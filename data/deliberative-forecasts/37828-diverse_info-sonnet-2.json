    "review": "Both forecasters raise important contextual details I underweighted. Forecaster 2 correctly emphasizes the significance of the May 2025 $450M Series G raise and $200M tender offer—these are contemporary events that directly address liquidity needs and reduce IPO urgency. Forecaster 3 introduces the Deel litigation as a deterrent, which is a valid consideration since major legal battles typically complicate IPO timelines. Their forecasts of 12-15% suggest I may be overconfident at 3%. However, I believe they may be underweighting the strength of the CEO's explicit May 2025 statements combined with the immediate alternative liquidity path. When a CEO states in multiple interviews THIS MONTH that there are 'no specific plans' and an IPO is 'not imminent,' while simultaneously executing a large tender offer and fresh capital raise, the evidence against a 40-day announcement is extremely strong. Their base-rate reasoning about mature companies having latent IPO capability is valid, but the contemporaneous evidence is dispositive. The combination of explicit denial + fresh capital + tender offer + litigation + 40-day window creates an extraordinarily high bar for a Yes outcome.",
    "rationale": "After reviewing their analyses, I'm updating slightly upward but remaining very bearish. The new information about the $450M Series G and $200M tender offer in May 2025 actually strengthens the No case rather than weakens it—companies don't typically raise massive private rounds and execute tender offers weeks before IPO announcements. This provides an alternative liquidity mechanism that reduces pressure. The Deel litigation is an additional headwind. However, Forecasters 2 and 3 make a fair point about avoiding overconfidence—mature companies can surprise markets, and the 2025 IPO window is open. While I maintain the evidence is strongly against a Yes outcome, I'll acknowledge residual uncertainty by moving from 3% to 5%. This accounts for low-probability scenarios like a pre-prepared confidential S-1 or strategic pivoting, while still reflecting that the CEO's explicit May 2025 denial, fresh capital raise, tender offer execution, and 40-day compressed timeline make an announcement highly unlikely.",
