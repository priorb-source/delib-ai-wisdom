    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Approximately 6 weeks. The observation period ends on July 1, 2025, and the outcome will be determined on or after that date.",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No. Neither Donald Trump nor Elon Musk have a history of using the specific phrase 'diversity visa'. The default expectation is that this pattern will continue over the short forecast period.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "The period until July 1, 2025, passes without any specific news event that prompts either Donald Trump or Elon Musk to comment on the Diversity Visa program using that exact phrasing. They continue to focus on other aspects of immigration or use different terminology to describe the program.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "A high-profile news story involving a Diversity Visa recipient captures the attention of conservative media. In response to the media cycle, either Donald Trump condemns the program using the phrase 'diversity visa', or Elon Musk uses the term in a reply or quote post while engaging with content about the story on X.",
    "rationale": "The probability is low primarily due to the strictness of the resolution criteria requiring the *exact phrase* 'diversity visa' and the short timeframe of approximately six weeks. While both individuals are frequent commentators on immigration, they often use their own preferred terminology; for example, Donald Trump has historically used the term 'visa lottery'. The base rate for any two specific individuals tweeting a specific, non-common phrase is very low. My forecast is not lower than 8% because immigration is a volatile and central topic for both men. A single, catalyzing news event could easily trigger a tweet, and Elon Musk’s recent engagement with related topics on X makes him a plausible candidate. I would increase my forecast if a major news story specifically naming the 'diversity visa' program breaks. I would decrease it as the deadline approaches without such a catalyst.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill Donald Trump or Elon Musk tweet (X post) about the Diversity Visa before April 1, 2025\n\nQuestion background:\n[Federal judge’s order leaves many visa lottery winners out of luck](https://www.siliconvalley.com/2020/10/01/judges-order-leaves-many-visa-lottery-winners-out-of-luck/) | Recent tweet [here](https://x.com/fentasyl/status/1894451029934039492) from a Twitter/X account followed by Elon Musk.\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if, before July 1, 2025 either Donald Trump or Elon Musk tweet using the exact words \"diversity visa\" as shown through [this search](https://x.com/search?f=top&q=%22diversity%20visa%22%20(from%3Arealdonaldtrump%20OR%20from%3Aelonmusk)&src=typed_query) on Twitter/X, which will be checked by Metaculus on or after July 1, 2025. If a tweet (now renamed to X post) containing the phrase is seen by a Metaculus Admin at that time, this question resolves as **Yes**. If not, it resolves as **No**.\n\n\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nNo additional information available.\n\nToday is 2025-05-22.\n\nBefore answering you think:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n(e) You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
