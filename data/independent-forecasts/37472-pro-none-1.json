    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Less than two months. The resolution window is from May 13, 2025, to July 1, 2025.",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No. Sheikh Hasina remains in exile in India as the interim government in Bangladesh consolidates its power and pursues legal action against her and her allies.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Sheikh Hasina continues to issue political statements from India but determines the personal risk of returning is too high. The interim government in Bangladesh proceeds with corruption and human rights abuse cases against her in absentia. India, prioritizing regional stability, does not compel her to leave, and she does not return before July 1, 2025.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Driven by her vow to return and potentially underestimating the risk, Sheikh Hasina makes an unexpected and dramatic return to Bangladesh to rally her supporters and challenge the interim government, leading to her immediate arrest. Alternatively, India and the new Bangladeshi government reach a swift agreement, and she is extradited to face trial.",
    "rationale": "My forecast is based on the strong incentives for the status quo to be maintained over the short resolution period. Sheikh Hasina fled Bangladesh in August 2024 amidst widespread protests, and the current interim government is actively investigating her administration for serious crimes. Returning would almost certainly result in her immediate arrest and prosecution, a significant personal risk that makes a voluntary return highly improbable. The provided background material, mentioning her 'vow to return', is characteristic political rhetoric aimed at maintaining relevance and morale among her supporters, but it is not a concrete plan of action. The timeframe is extremely short (less than 7 weeks), which makes complex scenarios like a negotiated settlement for her return or a formal extradition process unlikely to conclude in time. The current path of greatest safety and political maneuverability for her is to remain in exile in India. \n\nMy forecast is not lower than 15% because the situation remains volatile. Sheikh Hasina has a history as a formidable and resilient political operator who might take a high-stakes gamble. There is also a non-trivial possibility of a 'black swan' event, such as a backroom deal between Dhaka and New Delhi leading to a surprisingly swift extradition. \n\nMy forecast is not higher because the barriers to her return are immense and fundamental. The interim government's legitimacy is partly built on holding her administration accountable, making any deal for her safe return politically poisonous for them. Therefore, the most probable outcome is that she will not enter Bangladesh within this narrow timeframe. \n\nI would raise my probability if credible reports emerged of negotiations for her return or if the Indian government signaled an intention to extradite her. I would lower my probability if the Bangladeshi government files more severe, non-bailable charges against her, further increasing the personal risk of a return.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill Sheikh Hasina return to Bangladesh before July 1, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nFirstpost: [Bangladesh has turned into a ‘terrorist country’: Sheikh Hasina targets Yunus, vows to return](https://www.firstpost.com/world/bangladesh-has-turned-into-a-terrorist-country-sheikh-hasina-targets-yunus-vows-to-return-13878191.html)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if Sheikh Hasina after May 12, 2025 and before July 1, 2025 enters territory of Bangladesh according to [credible sources](https://www.metaculus.com/help/faq/#definitions).\n\nThe circumstances of her entering Bangladeshi territory, whether voluntarily or due to her extradition from India, will not affect resolution.\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nNo additional information available.\n\nToday is 2025-05-08.\n\nBefore answering you think:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n(e) You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
