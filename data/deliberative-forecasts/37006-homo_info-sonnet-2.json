    "review": "The other forecasters raise several critical points I underweighted. Forecaster 2's historical seat data is particularly compelling: the Bloc has maintained a 32 vs 10 seat advantage (3:1 ratio) in both 2019 and 2021, extending back 5-7 elections. Forecaster 3's current seat projections (19-25 for Bloc vs 10-12 for Conservatives) show that similar polling percentages translate to roughly 2:1 seat advantages due to vote efficiency and geographic concentration. I focused too heavily on polling percentages being close (both around 23%) without adequately considering seat conversion dynamics. The most persuasive argument is about the mechanism of change: Carney's Liberal surge is primarily drawing from Bloc voters, not boosting Conservatives. For Conservatives to win more seats than the Bloc, they'd need either their own surge (no evidence - support stable at 23%) or a Bloc collapse so severe that Conservatives win more seats despite not gaining support themselves. Forecaster 2's point about Conservative organizational problems (unable to field candidates in Quebec City) actually working against them, not for them, was also important context I misread from the background article.",
    "rationale": "I need to update upward based on three key insights: (1) Historical seat conversion shows a persistent 3:1 advantage for Bloc over Conservatives that has held for multiple elections, not just a marginal edge; (2) Current seat projections show 2:1 Bloc advantage even with similar polling numbers, indicating structural vote efficiency advantages I underweighted; (3) The causal mechanism for Conservative gains is unclear - the Liberal surge under Carney draws from Bloc supporters but doesn't redirect them to Conservatives. For Conservatives to overcome a 10-15 seat deficit in 5-6 months would require either a Conservative surge (no polling evidence) or such a catastrophic Bloc collapse that their stable 23% support yields more seats. While the Carney factor introduces real uncertainty and the 6-month timeline allows for shifts, the combination of historical patterns, current projections, and lack of a clear mechanism for Conservative gains makes a Yes outcome more likely than my initial 68% suggested. I'm updating to 76% - higher than my original forecast but lower than the other forecasters because the unprecedented nature of Carney's disruption and demonstrated polling volatility still warrant meaningful uncertainty.",
