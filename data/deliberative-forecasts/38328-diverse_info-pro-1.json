    "review": "Forecaster 2 provides a crucial anchor with a base-rate analysis, suggesting a ~60-75% probability from historical data alone. Their point that MEPs implicated in scandals often delay resignation is a convincing counterargument to my initial, scandal-focused rationale. Forecaster 3 introduces an entirely new and compelling driver: national government formations, specifically in Portugal, which are occurring within the resolution window. This provides a strong, independent pathway to a 'Yes' outcome that I had overlooked. I find Forecaster 3's final probability of 40% surprisingly low, as it falls below the historical base rate despite them identifying a strong positive driver. Conversely, Forecaster 2's 60% feels slightly too anchored to the base rate, perhaps under-weighting the combined effect of both an active scandal and a timely government formation process happening simultaneously.",
    "rationale": "I am maintaining my forecast of 70%, but my reasoning has shifted significantly after reviewing my colleagues' analyses. My initial forecast was based almost entirely on the Huawei scandal, assuming it would force a quick resignation. Forecaster 2 rightly pointed out that implicated MEPs often cling to their seats, weakening this single line of reasoning. However, Forecaster 2 also introduced a compelling base-rate analysis indicating a ~60-75% chance of a resignation in any similar time window, providing a much stronger statistical anchor. Furthermore, Forecaster 3 introduced a completely separate and powerful driver: the high likelihood of an MEP being appointed to a national cabinet, particularly in Portugal, where government formation is currently underway and aligns perfectly with the resolution window. My updated forecast is now based on a convergence of three factors: (1) a strong historical base rate of resignations, (2) the ongoing national appointment-cycle in Portugal creating a specific, timely 'pull' factor, and (3) the Huawei scandal creating an additional, albeit less certain, 'push' factor. The combination of these independent drivers makes a resignation during this specific period more likely than the historical average, justifying a forecast above the base rate.",
