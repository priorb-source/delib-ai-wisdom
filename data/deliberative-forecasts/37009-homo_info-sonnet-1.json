    "review": "The three forecasts present starkly different evidence and reach dramatically different conclusions (70%, 72%, 8%). Forecaster 2 cites concrete preparatory evidence - fundraising figures, staff expansion, and contacting House seat replacements - which I didn't have. However, Forecaster 3 raises a critical counterpoint: no FEC paperwork has been filed for Senate candidacy as of late April 2025. This creates a puzzle: Forecaster 2's activities could relate to Stevens' current House seat rather than a Senate run, while the absence of Senate-specific FEC filings would be a major red flag. The media reports I relied on ('widely expected to declare as early as next week') suggest imminent intent, but media speculation doesn't always materialize. Forecaster 3's point about other Democrats already in the race (McMorrow, El-Sayed) is notable context I hadn't fully considered. The critical issue is reconciling strong media signals with the apparent absence of formal preparatory steps. With 10 days remaining, there's still time for filing and announcement, but the lack of visible Senate-specific preparation is concerning.",
    "rationale": "Upon reflection, I relied too heavily on media speculation without verifying concrete preparatory indicators. While multiple outlets reported expectations of an announcement, 'widely expected' is not confirmation. Forecaster 3's observation about missing FEC paperwork is significant - candidates typically file exploratory committee paperwork before announcing. However, I don't find Forecaster 3's 8% credible either, as 10 days remains sufficient time for both filing and announcement if Stevens commits to the race. The media reports from credible outlets suggest real signals from Stevens' camp, even if timing may slip. Forecaster 2's evidence about campaign activities is intriguing but may relate to House rather than Senate activities. The truth likely lies between the extremes: Stevens may be seriously considering a run with some preparation underway, but the absence of FEC filing suggests plans are less advanced than media reports implied. The tight timeline increases risk of missing the May 1 deadline even if she intends to run. I'm updating downward to account for the lack of formal preparatory steps, but maintaining moderate probability given the strength and recency of media signals.",
