    "review": "Both forecasters largely mirror my priors: tight timeline, primary missed, leadership resistance, weak polling, caretaker norms, and lack of campaign prep make No the default; a late ‘draft’ via party rule-bending keeps a nontrivial tail. New/clarified angles they added: explicit mention of an independent-run pathway (procedurally costly but technically possible) and concrete up/down signals to watch. I agree with their triggers. One nuance I’d add is that the resolution criterion is announcement-only (not ballot eligibility), which slightly raises the chance relative to a full-viability forecast. Overall, their reasoning is sound and nudges me marginally upward on the tail scenario.",
    "rationale": "Time remaining is ~13 days to May 5, with a hard eligibility-linked resignation deadline of May 4. The baseline path remains No: he missed the PPP primary, leadership has said he won’t be included, caretaker norms disfavor a run, polls are poor (2–12% with high ‘unacceptable’), and there’s no visible campaign infrastructure. Han’s public stance (“not yet decided,” prioritizing Apr 24 trade talks) and lack of preparatory moves also point against an imminent bid. Countervailing factors are real but bounded: a sizable PPP faction is pushing a draft, and Korean parties can be procedurally flexible under pressure. A plausible Yes path would involve a rapid elite pivot—emergency nomination/draft—followed by a same-day resignation and announcement close to May 4. Given the resolution is triggered by an announcement (even before full procedural clarity), the tail is slightly larger than a ‘viable run’ probability. I’m nudging up from 14% to 16% to reflect (a) that announcement threshold and (b) alignment with two independent peers who see a similar, modest tail. Absent concrete signals (rule-bending by PPP, campaign team formation, scheduled resignation, or public elite endorsements), the No remains dominant.",
