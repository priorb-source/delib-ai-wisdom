  "information": "China's Consumer Price Index (CPI) has registered three consecutive months of year-on-year deflation: -0.7% in February, -0.1% in March, and -0.1% in April 2025. The Producer Price Index (PPI), a measure of factory-gate prices, has also shown sustained deflationary pressure, declining for 31 consecutive months. In April, the PPI fell by 2.7% year-on-year, the largest decline in six months. Core CPI, which excludes food and energy, has remained positive but low, at around +0.5% year-on-year.\n\nChina's manufacturing activity contracted for the second consecutive month in May, with the manufacturing Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) standing at 49.5, below the 50-point mark that separates growth from contraction. The non-manufacturing PMI also showed a slight decline to 50.3 in May from 50.4 in the previous month. In the property sector, new-home sales from the 100 largest developers fell by 8.6% year-on-year in May, following an 8.7% drop in April.\n\nSpecific components influencing China's inflation data include energy and food prices. Brent crude oil averaged $84 in May 2025, a 4% increase from a year earlier. However, the year-on-year change in domestic energy prices remained negative. Pork prices, a key component of the food basket, also remained lower than a year ago due to high inventories. On the policy front, the People's Bank of China implemented a 10 basis point reserve requirement ratio (RRR) cut in mid-May.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "The May 2025 CPI data for China is typically released by the National Bureau of Statistics around the 10th of June. Therefore, the outcome will be known within approximately one to two weeks.",
    "status_quo_outcome": "The status quo, based on three consecutive months of year-on-year CPI deflation and 31 months of PPI deflation, would be a fourth month of deflation. Therefore, the status quo outcome is 'Yes'.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "A 'No' outcome occurs if the CPI is zero or positive. This scenario could be driven by a surprisingly effective and rapid impact from recent government stimulus, like the RRR cut, boosting consumer demand more than expected. Alternatively, a sharp, unexpected surge in a key price component, such as pork or domestic energy, could be sufficient to push the headline inflation number into positive territory, overcoming the broader disinflationary trend.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "A 'Yes' outcome occurs if the CPI is negative for the fourth consecutive month. This scenario would see the continuation of prevailing economic trends. Persistent weakness in domestic demand, evidenced by the contraction in the manufacturing PMI and the ongoing real estate slump, continues to suppress prices. Industrial overcapacity, reflected in the prolonged PPI deflation, maintains downward pressure on goods prices, and any policy support proves insufficient to reverse the trend within the month.",
    "rationale": "My forecast is based on the strong momentum of existing deflationary pressures in the Chinese economy. The primary evidence is the trend itself: China has recorded three straight months of negative year-on-year CPI and, more structurally, 31 consecutive months of PPI deflation, indicating significant industrial overcapacity and weak pricing power. Recent high-frequency data for May reinforces this view, with the manufacturing PMI remaining in contractionary territory at 49.5 and new-home sales continuing to decline. This points to persistent weakness in both consumer and business demand. While core CPI remains slightly positive and global oil prices have risen year-on-year, these factors seem insufficient to counteract the broader disinflationary forces. The PBoC's recent RRR cut is a modest policy response whose effects are unlikely to materialize fully within the same month it was implemented. Therefore, the most probable outcome is that the underlying weak demand and oversupply issues will continue to dominate, resulting in another month of negative CPI. My probability is not higher than 75% because the deflation figures in March and April were very slight (-0.1%), meaning only a minor positive shock to a volatile component like food or energy would be needed to flip the headline number to 0.0% or above. My probability is not lower because the overwhelming majority of indicators, from manufacturing and producer prices to the property sector, point towards continued weak aggregate demand, making a return to inflation in May unlikely without a significant external shock or a major, unannounced policy intervention.",
