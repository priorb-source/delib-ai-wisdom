  "information": "Historical data from the National UFO Reporting Center (NUFORC) shows the following counts of reported sightings for the month of June: 357 in 2019, 470 in 2020, 407 in 2021, and 603 in 2022. While specific numbers for June 2023 and June 2024 were not provided in the source material, data tables indicated that all reported months in 2023 exceeded 600 reports and all reported months in 2024 exceeded 450 reports. For the current year, a data scrape on May 22, 2025, showed a total of 2,067 sighting reports for January through April 2025, yielding a monthly average of approximately 517. Each of ahe first four months of 2025 individually exceeded 400 reports.\n\nBetween May 2023 and June 2024, the US government documented 757 reports of Unidentified Aerial Phenomena (UAPs), with 708 of them occurring in the air. Of these, only 49 cases were officially closed. A notable number of these sightings occurred near the U.S.-Mexico border, particularly in Arizona. Media reports have covered recent military-related incidents, including a US Air Force F-16 fighter jet that was struck and damaged by an object over Arizona in January 2023. In a separate event from September 2024, a US Air Force pilot reported a close encounter with an object traveling at Mach 2 during a mission in California.\n\nPublic interest in UFO-related topics is supported by ongoing events and media attention. The 11th annual 'Contact in the Desert' conference, a major gathering for UFO experts and enthusiasts, is scheduled to run from May 29 to June 2, 2025, in California. Regionally, Washington state ranks third in the U.S. for the total number of UFO reports submitted to NUFORC, and several sightings have been reported from the state's Columbia Basin region since the beginning of 2025. The topic of UAPs also continues to receive attention from mainstream news outlets and the U.S. Congress.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Approximately 5-6 weeks. Today is May 23, 2025, and the question will resolve based on June 2025 data accessed on or after July 1, 2025.",
    "status_quo_outcome": "Yes - June 2025 will exceed 400 reports. The recent trend shows every month in 2025 has exceeded 400 reports (averaging ~517/month), and most June months since 2020 have exceeded this threshold.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "June 2025 reports drop significantly below recent 2025 monthly averages due to a combination of factors such as: temporary public attention shifting away from UFO topics, technical issues with the NUFORC reporting system, or unusually poor weather conditions reducing outdoor visibility and activity.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "June 2025 continues the established 2025 pattern where each month has exceeded 400 reports. The monthly average of ~517 reports continues, potentially boosted by summer weather increasing outdoor activity, ongoing media attention from the 'Contact in the Desert' conference (May 29-June 2), and sustained government/public interest in UAPs.",
    "rationale": "The evidence strongly favors exceeding 400 reports in June 2025. Historical data shows June exceeded 400 in three consecutive years (2020: 470, 2021: 407, 2022: 603), and likely in 2023 and 2024 as all reported months in those years exceeded 450-600 reports. Most importantly, every single month in 2025 (January-April) has individually exceeded 400 reports, with a monthly average of approximately 517. This represents a consistent upward trend over multiple years. The timing of the 'Contact in the Desert' conference at the end of May could generate increased interest and reporting activity in June. Summer weather typically increases outdoor activity and visibility, potentially leading to more sightings. The only significant risks to a 'No' outcome would be an unexpected reporting system failure or a sudden, unprecedented drop in public reporting behavior. My forecast is not higher (e.g., 95%+) because some month-to-month variation is normal and there's always uncertainty in behavioral data. My forecast is not lower because the 2025 trend is remarkably consistent - four consecutive months above 400 with a comfortable margin - and the historical June data strongly supports this outcome. To update lower, I would need evidence of technical issues at NUFORC, declining May 2025 reports, or major organizational changes. To update higher, I would need confirmation of exceptionally high early June activity or major UAP-related news driving increased reporting.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill the number of UFO sightings reported by the National UFO Reporting Center exceed 400 for June 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nAccording to the [National UFO Reporting Center](https://nuforc.org/about-us/): \"The National UFO Reporting Center was founded in 1974 by noted UFO investigator Robert J. Gribble. The Center’s primary function over the past five decades has been to receive, record, and to the greatest degree possible, corroborate and document reports from individuals who have been witness to unusual, possibly UFO-related events. Throughout its history, the Center has processed over 180,000 reports, and has distributed its information to thousands of individuals.\"\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if The National UFO Reporting Center posts greater than 400 UFO/UAP sighting reports at [this link](https://nuforc.org/ndx/?id=event) for the month of June 2025, as displayed when accessed by Metaculus on or after July 1, 2025.\n\n\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nHistorical data from the National UFO Reporting Center (NUFORC) shows the following counts of reported sightings for the month of June: 357 in 2019, 470 in 2020, 407 in 2021, and 603 in 2022.

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
