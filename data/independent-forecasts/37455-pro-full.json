  "information": "On April 14, 2025, the Lesotho Communications Authority (LCA) granted Starlink Lesotho a 10-year license to operate a satellite network and provide broadband services nationwide. Starlink Lesotho Pty Ltd, owned by Starlink Holdings Netherlands B.V., had submitted its application on January 24, 2025. The LCA had previously rejected a request from Starlink due to concerns over the company's lack of local ownership. The approval followed the imposition of a 50% US tariff on Lesotho in early April 2025. No official timeline for the service launch was provided at the time of the license grant.\n\nStarlink's service rollout timelines in other African nations have varied. In the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC), a license was granted around May 3-5, 2025, and service availability was announced by May 5, with the launch expected within days. The company also received a license from Somalia in April 2025. However, Starlink has faced regulatory challenges in other countries; it lacks a full operating license in South Africa, and authorities in Zimbabwe have asked the company to disconnect kits operating illegally in the country.\n\nStarlink's parent company, SpaceX, has a regional partnership with Airtel Africa to provide high-speed internet services to its customers across the continent. Geographically, Lesotho is a landlocked country, entirely surrounded by South Africa, where Starlink is not yet licensed to operate. The country has a small area of approximately 30,355 km² and is characterized by mountainous terrain.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Less than two months, as the deadline is July 1, 2025.",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No. As of today, the Starlink availability map does not show Lesotho as a country with service availability.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Despite receiving a license, Starlink encounters unforeseen logistical or administrative delays. The process of importing necessary equipment through South Africa (where Starlink is not licensed) proves too complex to resolve before the deadline, or the company simply prioritizes other global launches, pushing the Lesotho service rollout and subsequent map update past July 1, 2025.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Following its typical rapid deployment model after securing a license, Starlink quickly finalizes its operational setup for Lesotho. The company updates its website to reflect the new service area to begin accepting orders, a process which takes less than the two and a half months between the license grant (April 14) and the resolution date.",
    "rationale": "The primary factor driving this forecast is the recent granting of a 10-year operating license to Starlink on April 14, 2025. This removes the main regulatory barrier. Starlink has a well-established history of rapid service rollout following license approval. The case of the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) is a powerful recent precedent, where service availability was announced within days of the license being granted in May 2025. The timeframe of over two months from the license date to the July 1 deadline is more than sufficient for a company known for its speed, especially considering Lesotho's small geographic size could simplify the rollout.\n\nThe main reason the forecast is not higher is the potential for logistical friction. Lesotho is landlocked and entirely surrounded by South Africa, where Starlink does not have an operating license. This could complicate the importation of user terminals and the setup of any necessary ground infrastructure. However, Starlink's satellite network with inter-satellite links reduces reliance on in-country ground stations, potentially mitigating this risk. \n\nThe reason the forecast is not lower is that the license approval is a very strong signal of imminent service. The logistical challenges, while real, are likely solvable for a company with SpaceX's capabilities and resources. It is more probable than not that they will overcome these hurdles within the given timeframe. \n\nI would increase my forecast if there were official announcements of equipment shipments or a specific launch date. I would decrease my forecast if reports emerged of specific customs or regulatory hurdles with South Africa, or if the end of June approaches with no news from Starlink.",
