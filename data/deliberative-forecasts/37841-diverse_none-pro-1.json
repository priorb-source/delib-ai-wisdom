    "review": "The other two forecasts are in strong agreement with my own initial assessment, with all three probabilities falling within a tight 77-80% range. The core reasoning is consistent across all analyses: a high probability of performance based on the status quo (Kneecap is on the official lineup), the short time until the festival, and Glastonbury's history of platforming controversial artists. We all identify the same primary counter-argument: the serious and ongoing police investigation into alleged support for proscribed organizations is a non-trivial risk that prevents a forecast in the 90%+ range. \n\nForecaster 3 introduced two points I had not explicitly weighed: 1) the concept of a strong 'base rate' where nearly all announced acts perform, and 2) the crucial evidence that the band has had *other recent cancellations* due to this controversy. This second point is particularly compelling as it establishes a precedent for cancellation, showing that the pressure is not merely theoretical. Forecaster 2 provided a useful breakdown of the risks into police, political, and government (visa) channels. Both analyses reinforce the idea that the mechanism for cancellation would likely be external pressure from legal, police, or licensing bodies, rather than a simple change of heart from the festival organizers themselves.",
    "rationale": "My initial forecast was 80%. After reviewing the analyses of my peers, I am making a slight downward adjustment. The core of my rationale remains unchanged: the performance is the most likely outcome because Kneecap is an officially announced act for a festival that is just over a month away and is known for its high tolerance for political controversy. The organizers would have booked the band in full knowledge of their provocative style.\n\nHowever, I am lowering my forecast from 80% to 78%. The key piece of information that prompted this change, highlighted by Forecaster 3, is that the band has already faced cancellations at other venues due to this specific controversy. This provides a clear precedent that the risk is tangible and has previously been sufficient to overcome the status quo at other events. While Glastonbury is more institutionally resilient to such pressures than most, this evidence of successful pressure campaigns elsewhere slightly increases the probability of a 'No' outcome. The risk is not just hypothetical media outrage; it has a proven track record of causing cancellations. This adjustment reflects a modest but important increase in my assessment of the risk, bringing my forecast into alignment with the slight caution expressed by my peers.",
