  "information": "A trend of 'reverse purchasing' has emerged where foreign tourists, particularly from the US, travel to China to purchase goods. According to Alipay data from the first half of April 2025, spending by foreign tourists in China increased 1.5 times compared to the same period in the previous year, with spending by US users doubling. This trend is attributed to improvements in China's manufacturing quality and favorable policies such as 'departure tax refund' and 'buy and refund' services. The changing international trade environment, including US tariffs, has also been cited as a contributing factor.\n\nIn April 2025, Russian President Vladimir Putin instructed the government to create a mechanism for the 'reverse purchase' of assets from foreign investors who have exited the Russian market. The government was given a deadline of May 15, 2025, to establish the procedures for these transactions. The decree specifies that the conditions for reverse purchases must account for the rights and interests of the current Russian owners of these assets.\n\nThe term 'reverse' is used in various financial contexts. A New York Fed statement on June 3, 2025, noted that its System Open Market Account (SOMA) net income could be impacted by interest expenses on 'reverse repurchase agreements.' On June 3, 2025, the Mexican government announced it had saved 12 billion pesos in the purchase of medicines through a 'reverse auction mechanism.' Additionally, the company Worldline launched a cash tender offer for its bonds on June 4, 2025, using a 'reverse book-building procedure.'",

    "no_outcome_scenario": "The New York Times reports on the trends of Western tourists shopping in China or the Russian government's mechanism for buying back assets from foreign firms, but does so without using the specific phrases 'reverse purchasing' or 'reverse purchase'. The stories either fail to gain enough prominence to be covered in the short 22-day window, or the journalists opt for more common terminology like 'shopping tourism', 'state buybacks', or 'asset repurchases'.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "The New York Times publishes an article focusing on either the Russian government's new economic policy regarding foreign assets or the burgeoning trend of American tourists buying goods in China. In the article, the journalist directly quotes a source or translates the official term used in state media, leading to the inclusion of the phrase 'reverse purchasing' or 'reverse purchase'. This is most likely to happen in the business or international news sections.",
    "rationale": "My forecast is a low 15%. The primary factor driving this low probability is the extremely short resolution window of just 22 days (June 9 to June 30, 2025). The status quo is that the NYT has not used this specific terminology, and journalistic adoption of new, specific jargon within such a brief period is rare.\n\nHowever, the probability is not closer to zero because there are two distinct and newsworthy potential triggers. First, the trend of 'reverse purchasing' by foreign tourists in China is a compelling consumer and economic story, especially with data showing a doubling of spending by US users. Second, the Russian government's formal establishment of a 'reverse purchase' mechanism for assets is a significant geopolitical and financial development that the NYT is likely to cover. The Russian story, in particular, involves official government terminology, which increases the likelihood of the exact phrase being used in a report.\n\nMy forecast is not higher because journalists often prefer to use more widely understood language. They might describe the phenomena without adopting the specific jargon, using phrases like 'shopping tourism' in the China context or 'state-facilitated buybacks' for Russia. The NYT may also be cautious about adopting terminology directly from Chinese or Russian state sources without qualification. Therefore, despite the existence of relevant news hooks, the default expectation is that this specific phrase will not be used.\n\nI would increase my forecast if another major English-language financial news outlet, such as the Wall Street Journal or Bloomberg, uses the term 'reverse purchasing' in the next week, as this would signal wider journalistic adoption. I would decrease my forecast if the resolution window opens and several days pass with no new developments or reporting on these specific topics.",
