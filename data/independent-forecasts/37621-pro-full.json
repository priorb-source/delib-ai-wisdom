  "information": "A proposal to ban the 'Tush Push' play, initially submitted by the Green Bay Packers, was discussed at the NFL's annual meeting in early April 2025. The proposal was tabled after receiving support from 16 of the NFL's 32 teams, short of the 24 votes required to pass a rule change. The proposal is scheduled to be revisited at the spring league meeting on May 20-21, 2025, in Minneapolis, Minnesota.\n\nMultiple reports indicate that NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell favors the ban. Goodell has stated that the play 'feels more like rugby' than football and that returning to pre-2005 rules that banned pushing players 'makes a lot of sense.' The NFL league office also reportedly wants to eliminate the play. Additionally, the NFL's Competition Committee and health and safety officials, including Dr. Allen Sills, have expressed concerns about the play's potential for injury.\n\nThe original proposal is being reworked into a broader rule that would prohibit pushing or pulling a ball carrier anywhere on the field, not just in the specific quarterback sneak formation. This change aims to frame the issue around general football principles rather than targeting a specific team. On the other hand, the NFL's health and safety department possesses no data indicating any injuries have occurred from the 'Tush Push'. The Philadelphia Eagles, who have used the play with a high success rate, have vocally opposed the ban.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Approximately 3 weeks. The outcome will likely be decided at the NFL spring league meeting on May 20-21, 2025, ahead of the June 1, 2025 resolution date.",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No. The 'Tush-Push' play is currently legal. If no rule change is passed, the status quo holds and the play remains allowed.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "At the league meeting on May 20-21, 2025, the reworked proposal to ban pushing a ball carrier fails to secure the 24 votes (a 75% supermajority) required for a rule change. Despite support from the league office, at least nine owners vote against the ban, and the play remains legal for the upcoming season.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "During the May 20-21, 2025 league meeting, intense lobbying by the Commissioner and the reworked, broader proposal to ban all pushing of a ball carrier successfully sway at least eight additional owners. The proposal receives 24 or more votes, and the NFL officially announces the rule change before June 1, 2025.",
    "rationale": "My forecast leans towards the ban being implemented due to the significant political will from key NFL leadership. The primary driver is the stated preference of Commissioner Roger Goodell and the NFL league office, who want the play eliminated. The fact that the proposal is being revisited just a month after it was tabled, and has been strategically reworked to be a broader rule against pushing any ball carrier, indicates a concerted effort to build the necessary consensus. The initial vote in April secured support from 16 teams, which is a strong foundation and only 8 votes shy of the 24 needed. This shows the proposal already has significant momentum. The reframing of the rule makes it easier for owners to support, as it appears to be a vote on a general football principle rather than a targeted action against the Philadelphia Eagles' successful strategy. The public safety concerns voiced by the Competition Committee and health officials, even without specific injury data, provide additional political cover for owners voting in favor of the ban. Why the forecast is not higher: The 75% supermajority requirement for a rule change is a very high bar. There is no hard data showing the play is less safe, which gives the 16 owners who did not initially support the ban a strong justification to maintain their position. The status quo is a powerful force, and changing rules that legislate against a successful on-field strategy can be unpopular with some owners. Why the forecast is not lower: The influence of the Commissioner and the league office on rule changes cannot be overstated. When they make an issue a priority, they often succeed. Getting half the league on board in the initial discussion demonstrates this is not a fringe issue but one with serious backing. The short turnaround time for the next vote signals that the league believes it can successfully whip the remaining votes. I would increase my forecast if there were credible reports that influential owners who previously opposed the ban have changed their stance. I would decrease my forecast if a significant bloc of owners publicly organized to oppose the reworked proposal, arguing against legislating competitive innovation out of the game.",
