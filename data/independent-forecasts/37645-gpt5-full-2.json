  "information": "Student-led protests demanding the immediate dissolution of parliament and early elections have been ongoing in Serbia for over six months, originating from a tragic canopy collapse in Novi Sad in November 2024. Protestors threatened to escalate their actions if their demands were not met by mid-May. A survey conducted by the CRTA research center indicated that 59% of Serbian citizens support the students' actions. However, reports also suggest that the momentum of the protests has been waning and the political opposition remains fragmented.\n\nIn response to protests, government officials have maintained that there is no need for early elections. Vice-Premier Ivica Dačić stated that the ruling coalition has a 'stable majority' in parliament. Following the Prime Minister's resignation in January 2025, President Aleksandar Vučić announced that a decision would be made within ten days on whether to form a new government or hold elections. More recently, a May 14, 2025 article quoted Vučić saying the party would again decide 'within ten days' whether to form another new cabinet or go to the polls.\n\nFollowing the Prime Minister's resignation in January 2025, a constitutional deadline was triggered, requiring the formation of a new government to avoid a mandatory snap election. According to multiple wire-service reports from March and April 2025, a new government successfully won a confidence vote in the Serbian parliament in mid-April. This event removed the automatic, constitutionally-mandated trigger for snap elections before the summer.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "About 46 days (until July 1, 2025)",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "The newly formed government from mid-April 2025 continues, the ruling coalition keeps its parliamentary majority, protests keep waning or remain manageable, and no decree dissolving parliament or setting an election date is issued before July 1.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "A political shock (coalition fracture, escalating protests, a major scandal, or a strategic calculation by President Vučić) leads to dissolution of the National Assembly and an official decree setting a specific election date—most plausibly in late July or August 2025—before July 1.",
    "rationale": "- Baseline: A new government reportedly won a confidence vote in mid-April 2025, removing the constitutional trigger that would have forced snap elections. Government figures say the coalition retains a stable majority and see no need for early polls. This strongly points to no announcement by July 1 absent new developments.\n- Protest pressure exists but appears to be losing momentum, and the opposition remains fragmented. While public sympathy is notable (CRTA polling shows 59% support for students), it hasn’t yet translated into a crisis that typically forces snap polls.\n- Legal/timing considerations: In Serbia, once parliament is dissolved, elections are generally held 45–60 days later. An announcement before July 1 would most likely imply a mid/late July or August vote—an unusual and electorally suboptimal window. If the ruling party wanted autumn elections, it would probably wait to announce until late summer, not before July 1.\n- Vučić’s rhetoric about deciding “within ten days” appears inconsistent with the mid‑April government formation and may be tactical rather than a firm signal. Still, his history of calling early elections warrants some non‑zero probability.\nWhy not higher: The government just formed; there’s no automatic trigger; summer timing is unattractive; officials project stability.\nWhy not lower: Serbia has a track record of snap elections; leadership could pivot quickly if unrest spikes or a political advantage emerges; an official announcement could come suddenly.\nWhat would move me up: Credible reports of coalition cracks, a resignation or failed key vote, legal steps toward dissolution, the President or the election commission signaling an imminent decree with a specific date, or protests materially escalating with broader elite defections.\nWhat would move me down: Continued quiet after mid‑May, successful agenda votes indicating firm majority discipline, and explicit statements ruling out dissolution before autumn.",

These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if, before July 1, 2025, a specific date on which a general election will be held is officially announced by the government of Serbia or any of its agencies that have the authority to do so. If no such announcement occurs before July 1, 2025, this question resolves as **No**.\n\nThe election does not have to be held before July 1, 2025; this question resolves based on an announcement.\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nStudent-led protests demanding the immediate dissolution of parliament and early elections have been ongoing in Serbia for over six months, originating from a tragic canopy collapse in Novi Sad in November 2024.

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower.
