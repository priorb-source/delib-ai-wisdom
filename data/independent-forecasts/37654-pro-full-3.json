  "information": "As of May 15, 2025, the Project 2025 Tracker spreadsheet listed the objective to 'Break up the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration' as 'In progress'. The moderators of the tracker have previously indicated that an item is moved to 'Complete' status only when a formal action, such as a signed executive order or an enacted statute, achieves the specific recommendation. For other large-scale restructurings, the tracker's status was changed to 'Complete' only after such a formal action was taken. From January through mid-May 2025, 5 of 41 objectives marked as 'In progress' on the tracker were updated to 'Complete'.\n\nOn May 8, 2025, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) announced it would no longer be updating its Billion Dollar Weather and Climate Disasters database. The official reason cited was 'in alignment with evolving priorities, statutory mandates, and staffing changes'. The database, active since 1980, had logged 403 events with an estimated cost exceeding $2.9 trillion. The discontinuation has been attributed to agency restructuring, budget cuts, and staff departures, including the lead scientist for the program. The administration also proposed a 25% reduction in NOAA's budget for fiscal year 2026.\n\nBreaking up a federal agency typically requires either legislation passed by Congress or an executive reorganization plan. Historically, similar executive reorganizations have taken between two and six months to progress from concept to a signed executive order, following legal and administrative vetting. For a legislative approach, while the House of Representatives could pass relevant language in an appropriations bill in June, Senate action would likely not occur until mid-July at the earliest. Past large-scale government reorganizations, such as the creation of the Department of Homeland Security, have been complex processes that take longer than a month and a half to formalize.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Approximately 1.5 months, until July 1, 2025.",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No. The spreadsheet currently marks the objective as 'In progress', and if this status does not change to 'Complete', the question will resolve as No.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "The administration continues to take actions that weaken NOAA, such as implementing budget cuts and discontinuing programs, but a formal executive order or legislative act to 'break up' the agency is not finalized and signed by the July 1, 2025 deadline. Consequently, the tracker's moderators leave the status as 'In progress'.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "The administration fast-tracks its plans and issues a signed executive order that formally initiates the breakup or fundamental restructuring of NOAA before July 1, 2025. Following this definitive action, the moderators of the Project 2025 Tracker update the objective's status to 'Complete'.",
    "rationale": "My forecast is based primarily on the significant procedural and temporal hurdles required to formally 'break up' a federal agency contrasted with the short, 1.5-month timeframe until the deadline. \n\nThe primary evidence supporting a 'No' resolution is the timeline. The research indicates that reorganizing a federal agency via an executive order historically takes two to six months, and we only have about six weeks. A legislative path is even less likely to meet the deadline, as Senate action is not expected until mid-July at the earliest. The status quo is 'In progress', and large bureaucratic changes face significant inertia. Furthermore, the tracker moderators have set a high bar for marking an objective 'Complete'—requiring a formal, enacted measure like a signed executive order or statute. Actions taken so far, such as discontinuing the Billion Dollar Disasters database and proposing budget cuts, are aggressive but preparatory; they do not meet the criteria for completion.\n\nMy probability is not lower than 15% because the administration has demonstrated clear intent and political will to act against NOAA. These preparatory actions are significant and suggest this is a high-priority objective. It is possible, though unlikely, that an executive order is already in the final stages of drafting and legal review, which could allow it to be signed before the deadline, defying the typical timeline.\n\nMy probability is not higher than 15% because the historical timelines for such a complex governmental reorganization provide a strong anchor. The short period remaining before July 1st is the most compelling factor against a 'Yes' outcome. The base rate of other objectives moving from 'In progress' to 'Complete' on the tracker (5 of 41 in 4.5 months) also suggests a slow process.\n\nI would increase my forecast upon receiving credible reports of a finalized executive order awaiting signature. I would decrease my forecast if reports emerged of legal challenges, internal administration delays, or a shift in political focus away from this specific objective.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill the Project 2025 Tracker spreadsheet have the objective of breaking up NOAA marked as complete before July 1, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nAt the time of this question, the objective was marked as \"in progress.\" The 2025 Tracker is a project of the Keep_Track subreddit and is explained [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/Keep_Track/comments/1ii7tbr/project_2025_tracker_is_now_live/).\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if the Project 2025 objective to \"break up the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration\" is marked as complete according to [this spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1QGG6wNHna-1tt91yXNkOauAJJ7snobFjfEnmxlmzhl4/edit?gid=0#gid=0) before July 1, 2025.

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
