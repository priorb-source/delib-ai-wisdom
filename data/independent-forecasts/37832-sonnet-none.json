    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Approximately 40 days (from May 22, 2025 to July 1, 2025)",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No - Databricks has not announced IPO plans and continues operating as a private company",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Databricks continues to delay its IPO plans given the CEO's public stance that it's 'dumb to IPO this year.' Market conditions remain unfavorable or the company determines it's strategically better to stay private longer. No S-1 filing or announcement appears before July 1.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Despite the CEO's recent statements, Databricks unexpectedly reverses course due to improved market conditions, strategic opportunities, or competitive pressure. The company either files an SEC Form S-1 or makes an official IPO announcement on their website in the next 40 days.",
    "rationale": "The baseline probability strongly favors No for several reasons. First, the CEO has explicitly stated it's 'dumb to IPO this year' in a TechCrunch article, which is strong public evidence against planning an IPO in 2025. Second, only 40 days remain until the resolution date - a very short window for a major corporate decision like an IPO announcement, which typically involves months of preparation and coordination with investment banks. Third, the research assistant found no additional information suggesting imminent IPO activity. Status quo bias is particularly relevant here: large companies don't reverse major strategic positions quickly, and going public is a significant undertaking that requires extensive preparation. For a Yes outcome, something fundamental would need to change - perhaps dramatic improvement in tech IPO market conditions, unexpected competitive pressure, or internal strategic shifts. However, these typically don't materialize in 5-6 week timeframes. I'm not going lower (say, 2-3%) because there's always some possibility of unexpected corporate announcements, and companies occasionally surprise markets. I'm not going higher (say, 15-20%) because the CEO's explicit public statement is strong evidence, the timeframe is very short, and there's no indication of preparation. I would update higher if: reports emerged of S-1 preparation, investment bank meetings, or improved market conditions. I would update lower with: further explicit statements about staying private or deteriorating IPO market conditions.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nBefore July 1, 2025, will Databricks announce that it is planning an IPO?\n\nQuestion background:\nTechCrunch: ['It's dumb to IPO this year': Databricks CEO explains why he's waiting to go public](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/dumb-ipo-databricks-ceo-explains-064957000.html)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question will resolve as **Yes** if Databricks, Inc., announces before July 1, 2025, that it is planning an initial public offering. In order to streamline the resolution of this question, there are two resolution sources for the IPO announcement: 1) Databricks filing an [SEC Form S-1](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/sec-form-s-1.asp) or 2) An announcement at the [news](https://www.databricks.com/blog) section of its website. If there is no such announcement before that date, this question resolves as **No**.\n\n\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nNo additional information available.\n\nToday is 2025-05-22.\n\nBefore answering you think:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n(e) You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
