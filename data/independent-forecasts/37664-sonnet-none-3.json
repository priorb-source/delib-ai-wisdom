    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Approximately 46 days until July 1, 2025",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No - Claude 4 has not been released yet, and there are no public indications of an imminent release",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Anthropic continues developing Claude 4 but does not complete testing, obtain necessary approvals, or achieve the readiness required for a general public release by June 30, 2025. Alternatively, they release it only to waitlist participants or in early access/beta form.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Anthropic announces and launches Claude 4 to the general public in the next 6 weeks, either via API, their website, or both, without requiring waitlist signup. This would require the model to be essentially ready now with only final preparation needed.",
    "rationale": "With only 46 days remaining until the deadline, the time window is extremely narrow. Status quo strongly favors No since Claude 4 has not been released and there are no credible public signals of an imminent launch. Major AI model releases typically follow predictable patterns: pre-announcements, press coverage, API documentation updates, gradual rollouts starting with early access programs. None of these indicators are currently present for Claude 4. The research assistant provided no additional information, reinforcing that there's no public evidence of Claude 4's imminent availability. Anthropic's recent release pattern shows incremental updates (Claude 3, Claude 3.5 Sonnet) rather than major version jumps. Even if Claude 4 were in late-stage development internally, companies rarely do surprise launches of flagship models - they prefer controlled rollouts for safety, testing, and marketing reasons. For the probability to be higher, we would need credible leaks, official hints, or documentation evidence. For it to be lower, we'd need explicit statements ruling out a Q2 2025 release. The small non-zero probability (8%) accounts for the possibility of accelerated internal timelines or strategic surprise announcements we haven't detected, but the overwhelmingly likely outcome is No given the constraints.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill Claude 4 be available to the general public before July 1, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nPromptLayer: [Everything we know: Claude 4](https://blog.promptlayer.com/claude-4/)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if a member of the general public can access Anthropic's Claude 4 model without first joining a waitlist or participating in an early access or testing phase. If Anthropic does not release Claude 4 before July 1, 2025, this question resolves as **No**.\n\nThe resolution will rely on [credible sources](https://www.metaculus.com/help/faq/#definitions), including that it may rely on the ability of Metaculus employees to access Claude 4. \"Access\" may be via API, the Anthropic website, or any other method that allows interaction with Claude 4. Models that do not include both \"Claude\" and \"4\" in the name will not be considered for resolution of this question.\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nNo additional information available.\n\nToday is 2025-05-16.\n\nBefore answering you think:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n(e) You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
