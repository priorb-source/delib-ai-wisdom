    "review": "Both forecasters lean on the frontrunner/inertia dynamic with two weeks left, which I underweighted. Their emphasis on name recognition, resources, and limited time for persuasion is reasonable. However, neither addresses ranked-choice voting transfer risk for a polarizing candidate like Cuomo, nor the possibility of progressive consolidation in later rounds. The lack of specific polling numbers (topline and RCV simulations) remains a key gap. Still, the generic base rate that a polling leader two weeks out usually wins deserves some weight.",
    "rationale": "I originally put more emphasis on Cuomo’s potential transfer weakness under RCV and progressive mobilization, holding him below 50%. The other forecasters’ arguments remind me that, absent concrete evidence of a Mamdani lead in later-round simulations or major consolidation, the polling lead plus name recognition and resource advantages typically make the leader a slight favorite this late. That said, the narrowing margin, Cuomo’s liabilities, and likely unfavorable second-choice dynamics in an RCV environment keep this far from a lock. With only directional evidence (\"lead narrows\") and no RCV polling, I’ll move up modestly from 42% to reflect frontrunner inertia, but stay below their 65% because the RCV structure and Cuomo’s polarization plausibly flip a small first-round lead.\n\nWhat would move me up: credible late polls with RCV simulations showing Cuomo winning final rounds; evidence of fragmented progressive vote with weak transfer cohesion; major institutional endorsements breaking late for Cuomo. What would move me down: polls showing a tie or Mamdani ahead in simulated finals; visible progressive consolidation/turnout signals; a late negative story specific to Cuomo that depresses second-choice support or turnout.",
