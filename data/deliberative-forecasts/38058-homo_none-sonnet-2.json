    "review": "The other forecasters raise several important points I need to weigh carefully. Most significantly, Forecaster 3 identifies that the lack of resolution by May 26 (day 7 of the window) means tariffs have appeared on at least one front page EVERY SINGLE DAY so far. This 100% coverage rate in the first week is much stronger evidence of persistence than I initially credited - it suggests not just prominence but near-guaranteed daily coverage. \n\nForecaster 2 correctly notes the resolution window is 43 days total with about 36 remaining, and emphasizes that the front page includes multiple sections where 'tariff' could appear, not just top headlines. This makes omission harder than I may have weighted.\n\nHowever, Forecaster 3's point about alternative terminology ('trade war', 'duties', 'import taxes') is interesting - papers could discuss the topic without using the specific word 'tariff', though this seems less likely for such a central policy term.\n\nThe bracketing of forecasts (my 28%, Forecaster 2's 38%, Forecaster 3's 48%) suggests I may have been too pessimistic about YES probability given the substantial remaining window.",
    "rationale": "Upon reflection, the most crucial new evidence is the 100% coverage rate through the first week. This demonstrates exceptional persistence beyond what 'tariffs are prominent' suggested. Seven consecutive days without a single omission from both papers is a strong signal.\n\nHowever, I need to balance this against fundamental probability considerations:\n\n1. **Time window advantage**: 36 remaining days is substantial. Even remarkably persistent stories rarely achieve 100% coverage over 6 full weeks. Major events (geopolitical crises, natural disasters, domestic political shocks) can monopolize front pages.\n\n2. **Low threshold**: We need just ONE day, not sustained absence. This dramatically increases YES probability compared to asking if tariffs will 'fade away.'\n\n3. **Dual paper requirement**: Both must omit simultaneously, which is harder than either one alone. But major breaking news often dominates both papers.\n\n4. **Alternative terminology**: While possible, 'tariff' is the standard term for this policy, making circumlocution less likely in headlines.\n\nThe 100% rate so far compels me to update downward from my initial 28%, as it indicates stronger persistence than I credited. However, I don't think the evidence warrants going as high as 48% - that seems to insufficiently weight the demonstrated consistency. A 35-37% forecast better balances the strong persistence signal against the meaningful remaining time window and low resolution bar.",
