    "review": "All three forecasters, including myself, are in strong agreement on the core drivers of this question. The central argument is that Lebanon's persistent and deep-seated political paralysis, which has prevented the implementation of necessary economic reforms since the Staff-Level Agreement (SLA) was reached in April 2022, is the overwhelming factor. Forecaster 2's analysis aligns almost perfectly with my own, reinforcing the view that with only one month remaining, the chances of breaking a multi-year deadlock are exceptionally slim. Forecaster 3 reaches the same fundamental conclusion but assigns a slightly higher probability (12% vs. 5%). The key new argument they raised, which I had not explicitly detailed, is the possibility that the IMF and the international community might show increased flexibility and accept a watered-down deal to prevent Lebanon from becoming a 'complete failed state'. This is a valid geopolitical consideration; the cost of a total collapse in Lebanon could be seen as higher than the cost of a less-than-perfect deal. I find this reasoning plausible, as it introduces a dynamic where external actors might lower the bar for an agreement. However, I am not fully convinced it justifies a jump to 12%, as the primary obstacle has always been the inability of domestic Lebanese factions to agree on any plan, even a 'bad' one, for allocating financial losses. IMF flexibility does not solve this internal gridlock.",
    "rationale": "My initial forecast was 5%. After reviewing my peers' analyses, my core reasoning remains unchanged. The analyses from Forecasters 2 and 3 strongly confirm that the status quo of political gridlock is the most likely predictor of the outcome. The extremely short timeframe of one month makes it highly improbable that years of legislative inaction and entrenched opposition to reforms (particularly concerning the banking sector) will be overcome. However, Forecaster 3's point about the potential for IMF flexibility due to geopolitical pressures to prevent a failed state is a compelling argument for a slightly higher probability than I initially assigned. While the domestic deadlock is the main barrier, a concerted push from international powers, combined with a lowering of the reform threshold by the IMF, could create a small window for a minimal, face-saving agreement to be announced. Such an agreement might not solve the underlying problems but could meet the resolution criteria by providing some funds. In acknowledgement of this possibility, which slightly increases the chances of a 'Yes' outcome, I am making a small upward revision to my forecast. I am not moving closer to 12% because there is no new tangible evidence suggesting this external pressure is manifesting in a way that can actually break the domestic political stalemate. Thus, my forecast remains anchored in the high probability of continued inaction.",
