  "information": "Multiple reports highlighted significant macroeconomic concerns. Year-ahead inflation expectations rose to 6.7%, the highest level recorded since 1981, with consumers widely citing worries about tariffs. The share of consumers expecting unemployment to rise increased for the fifth consecutive month, reaching its highest point since 2009. Concurrently, the Conference Board’s Leading Economic Indicators registered four consecutive monthly drops. Policy uncertainty was also a factor, with ongoing tariff implementation, market volatility, and potential changes in Federal Reserve leadership.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "About 2–3 weeks until the preliminary May 2025 reading (typically around Fri, May 9–10).",
    "status_quo_outcome": "A slight mean-reversion bounce: May comes in a bit above 50.8 (roughly 52–54).",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Negative momentum persists: tariff and inflation headlines intensify, gas prices rise, markets wobble, and layoff news/claims tick up. Sentiment stays at or below 50.8 (e.g., 48–51).",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "April’s shock fades and conditions stabilize: calmer policy headlines, steady/falling gasoline prices, and a market rebound nudge expectations up, producing a modest bounce above 50.8 (e.g., 52–55).",
    "rationale": "We are forecasting whether the May 2025 University of Michigan Consumer Sentiment index will exceed April’s preliminary 50.8. The preliminary May figure should post in mid-May and is sufficient for resolution.\n\nBase-rate and mean-reversion: 50.8 is an extreme low (near historical troughs). After such sharp drops, this series often mean-reverts modestly the following month. Typical month-to-month changes are a few points, and the probability of an uptick after a plunge is slightly better than even. This leans me toward a small rebound and thus a slight edge to “Yes.”\n\nHeadwinds temper that edge. The research assistant notes: year-ahead inflation expectations spiked to 6.7% (highest since 1981), unemployment expectations rose for a fifth month to the highest since 2009, the Conference Board LEI fell for four months, and policy uncertainty (tariffs, market volatility, Fed leadership questions) is elevated. These factors create downside risk and could keep sentiment depressed or push it lower still.\n\nNetting these forces: mean reversion and the difficulty of sustaining new record lows argue for a small bounce; widespread macro anxiety and policy uncertainty argue for continued weakness. I weight the status quo/mean-reversion more heavily—most months don’t see repeated record-setting declines—so I place the odds modestly above 50%.\n\nWhy not higher: Persistent inflation fears (esp. tariff-related), fragile risk sentiment, and rising unemployment expectations could readily cap or reverse any rebound. Why not lower: We’re already at a trough-like level; without fresh shocks (e.g., sharp gas price surge, major tariff escalation, market selloff), another lurch down is less likely than a small bounce.\n\nWhat would move my forecast up: Clear easing in gasoline prices, calmer tariff news, a market rally, softer initial jobless claims, or early survey commentary suggesting improving expectations. What would move it down: Renewed tariff escalations, a visible jump in gas prices, equity selloff/volatility, deterioration in claims or layoff headlines, or fresh inflation scare stories ahead of the survey window.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill the May 2025 University of Michigan Consumer Sentiment number be greater than it was for April 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nCNN: [US consumer sentiment plummets to second-lowest level on records going back to 1952](https://www.cnn.com/2025/04/11/economy/us-consumer-sentiment-april/index.html)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if the University of Michigan's reported Index of Consumer Sentiment, expected to be located [here](http://www.sca.isr.umich.edu/), is greater than 50.8 for May 2025. Less than or equal to that amount resolves the question as **No**.\n\nPreliminary results are sufficient to resolve the question. If there is any confusion about the number, Metaculus will resolve based on whatever number is posted at [this pdf](http://www.sca.isr.umich.edu/files/tbcics.pdf) that is labelled as May 2025, including preliminary. For example, on April 11, 2025 the number displayed was 50.8 for April 2025 (P).\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nMultiple reports highlighted significant macroeconomic concerns.

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
