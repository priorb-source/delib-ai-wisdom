  "information": "The federal budget deficit for the fiscal year ending September 30, 2025, is projected to be $2.2 trillion. The Congressional Budget Office (CBO) estimates that a Republican-proposed bill to cut taxes and eliminate certain programs would add an additional $2.4 trillion to the national debt over the next decade. Interest payments on the debt have become one of the largest federal expenses, exceeding defense spending and projected to surpass $1 trillion annually. According to the Treasury Department, net interest expenditure for the first seven months of the 2025 fiscal year totaled $578.7 billion. In 2025, $9.2 trillion of existing U.S. debt is scheduled to mature, with $6.5 trillion of that amount coming due between January and June.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "23 days until June 27, 2025",
    "status_quo_outcome": "Yes - the debt will exceed $37 trillion",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "The national debt would need to currently be significantly below $37 trillion (by at least $150 billion or more) to account for typical daily increases over the next 23 days. This would require that recent debt accumulation has been dramatically slower than projected, which contradicts the reported $2.2 trillion annual deficit projection.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "The debt continues its normal growth trajectory. Given we are 8 months into fiscal year 2025 (which started October 2024), and with a projected $2.2 trillion annual deficit, approximately $1.5 trillion in deficits should have accumulated. If the debt was around $35.9-36.1 trillion in October 2024, it would now be approximately $37.4-37.6 trillion, already exceeding the threshold.",
    "rationale": "The research assistant's report indicates a $2.2 trillion deficit for FY 2025, which translates to approximately $6 billion per day in debt accumulation. With 8 months elapsed in the fiscal year (October 2024 through May 2025), roughly $1.5 trillion in deficits should have accumulated. The US national debt was approximately $35.9-36.2 trillion in late 2024, meaning it should currently be around $37.4-37.7 trillion. This suggests the debt has already exceeded the $37 trillion threshold. Even if my estimate is off and the current debt is slightly below $37 trillion, with 23 days remaining and typical daily increases of $5-7 billion, the threshold would still be crossed well before June 27. The massive interest payments ($578.7 billion for 7 months alone) and debt rollover activity ($6.5 trillion maturing January-June) support continued rapid debt growth. My forecast is not higher (99%+) because there could be temporary reporting anomalies, data lags, or my baseline assumptions about October 2024 debt levels could be slightly incorrect. My forecast is not lower because the trend is extremely consistent, the timeframe is short, and the debt grows continuously through both borrowing and compounding interest. For me to revise downward, I would need evidence that current debt is below $36.85 trillion or that there has been an unprecedented reduction in deficit spending.",

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
