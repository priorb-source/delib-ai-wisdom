  "information": "As of early June 2025, Miami Mayor Francis Suarez has publicly stated he is considering a run for governor. A poll conducted by The James Madison Institute in May 2025 showed Suarez with 5% support in the Republican primary field. In local politics, the Miami City Commission was set to vote on a proposal to move the city's November election to 2026, which would extend the terms of current commissioners and Mayor Suarez by one year.",

    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "About 26 days (until July 1, 2025)",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Suarez continues to say he’s considering a run, does fundraising or exploratory activity without a formal declaration, and waits until later in 2025 (or 2026) to officially announce.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Suarez schedules a press event or releases a video/social post explicitly stating he is running for governor, likely timed around end-of-quarter fundraising or following a key Miami City Commission action.",
    "rationale": "- Definition: The question requires an explicit candidacy announcement before July 1, 2025. Mere statements of consideration or forming a committee without clearly declaring a run would not suffice.\n- Current signals (per research assistant): As of early June 2025, Suarez is publicly weighing a gubernatorial bid; a May 2025 James Madison Institute poll has him at 5% in the GOP field; and the Miami City Commission was set to vote on moving the city’s November election to 2026, which would extend terms including Suarez’s. None of these indicate an imminent announcement, but they keep the option open.\n- Timing considerations: July 1, 2025 is roughly 17 months before the 2026 election—within a common window for gubernatorial announcements, but the next 3–4 weeks is a short runway absent strong “announcement soon” reporting. He could prefer to wait for the field to crystallize, line up fundraising, or see the outcome of the Miami election-timing proposal. While end-of-quarter fundraising (June 30) could create a modest incentive to announce now, Florida’s political committee system allows substantial pre-announcement fundraising, reducing the urgency.\n- Status quo weight: The default is that no announcement happens in any given short interval. We have only generalized “considering” signals and a modest early poll standing (5%), which suggests limited momentum for a near-term declaration.\n- Why not higher: No clear signs of imminence (e.g., staff hires leaking, event permits, firm media reports of a date). Polling is weak, and he has strategic reasons to wait.\n- Why not lower: The window (mid-2025) is plausible for a gubernatorial launch; public trial balloons already exist; and end-of-quarter optics could nudge an early move, especially if the city election timing decision is resolved and he wants to capitalize on a news cycle.\n- What would move me up: Credible reports of a scheduled announcement, visible campaign infrastructure (domain launch with explicit governor messaging, senior hires), or donor invitations referencing a launch. Also, confirmation that the city election date change passed and is followed by fresh reporting that Suarez will announce before end of June.\n- What would move me down: Public statements from Suarez pushing a decision to later in the year, adverse developments in the city election timing issue that make a June announcement costly, or strong rivals announcing imminently and crowding out his path, leading him to hold off.",

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
