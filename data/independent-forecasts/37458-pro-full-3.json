  "information": "The last mutually acknowledged phone call between Donald Trump and Xi Jinping took place on January 17, 2025. Since then, Trump has claimed to have spoken with Xi on multiple occasions, but China's Foreign Ministry has repeatedly and publicly denied that any leader-to-leader calls have occurred. On May 5, 2025, President Trump stated he had 'no immediate plans to speak with Chinese President Xi Jinping.' Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Guo Jiakum reiterated that 'the two heads of state have not called each other recently' and that no negotiations on tariffs are underway.\n\nThe US and China are engaged in an ongoing trade war. The Trump administration has imposed tariffs of up to 145% on most Chinese imports, and China has retaliated with tariffs of up to 125% on US goods. On May 6, 2025, Trump stated that Chinese officials want to negotiate, but on the same day, US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent told Congress that no official negotiations have begun between the two countries. High-level trade talks between Treasury Secretary Bessent and Chinese Vice Premier He Lifeng are scheduled to take place in Geneva on May 10-11, 2025.\n\nIn March 2025, news outlets including The Wall Street Journal reported that the US and China were in the early stages of discussing a potential 'birthday summit' for June, as Trump's birthday is on June 14 and Xi's is on June 15. The status of these discussions is uncertain. In early May 2025, Chinese President Xi Jinping is on a state visit to Russia from May 7 to 10 to meet with President Vladimir Putin and attend Victory Day celebrations. Topics for their discussion include strategic relations and the US tariff war.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "39 days. The outcome will be determined by events occurring up to June 14, 2025, with the final result known on June 15, 2025.",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No. The current situation involves high tariffs, public denials of communication from China, and recent statements from both sides indicating no immediate plans for a call. Maintaining this status quo would result in no mutually acknowledged phone call.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "The high-level trade talks in Geneva on May 10-11 fail to produce a significant breakthrough. The trade war continues unabated, and diplomatic channels between the leaders remain closed. The 'birthday summit' idea does not resurface, and the June 15 deadline passes without a mutually acknowledged call.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "The talks between Treasury Secretary Bessent and Vice Premier He Lifeng in Geneva are surprisingly productive, creating a clear pathway for de-escalation. To build on this momentum and finalize an agreement or schedule a summit, Presidents Trump and Xi hold a phone call in late May or early June which is subsequently confirmed by both Washington and Beijing.",
    "rationale": "My forecast is 35%. The base case, or status quo, strongly points towards 'No.' The last confirmed call was in January 2025, and since then, a pattern of US claims and Chinese denials has emerged. The resolution requires mutual acknowledgment, which sets a high bar that recent alleged contacts have failed to meet. Furthermore, both leaders have recently stated they have no immediate plans for a call amidst an ongoing trade war. The probability is not lower because of the high-level talks scheduled for May 10-11. These talks represent a significant potential catalyst. A successful outcome could create the political will for a leaders' call to lock in progress or plan next steps, such as reviving the rumored 'birthday summit' for mid-June. My forecast assigns a meaningful chance to this breakthrough scenario. I would increase my forecast if reports indicate the Geneva talks were successful and that further leader-level engagement is planned. I would decrease it if the talks end in failure or with increased acrimony.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill Donald Trump and Xi Jinping speak on the phone with each other before June 15, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nCBS News: [Trump says he's talked with Xi about tariffs. China has denied talks are taking place](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/trump-xi-china-tariffs/)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if, after May 12, 2025 and before June 15, 2025, Donald Trump and Xi Jinping speak on the phone with each other, according to [credible sources](https://www.metaculus.com/faq/#definitions).\n\nBoth sides must acknowledge the phone call took place for it to count. \"Speak on the phone with each other\" is defined as both individuals, from different physical spaces, orally uttering words intended for the other individual into a telephone or equivalent device, those words being converted into electrical or digital signals in real time, and then transferred to the other individual via telecommunications links, where they are reconverted into sound waves at the other individual's listening device.\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nThe last mutually acknowledged phone call between Donald Trump and Xi Jinping took place on January 17, 2025.

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
