    "review": "Both forecasters make compelling points that I should consider. Forecaster 2 and 3 converge on 68-70%, notably lower than my initial 85%. They both emphasize an important distinction I underweighted: a 'No' outcome could come from simply withdrawing/pulling the webpage rather than issuing a revised recommendation. Forecaster 3's reference to 2017 precedent of rapid political webpage changes is relevant - technically, web content can be changed in days with sufficient political will. Both also emphasize that the April announcement of convening the Task Force actually signals a process approach rather than imminent action, which is a good insight. However, I think they may be slightly overweighting the webpage-removal risk. While technically feasible, we have no concrete evidence of plans for rapid action in the next 6 weeks. The Task Force announcement specifically suggests they're NOT planning immediate changes. Additionally, the historical precedent of a 4-year review process and strong institutional resistance to rapid changes in federal health recommendations remains powerful evidence for status quo.",
    "rationale": "After reviewing the other analyses, I'm adjusting my forecast down modestly but not dramatically. The key update to my thinking is recognizing that webpage removal or suspension is a more realistic path to 'No' than I initially weighted - it wouldn't require a full scientific review, just executive action. The 2017 precedent for rapid webpage changes under political pressure is relevant. However, several factors still strongly favor status quo through July 1: (1) The Task Force announcement in April signals they're pursuing a formal review process, not immediate action. If webpage removal were planned for pre-July, why announce a months-long review? (2) No evidence of any directive or timeline for action before July 1 has emerged. (3) Only 6 weeks remain - even motivated political changes require coordination. (4) A sudden webpage removal would be highly controversial and trigger immediate pushback from major health organizations. (5) The bureaucratic 'path of least resistance' is to maintain existing guidance while initiating the announced review. I'm lowering my probability from 85% to 80% to account for a slightly higher risk (~20%) of rapid webpage changes than I initially assessed, while maintaining that the institutional and procedural barriers make status quo more likely than not.",
