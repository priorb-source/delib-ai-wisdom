  "information": "Discord had previously considered going public in 2021 but postponed those plans due to market volatility. That same year, Microsoft offered to acquire Discord for $10 billion, but the company's leadership rejected the offer and a potential IPO was considered as an alternative. Responding to the recent 2025 IPO reports, a Discord spokesperson stated that the company does not comment on rumors or speculation. Discord's revenue is generated through a 'freemium' model, selling subscriptions for premium features.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "38 days (until July 1, 2025)",
    "status_quo_outcome": "Discord remains a private company and makes no announcement regarding an Initial Public Offering (IPO).",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "The July 1, 2025 deadline passes without Discord filing an S-1 form with the SEC or posting a specific IPO announcement on its official news blog. This could be due to unfavorable market conditions, a strategic decision to remain private for longer, or preparations taking more time than anticipated.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Before July 1, 2025, Discord either files a Form S-1 with the SEC or publishes a direct announcement on its company blog stating that it is planning an IPO. This would confirm the March 2025 media reports detailing their partnership with investment banks.",
    "rationale": "My forecast is primarily based on weighing the credibility of the March 2025 Ars Technica report against the short timeframe remaining until the deadline. The report's specificity, naming JP Morgan Chase and Goldman Sachs as partners, suggests it is based on a well-sourced leak and that IPO preparations are in an advanced stage. Discord's history, including rejecting a $10 billion Microsoft acquisition offer, indicates a long-held ambition for independence, for which an IPO is the most logical path. The status quo is that Discord is private, and corporate plans, especially IPOs, are frequently delayed. However, the evidence of concrete steps being taken is compelling. The 38-day window is short, which introduces significant uncertainty and is the main reason the probability is not higher. A significant market downturn or reports of internal delays would cause me to lower this forecast. Conversely, any further corroborating reports or official company hints would cause me to raise it. My forecast of 60% reflects a belief that the reported plans are real and likely to proceed, but acknowledges the tight deadline and the inherent possibility of delays.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nBefore July 1, 2025, will Discord announce that it is planning an IPO?\n\nQuestion background:\nArs Technica: [Discord is planning an IPO this year, and big changes could be on the horizon](https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2025/03/report-discord-partners-with-jp-morgan-chase-goldman-sachs-for-a-2025-ipo/)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question will resolve as **Yes** if Discord, Inc., announces before July 1, 2025, that it is planning an initial public offering. In order to streamline the resolution of this question, there are two resolution sources for the IPO announcement: 1) The company filing an [SEC Form S-1](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/sec-form-s-1.asp) or 2) An announcement at the [news](https://discord.com/blog) section of its website. If there is no such announcement before that date, this question resolves as **No**.\n\nPlease note that for an announcement on the news section of the company's website to resolve the question as Yes, the announcement must be specific. Vague statements such as \"someday becoming a public company\" will not count. If there is any doubt, then greater weight will be placed on whether an S-1 has been filed.\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nDiscord had previously considered going public in 2021 but postponed those plans due to market volatility.

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
