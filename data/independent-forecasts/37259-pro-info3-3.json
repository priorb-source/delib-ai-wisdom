  "information": "Greenland's economy is substantially dependent on an annual block grant from Denmark, which amounts to approximately 4.3 billion Danish kroner and makes up about half of the government's budget. The current government's stated priority is to develop Greenland's mineral resources to build economic self-sufficiency before moving toward political independence. The 2009 Self-Government Act provides the legal basis for Greenland to declare independence through a referendum. Past referendums, such as those in 1979 and 2008, had significantly longer preparation and lead times than the period before the July 1, 2025 deadline.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Approximately 2 months, until July 1, 2025.",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No. The Greenlandic government will continue its current policy of prioritizing economic development and self-sufficiency before considering a referendum on independence.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "The ruling coalition in Greenland maintains its current focus on strengthening the economy through resource development. Given the short timeframe and the immense economic and logistical preparations required for a credible independence push, the government sees no reason to rush and does not announce a referendum date by the July 1, 2025 deadline.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "An unforeseen political crisis, such as a major falling out with the Danish government over foreign policy or resource rights, creates a surge in nationalist sentiment. To capitalize on this momentum or to consolidate a fracturing coalition, the Premier of Greenland makes a snap announcement, scheduling an independence referendum.",
    "rationale": "My forecast is heavily weighted towards the status quo, which is that Greenland's government is not actively pursuing an immediate independence referendum. My reasoning is based on several key factors. Firstly, the current government's stated priority, as highlighted by my research assistant, is to achieve economic self-sufficiency before seeking political independence. Greenland's significant reliance on the annual block grant from Denmark (about 50% of its budget) is a formidable structural barrier to independence, and this economic reality guides the current administration's gradualist approach. Secondly, the timeframe is exceptionally short. With less than two months until the deadline, announcing such a momentous referendum would be a radical departure from normal political process and historical precedent, which has involved much longer lead times. There is currently no public discourse or political maneuvering to suggest such an announcement is imminent. My probability is not lower than 3% because unexpected political events can happen. A sudden domestic political crisis or a major international incident involving Greenland's sovereignty could theoretically force the government's hand, making a snap announcement a strategic possibility, however remote. My probability is not higher because all available evidence—the government's stated policy, the strong economic disincentives, and the short timeline—points firmly against an announcement. For me to increase my forecast, I would need to see evidence of a major schism within the ruling coalition, a sudden and significant spike in public polling favoring an immediate referendum, or a major diplomatic incident with Denmark.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nBefore July 1, 2025, will the government of Greenland officially announce a date for an independence referendum?\n\nQuestion background:\nReuters: [Greenland's independence gradualists win election amid Trump control pledge](https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/greenland-election-tests-independence-ambitions-us-interest-looms-2025-03-11/)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if, before July 1, 2025, a referendum on the independence of Greenland from the Denmark is officially scheduled. If this does not occur before that date, this question resolves as **No**.\n\nFor purposes of this question, the referendum will be considered \"officially scheduled\" when it is announced by a person or entity with the authority to do so within Greenland. Please note that broader legality, such as it being overturned by the government of Denmark, will be considered irrelevant for this question.\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nGreenland's economy is substantially dependent on an annual block grant from Denmark, which amounts to approximately 4.3 billion Danish kroner and makes up about half of the government's budget.

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
