    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Approximately 55 days until July 1, 2025",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No - Lesotho is not currently listed as 'Available' on Starlink's availability map, and absent any changes, this status would continue through July 1, 2025",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Despite receiving regulatory approval on April 14, 2025, Starlink encounters delays in operationalizing service in Lesotho. These could include: additional regulatory paperwork, challenges establishing local customer service infrastructure, payment system integrations, supply chain logistics for equipment, or simply that the company's rollout timeline extends beyond July 1. The company may be prioritizing other markets or facing resource constraints.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Following the license grant on April 14, Starlink moves quickly to activate service in Lesotho. Given that South Africa (which surrounds Lesotho) already has Starlink service, the regional satellite coverage and ground infrastructure are in place. Starlink completes remaining administrative setup, establishes local payment and customer service systems, and updates their availability map to show Lesotho as 'Available' sometime between now and July 1.",
    "rationale": "This forecast requires weighing the significance of regulatory approval against the limited timeframe and lack of information about launch preparations. The positive factor is that Lesotho granted the license on April 14, 2025 - approximately 3 weeks ago - clearing the major regulatory hurdle. Additionally, South Africa's existing Starlink service means regional satellite coverage and infrastructure are already operational, potentially enabling faster deployment. The total window from license approval to resolution is roughly 77 days (2.5 months), which is plausible for a company with Starlink's technical capabilities. However, several factors warrant caution: First, status quo bias suggests maintaining current state (no availability) is more likely than change. Second, the research assistant provided no information about launch preparations, announcements, or timelines from Starlink, which we would expect to see if a launch were imminent. Third, even with regulatory approval, operationalizing service typically requires establishing local customer service, payment systems, supply chain logistics, and potentially additional administrative steps. The 3-week period since license approval is relatively short, and there's no evidence of progress. Historical patterns with Starlink launches suggest variable timelines after regulatory approval - some countries see quick activation while others experience delays. This forecast would increase with evidence of: active preparations, official launch announcements, equipment shipments to Lesotho, or Starlink job postings for local operations. It would decrease if: Starlink announces delays, additional regulatory requirements emerge, or competing priorities are revealed. Considering all factors, a moderate probability around 40% reflects both the real possibility enabled by the license grant and regional infrastructure, balanced against the limited time remaining and absence of launch signals.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill Starlink's website show Lesotho as a country with Starlink availability before July 1, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\n[Lesotho grants license to Musk's Starlink](https://www.ewn.co.za/2025/04/14/lesotho-grants-license-to-musks-starlink)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if, before July 1, 2025, the [Starlink Availability Map](https://www.starlink.com/us/map) has anywhere in Lesotho listed as \"Available.\"\n\n\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nNo additional information available.\n\nToday is 2025-05-07.\n\nBefore answering you think:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n(e) You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
