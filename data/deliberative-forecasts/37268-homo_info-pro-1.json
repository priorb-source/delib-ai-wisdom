    "review": "The deliberation has introduced two critical, and seemingly contradictory, pieces of information that I had not previously considered. Forecaster 2 highlights an imminent Independent High Electoral Commission (IHEC) deadline of May 4 for the registration of political alliances. This is a powerful logistical argument for a 'No' outcome, as it creates a significant, immediate barrier to participation for the 'Alliance Towards Reforms'. Conversely, Forecaster 3 introduces two crucial points for the 'Yes' case: Muqtada al-Sadr's history of reversing election boycotts (notably in 2021, on a similar timeframe), and the recent, concrete action of calling for his followers to update their voter registration. I find Forecaster 3's reasoning more persuasive. The call to update voter registration is a costly signal that is difficult to reconcile with a genuine intention to boycott. While Forecaster 2's point about the IHEC deadline is valid, such deadlines are often flexible in Iraqi politics, especially when the participation of a major actor like Sadr is at stake to ensure the election's legitimacy. A deadline extension or accommodation for Sadr seems more plausible than him mobilizing his base to register to vote for no reason.",
    "rationale": "My initial forecast of 15% was based primarily on Sadr's consistent public statements reaffirming his boycott. The new evidence provided by the other forecasters, particularly Forecaster 3, compels a significant update. The historical precedent of Sadr reversing boycotts late in the process, combined with the tangible action of urging his followers to update their voter registration, now outweighs his public rhetoric in my assessment. The voter registration drive is a strong indicator of his underlying intent to participate. This action prepares his base for an election and exerts immense pressure on his political rivals and the electoral commission. The primary argument against this, raised by Forecaster 2, is the May 4 IHEC registration deadline. However, I assess this as a 'soft' constraint. The Iraqi government and international partners have a vested interest in an inclusive election, and it is highly probable that deadlines would be extended or other accommodations made to allow for Sadrist participation if he signals a desire to return. My forecast is not higher than 40% because a reversal is not guaranteed. Sadr could be using the voter registration drive as a political bluff to extract concessions, or he could ultimately decide to announce his participation after the July 1 deadline, which would still result in a 'No' resolution for this question. Nonetheless, the new evidence has substantially shifted the balance of probabilities, making a 'Yes' outcome a much more plausible scenario than I had initially judged. I am therefore more than doubling my forecast.",
