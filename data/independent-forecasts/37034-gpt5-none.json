    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "About 5 weeks (roughly 37 days) until the May 30, 2025 Baker Hughes report.",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No — the U.S. total rig count remains at or above 583.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Oil stays around the low-to-mid $80s and gas stabilizes near recent levels; E&Ps keep activity steady or slightly higher, with weekly rig changes small (±0–5). The total hovers in the low-to-mid 600s or high 500s and finishes at ≥583.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "A sharper-than-usual spring slowdown: multiple weeks of net declines driven by continued gas-directed cuts (e.g., Haynesville) and a softening in oil prices into the low-$70s, plus tighter capital discipline. Weekly drops of ~5–8 rigs compound, pulling the total into the high 570s/low 580s by May 30.",
    "rationale": "Baseline conditions favor a No. In recent months the Baker Hughes U.S. total has generally been in the low-to-mid 600s, with week-to-week moves typically small. From now to the May 30 print there are only about six weekly readings, which usually isn’t enough time for large cumulative swings unless there is a clear macro shock. Oil prices have been reasonably supportive for maintaining oil-directed activity, and while gas-directed rigs have been weaker, the pace of decline has not typically been steep enough to pull the total decisively below 583 on this short timeline absent a fresh downturn.\n\nEvidence and weighting: Without new data from the assistant, I’m leaning on the status quo: recent totals in the low-to-mid 600s imply the threshold (583) is below the current level by a meaningful margin. Typical weekly volatility (often single digits) suggests a gradual drift, not a cliff. Therefore, the modal outcome by late May is a total at or above 583.\n\nWhy not higher (closer to 0–10%)? Because if the current total is nearer the high 500s/low 600s than the mid-600s, only a modest run of negative prints could push below 583. Gas markets remain fragile; another leg down in Henry Hub or fresh operator guidance cutting rigs could move the needle within a few weeks.\n\nWhy not lower (closer to 50%+)? Crossing below 583 would likely require either starting already near ~590 or experiencing several consecutive larger-than-normal weekly drops. That’s possible but not the base case given supportive oil pricing and the short window.\n\nWhat would change my forecast upward (toward Yes):\n- A print in late April/early May that places the total ≤595, especially if accompanied by weak guidance from major E&Ps.\n- Oil sliding into the low $70s or below and gas dipping sharply, with two straight weeks of ≥5-rig declines.\n\nWhat would change my forecast downward (toward No):\n- Prints holding in the low-to-mid 600s, or any weekly increases.\n- Continued firm oil prices (>$80 WTI) and signs of gas stabilization or modest additions.\n\nThe research assistant provided no additional info; thus the forecast leans heavily on recent historical patterns and typical short-horizon volatility in Baker Hughes rig counts.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill the number of active US drilling rigs be less than 583 for the week ending May 30, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nSeekingAlpha: [U.S. rig count falls for third straight week, Baker Hughes says](https://seekingalpha.com/news/4430543-u-s-rig-count-falls-for-third-straight-week-baker-hughes-says)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if the last count of active US drilling rigs for the week ending May 30, 2025, according to the [Baker Hughes North America Rig Count](https://rigcount.bakerhughes.com/na-rig-count), is less than 583. Specifically, it will resolve based on the number listed as the United States Total for the most recent week in the May 30, 2025 North America Rig Count Report. This is the number of active drilling rigs and includes the total of those classified as gas, oil and miscellaneous, in every US location including inland waters, land and offshore.\n\nIf no report dated May 30, 2025, is released before June 1, 2025, Eastern Time, Metaculus may resolve this question using the most recent report available dated between May 23, 2025, and June 1, 2025, inclusive. If no such report exists, this question will be annulled.\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nNo additional information available.\n\nToday is 2025-04-23.\n\nBefore answering you think:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n(e) You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
