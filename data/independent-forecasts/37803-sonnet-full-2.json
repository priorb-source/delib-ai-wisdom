  "information": "The current administration's Department of Defense leadership has explicitly stated a policy shift away from climate initiatives. Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth remarked that the DoD should focus on \"war-fighting\" and that climate programs are \"ripe for cuts.\" In other statements, Hegseth said, \"The Department of Defense is not concerned with climate nonsense; it's about preparing and conducting war.\" The administration has officially ceased to consider climate change a national security issue and revoked a January 2021 executive order on combating the climate crisis.\n\nSpecific actions have been taken to dismantle climate-related military programs. The U.S. Navy officially rescinded its 'Climate Action 2030' plan, a Biden-era initiative to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. Navy Secretary John Phelan announced the decision, emphasizing a renewed focus on \"lethality and our warfighters.\" Furthermore, the Department of Defense has removed $377 million in funding for climate change reduction programs. Other initiatives, such as the Air Force's 'Sustainable Aviation Fuel' program and the Army's plan for tactical vehicle electrification, have also been put in doubt or deemed impractical.\n\nThe Department of Defense's official climate resilience portal, climate.mil, has been offline since January 21, 2025. This takedown is part of a broader removal of climate-related content across various federal websites. Historical precedent from the 2017-2021 Trump administration shows that similar websites taken offline, such as pages on the Environmental Protection Agency's site, often remained down for several years. While some Democratic senators have reportedly demanded an explanation for the portal's removal and may hold hearings in June, no binding mandate or official plan to restore the website has been announced.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Approximately 6 weeks (42 days from May 20, 2025 to July 1, 2025)",
    "status_quo_outcome": "The website remains offline (DOWN)",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "The climate.mil portal remains offline on July 1, 2025, consistent with the current administration's explicit policy shift away from climate initiatives. The site has already been down for over 4 months with no restoration efforts announced, and the DoD continues to focus resources on 'war-fighting' rather than climate programs. The $377 million in removed climate funding and rescinded Navy Climate Action 2030 plan demonstrate sustained commitment to this policy direction.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Congressional pressure from the Democratic senators holding hearings in June forces the administration to restore the portal. Alternatively, legal challenges succeed in mandating restoration, or unexpected political pressure campaigns create sufficient incentive for the DoD to bring the website back online before July 1. Another possibility is bureaucratic processes or archived content being restored independent of high-level policy decisions.",
    "rationale": "The status quo strongly favors the site remaining offline. The current administration has taken multiple concrete actions demonstrating commitment to eliminating climate programs: removing $377 million in funding, rescinding the Navy's climate plan, revoking climate executive orders, and making explicit statements that DoD is 'not concerned with climate nonsense.' The website has already been down for nearly 4 months (since January 21, 2025) with zero indication of restoration plans. Historical precedent from 2017-2021 shows similar climate websites remained offline for years. The policy direction is unambiguous and backed by both rhetoric and action. Why not lower: Six weeks provides some window for unexpected developments. Congressional hearings scheduled for June could generate political pressure. Legal challenges or public campaigns occasionally succeed. Bureaucratic processes can sometimes restore content independently. Small probability of policy reversals always exists. Why not higher: The administration's position is crystal clear and consistently executed. No restoration signals exist despite 4+ months offline. All actions (funding cuts, policy rescissions, public statements) align with keeping the site down. Very short timeframe makes rapid reversal unlikely. I would update higher if: restoration announcements emerge, legal mandates are issued, or significant political pressure campaigns gain traction. I would update lower if: additional climate programs are cut, or explicit statements confirm the site will remain permanently offline.",
