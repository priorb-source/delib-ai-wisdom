    "review": "I found the deliberation with the other forecasters very helpful. Forecaster 2’s analysis was particularly compelling, introducing a crucial new piece of data: the quantitative drop in Elon Musk's political-related posts from 51% in February to 19% in May. This provides a strong, evidence-based reason to lower the probability. Both Forecaster 2 and 3 reinforced my view on key constraints, namely the short 40-day timeframe and the high bar set by the 'exact phrase' resolution criteria. Forecaster 3 raised an interesting point about the strained Trump-Musk relationship, which slightly reduces the chance of a coordinated message, but I see it as a minor factor. I found Forecaster 3's final forecast of 18% to be inconsistent with their own well-articulated list of significant negative factors (Musk's reduced political involvement, exact phrase constraint, etc.). The arguments presented seemed to support a much lower probability, closer to my own and Forecaster 2's assessment.",
    "rationale": "My initial forecast was 5%. After reviewing the other analyses, I am updating my forecast downward. The new information provided, particularly by Forecaster 2, about the significant and documented decline in Elon Musk's rate of political posting on X is the primary driver of this change. My initial analysis accounted for the general unlikelihood of the event, but this new data firms up the base rate and shows a clear trend of Musk disengaging from the very type of commentary this question requires. This trend, combined with the other strong factors pointing to 'No'—Donald Trump's primary use of Truth Social over X and the very specific 'diversity visa' wording requirement—makes the event even less likely than I first estimated. An unpredictable event could still cause one of them to post the phrase, but the probability of that trigger occurring and them responding with this exact wording in the next 40 days is extremely low. I am therefore reducing my forecast from 5% to 3% to better reflect this new evidence.",
