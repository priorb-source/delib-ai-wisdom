    "review": "Forecaster 2 and I reached similar conclusions (92% vs 80%), while Forecaster 3 is more cautious at 72%. All three analyses converge on the core data and math: 105 Done as of April 16, needing only 15 more by July 1, with a recent rate (0.625/day) far exceeding what's required (0.2/day). Forecaster 2's emphasis on the 'exceptionally sharp slowdown' needed to miss the threshold is mathematically compelling - the buffer is indeed large. However, Forecaster 3 raises an important point I underweighted: the February report stating '>36% implemented' conflicts with April's ~35% (105/302), suggesting measurement noise or criteria instability. This data inconsistency is concerning for a volunteer-run tracker. I also appreciate Forecaster 3's explicit discounting of the 2.2/day historical rate as an early burst, though I had implicitly done this. Forecaster 2's optimism about the 44 in-progress pipeline is warranted, but may be too confident given we're now 30 days past the April 16 data point with no confirmation of continued progress. The core tension is between the overwhelming mathematical case (needing just 1/3 of observed pace) versus uncertainties in tracker reliability, measurement consistency, and data staleness.",
    "rationale": "After reviewing both analyses, I'm updating slightly downward from 80% to 77%. The mathematical case remains very strong - even pessimistic scenarios (50% deceleration) would exceed 120. The 44-item pipeline provides significant conversion potential. However, Forecaster 3's observation about data inconsistency between February and April reports adds meaningful uncertainty about measurement stability that I initially underweighted. Being 30 days past our last data point also increases variance. The volunteer nature of the tracker introduces discontinuation risk that becomes more salient over longer periods. While Forecaster 2's 92% captures the strong mathematical case, it underweights these operational and measurement uncertainties. Forecaster 3's 72% appropriately recognizes these risks but seems overly cautious given the very low bar and substantial pipeline. My updated 77% reflects that the mathematical fundamentals strongly favor Yes, but measurement uncertainty and data staleness warrant modestly more caution than my initial 80%.",
