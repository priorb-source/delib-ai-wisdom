    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "About 40 days (until July 1, 2025)",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "NUFORC receives few or no cube-shaped reports in June 2025, or any cube-shaped reports are posted after July 1, 2025, or classified under another shape (e.g., rectangle/other), so no June 2025 entry with shape “Cube” appears on the site when checked on/after July 1.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "At least one June 2025 report is posted by July 1 with the shape field set to “Cube.” This could be a single witness account anywhere in the U.S., appearing in NUFORC’s June 2025 event index.",
    "rationale": "Baseline: NUFORC’s “Cube” shape is historically rare relative to common shapes (light, sphere, triangle, etc.). The prompt itself notes rarity but also that December 2024 had six cube reports, showing occasional clusters do occur. For a given month, however, many months likely have zero cubes.\nSeasonality: June tends to have higher overall sighting volume (more outdoor activity and clear nights). If the fraction of cubes is roughly stable, higher volume nudges the chance up somewhat relative to winter months.\nPosting lag risk: Resolution hinges on what is visible on/after July 1, 2025. NUFORC often posts in batches, and some June reports may not be published by July 1. This timing constraint reduces the probability versus the eventual (full) month count.\nNet effect: Combining a low per-month base rate (status quo: usually zero) with a positive seasonal effect and a negative posting-lag effect, I expect a modest chance that at least one cube will be visible by July 1.\nWhy not higher? Cube is a niche classification; misclassification into “rectangle/other/unknown” and batch posting delays both push the odds down. Why not lower? Recent history shows cubes do get reported (e.g., Dec 2024 had multiple), and June’s higher activity gives a nontrivial chance even with lag.\nResearch assistant info: None beyond the prompt; no additional data to adjust the base rate. Updates: I would move higher if NUFORC appears to post June reports unusually quickly or if social/media chatter points to multiple cube-like events early in June. I would move lower if NUFORC posting cadence slows or if recent months (Apr–May 2025) show zero cubes, suggesting a persistently low base rate.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill the National UFO Reporting Center report a sighting of a cube-shaped UFO in June 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nAccording to the [National UFO Reporting Center](https://nuforc.org/about-us/): \"The National UFO Reporting Center was founded in 1974 by noted UFO investigator Robert J. Gribble. The Center’s primary function over the past five decades has been to receive, record, and to the greatest degree possible, corroborate and document reports from individuals who have been witness to unusual, possibly UFO-related events. Throughout its history, the Center has processed over 180,000 reports, and has distributed its information to thousands of individuals.\"\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if The National UFO Reporting Center posts a report of a sighting of a UFO/UAP shaped like a cube in June 2025 at [this link](https://nuforc.org/ndx/?id=event) when accessed by Metaculus on or after July 1, 2025.\n\nFor example, although rare in the history of NUFORC, the month of December 2024 [had](https://nuforc.org/subndx/?id=e202412) six sightings with a cube shape.\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nNo additional information available.\n\nToday is 2025-05-21.\n\nBefore answering you think:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n(e) You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
