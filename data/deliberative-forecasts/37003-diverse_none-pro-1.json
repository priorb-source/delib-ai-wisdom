    "review": "Both Forecaster 2 and Forecaster 3 provide a robust analysis of the Social Democratic Party's (SPÖ) historical and structural advantages in Vienna, which I find compelling. They correctly identify the SPÖ's 80-year incumbency, favorable urban demographics, and institutional power as crucial factors creating a high baseline probability for their victory. I believe my initial forecast under-weighted these points. \n\nHowever, I think both forecasters significantly underweight the primary piece of new evidence provided: the March 2025 IFDD poll showing a statistical tie between the SPÖ (28%) and the Freedom Party (FPÖ) (27%). Forecaster 2 dismisses the kind of massive electoral swing needed for an SPÖ loss, yet this poll is direct evidence that such a swing may be in progress. Forecaster 3 appears to misinterpret this poll, stating it shows the SPÖ \"ahead\" and is \"consistent with the broader pattern,\" which is inaccurate for a 1-point lead in a city the SPÖ won by 17 points in the last election. Their confidence at 78% seems to ignore a critical data point that suggests the race is far closer than historical patterns would indicate.",
    "rationale": "After reviewing my peers' analyses, I am adjusting my forecast upwards. My initial 55% was too reactive to a single poll, and I now believe I under-appreciated the sheer resilience and institutional strength of the SPÖ in Vienna, which Forecasters 2 and 3 rightly emphasized. The party's 80-year history of winning, its powerful get-out-the-vote machine, and its deep roots in the city's social fabric (e.g., social housing) provide a stable 'floor' of support that makes them a formidable incumbent, even when facing headwinds.\n\nHowever, I am not moving to my peers' 78% because I believe they are both failing to properly incorporate the March 2025 poll data. A poll showing a statistical tie represents a dramatic shift from the SPÖ's 2020 result and cannot be easily dismissed. It signals that the national momentum for the FPÖ is potent enough to make Vienna competitive in a way it hasn't been in decades. My updated forecast seeks a middle ground: it acknowledges the SPÖ remains the favorite due to its powerful incumbency advantage (moving me up from 55%), but it also reflects that the race is now exceptionally close and an opposition victory is a very plausible outcome (keeping me well below 78%). The SPÖ is likely to win, but there is a significant chance they will not.",
