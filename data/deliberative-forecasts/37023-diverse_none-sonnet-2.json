    "review": "Both forecasters make compelling arguments I initially underweighted. Forecaster 3's point about typical 1-2 point month-to-month sampling variation is particularly important - even without genuine sentiment improvement, statistical noise could easily push May above 50.8. Forecaster 2 correctly emphasizes the extremely low threshold where 50.9 resolves as Yes. However, I find Forecaster 3's reference to mid-2022 concerning - the historical example of 'second-leg-down' after an initial plunge suggests mean reversion from extreme lows isn't guaranteed. Both forecasters may be overweighting statistical mean reversion relative to the severity and recency of whatever caused this historic collapse. The April 11 date means we're only 11 days past this reading, and without knowing the specific catalyst, we can't assess whether it's resolving. Still, their emphasis on sampling variation and the low resolution threshold are persuasive statistical arguments I initially undervalued.",
    "rationale": "After reviewing both analyses, I'm updating upward from 48% but remaining more conservative than either forecaster. The statistical arguments for mean reversion and sampling variation are strong - normal month-to-month fluctuations of 1-2 points make even a slight uptick plausible regardless of underlying conditions. The resolution threshold of >50.8 is indeed very low. However, I remain cautious about three factors: (1) The unprecedented severity of 50.8 as the second-lowest reading in 73 years suggests extraordinary circumstances, not normal volatility; (2) The extreme recency (April 11) means causative factors likely persist into the May survey period; (3) The mid-2022 precedent shows that initial plunges can deepen rather than bounce. Without information on gas prices, inflation trends, or market conditions between late April and early May, I cannot confidently predict improvement. The balance of evidence now favors a modest improvement more than I initially assessed, but not decisively so. My updated forecast splits the difference between pure statistical arguments and situational caution.",
