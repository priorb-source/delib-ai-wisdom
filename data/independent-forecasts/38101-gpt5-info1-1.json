  "information": "UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer faces criticism from Brexit supporters over concessions in a 'renewal' agreement with the EU. His government is also grappling with a sluggish economy, contributing to a decline in popularity. Starmer faces a growing political challenge from Nigel Farage's Reform UK party, whose economic plans he has described as reckless and comparable to the policies of former Prime Minister Liz Truss. Starmer's government plans to reduce the civil service by 50,000 jobs by 2030, aiming to save £2 billion annually, with details to be announced in a spending review on June 11.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "About 32 days (until July 1, 2025)",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No — recent Morning Consult trends suggest Shigeru Ishiba’s approval is modestly higher than Keir Starmer’s, and a tie would also resolve as No.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Approvals stay roughly where they are: Ishiba holds in the high 30s/low 40s; Starmer remains in the low/mid 30s or slips after the June 11 spending review and continued economic/political headwinds. Result: Starmer does not overtake Ishiba by July 1.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "A Japan-specific negative shock (e.g., renewed yen slide/inflation pain, scandal within the LDP) knocks Ishiba down several points, while Starmer gets a short-term boost (e.g., a well-received spending review, positive economic data, or a BoE move improving sentiment), lifting him above Ishiba on the July 1 reading.",
    "rationale": "Baseline comparison and inertia favor No. Morning Consult uses a 7-day trailing average, which dampens rapid swings; with only ~1 month left, large rank changes are less likely. As of late May, Ishiba appears to have a slight approval edge over Starmer. UK: The research assistant notes Starmer’s recent slide amid a sluggish economy, criticism over EU concessions, pressure from Reform UK, and looming civil service cuts with details due June 11—events more likely to depress than lift his near-term approval. Japan: Ishiba’s post-transition “honeymoon” may be fading but remains relatively resilient compared with typical UK PM ratings; absent a clear shock, he likely stays at or above the mid-30s. Mechanics also bias toward No: ties resolve as No, and cross-country gaps of a few points are common month-to-month while 1–3 point movements are typical in this window. Why not higher than my forecast? Starmer faces immediate downside catalysts (spending review backlash, domestic political pressure) and limited time for a rebound; meanwhile Ishiba’s risks are more diffuse. Why not lower? Japan has meaningful downside risks (yen weakness, inflation pressures, lingering party finance issues) that could quickly erode Ishiba’s approval, and a single well-received UK policy move or improving macro print could nudge Starmer up a few points. What would move me up: credible new Morning Consult data showing convergence or Starmer overtaking Ishiba; a UK-positive surprise (e.g., BoE cut with upbeat market/consumer response) or a Japan-negative shock (yen spike, scandal). What would move me down: a poor reception to the June 11 UK spending review, worsening UK economic sentiment, or stable/improving Ishiba numbers through late June.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer have a higher approval rating than Japanese Prime Minister Shiguru Ishiba on July 1, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nResolution source updates monthly. According to Morning Consult for January 2025: \"The latest approval ratings are based on data collected from Jan. 21-27, 2025. Ratings reflect a trailing seven-day simple moving average of views among adults in each country surveyed.\"\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if Keir Starmer has a higher approval rating than Shiguru Ishiba according to [Morning Consult](https://pro.morningconsult.com/trackers/global-leader-approval) when checked by Metaculus on or after July 1, 2025. If this not the case (including due to a tie), this resolves as **No**.\n\n\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nUK Prime Minister Keir Starmer faces criticism from Brexit supporters over concessions in a 'renewal' agreement with the EU.

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
