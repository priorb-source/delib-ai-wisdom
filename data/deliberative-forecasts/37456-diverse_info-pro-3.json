    "review": "My initial forecast was far too optimistic, driven almost entirely by the recall's Class III designation. I fundamentally misunderstood the operational complexities involved and failed to seek out historical base rates for recall closures. Both other forecasters provided a much more grounded analysis. Forecaster 2's emphasis on the product's long shelf life (extending to March 2026) was a critical piece of information I had missed; this single factor dramatically lengthens the timeline needed for FSIS to verify recall effectiveness. Forecaster 3's contribution of a historical median closure time of around 90 days for Class III recalls provided an essential anchor that was missing from my analysis. Their argument that the ~95-day window in the question is very close to this median immediately reframes the problem as being near even odds, before accounting for other factors. Both correctly pointed out that the 40 days already passed without closure is itself evidence that this is not a simple case, skewing the probabilities toward a longer resolution time. Their reasoning is highly convincing, and my initial analysis appears naive in comparison.",
    "rationale": "I am making a significant update to my forecast, lowering it from 85% to 35%. The arguments from my peers were compelling and exposed major flaws in my initial reasoning. My primary error was over-weighting the Class III status and assuming a quick administrative closure. I have now integrated three new, crucial considerations. First, the historical base rate, as cited by Forecaster 3, indicates a median closure time of ~90 days for such recalls. The question's deadline is ~95 days, placing the base probability near 50%. Second, as highlighted by both peers, the long shelf-life of the product is a major complicating factor that I completely overlooked. Verifying that a product with a one-year shelf life has been removed from complex supply chains (including retail and foodservice) is a lengthy process that strongly suggests a closure time longer than the median. This pushes my forecast significantly below 50%. Third, the fact that 40 days have already elapsed without closure makes it more likely that this case belongs to the slower half of the distribution of all recalls. While I still believe Cargill's corporate competence is a minor factor in favor of a faster resolution, this is heavily outweighed by the newly considered complexities. The weight of the evidence now strongly suggests closure before July 1 is less likely than not.",
