  "information": "In March 2025, Anthropic raised approximately $3.5 billion in a funding round that valued the company at around $61.5 billion, up from $16 billion a year prior. Key investors in this and other recent rounds include Amazon (access to $8 billion), Google (over $3 billion invested), Lightspeed Venture Partners, Salesforce Ventures, and Fidelity Management & Research Co. Analysts have noted that the company's access to deep private funding from strategic partners lowers its immediate need for capital.\n\nAnthropic has recently launched its Claude 3.7 Sonnet model and is reportedly developing new features, including a two-way voice assistant and enhanced memory functions for its AI. The company announced a five-year, $100 million partnership with Databricks to develop corporate AI agents. Concurrently, Anthropic is expanding its operations into the Asia-Pacific region, with plans to establish an office in Korea.\n\nThe typical process for an initial public offering of this size involves preparatory steps that have not been publicly observed for Anthropic. There have been no reports or leaks to major financial news outlets like Reuters, the Wall Street Journal, or Bloomberg about the company hiring investment banks or filing a confidential S-1 form. Among U.S. venture-backed companies valued at over $10 billion (decacorns), the base rate for going public is approximately one to two companies per year.",

    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "About 47 days (until July 1, 2025)",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Anthropic continues operating privately, announces partnerships/products, and taps existing strategic/venture funding; there is no SEC Form S-1 filing and no IPO-plans post on Anthropic’s News page before July 1.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Anthropic posts on its News page that it has confidentially submitted a draft S-1 (or otherwise states plans to go public), or it publicly files an S-1 with the SEC in late May/June targeting a fall 2025 listing.",
    "rationale": "- Baseline and timing: With only ~7 weeks left, large late-stage tech companies rarely go from no visible prep to a public S-1 or explicit IPO announcement that quickly. The base rate for decacorn IPOs is low (about 1–2 per year), and compressing this into a short window further reduces odds.\n- Funding situation: As the research assistant notes, Anthropic raised roughly $3.5B in March 2025 at ~$61.5B valuation, on top of deep strategic capital from Amazon and Google. Ample private funding lowers the near-term need for public capital and reduces pressure to announce an IPO imminently.\n- Missing precursors: There have been no credible reports of bank mandates, confidential S-1 filings, or related leaks in major outlets (WSJ/Reuters/Bloomberg). For a company of this profile, such signals typically emerge weeks to months before a public S-1 or an official announcement.\n- Resolution specifics: The question resolves Yes only if (1) a public S-1 appears or (2) Anthropic’s own News page announces IPO plans. Even if reporters speculate, that wouldn’t count unless Anthropic confirms it on its site or a public S-1 is filed. Companies sometimes announce a confidential submission, which would satisfy (2), but given the lack of prep signals and the fresh March raise, that looks unlikely within the remaining time.\n- Why not higher: Strong AI market sentiment could support an IPO window, but the recent mega-round, strategic backers, lack of pre-IPO signals, and short fuse argue against a near-term announcement.\n- Why not lower: It’s not zero because a company can quietly prepare and then post a brief notice (“confidentially submitted an S-1”) or publicly file in late June to target a fall window. Anthropic could also seek employee liquidity or strategic reasons for public currency.\n- What would move me up: Credible reports of hired lead underwriters; Reuters/WSJ/Bloomberg scoops on a confidential S-1; CFO/board changes signaling readiness; or an Anthropic News post hinting at capital markets plans.\n- What would move me down: Another large private round or strategic financing closing before July; explicit statements from leadership denying near-term IPO plans; continued absence of any banking/IPOs-related reporting into mid/late June.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nBefore July 1, 2025, will Anthropic announce that it is planning an IPO?\n\nQuestion background:\nIn its most recent funding talks, Anthropic [floated](https://www.theinformation.com/articles/openai-rival-anthropic-has-floated-40-billion-valuation-in-early-talks-about-new-funding) a valuation of $40 billion. Although there has been speculation that the company could IPO, nothing concrete has been announced yet.\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question will resolve as **Yes** if Anthropic, Inc., announces before July 1, 2025, that it is planning an initial public offering. In order to streamline the resolution of this question, there are two resolution sources for the IPO announcement: 1) The company filing an [SEC Form S-1](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/sec-form-s-1.asp) or 2) An announcement at the [News](https://www.anthropic.com/news) section of its website. If there is no such announcement before that date, this question resolves as **No**.\n\n\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nIn March 2025, Anthropic raised approximately $3.5 billion in a funding round that valued the company at around $61.5 billion, up from $16 billion a year prior.

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
