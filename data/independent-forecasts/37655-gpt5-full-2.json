  "information": "Under Ukrainian law, specifically Article 19 of the Law “On the Legal Regime of Martial Law,” scheduling or holding national elections is forbidden while martial law is in effect. On May 15, 2025, the Verkhovna Rada (Ukraine's parliament) voted to prolong martial law and general mobilization until at least August 6, 2025. The parliamentary rules of procedure also stipulate that once martial law is lifted, the date for the next presidential election must be set no less than 90 days in advance.\n\nPresident Volodymyr Zelensky's office officially denied media reports suggesting that presidential elections were being planned for July 2025. Sources within the president's office and the Ukrainian government told BBC News Ukraine that no meetings had been held nor instructions given to prepare for elections, labeling the reports as 'fake or manipulative information.' President Zelensky has repeatedly stated that the question of holding elections can only be considered after the conflict is resolved.\n\nFormer President of Ukraine, Petro Poroshenko, announced on February 16, 2025, that the next presidential elections will take place on October 26, 2025. He claimed his information came from multiple sources, including the Office of the President, law enforcement agencies, the Central Election Commission, and a printing plant which, he alleged, was already calculating the number of ballots required. This followed earlier reports in March 2025 from The Economist, which, citing anonymous sources in the Ukrainian government, had suggested President Zelensky was planning to announce a surprise election for July 2025.",

    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "About 46 days (until 2025-07-01)",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No — no election date is announced while martial law remains in effect.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Martial law remains in force through at least August 6, 2025, and Ukraine’s authorities maintain the position that elections cannot be scheduled under martial law. The Verkhovna Rada takes no scheduling action before July 1, and official denials continue.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "The Verkhovna Rada, which has the authority to set the presidential election date, unexpectedly either (a) terminates or suspends martial law early and immediately passes a resolution scheduling a fall 2025 election (e.g., late October), or (b) adopts a legal change that allows scheduling during martial law and announces a specific date before July 1. A conditional resolution that sets a specific date upon lifting martial law could also qualify if passed by July 1.",
    "rationale": "Time is short and the legal/political status quo points to no announcement by July 1. According to the research assistant: (1) Ukrainian law under Article 19 of the Law “On the Legal Regime of Martial Law” forbids scheduling or holding national elections while martial law is in effect. (2) On May 15, 2025, the Verkhovna Rada extended martial law and mobilization to at least August 6, 2025. (3) Once martial law is lifted, the next presidential election date must be set with a lead time of roughly 90 days. (4) The President’s office denied reports of planning a July 2025 election; Zelensky has said elections can only be considered after the conflict is resolved. (5) Poroshenko’s claim of an October 26, 2025 election date is not an official announcement and appears inconsistent with the current martial law extension unless martial law is lifted earlier or the law is changed.\nGiven these facts, the base case is No: the only body with authority to set a presidential election date is the Verkhovna Rada, and it has just prolonged martial law beyond July 1. Making a lawful announcement before July 1 would require either lifting martial law early or changing the legal framework to permit scheduling under martial law—both heavy political lifts amid ongoing conflict and recent official denials.\nWhy not higher? There are rumors and some political incentives to project democratic continuity and plan for a fall vote, but those signals are weak relative to the legal barrier and the fresh extension to August 6. Why not lower? Ukraine could, in principle, change the law, pass a conditional scheduling resolution, or terminate martial law earlier than currently planned if the security situation or political calculus shifts. Clear indicators that would raise my forecast: credible reports of a planned early termination of martial law; draft legislation enabling scheduling during martial law; public statements from top leadership (President, Rada leadership) signaling imminent scheduling; or CEC/administrative preparations accompanied by official confirmation. Indicators that would lower it further: another strong denial paired with legal opinions reaffirming the ban on scheduling during martial law; deterioration on the front that makes any election planning implausible; or a new extension or reaffirmation that martial law will remain unchanged through the summer.",

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower.
