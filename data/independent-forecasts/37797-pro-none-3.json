    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Approximately one month. The outcome will be known following the FATF Plenary meeting in June 2025.",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No, no jurisdictions will be added to or removed from the FATF 'black list'. The list will remain: North Korea, Myanmar, and Iran.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "The FATF concludes its June 2025 Plenary and issues a statement indicating no changes to the 'High-Risk Jurisdictions subject to a Call for Action' list. The existing members have not made sufficient progress to be considered for removal, and no 'grey-listed' jurisdiction is deemed to have failed its action plan so severely as to warrant escalation.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Following the plenary, the FATF announces a change to the list. This would most likely involve adding a jurisdiction currently on the 'grey list' that has shown a complete lack of political commitment or has experienced a collapse in state functions, making compliance impossible. A less likely, but still possible, scenario is the removal of one of the current members, though this would require a monumental and unforeseen shift in that country's policies.",
    "rationale": "My forecast is based on the high degree of inertia associated with the FATF's 'black list'. Changes, both additions and removals, are infrequent and represent major shifts in international financial policy.\n\nFirst, considering the removal of a currently listed jurisdiction:\n- North Korea (DPRK) and Iran remain heavily sanctioned and largely isolated from the international financial system, with little to no evidence of the political will required to implement FATF standards. Their removal is extremely improbable.\n- Myanmar was added relatively recently (October 2022) following a military coup, and the country's internal conflict and governance situation have not improved, making removal highly unlikely.\n\nSecond, considering the addition of a new jurisdiction:\n- This is the only plausible path to a 'Yes' outcome. A country would be elevated from the 'grey list' (Jurisdictions under Increased Monitoring) to the 'black list'.\n- This is a drastic step, reserved for cases of persistent non-compliance or a complete lack of high-level political commitment. Such a move is politically sensitive and requires broad consensus among FATF members.\n- While several countries on the grey list face significant challenges (e.g., Haiti, Yemen, Syria due to state fragility; others for persistent technical failures), there have been no strong public signals from the FATF or its key members suggesting an imminent blacklisting for any specific jurisdiction. The process typically involves clear warnings and protracted negotiations before such an escalation.\n\nTherefore, the status quo is the most likely outcome.\n\nWhy my forecast is not lower (e.g., 5%): The presence of several fragile states on the grey list means there are multiple, albeit low-probability, scenarios that could lead to an addition. A sudden political or security deterioration in a country like Haiti or Yemen could trigger a rapid consensus to blacklist them.\n\nWhy my forecast is not higher (e.g., 30%): The base rate for changes to this list is very low. It is a tool of last resort, and the diplomatic and technical hurdles to add a country are substantial. Without specific, credible intelligence pointing to an impending escalation for a particular country, a higher probability would be unwarranted.\n\nI would increase my forecast if credible diplomatic or media reports emerge that the FATF is losing patience with a specific grey-listed country and is formally considering its addition to the black list. I would decrease it if the pre-plenary discussions and reports appear routine with no focus on potential escalations.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill any jurisdictions be added to or removed from the FATF \"black list\" following the FATF Plenary meeting in June 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nWikipedia: [Financial Action Task Force blacklist](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Financial_Action_Task_Force_blacklist)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if following its June 2025 plenary, the Financial Action Task Force (FATF) has made any changes to its \"High-Risk Jurisdictions subject to a Call for Action\" list, which at the time of this question consists of North Korea, Myanmar and Iran. Resolves according to the [official list](https://www.fatf-gafi.org/en/countries/black-and-grey-lists.html).\n\nThe question may resolve according to [credible sources](https://www.metaculus.com/help/faq/#definitions) in case the website is unavailable or not timely updated.\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nNo additional information available.\n\nToday is 2025-05-19.\n\nBefore answering you think:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n(e) You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
