    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "~1–3 weeks (NBS May CPI likely around June 10–12; FRED series typically updates a few days to a week after national release)",
    "status_quo_outcome": "Yes — CPI YoY remains negative for May 2025, extending the deflation streak to a 4th month",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "May CPI YoY prints at 0.0% or positive due to a rebound in pork/food prices, stronger holiday-related services inflation (Labor Day travel), and/or energy price effects lifting the headline above zero",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Weak domestic demand and ongoing property-sector drag keep headline CPI subdued; continued food-price softness and discounting offset modest core inflation, leaving headline YoY below zero again in May",
    "rationale": "- Context: The question resolves using FRED’s CHNCPIALLMINMEI (YoY, NSA) for May 2025. The background article indicates April CPI was negative YoY, and the prompt implies a deflation streak into April (i.e., Feb–Apr negative). A fourth straight month requires May to remain negative.  - Status-quo weighting: In the absence of new hard data (assistant report: no additional info), I put extra weight on persistence. China’s headline CPI has been weak amid property-sector adjustment, soft consumption, and ongoing producer-price deflation pressures. Core is typically mildly positive, but food and goods price weakness have repeatedly pulled the headline below zero. Month-to-month, large regime shifts are uncommon without a clear catalyst.  - Base effects and seasonality: May compares against spring 2024 when headline inflation was low but not deeply negative. Unless there is a notable upswing in food (especially pork) or services inflation from Labor Day holiday effects, the YoY print likely stays slightly negative.  - Risks to a No: Pork prices can turn quickly with the hog cycle; a stronger-than-expected rebound in travel/services prices or energy could tip headline to 0.0% or a touch positive. Also, targeted policy measures or administrative price support could nudge the headline.  - Why not higher: I’m not above ~70% because small changes (e.g., a few tenths from pork or services) can flip the sign; the May holiday can impart upside to services prices, and base effects might be marginal.  - Why not lower: Given recent negative prints, weak demand signals, and the inertia in the price environment, the most likely outcome is still a slightly negative YoY.  - What would move me: Upward (to 75–80%) if high-frequency indicators showed continued food price softness (pork/veg) and Reuters-style economist polls clustered around −0.3% or lower. Downward (to 50–55%) if hog prices and travel/services indicators surged YoY or credible previews pointed to −0.1% to +0.1% with upside risks.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill China experience a 4th month in a row of deflation in its May CPI report?\n\nQuestion background:\nSCMP: [China’s consumer prices fall in April, fuelling fears of deflation](https://www.scmp.com/economy/economic-indicators/article/3309834/chinas-consumer-prices-fall-april-fuelling-fears-deflation)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if the \"Percent Change from Year Ago, Not Seasonally Adjusted\" data presented at [FRED Consumer Price Indices (CPIs, HICPs), COICOP 1999: Consumer Price Index: Total for China (CHNCPIALLMINMEI)](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/CHNCPIALLMINMEI#) is negative for May 2025.\n\n\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nNo additional information available.\n\nToday is 2025-06-02.\n\nBefore answering you think:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n(e) You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
