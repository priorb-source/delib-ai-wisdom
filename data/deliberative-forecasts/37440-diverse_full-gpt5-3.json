    "review": "Both forecasters emphasize the late-session withdrawal of CS/HB 1381 as a strong negative signal and the constraint of the budget-focused extended session. I agree those are the key headwinds. Forecaster 2 underscores the unusualness of calling a special session for a just-withdrawn bill; Forecaster 3 stresses the recency of the withdrawal as evidence of limited near-term political will. Neither adds new procedural avenues beyond a Governor-called special session, and they somewhat underweight two additional paths I consider material: (1) a two-thirds vote in each chamber to take up off-call items during the extended session (numerically achievable with GOP supermajorities), and (2) inserting narrower provisions (e.g., HB 831-style ID marking) into implementing/conforming bills if leadership is motivated. That said, both are still low-probability moves this late and after withdrawal. Overall, their reasoning reinforces a low baseline and doesn’t present evidence to push me meaningfully away from my prior.",
    "rationale": "Time left is roughly eight weeks. The default is No, given the regular session ended without enactment and CS/HB 1381 was withdrawn on May 3. To reach Yes before July 1, leadership would need to: (a) expand the budget session’s scope (via Governor’s call or two-thirds votes), (b) schedule and pass a separate special session, or (c) embed narrower citizenship-verification language (which would still resolve the question) into budget-implementing vehicles. All are procedurally feasible but politically nontrivial after a high-profile withdrawal. GOP supermajorities and a supportive governor keep a non-negligible tail risk; if taken up, passage and a quick signature are very plausible. The peers’ arguments strengthen the weight I put on the withdrawal and the budget-session focus but don’t negate the remaining, albeit slim, paths. Net: I maintain a low-teens/upper-teens probability. Triggers to move up: the special session call including elections, public prioritization by leadership, or draft text surfacing in implementing/conforming bills. Triggers to move down: the extended session closes without off-call action and no separate special session is noticed by mid-June.",
