    "review": "The most critical difference in our analyses is the recall classification. Forecaster 3 asserts this is Class III (lowest risk, not likely to cause adverse health consequences), while Forecaster 2 assumes Class I (high-risk health hazard), and I expressed uncertainty between the two. This classification fundamentally changes the expected closure timeline: Class III typically closes in 1-3 months (30-90 days) versus Class I at 3-6 months (90-180 days).\n\nForecaster 3 raises compelling points I hadn't fully weighted: (1) No illnesses reported, (2) Preemptive issuance by Cargill, (3) 'Unapproved substance' language typically indicates regulatory violations rather than immediate health hazards. These factors indeed suggest Class III is more likely than Class I.\n\nForecaster 2's emphasis on complexity factors (multi-state distribution, institutional foodservice, 212,268 pounds, extended shelf life) remains valid regardless of classification, but their pessimism assumes a Class I designation that may be incorrect.\n\nThe key insight is that if this is Class III, we're at day 40 of a typical 30-90 day closure window, with 55 days remaining until the July 1 deadline. A 95-day total window exceeds the typical Class III maximum, providing reasonable time for closure. However, the fact that we're already at day 40 without closure suggests the process isn't being expedited despite low risk.",
    "rationale": "After reviewing the other forecasters' analyses, I'm updating my assessment to weight more heavily toward Class III classification based on: (1) no reported illnesses, (2) preemptive nature of the recall, (3) 'unapproved substance' regulatory language, and (4) the general pattern that cleaning solution contamination caught early tends to be classified as lower risk.\n\nIf this is Class III with typical 30-90 day closure times, the 95-day window (40 elapsed, 55 remaining) provides sufficient time for closure, though not abundant time. The complicating factors I originally identified (multi-state, institutional distribution, large volume, extended shelf life) remain relevant and explain why we're already past the lower bound of typical Class III closure times.\n\nThe probabilistic calculation: With ~60% chance this is Class III and ~70% chance it closes within 95 days if Class III, versus ~40% chance it's Class I with ~25% chance it closes within 95 days if Class I, yields approximately: (0.6 × 0.7) + (0.4 × 0.25) = 52%.\n\nI'm updating upward from 45% to 52%, acknowledging Forecaster 3's stronger evidence for Class III classification while maintaining appropriate caution given the time already elapsed and operational complexities.",
