    "review": "My initial forecast was overly optimistic at 75%. I over-indexed on the strength of the signal from the March report (hiring JP Morgan and Goldman Sachs) and assumed this meant a public filing was imminent. The other two forecasters provided crucial context that I had undervalued. Forecaster 2 correctly noted that the two-month passage of time since the report without an announcement is itself a negative signal against the tight deadline. Forecaster 3's analysis was particularly convincing and is the primary driver of my update. Their points about the standard IPO process—specifically the use of confidential S-1 filings (which don't resolve this question) and the typical calendar for large tech IPOs targeting a fall debut (which implies a late summer public filing)—provide a strong structural argument for why the announcement is more likely to occur *after* the July 1 deadline. I found this reasoning compelling because it introduces a high-probability scenario where Discord is actively preparing for a 2025 IPO, yet this question still resolves as No.",
    "rationale": "I am substantially revising my forecast downward from 75% to 35%. My initial analysis failed to adequately consider the standard timeline and procedures of a major tech IPO. The arguments from the other forecasters, especially Forecaster 3, were persuasive in highlighting that a public S-1 filing (the most likely resolution trigger) often follows a confidential filing by several months. A common timeline for a major IPO would be to target a post-Labor Day listing, which would place the public S-1 filing in late July or August, outside the resolution window for this question. While the March report strongly indicates a 2025 IPO is the goal, it does not guarantee a first-half announcement. The two months of silence since that report, as Forecaster 2 pointed out, makes an announcement in the next 39 days less likely. My updated forecast of 35% reflects the view that while an announcement before July 1 is still plausible if Discord is on an accelerated timeline, the more standard IPO calendar makes it less likely than not.",
