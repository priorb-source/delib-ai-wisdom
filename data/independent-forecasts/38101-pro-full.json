  "information": "UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer faces criticism from Brexit supporters over concessions in a 'renewal' agreement with the EU. His government is also grappling with a sluggish economy, contributing to a decline in popularity. Starmer faces a growing political challenge from Nigel Farage's Reform UK party, whose economic plans he has described as reckless and comparable to the policies of former Prime Minister Liz Truss. Starmer's government plans to reduce the civil service by 50,000 jobs by 2030, aiming to save £2 billion annually, with details to be announced in a spending review on June 11.\n\nJapanese Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba's cabinet approval rating fell to a record low of 26% in a March 2025 Asahi newspaper poll. The 14-percentage-point drop followed a controversy involving the distribution of 100,000 yen gift vouchers to 15 lawmakers from the ruling party, which sparked public distrust. Although Ishiba apologized, he stated he used his own 'pocket money' as a sign of appreciation. All 15 lawmakers subsequently returned the vouchers. On the economic front, Ishiba is pursuing a growth-oriented economy driven by wage increases and investment, and has called for cooperation with the Japan Business Federation (Keidanren).\n\nPolling data from early 2025 shows fluctuating approval ratings for both leaders. A Morning Consult screenshot from early May reported Starmer at 36% and Ishiba at 29%, while other reports citing late-May figures placed Starmer at 28% and Ishiba at 32%. Earlier, a March 2025 Ipsos UK poll found that 30% of Britons believed Starmer was performing well, an increase of 7 percentage points. A YouGov poll from the same period showed Starmer with a 31% positive rating, his highest since September 2024. In April 2025, Starmer and Ishiba held a telephone call to discuss the economic impact of U.S. tariffs and agreed to cooperate on global issues.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Approximately one month.",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No. The most recent polling data from late-May 2025, although not from the specific resolution source, indicates Shigeru Ishiba's approval rating (32%) is higher than Keir Starmer's (28%).",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Keir Starmer's approval rating continues to decline following public backlash to the civil service cuts announced in the June 11 spending review. Meanwhile, Shigeru Ishiba's rating stabilizes or marginally improves as the memory of his recent scandal fades and no new crises emerge, resulting in his approval being higher than or equal to Starmer's on July 1, 2025.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "The Starmer government's spending review is perceived as fiscally responsible, providing a modest boost to his approval ratings. Concurrently, Shigeru Ishiba's approval stagnates or falls as his economic policies fail to gain public traction, leading to Starmer having a higher rating by the resolution date.",
    "rationale": "This is a highly uncertain forecast due to the close and volatile nature of both leaders' approval ratings. The specified resolution source, Morning Consult, showed Starmer ahead in early May (36% vs 29%), while more recent but separate reports from late May show Ishiba ahead (32% vs 28%). This discrepancy suggests a tight race with fluctuating public opinion. My forecast leans slightly towards 'No' for two main reasons. First, the momentum appears to be against Starmer, who is grappling with a sluggish economy and faces a significant political risk with the upcoming spending review on June 11, which includes potentially unpopular job cuts. Second, Ishiba's approval, while extremely low, seems to be recovering from a trough caused by a scandal. Ratings at historical lows often have more potential for upward movement (reversion to the mean) than further decline. The probability is not lower than 40% because Starmer could still handle the spending review skillfully, and the early May Morning Consult data provides a strong baseline supporting a 'Yes' outcome. The probability is not higher than 50% because the most recent data points and underlying political pressures favor Ishiba. I would increase my forecast if the June 11 review is met with public approval. I would decrease it if the review leads to a significant drop in Starmer's polling or if new polls show Ishiba's recovery accelerating.",

Ratings reflect a trailing seven-day simple moving average of views among adults in each country surveyed.\"\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if Keir Starmer has a higher approval rating than Shiguru Ishiba according to [Morning Consult](https://pro.morningconsult.com/trackers/global-leader-approval) when checked by Metaculus on or after July 1, 2025.
