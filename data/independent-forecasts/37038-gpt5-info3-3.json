  "information": "The United States recently implemented a general 10% tariff on imports from most trading partners. Concurrently, the administration has pursued other trade actions, including imposing a 25% tariff on imported automobiles and certain auto parts, and increasing tariffs on Chinese goods to over 100% in response to retaliatory measures. Additionally, new tariffs ranging from 41% to over 3,500% have been announced on solar imports from several Southeast Asian countries, pending a final decision in June 2025.",

    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "~38 days (until June 1, 2025)",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "The US–Israel FTA remains in force with “IL” special rates largely Free; no country-specific 17% line is added to the HTS for Israel. Any new US tariff programs (e.g., broad baseline tariffs, sectoral measures, AD/CVD cases) either exclude Israel, or are implemented via Chapter 99 in ways that do not present as a “+17% for Israel” in the applicable subheadings by June 1.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "The administration implements a country-specific, across-the-board “reciprocal” tariff program that assigns Israel a 17% additional duty (e.g., tied to Israel’s 17% VAT) and encodes it in the HTS—likely via Chapter 99—with language that clearly displays “+ 17% for Israel” when the HTS is queried on or after June 1, 2025. Alternatively, ILFTA preferences are suspended and a special Israel rate of 17% is explicitly added to applicable subheadings (even if listed as suspended).",
    "rationale": "Baseline: Under the US–Israel FTA, the HTS typically lists “IL” with Free for most lines. There is no standing US policy that sets a uniform, country-specific 17% tariff on Israel. HTS country-specific adders (like the China Section 301 duties) usually appear as Chapter 99 additional duties, not as a replacement line item of “+17% for Israel” in standard subheadings. Politically and legally, imposing a targeted across-the-board tariff on Israel by June 1 would be unusual given the alliance, FTA obligations, and WTO constraints; suspending ILFTA or creating a bespoke 17% rate would be a significant, visible departure. Timing: With ~5 weeks left, implementing, proclaiming, encoding, and publishing a country-specific 17% for Israel that is visible on hts.usitc.gov by June 1 is a tight window. Research assistant input: They report a general 10% tariff and other trade actions. Even if accurate, these are not Israel-specific and would more likely be reflected as general or Chapter 99 measures rather than as a dedicated “Israel 17%” line in the HTS. The 17% figure plausibly maps to a “reciprocal” tariff pegged to Israel’s 17% VAT—an idea floated in policy circles—but enacting that rapidly, and in a way that the HTS shows as “+17% for Israel,” remains unlikely. Why not higher: Significant institutional, legal, and political hurdles; unusual to single out Israel; HTS convention typically uses Chapter 99 adders, and AD/CVD actions do not change the base HTS country rate display. Why not lower: A small chance exists that a sweeping reciprocal-tariff program rolls out quickly with per-country adders, including Israel at 17%, and that USITC publishes a visible HTS entry (even if marked suspended) by June 1. What would move me up: - An official White House/USTR announcement of a reciprocal tariff regime assigning 17% to Israel. - A presidential proclamation or USITC notice adding Chapter 99 provisions explicitly stating an additional 17% duty on “products of Israel,” with HTS website previews showing the text. - Notice of ILFTA suspension with specific 17% rates. What would move me down: - Signals that any baseline tariff excludes FTA partners (including Israel). - USITC/CBP guidance indicating no country-specific HTS lines for Israel will be posted before June 1.",
