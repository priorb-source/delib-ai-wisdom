  "information": "According to Baker Hughes data from mid-April 2025, the total number of active drilling rigs in the U.S. rose by 2 to 585. This followed a 7-rig dip in the prior week. The count of oil rigs rose by 1 to 481, and gas rigs also increased by 1 to 98. The total rig count is down by 34 compared to the same period in the previous year. Drilling activity in the Permian basin was steady at 289 rigs, which is 29 fewer than the previous year. The Frac Spread Count, which estimates the number of crews completing wells, fell by 10 to 195.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Approximately 5 weeks, with the outcome determined by the Baker Hughes report for the week ending May 30, 2025.",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No, because the latest reported rig count of 585 is not less than 583.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Relatively stable commodity prices and economic conditions encourage oil and gas producers to maintain their current drilling schedules. Weekly fluctuations occur, but the net change over the five-week period is a decrease of 2 rigs or fewer, resulting in a final count of 583 or higher.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "The persistent industry trend of capital discipline and efficiency gains, driven by recent corporate mergers, continues to exert downward pressure on the rig count. Normal weekly volatility results in a net decrease of 3 or more rigs over the five-week period, pushing the total count to 582 or lower.",
    "rationale": "My forecast is based on an analysis of the current rig count, recent trends, and underlying industry drivers. The current US active rig count is 585, which is just two rigs above the threshold of 583. This proximity to the threshold makes the status quo outcome of 'No' a very real possibility and serves as my primary anchor.\n\nHowever, several factors point towards a likely decrease. The most significant is the year-over-year trend; the current count of 585 is 34 rigs lower than the same period last year. This reflects a persistent, structural shift in the industry towards capital discipline and maximizing shareholder returns over aggressive production growth. This is further compounded by efficiency gains, where fewer rigs are needed to achieve the same level of production. The recent wave of M&A in the sector is likely to accelerate this trend as consolidated companies optimize their operations and reduce redundant drilling programs.\n\nThe weekly data is volatile, as evidenced by the recent movements: a 7-rig drop followed by a 2-rig increase. This volatility means that a net change of just 3 rigs over five weeks is a very small move and well within the range of normal fluctuations. The long-term downward pressure makes a net decrease more probable than a net increase or stasis.\n\nMy forecast is not higher (e.g., 75%) because the starting point is above the threshold. We are only one or two weeks of modest rig additions away from a 'No' outcome, and stable oil prices provide an incentive for companies to at least maintain current activity levels.\n\nMy forecast is not lower (e.g., 45%) because that would mean betting against the strong, established year-over-year trend for a very small required change. The headwinds of capital discipline and efficiency are significant and suggest that, on balance, the path of least resistance for the rig count is downwards.\n\nI would increase my probability for 'Yes' if upcoming weekly reports show a consistent decline or if a significant drop in oil or gas prices occurs. Conversely, I would lower my probability and favor 'No' if we see a sustained increase in commodity prices or if the next two to three weekly reports show additions to the rig count.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill the number of active US drilling rigs be less than 583 for the week ending May 30, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nSeekingAlpha: [U.S. rig count falls for third straight week, Baker Hughes says](https://seekingalpha.com/news/4430543-u-s-rig-count-falls-for-third-straight-week-baker-hughes-says)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if the last count of active US drilling rigs for the week ending May 30, 2025, according to the [Baker Hughes North America Rig Count](https://rigcount.bakerhughes.com/na-rig-count), is less than 583. Specifically, it will resolve based on the number listed as the United States Total for the most recent week in the May 30, 2025 North America Rig Count Report. This is the number of active drilling rigs and includes the total of those classified as gas, oil and miscellaneous, in every US location including inland waters, land and offshore.\n\nIf no report dated May 30, 2025, is released before June 1, 2025, Eastern Time, Metaculus may resolve this question using the most recent report available dated between May 23, 2025, and June 1, 2025, inclusive. If no such report exists, this question will be annulled.\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nAccording to Baker Hughes data from mid-April 2025, the total number of active drilling rigs in the U.S. rose by 2 to 585.

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
