  "information": "Historically, maintaining a .400 batting average is extremely rare in modern baseball. No MLB player has finished a season batting .400 since Ted Williams in 1941. Furthermore, no player in the last 25 seasons has had a batting average of .400 or greater on July 1. In 2023, Luis Arraez's average was .401 on June 23 but fell to .392 by July 1. Factors contributing to this difficulty include lower league-wide Batting Average on Balls in Play (BABIP), which is .288 in the current era compared to .300 in 1930.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Approximately 6 weeks. The question resolves on July 1, 2025, and today is May 20, 2025.",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No. The historical baseline strongly suggests no player will maintain a .400 batting average through July 1. No MLB player has achieved this milestone in the last 25+ seasons.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "All players currently hitting near .400 experience natural regression to the mean over the next six weeks. As sample sizes increase from ~45 games to ~80-85 games by July 1, batting averages converge toward players' true talent levels (typically .260-.330 for most, .330-.370 for elite hitters). Even the hottest hitters cool off and finish below .400 on July 1.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "An elite contact hitter like Luis Arraez, Aaron Judge, or another exceptional talent maintains an historically hot start through July 1. This player would need both extraordinary skill and significant luck (sustained high BABIP, favorable pitcher matchups, good health) to keep their average at or above .400 for the first half of the season.",
    "rationale": "The historical evidence strongly favors a No outcome. The research indicates that no player has had a .400+ batting average on July 1 in the last 25 seasons. This is particularly significant because it represents hundreds of player-seasons. The case of Luis Arraez in 2023 is especially instructive: he was batting .401 on June 23 but declined to .392 by July 1 - just 8 days later. This demonstrates how difficult it is to maintain such a high average even for elite contact hitters. Structural factors in modern baseball compound this difficulty, including lower league-wide BABIP (.288 vs .300 historically), improved pitching, defensive shifts, and better scouting. By May 20, the MLB season is about 40-50 games in, and by July 1 players will have approximately 80-85 games of data. While early-season small samples can produce extreme averages, the next 6 weeks provide substantial time for regression to the mean. My forecast is not higher because: (1) the 25+ year drought is compelling evidence of extreme rarity, (2) even recent elite hitters haven't achieved this, (3) approximately 40 days remain for regression, and (4) structural baseball factors work against this outcome. My forecast is not lower because: (1) we're already 1.5-2 months into the season so we're past tiny sample sizes, (2) only ONE player out of 300+ MLB hitters needs to achieve this, (3) exceptional variance and hot streaks do occur in baseball, and (4) without current data on May 20 batting averages, I cannot rule out that someone is very close right now. I would update higher if I saw current data showing multiple players at .410+ today, or evidence of an unprecedented hot streak. I would update lower if current data showed no players near .400, or if elite hitters were injured.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill any major league baseball player have a .400 batting average on July 1, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\ntheScore: [How long can Judge's .400 batting average last?](https://www.thescore.com/mlb/news/3284701/how-long-can-judges-400-batting-average-last)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below.
