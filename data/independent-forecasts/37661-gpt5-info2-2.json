  "information": "In mid-May 2025, U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren, along with other Senate Democrats, called for a federal investigation into whether the Trump administration helped SpaceX secure foreign deals, including in Bangladesh. The senators allege that favorable treatment from foreign governments may have been exchanged for tariff favors, which they described as potential 'crony capitalism' and a 'quid pro quo' that could violate federal ethics laws. They have written to the Department of Justice and the White House ethics office requesting a probe into the matter.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "About 45 days (until July 1, 2025)",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No — the Starlink map continues to show Bangladesh as Coming Soon/Not Available by July 1",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Regulatory formalities (license issuance, spectrum/landing rights paperwork, import clearances, billing/shipping setup) stretch beyond June; BTRC or other ministries require a local gateway or additional compliance steps; local ISP pushback or political optics (amid U.S. probe headlines) slows flipping the switch; Starlink prioritizes other launches and delays the website update.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Following the reported ‘final approval,’ BTRC issues the operative license and import/NOC paperwork promptly, Starlink enables service using ISL backhaul and/or a ready gateway, opens orders and updates the map to Available well before July 1.",
    "rationale": "Evidence suggests Bangladesh has just granted high‑level approval, which is a major prerequisite. Historically, Starlink often moves from regulatory approval to active availability within weeks to a few months, especially where capacity is ample and no new gateway build is mandated. Forty‑five days is tight but feasible for a website availability flip if the approval truly is final and operational details are in place. The research assistant notes U.S. senators seeking an investigation into possible foreign deal facilitation, including Bangladesh. That could create political noise but is unlikely to be a near‑term operational blocker inside Bangladesh unless local authorities pause implementation. Why not higher: In several countries, post‑approval steps (license formalization, customs, local compliance, tariff approvals, billing, shipping readiness) have taken longer than a month; Bangladesh’s regulatory processes and potential requirements for in‑country gateway or local partnerships could push past July 1. Why not lower: The report of ‘final approval’ implies domestic political will; Starlink’s global footprint and ISL capability reduce technical barriers; Starlink has shown it can flip countries relatively quickly once paperwork and logistics are aligned. Up‑updates: confirmation that BTRC issues the final license and NOC/import approvals; Starlink starts accepting Bangladeshi orders or announces go‑live; appearance of Bangladesh as ‘Available’ or ‘Waitlist’ due to capacity (still resolves Yes if any area shows Available). Down‑updates: credible reports of licensing delays, new conditions (e.g., mandatory local gateway build), legal challenges from local operators, or government reconsideration tied to political scrutiny.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill Starlink's website show Bangladesh as a country with Starlink availability before July 1, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\n[Bangladeshi leader gives final approval to Musk's Starlink service](https://www.aa.com.tr/en/asia-pacific/bangladeshi-leader-gives-final-approval-to-musks-starlink-service/3551404)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if, before July 1, 2025, the [Starlink Availability Map](https://www.starlink.com/us/map) has anywhere in Bangladesh listed as \"Available.\"\n\n\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nIn mid-May 2025, U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren, along with other Senate Democrats, called for a federal investigation into whether the Trump administration helped SpaceX secure foreign deals, including in Bangladesh.

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
