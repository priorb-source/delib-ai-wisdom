    "review": "Both forecasters’ arguments are well-aligned with my prior view: headline CPI is a near-zero knife-edge driven by food and domestic energy drags, with core positive but subdued. They emphasize status-quo persistence when core is ~+0.5%, ongoing PPI deflation, weak PMIs/property, and pork still soft—consistent with another slight negative. Useful additions: the explicit highlighting of FRED/OECD series rounding/methodology risk around 0.0, and the mention of NDRC fuel price pass-through dynamics potentially muting Brent’s YoY rise. I don’t see new hard data but their emphasis on persistence and the rounding tail risk is relevant. I find their reasoning sound and largely convergent with mine.",
    "rationale": "I continue to see May as a knife-edge between -0.1 and +0.1 YoY. The balance of evidence still leans slightly to negative: three straight negative prints, deep PPI deflation, weak demand signals (PMI <50, soft property), and research indicating domestic energy prices remained negative YoY while pork stays below last year on high inventories. May Day services strength and slightly firmer crude versus a year ago could nudge the headline to 0.0/+0.1, but given core is only ~+0.5%, those offsets are unlikely to dominate food/energy drags. The deliberation reinforced two points: (1) regime persistence near zero when core is soft; (2) nontrivial rounding/methodology risk on the FRED/OECD series if the true value is very close to zero. Balancing these, I modestly nudge my probability up, reflecting a slight overweight on status quo persistence relative to the offsetting holiday/services effects. Change: 58% -> 60%.",
