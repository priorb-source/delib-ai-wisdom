    "review": "- New from Forecaster 2: The British Virgin Islands (BVI) as an addition candidate with a lapsed remediation window and reported UK non‑opposition. That’s a concrete potential add I hadn’t considered; if accurate, it meaningfully raises the chance of at least one change. Pakistan re‑listing feels speculative and I assign low weight.\n- From Forecaster 3: A strong base‑rate claim (16 of 17 plenaries since 2018 had changes). That aligns with my prior that most plenaries adjust the grey list and supports a higher probability than my initial 85%.\n- Overall, I find the base‑rate argument compelling and the BVI anecdote additive but not definitive absent corroboration. I modestly increase my forecast.",
    "rationale": "- Base rate: Most plenaries result in at least one grey‑list change; a ~90%+ historical frequency suggests a high prior for “Yes.”\n- Specific June 2025 signals: Mozambique reportedly completed reforms and had an April on‑site with positive readouts—this is a credible delisting candidate on timing. Nigeria and South Africa seem more likely candidates for October, though a Nigeria fast‑track isn’t impossible. On additions, the BVI pathway (per Forecaster 2) is plausible via the ICRG process and would only require consensus at the plenary.\n- To get a “No,” we’d need a conjunction: Mozambique delayed, Nigeria/SA not ready, BVI granted an extension or otherwise deferred, and no other surprise additions—possible but unlikely given FATF’s active list management.\n- I keep some caution for procedural slippage and politics; hence not going to mid‑90s.\n- Net: The added base‑rate evidence and a plausible new addition candidate justify an upward adjustment from 85%.",
