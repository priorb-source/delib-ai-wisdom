  "information": "As of May 15, 2025, the Project 2025 Tracker spreadsheet listed the objective to 'Break up the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration' as 'In progress'. The moderators of the tracker have previously indicated that an item is moved to 'Complete' status only when a formal action, such as a signed executive order or an enacted statute, achieves the specific recommendation. For other large-scale restructurings, the tracker's status was changed to 'Complete' only after such a formal action was taken. From January through mid-May 2025, 5 of 41 objectives marked as 'In progress' on the tracker were updated to 'Complete'.",

    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "About 46 days (until July 1, 2025)",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No — the tracker still lists the NOAA breakup objective as anything other than “Complete” on/after July 1, 2025.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "No formal statutory or executive action that constitutes “breaking up NOAA” occurs before July 1, or such action occurs but the spreadsheet is not updated to “Complete” by that date. The item remains “In progress” (or similar).",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "A formal action deemed sufficient by the tracker moderators is taken and logged before July 1, 2025 — e.g., Congress enacts and the President signs legislation to reorganize/break up NOAA, or a signed executive order with clear, legally effective agency reorganization steps that the moderators judge fulfills the objective — and the spreadsheet is updated to “Complete.”",
    "rationale": "- Current status: As of May 15, 2025, the tracker shows the NOAA breakup objective as “In progress.” The moderators have stated they mark items “Complete” only once a formal action (e.g., signed executive order or enacted statute) achieves the recommendation. For large-scale restructurings, they have followed this practice. From January–mid-May 2025, only 5 of 41 “In progress” items moved to “Complete.”\n- Status quo weight: With roughly 46 days left and no public indication that NOAA’s breakup is imminent, the default is that the item remains “In progress.” The world typically changes slowly, especially for complex bureaucratic reorganizations.\n- Practical/legal hurdles: “Breaking up” NOAA (an agency within Commerce) likely requires statutory changes; sweeping cross-departmental transfers or dismantling cannot typically be done via executive order alone. Even if an EO initiated steps, the tracker’s standard suggests they would wait for clearly effective formal action before marking “Complete.” Legislative processes of this magnitude within six weeks are improbable absent clear, ongoing progress (committee action, floor votes, conference, signature). There has been no widely reported legislation or White House plan at the cusp of enactment.\n- Base rates from the tracker: Only 5 of 41 “In progress” items flipped to “Complete” over ~4.5 months (~12%). The NOAA breakup is more complex than an average item, so its near-term completion probability should be below that base rate, especially in a 1.5-month window.\nWhy not higher? Because of the short timeframe, the need for formal action, the scale/complexity of agency breakup, and lack of visible momentum. Also, even if an action occurred late, the spreadsheet must be updated before July 1 for a Yes.\nWhy not lower? A small chance remains that a surprise, high-priority executive action combined with clear legal authority, or rapid legislative movement, occurs and the tracker promptly updates. The moderators might deem a sufficiently strong EO as meeting the objective if it concretely effects the breakup.\nWhat would move me up: Credible reporting of an imminent bill with leadership backing and fast-track timelines; passage of a relevant bill through either chamber; an OMB/White House reorganization plan with clear legal basis nearing signature; or tracker moderator guidance that a specific EO would suffice and signs such an EO is imminent.\nWhat would move me down: Public clarification from the tracker that only enacted legislation counts; congressional calendars slipping into recess without movement; passing time without any bill introductions or hearings; or moderator notes indicating the item requires multiple statutory steps.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill the Project 2025 Tracker spreadsheet have the objective of breaking up NOAA marked as complete before July 1, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nAt the time of this question, the objective was marked as \"in progress.\" The 2025 Tracker is a project of the Keep_Track subreddit and is explained [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/Keep_Track/comments/1ii7tbr/project_2025_tracker_is_now_live/).\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if the Project 2025 objective to \"break up the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration\" is marked as complete according to [this spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1QGG6wNHna-1tt91yXNkOauAJJ7snobFjfEnmxlmzhl4/edit?gid=0#gid=0) before July 1, 2025. If it is anything other than complete (such as \"in progress\") when accessed by Metaculus on or after July 1, 2025, then the question resolves as **No**.\n\n\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nAs of May 15, 2025, the Project 2025 Tracker spreadsheet listed the objective to 'Break up the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration' as 'In progress'.

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
