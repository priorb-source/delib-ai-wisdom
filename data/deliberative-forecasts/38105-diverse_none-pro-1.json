    "review": "My initial forecast was 10%. Forecaster 2 (30%) is too optimistic, placing significant weight on a finance minister's statement which I, along with Forecaster 3, view as political cheap talk given Lebanon's history of inaction. Forecaster 3's analysis (8%) is highly convincing and aligns very closely with my own initial reasoning. Their key contributions were clarifying that the resolution requires IMF Board approval for disbursement (not just a Staff-Level Agreement), which adds another significant time-consuming hurdle, and identifying a specific but low-probability pathway for a 'Yes' (an emergency RFI). This reinforces the strength of the arguments for a 'No' outcome and the extreme difficulty of achieving a resolution within the short, one-month timeframe.",
    "rationale": "My forecast remains low and I have slightly decreased it from 10% to 8%. The deliberation has reinforced my initial assessment that a deal is highly unlikely. The core obstacle remains the deep-seated political paralysis in Lebanon, which has prevented the implementation of IMF-mandated 'prior actions' since a Staff-Level Agreement was first reached in April 2022. The roughly one-month timeframe until July 1, 2025, is exceptionally short to overcome years of entrenched political and financial interests blocking reform.\n\nForecaster 2's argument that a minister's optimistic statement is a meaningful signal is unconvincing; such statements have been made repeatedly without leading to a deal. I concur with Forecaster 3 that this is not new or reliable evidence.\n\nForecaster 3's analysis strengthens my conviction. They correctly emphasize that the resolution requires not just an agreement in principle, but a deal where the IMF agrees to provide money. This means a Staff-Level Agreement is insufficient; full IMF Executive Board approval is required. There are no signs that the prior actions have been met, let alone that a Board meeting is being scheduled. The procedural steps on the IMF side alone make the deadline nearly impossible to meet, even if Lebanon's government were to act decisively tomorrow.\n\nThe small 8% probability accounts for a low-chance 'black swan' event, such as a sudden political consensus driven by a worsening of the already dire economic crisis, potentially leading to a fast-tracked emergency financing package. However, the base case remains a continuation of the status quo of political gridlock and inaction.",
