    "review": "My initial forecast of 5% was significantly lower than my peers' forecasts of 18% and 16%. Both other forecasters presented compelling evidence and arguments that I had not fully weighed. Forecaster 2 highlighted Costa Rica's existing vaccination mandate for travelers from high-risk countries, which signals a high level of regional awareness and perceived risk. Forecaster 3 provided a more detailed and plausible transmission scenario than I had considered, focusing on the sylvatic (jungle) cycle spreading from Colombia into Panama via the Darién region, supported by specific vectors and primate hosts. They also quantified the severity of the South American outbreak (more than doubling 2024's case count in Q1 2025) and noted UN reports of vaccination program disruptions, which weakens the assumption of robust public health barriers. Their reasoning is very convincing. They did not disagree with my core assumptions—that the status quo is strong and the timeline is short—but they provided specific evidence to suggest the tail risk is considerably fatter than I had estimated. The unusually high viral activity in a country bordering North America, combined with a plausible ecological pathway for spread and potentially weakened public health defenses, justifies a significant upward revision.",
    "rationale": "I am updating my forecast from 5% to 17%. My initial analysis was anchored too heavily on the historical rarity of such events and underestimated the magnitude of the current regional risk. The other forecasters provided convincing evidence that alters this assessment. Specifically, the severity of the outbreak in Colombia, the high-risk sylvatic transmission pathway through the Darién Gap into Panama, and reports of vaccination disruptions collectively increase the probability of an introduction into a North American country. Furthermore, a North American country (Costa Rica) is already demonstrating heightened concern through its vaccination requirements, suggesting that any confirmed case would be met with swift action, increasing the likelihood of a timely CDC notice. The core challenge remains the short 38-day timeline, which requires both viral transmission and administrative action to occur. However, the new evidence convinces me that the probability of the initial transmission event is higher than I first believed. A 17% probability better reflects a scenario that is unlikely but is facing unusually high pressure from a severe, geographically proximate outbreak.",
