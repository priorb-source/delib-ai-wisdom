    "review": "The analyses from the other two forecasters are highly aligned with my own, creating a strong consensus. We all identified the same primary drivers for a 'Yes' outcome: the powerful precedent of his attendance at the 2023 and 2024 G7 summits and the overwhelming strategic necessity for him to secure support in person. We also all converged on the same category of risk for a 'No' outcome: the inherent unpredictability of leading a country at war, encompassing potential military crises or specific security threats. Forecaster 2's mention of a personal health issue is a valid, though low-probability, component of this risk category. I find their reasoning convincing as it independently confirms the key variables and their relative weights. No new evidence or arguments were presented that would cause a significant shift in my assessment.",
    "rationale": "I am maintaining my forecast of 90%. The deliberation with my colleagues has reinforced my confidence in this assessment rather than altered it. The core logic remains unchanged: President Zelenskyy's attendance is the default and overwhelmingly likely scenario. This is driven by the established pattern of his personal diplomacy at key international forums and the critical importance of the G7 for securing ongoing military and financial aid for Ukraine. The invitation has been extended by the host nation, Canada, and the logistical challenges of such travel, while significant, have been repeatedly overcome in the past. The 10% probability of non-attendance sufficiently accounts for low-probability, high-impact events, such as a sudden and severe deterioration on the battlefield that requires his presence in Ukraine, or a specific, credible security threat that makes travel unacceptably risky. The consensus among all three forecasters strengthens the conclusion that 90% is a well-calibrated estimate given the current information.",
