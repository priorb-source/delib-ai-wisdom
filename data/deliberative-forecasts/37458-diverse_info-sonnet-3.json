    "review": "Forecaster 2 raises intriguing information about a 'birthday summit' for June, but I'm uncertain about this intel's provenance since my research assistant didn't mention it. If credible, this would be a significant upward driver, though the 'early and uncertain' characterization tempers its impact. Forecaster 3 provides crucial new details I hadn't considered: Trump's May 5 statement that he has 'no immediate plans' to speak with Xi, and the specific history that the last mutually acknowledged call was January 17, 2025. This establishes a 4-month gap with an explicit pattern of Chinese denials. Forecaster 3's emphasis on China's 'communications posture of denial' is particularly important given the resolution requirement for mutual acknowledgment. The May 5 'no immediate plans' statement is especially significant as it's from just 2 days ago and directly contradicts the likelihood of a near-term call. However, both forecasters may be underweighting the Geneva talks (May 10-11) as a catalyst - high-level economic negotiations often create momentum for leader engagement, especially under extreme economic pressure (145% tariffs). Forecaster 3's 24% seems overly anchored to the status quo given the compressed timeline and severity of the crisis.",
    "rationale": "I'm updating my forecast downward based primarily on Trump's May 5 statement about having 'no immediate plans' to speak with Xi - this is recent, explicit information that significantly reduces near-term probability. The established pattern of Chinese denials that Forecaster 3 highlights also strengthens the constraint around mutual acknowledgment. However, I'm not dropping as low as 24% for several reasons: (1) 'No immediate plans' on May 5 doesn't preclude a call in the 33-day window, especially post-Geneva talks; (2) The May 10-11 Geneva discussions remain a concrete catalyst that could shift dynamics rapidly; (3) The economic stakes (145% tariffs causing severe market disruptions) create extraordinary pressure for direct leader engagement; (4) One month is sufficient time for circumstances to shift from 'no immediate plans' to an urgent need for communication. I'm skeptical of Forecaster 2's birthday summit information without independent confirmation, so I'm not weighting it heavily. My updated forecast reflects greater weight on the status quo and recent statements, while maintaining that the Geneva talks and economic crisis provide meaningful probability of a shift.",
