  "information": "South Sudan signed the African Continental Free Trade Area (AfCFTA) agreement in 2019 but, as of early May 2025, is one of the few states that have not deposited their instruments of ratification with the African Union. The ratification process requires a bill to pass the Transitional National Legislative Assembly, be signed by the President, and have the formal instrument lodged with the AU Commission. Historically, South Sudan's legislative processes can be lengthy; for example, the country took six years to ratify the Maputo Protocol.",

    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "About 60 days (until end of 2025-06-30)",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "The ratification bill is not tabled or not passed by the Transitional National Legislative Assembly in May/June; or the President’s assent is delayed; or, even if domestic ratification occurs, the instrument is not deposited with the AU Commission by June 30.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Government fast-tracks the process: Cabinet tables the AfCFTA ratification bill immediately, the Assembly passes it on an expedited basis in May/early June, the President promptly signs, and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs deposits the instrument of ratification with the AU Commission before July 1.",
    "rationale": "- What we know: South Sudan signed AfCFTA in 2019 but, as of early May 2025, has not deposited instruments of ratification. Ratification requires: (1) passage by the Transitional National Legislative Assembly, (2) presidential assent, and (3) deposit with the AU Commission. South Sudan’s legislative pace is often slow (e.g., six years to ratify the Maputo Protocol), and administrative follow‑through to deposit can add time. Only about two months remain, and the AU recognizes ratification upon deposit.\n- Status quo inertia: With no public indication that the ratification bill is on the Assembly’s near-term agenda or that deposit preparations are underway, the default is slippage beyond June. Legislative calendars, capacity constraints, and competing political priorities make rapid action atypical.\n- Reasons it could still happen: Peer pressure (few holdouts remain), economic signaling to investors/partners, and the ability to fast‑track if the executive prioritizes it. The procedural steps, while multiple, can be compressed if there is political will; the deposit itself can be done quickly once domestic steps are complete.\n- Why not higher: Short runway (≈60 days), history of slow treaty processing, and risk that even a passed bill misses the deposit deadline.\n- Why not lower: The government may value AfCFTA accession for regional integration and investment narratives; recent summit attention suggests some momentum; and fast‑tracking is feasible.\n- What would move me up: Clear evidence the bill is tabled on the TNLA order paper, first/second readings scheduled, Cabinet/public statements committing to June ratification, rapid presidential assent, or credible reports that deposit logistics with the AU are prepared. What would move me down: Continued silence on the legislative agenda by late May, adjournments or political distractions, or indications that deposit will await procedural formalities after July.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill South Sudan ratify AfCFTA (the pan-African free trade agreement) before July 1, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nThe Star Worldwide via MSN: [World Chambers Africa Summit maps economic path for South Sudan](https://www.msn.com/en-xl/africa/other/world-chambers-africa-summit-maps-economic-path-for-south-sudan/ar-AA1CTigs?ocid=BingNewsVerp)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if South Sudan ratifies the African Continental Free Trade Area (AfCFTA) Agreement before July 1, 2025.\n\n\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nSouth Sudan signed the African Continental Free Trade Area (AfCFTA) agreement in 2019 but, as of early May 2025, is one of the few states that have not deposited their instruments of ratification with the African Union.

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
