    "review": "Both forecasters largely mirror my priors: short remaining window, long hiatus since 2017, likely test-readiness since 2022, and absence of visible pre-test signals keeps odds low but not negligible. New/useful points they added: (1) an explicit late-June symbolic date (June 25) as a plausible provocation anchor; (2) the “annual hazard to two‑month window” framing; (3) emphasis that spring allied exercises passed without a test; and (4) specificity on observables at Punggye‑ri (Tunnel 3/4 activity) as triggers for an update. I find their reasoning generally convincing and consistent with my own. I still think 12% is a bit high absent fresh indicators, but the date‑anchored provocation and weakened UNSC cohesion slightly increase my estimate. I’ll nudge up modestly.",
    "rationale": "- Base case: No test remains most likely given seven-plus years without one, frequent missile alternatives for signaling, China’s preference for stability, and the lack of current open-source indicators of final preparations at Punggye‑ri.\n- Time window: ~61 days is short. If a notional annual hazard is low double digits, a simple proportional conversion implies only a few percent over two months absent triggers.\n- Factors nudging up from that baseline: maintained test-site readiness since 2022; potential geopolitical cover from closer Russia ties and weaker UNSC coordination; and a plausible symbolic timing window (e.g., late June) that could motivate a demonstration, especially if paired with a sharp escalation or regime messaging about qualitative nuclear advances.\n- Net: I model this as a low baseline hazard (≈3–5% over two months) plus a modest chance of a trigger window that temporarily elevates risk. Weighting those yields a low but non-trivial probability. Without satellite/IMS/allied warning indicators or DPRK state-media foreshadowing, I keep the estimate in the high single digits.\n- Upgrade/downgrade criteria: I would move up on credible satellite evidence of final test prep (cabling, portal sealing, sustained vehicle traffic, security lockdowns), allied public warnings of imminence, or DPRK signaling of a decisive nuclear step tied to a specific date. I would move down on authoritative assessments of site inactivity/technical setbacks or signs of Chinese pressure and de-escalation commitments.\nGiven the additional arguments about symbolic timing and geopolitical cover, I slightly raise my forecast.",
