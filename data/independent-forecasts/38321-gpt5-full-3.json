  "information": "According to multiple news reports from early June 2025, the White House has officially confirmed that US President Donald Trump will attend the NATO summit in The Hague. White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt stated, 'I can confirm that Trump will attend the NATO summit.' This confirmation was also echoed by officials from allied nations. Dutch Prime Minister Dik Scoh announced Trump's intention to attend following a phone call between the two leaders. Similarly, Polish Foreign Minister Radoslaw Sikorski stated that Trump had reaffirmed his commitment to the alliance and would be present at the summit.\n\nA primary focus of the summit will be defense spending among NATO members. President Trump has been advocating for member countries to increase their defense spending to 5% of their GDP, a significant increase from the current 2% target. In response to this pressure, NATO Secretary-General Mark Rutte (or Jens Stoltenberg, sources vary) has reportedly proposed a compromise deal: a target of 3.5% of GDP on direct defense spending by 2032, with an additional 1.5% allocated for broader security-related expenditures. The discussions will also address military aid to Ukraine, and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky is expected to attend.\n\nThe NATO summit is scheduled to take place from June 24 to June 26, 2025, at the World Forum in The Hague, Netherlands. This will be the first time the Netherlands has hosted a NATO summit. Over 6,000 delegates and 2,000 journalists from 32 NATO member countries and partner nations are expected to be in attendance. President Trump's schedule for June 2025 also includes other high-profile international travel, such as his attendance at the G7 leaders' summit in Kananaskis, Canada, from June 15 to 17.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "About 20–22 days (the summit runs June 24–26, 2025; outcome should be known by June 24).",
    "status_quo_outcome": "Yes — Trump attends in person.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "A late-breaking disruption prevents travel or participation: e.g., acute health issue, a major domestic crisis requiring him to remain in the U.S., a significant security threat affecting the summit, aircraft/mechanical issues, or the summit is postponed/moved out of June. Alternatively, he sends a surrogate (VP/Secretary of State) or only participates virtually.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "He travels to The Hague and joins at least one leaders’ session, family photo, or official dinner at the World Forum during June 24–26, being physically present with other heads of state.",
    "rationale": "Multiple outlets and officials (per the research assistant) report the White House has confirmed Trump will attend, with allied confirmations echoing this. The summit dates (June 24–26 in The Hague) are set, and attendance by the U.S. President at NATO summits is historically the norm. After a public commitment, the reputational and diplomatic costs of a no-show are high, and logistics and security planning for a presidential visit would already be well underway. These factors make attendance the status quo outcome, and the world usually follows the status quo. Why not higher than this forecast? Residual tail risks remain: Trump’s personal unpredictability, potential health issues for a 78–79-year-old, sudden domestic or international crises, security concerns, flight or mechanical issues, or a late scheduling change. Also, a very small chance the summit is postponed/cancelled or moved out of June. Why not lower? The explicit White House confirmation, corroboration by allied officials, and strong diplomatic precedent all push the probability up; once such visits are publicly committed, last-minute reversals are rare. What would move me up? Publication of the official detailed schedule, confirmed wheels-up on Air Force One for Europe, or pool reports showing arrival in the Netherlands. What would move me down? Credible reports of health problems, a major domestic emergency, a significant security threat to the summit, language shift from the White House to conditional phrasing, or reports of a schedule change/postponement of the summit.",

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
