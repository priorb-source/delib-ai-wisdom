  "information": "As of early June 2025, India has not received an official invitation to the G7 summit scheduled to take place in Canada from June 15-17. Multiple media outlets, including The Tribune and the Hindustan Times, have reported this, citing official sources. These reports indicate that no advance preparations for a high-level visit from India are underway. This is contrary to the protocol for such trips, which are typically planned weeks in advance for security and logistical coordination. Canada has extended invitations to other non-G7 countries, including Australia, Ukraine, South Africa, and Brazil.\n\nDiplomatic relations between India and Canada were impacted following the killing of Khalistani separatist leader Hardeep Singh Nijjar in Canada in June 2023. The previous Canadian government under Justin Trudeau had made allegations regarding Indian government involvement, which India denied. Following a change in government, new Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney and Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi exchanged messages expressing a desire to strengthen bilateral ties. However, Indian officials have stated concerns regarding the activities of Khalistani elements in Canada and expect Ottawa to guarantee the safety of Indian diplomats.\n\nSikh organizations in Canada, including the 'Sikh Federation' and the 'World Sikh Organization', have publicly demanded that the Canadian government not invite Prime Minister Modi to the G7 summit. They have cited the Indian government's alleged involvement in the murder of Hardeep Singh Nijjar and other human rights concerns. In a letter to Prime Minister Mark Carney, the World Sikh Organization of Canada stated that inviting the Indian Prime Minister would be an 'irresponsible decision' and would signal that Canada is willing to ignore foreign interference.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "12-14 days. The G7 Summit is scheduled for June 15-17, 2025, and today is June 3, 2025.",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No - Modi does not attend. As of today, India has not received an official invitation, and there are no advance preparations underway for a high-level visit.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Canada does not extend an invitation to India in the remaining days, or extends one too late for proper security and logistical arrangements to be made. Alternatively, Modi receives an invitation but declines due to diplomatic tensions over the Khalistan issue, domestic opposition in Canada, or scheduling conflicts.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Canada extends a surprise last-minute invitation in the next 1-2 days as part of new PM Carney's effort to reset bilateral relations. Modi accepts the invitation despite the diplomatic challenges and rushed timeline. Both countries expedite security arrangements and treat this as a diplomatic breakthrough opportunity.",
    "rationale": "The evidence strongly points toward a No outcome. With only 12-14 days until the summit, India has not received an official invitation according to multiple credible sources (The Tribune, Hindustan Times). This timing is critical because high-level diplomatic visits typically require weeks of advance planning for security coordination and logistics - something that is standard protocol and not easily bypassed. Canada has already invited other non-G7 countries (Australia, Ukraine, South Africa, Brazil), demonstrating selective invitation decisions. The diplomatic context is unfavorable: significant tensions exist over the Nijjar killing allegations, and prominent Sikh organizations in Canada are actively lobbying against Modi's invitation. While new PM Carney has expressed interest in strengthening ties with India, this hasn't translated into concrete action regarding the G7 invitation. The combination of no invitation yet, insufficient time for proper preparation, diplomatic tensions, and domestic Canadian opposition creates overwhelming barriers. I'm not forecasting lower (say 1%) because there remains a slim possibility of a surprise diplomatic maneuver - perhaps Carney could issue a last-minute invitation as a bold reset gesture, and Modi could accept to demonstrate India's importance despite the rushed timeline. However, I'm not forecasting higher because the logistical impossibility of arranging proper security for a PM visit in under two weeks, combined with the political sensitivities, makes attendance extremely unlikely. For me to update significantly upward, I would need to see: (1) an official invitation extended within 24-48 hours, (2) confirmation that Modi has accepted, and (3) evidence of expedited security preparations beginning. For me to update downward to near-zero, I would need explicit confirmation that no invitation will be extended or that Modi has declined.",
