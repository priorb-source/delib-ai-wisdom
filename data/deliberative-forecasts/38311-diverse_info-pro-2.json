    "review": "The other two forecasters provide excellent, reinforcing analyses. There is a strong consensus on the core arguments: official White House confirmation, strong historical precedent, and advanced logistical preparations all point towards attendance. The primary source of uncertainty for all of us is the combination of President Trump's known unpredictability and low-probability, high-impact tail risks (e.g., health or security crises). I found the new evidence cited by my colleagues particularly compelling. Forecaster 2's mention of specific security measures already being implemented (airspace restrictions) and U.S. officials attending preparatory meetings provides concrete evidence of significant sunk costs and institutional momentum. Forecaster 3's point about President Trump's inclusion on official participant lists as of today adds further weight. While Forecaster 2's 91% seems slightly low given the strength of this new evidence, their reasoning is otherwise sound. The arguments from both forecasters have persuaded me to slightly increase my own confidence.",
    "rationale": "My initial forecast of 94% was based on the strong base rate for presidential attendance and the scheduled Trump-Scholz meeting, which indicated active diplomatic engagement. The primary uncertainty was a last-minute cancellation stemming from President Trump's volatility or an unforeseen crisis. After reviewing my colleagues' analyses, I am updating my forecast upward. The new evidence they introduced—specifically, the implementation of security and airspace restrictions, the attendance of U.S. officials at preparatory meetings, and President Trump's confirmed inclusion on current official participant lists—demonstrates a higher level of logistical and political commitment than I had previously factored in. These concrete preparations create significant momentum and increase the political cost of a last-minute cancellation, thus reducing the probability of a cancellation due to whim or a minor diplomatic spat. While the tail risks of a major health or security emergency remain, this new evidence solidifies the status quo and warrants a modest increase. I am raising my forecast from 94% to 96%.",
