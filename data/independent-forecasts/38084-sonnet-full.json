  "information": "According to the resolution source, drought.gov, approximately 22.7 million California residents were living in areas of drought (classified as D1-D4) as of the week of May 27, 2025. The U.S. Drought Monitor map, which provides this data, is updated weekly. Earlier in the year, on March 25, 2025, the California Department of Water Resources reported that water storage at Lake Oroville was 86% full and the statewide snowpack was at 96% of the normal level for that date. Consequently, the State Water Project increased its water allocation forecast to 40% of requested supplies.\n\nIn late May 2025, the National Weather Service issued extreme heat watches and advisories for several inland regions of California, with temperatures forecasted to exceed 100 degrees Fahrenheit. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's (NOAA) Climate Prediction Center also forecasted higher-than-usual temperatures across much of the state for the summer of 2025. NOAA's outlook indicated that the ongoing drought would likely persist through the end of August, with an above-normal risk for significant wildfires from June through August.\n\nA late May 2025 weather forecast for the Bay Area noted a period of unusual weather activity, including a forecasted hot weather event followed by a sharp cooldown. The same forecast mentioned the potential formation of Tropical Storm Alvin in the Eastern Pacific. According to the report, this storm system could track northwest towards California and interact with a low-pressure system, potentially bringing widespread storm activity and rainfall. This was to be followed by a trough of low pressure from Canada, resulting in below-average temperatures and showers.",

    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Approximately 30 days, from May 29, 2025 to June 28, 2025",
    "status_quo_outcome": "YES - Currently 22.7 million California residents are in drought areas, which is 2.7 million above the 20.0 million threshold",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Significant rainfall from tropical storm systems or other weather events brings widespread precipitation to California in early June, improving drought conditions enough that classifications are updated to drop more than 2.7 million residents out of drought status within 30 days",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Drought conditions persist as forecasted by NOAA through August, with high temperatures and limited rainfall maintaining or worsening current drought classifications affecting at least 20.0 million residents",
    "rationale": "The status quo strongly favors a YES outcome since California currently has 22.7 million residents in drought areas, providing a 2.7 million buffer above the threshold. Several factors support drought persistence: NOAA explicitly forecasts the drought continuing through end of August, summer temperatures are predicted to be higher than usual, and there's an above-normal wildfire risk from June-August. Droughts are characteristically slow-moving phenomena that don't reverse quickly - the U.S. Drought Monitor typically requires sustained improvement over weeks or months before reclassifying areas. The 30-day timeframe until resolution is relatively short for meaningful drought recovery. However, there are countervailing factors preventing extreme confidence: potential Tropical Storm Alvin could bring rainfall, forecasts mention possible widespread storm activity and a Canadian trough bringing showers and cooler temperatures, and earlier reports showed decent water reserves (86% at Lake Oroville, 96% snowpack in March). While these weather systems could provide relief, a single storm or even several events rarely eliminate drought classifications immediately. For a NO outcome, conditions would need to improve dramatically enough to remove 2.7+ million residents from drought status in just one month, which would be unusually rapid. My forecast isn't higher because weather systems do carry genuine uncertainty and the tropical storm potential represents real downside risk to drought persistence. It's not lower because the status quo is well above threshold, official forecasts support persistence, and the short timeframe makes dramatic improvement unlikely given how drought recovery typically unfolds gradually.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill California have 20.0 million or more residents living in drought on June 28, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nSF Gate: [California's drought has returned — and it's already bad](https://www.sfgate.com/bayarea/article/california-drought-problem-20271547.php)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if Drought Monitor at [this link](https://www.drought.gov/states/california) lists greater than or equal to 20.0 million California residents in areas of drought, when the link is accessed by Metaculus on or after June 28, 2025. If the number is below that, this question resolves as **No**.\n\nThe question will resolve as soon as the page is accessed by Metaculus Admins on the resolution date. However, if there are issues accessing the page, then resolution will wait up until the end of the tournament's scoring at which point if Metaculus has still not been able to access the resolution source, this question will be **annulled**.\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nAccording to the resolution source, drought.gov, approximately 22.7 million California residents were living in areas of drought (classified as D1-D4) as of the week of May 27, 2025.

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower.
