  "information": "The U.S. Department of State released the results for the Diversity Visa Program (DV-2026) lottery in early May 2025. Applicants can check their status online through the Entrant Status Check page until September 30, 2026. This followed the release of the DV-2025 results on May 3, 2025. The registration period for the DV-2026 lottery ran from October to November 2024. The program awards up to 55,000 permanent residence visas annually. The State Department has emphasized that the official website, dvprogram.state.gov, is the only channel for results.",

    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "About 6 weeks (≈42 days), until July 1, 2025",
    "status_quo_outcome": "Yes",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "The State Department reorganizes travel.state.gov and changes or removes the specific URL; the page is temporarily down exactly when checked (e.g., maintenance, CDN/DNS issue); or the DV program page is consolidated into a new path without a redirect that clearly serves the same content at the original URL.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "The Step 1 “Submit an Entry” instructions page remains published at the same URL, possibly updated to note that the entry period is closed, but still accessible at the specified address.",
    "rationale": "- Baseline: The DV Program is ongoing and routine. The 2026 results were released in early May 2025, and status checks run through Sept 30, 2026. The registration window typically opens each Oct–Nov, and the instructions page is usually kept live year-round with updates. This strongly favors continuity over the next six weeks.\n- URL stability: State.gov pages are relatively stable outside of planned site-wide redesigns. There is no public signal of an imminent travel.state.gov restructuring in the next month and a half. The most plausible way to get a No is a content reorganization that changes the URL or retires the page before July 1.\n- Uptime: The State Department’s web infrastructure is robust; a precisely timed outage when Metaculus checks is possible but unlikely over a narrow check window.\n- Policy risk: Any move to abolish or suspend the DV program by July 1, 2025 is highly unlikely. Even if policy changed, agencies typically keep informational pages up (often with notices) rather than abruptly removing them.\n- Research assistant info: Confirms the DV-2026 cycle milestones and ongoing operations, reinforcing near-term stability.\nWhy not higher: Small but real risks include a quiet URL change/redirect that fails the strict location test, or a transient outage at check time.\nWhy not lower: No indications of policy disruption, budgetary crisis, or site redesign on this short horizon; the DV page’s purpose continues between entry windows.\nUpdate signals:\n- Upward: Reconfirming the page at that exact URL remains accessible through late June; explicit comms indicating no site changes.\n- Downward: Early signs of travel.state.gov content reorganization, 404 or redirect of the target URL, or guidance moving DV content to a different path; widespread State Dept web outages around late June.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill the US State Department's Diversity Visa page still be online on July 1, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\n[Federal judge’s order leaves many visa lottery winners out of luck](https://www.siliconvalley.com/2020/10/01/judges-order-leaves-many-visa-lottery-winners-out-of-luck/) | [Donald Trump's 2017 tweet discussing the DV program](https://x.com/realDonaldTrump/status/925684982307348480)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if the Step 1 Submit an Entry page with instructions for registering for the Diversity Immigrant Visa (DV) Program is at [this location](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/us-visas/immigrate/diversity-visa-program-entry/diversity-visa-submit-entry1.html) when attempted to be accessed by Metaculus on or after July 1, 2025.\n\n\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nThe U.S. Department of State released the results for the Diversity Visa Program (DV-2026) lottery in early May 2025. Applicants can check their status online through the Entrant Status Check page until September 30, 2026. This followed the release of the DV-2025 results on May 3, 2025.

The State Department has emphasized that the official website, dvprogram.state.gov, is the only channel for results.\n\nToday is 2025-05-20.\n\nBefore answering you think:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n(e) You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
