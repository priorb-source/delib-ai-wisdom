  "information": "Kalshi, a prediction market platform regulated by the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC), has been actively offering daily MLB markets since April 17, 2025. Sports-related contracts represent a significant portion of its business, accounting for over 80% of weekend trading volume. The company has handled substantial trading activity, including $27 million for the Super Bowl and $500 million for the March Madness basketball tournament. Kalshi has also filed with the CFTC to expand its offerings to include single-game predictions.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "About 30 days (June 1–30, 2025); outcome knowable by July 1, 2025.",
    "status_quo_outcome": "Yes — Kalshi has been listing daily MLB game markets since April 17, 2025, and MLB has games essentially every day in June.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Any single day in June passes without Kalshi listing at least one market tied to an MLB game played that day (e.g., a temporary suspension due to regulatory action, a platform outage, an intentional pause on weekdays for liquidity, or an extremely unlikely day with zero MLB games).",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Kalshi continues its current cadence of posting daily MLB single-game markets throughout June without interruption (no regulatory hold, no extended downtime), and MLB has at least one game every day.",
    "rationale": "- Baseline: The research assistant reports Kalshi has been offering daily MLB markets since April 17, 2025, with sports now a core focus (e.g., 80% of weekend volume, large Super Bowl and March Madness volumes). That track record and strategic emphasis make continued daily listings in June the status quo. MLB typically has games every day in June (no All-Star break), so the schedule supports the condition.\n- Positive indicators: Strong user demand for sports, recent momentum, and a public-facing baseball tag page suggest operational readiness and intent to keep daily listings. The requirement is modest—“at least one game per day.”\n- Risks keeping this below 100: (1) Regulatory uncertainty—ongoing litigation with the CFTC (albeit focused on election markets) could create spillover caution or temporary halts; (2) Operational risks—single-day site outages or listing lapses; (3) Compliance nuance—if any unresolved approval is needed for certain single-game structures; (4) Very low-probability league-wide no-game day (effectively negligible) or mass postponements.\n- Why not higher: A single missed day suffices for No, and legal/operational tail risks are nonzero over a 30-day stretch.\n- Why not lower: Two months of demonstrated daily MLB listings, heavy strategic focus on sports, and typical MLB scheduling make continuity the most likely outcome.\n- What would move me up: Evidence of a formal CFTC green light specifically covering the current single-game structures; first week of June showing consistent daily listings; statements from Kalshi committing to daily MLB coverage in June; visible redundancy/uptime assurances.\n- What would move me down: Any notice from Kalshi about pausing or altering sports offerings; adverse court or CFTC action causing broader listing caution; an observed day without baseball listings; major platform outages.",

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any).
