    "review": "Forecaster 2 raises a valuable point about continental momentum—49 of 54 African countries having ratified does create reputational pressure and suggests Libya is increasingly isolated. However, this momentum doesn't overcome the fundamental constraints: Libya's political fragmentation, the extremely short 2-month window, and the absence of any reported ratification process underway. Forecaster 2's 15% seems too optimistic given these structural barriers.\n\nForecaster 3 introduces what they claim is important new information about Libya focusing on a Turkey bilateral trade deal in May 2025. If accurate, this would be highly relevant evidence that Libya's economic policy bandwidth is directed elsewhere. However, I cannot verify this information as it wasn't in my research assistant's report. Forecaster 3's 5% forecast is more aligned with the evidence of no active ratification process, though I'm hesitant to fully weight unverified information.\n\nBoth forecasters correctly emphasize the status quo and short timeline. The key disagreement is whether continental pressure and reputational incentives (Forecaster 2) outweigh the lack of evidence for prioritization and competing focuses (Forecaster 3).",
    "rationale": "After reviewing both analyses, I'm updating my forecast slightly downward. The continental momentum argument (49/54 ratifications) is valid but doesn't fundamentally change the calculus—Libya has been an outlier for years, and 2 months is insufficient to overcome structural barriers without evidence of active prioritization.\n\nForecaster 3's point about lack of evidence for AfCFTA being a priority resonates strongly. Whether or not the Turkey deal is accurate, the absence of any public signals, legislative activity, or official commitments regarding AfCFTA ratification is damning. In forecasting, the burden of proof lies with predicting change from the status quo, and there's simply no evidence supporting such change.\n\nI'm moving from 7% to 6% because:\n1. I agree the lack of any evidence of prioritization is more significant than I initially weighted\n2. The continental momentum argument, while valid, is insufficient to overcome concrete obstacles\n3. Two months remains an extremely compressed timeframe for treaty ratification in a politically fragmented state\n4. I'm maintaining some distance from Forecaster 3's 5% due to uncertainty about unverified information and general epistemic humility\n\nI would update higher only with concrete evidence of initiated ratification procedures. I would update lower as time passes without such evidence.",
