    "review": "The other forecasters, particularly Forecaster 2, provided crucial context that was absent from my initial analysis. Forecaster 2's arguments regarding long-term polling trends favoring the Conservatives, significant incumbency fatigue after nearly a decade, and the structural difficulty of assembling a majority coalition of seats given the Bloc's strength in Quebec, were highly persuasive. This information fundamentally reframes the data from my research assistant, suggesting it may represent a recent, volatile surge rather than a stable trend. Forecaster 3 reinforced the low historical base rate for an incumbent government at this point in its tenure to win a fresh majority. Their combined analyses convincingly argue that the underlying political fundamentals are unfavorable for the Liberals, a critical consideration I had overlooked.",
    "rationale": "I am making a substantial downward revision of my forecast from 80% to 33%. My initial analysis was based solely on a research assistant's report that portrayed a strong and stable Liberal lead. I mistakenly treated this single, optimistic data point as the entire picture.\n\nThe other panelists have introduced compelling evidence that the broader context is far less favorable to the Liberals. Forecaster 2's point about the long-term polling, which has consistently shown a large Conservative lead, is particularly important. This suggests the pro-Liberal data I have is, at best, a very recent and untested development. Given the significant headwinds of voter fatigue and structural electoral math raised by both other forecasters, the durability of this new Liberal lead is highly questionable over the ~6 months remaining until the election.\n\nMy new forecast synthesizes these conflicting inputs. It acknowledges that if the Liberals are polling in majority territory now (as per my initial data), their chances are much higher than the 2-12% my peers offered. However, it heavily discounts this position due to the high probability that the unfavorable, long-term fundamentals will reassert themselves. Therefore, I now believe the path to a Liberal majority is plausible but faces significant resistance, making it an unlikely but possible outcome.",
