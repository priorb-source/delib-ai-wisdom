  "information": "As of early June 2025, the Republican primary field for the 2026 Florida gubernatorial race includes Congressman Byron Donalds, who launched his campaign with an endorsement from former President Donald Trump. On the Democratic side, former U.S. Representative David Jolly, a former Republican and critic of Donald Trump, announced his candidacy on June 5, 2025. Governor Ron DeSantis, who is term-limited, has not endorsed a successor in the Republican primary.",

    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "26 days (from June 5, 2025 to July 1, 2025)",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Casey DeSantis decides not to enter the 2026 gubernatorial race, either deterred by Byron Donalds' Trump endorsement and polling advantage, or choosing to wait for a future political opportunity. She makes no announcement before the July 1 deadline, and the question resolves as No.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Casey DeSantis announces her gubernatorial candidacy sometime in the next 26 days despite Byron Donalds being in the race with Trump's backing. She decides to leverage her name recognition and Ron DeSantis's political network to compete in the Republican primary regardless of being the underdog.",
    "rationale": "The status quo strongly favors No. As of June 5, 2025, Casey DeSantis has not announced her candidacy with only 26 days remaining until the deadline. Several factors reinforce this status quo: (1) Byron Donalds has already launched his campaign with Trump's endorsement, which signals Trump would likely oppose her candidacy; (2) Polling shows Donalds ahead of her, suggesting a challenging path; (3) Ron DeSantis has notably not endorsed anyone, which could indicate family deliberation or strategic hesitance; (4) There are no reported signals of imminent campaign infrastructure being built or major announcement events scheduled. However, I'm not forecasting lower because 26 days remains sufficient time for a political announcement, and the DeSantis name carries significant weight in Florida politics. She may have been strategically waiting to assess the field. My forecast would increase substantially if there were leaks about campaign staff hiring, scheduled major events, or supportive statements from Ron DeSantis. It would decrease if she explicitly ruled out running or endorsed Donalds. Good forecasting requires respecting the status quo - absent clear evidence of imminent change, the world tends to remain as it is. With no announcement yet and limited time remaining, the probability of maintaining the current state (no announcement) is high.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill Casey DeSantis announce her candidacy for Florida governor before July 1, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\n[Poll: Trump's endorsement boosts Byron Donalds over Casey DeSantis for Florida governor](https://www.tallahassee.com/story/news/local/state/2025/05/09/poll-byron-donalds-surges-past-casey-desantis-with-trump-backing/83412367007/)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if Casey DeSantis announces her candidacy for governor of Florida before July 1, 2025. If no such announcement has been made before that date, the question resolves as **No**.\n\n\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nAs of early June 2025, the Republican primary field for the 2026 Florida gubernatorial race includes Congressman Byron Donalds, who launched his campaign with an endorsement from former President Donald Trump.

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
