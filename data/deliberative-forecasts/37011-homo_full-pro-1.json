    "review": "The analyses from both Forecaster 2 and Forecaster 3 are exceptionally thorough and align almost perfectly with my own initial assessment. We have all independently identified the same critical barriers for Reform UK: the monumental task of overcoming the Conservative Party's 57-seat notional incumbency, the punishing mechanics of the First-Past-The-Post electoral system for a new party, Reform's lack of established local infrastructure, and the historical precedent of predecessor parties failing to convert national polls into local council control. Their reasoning is highly convincing. The only substantive difference is their convergence on a 2% probability, whereas I had initially landed on 1%. This suggests they are placing a slightly greater weight on the small but non-zero chance of a political 'black swan' event, which is a reasonable and defensible judgment.",
    "rationale": "My fundamental reasoning remains unchanged. A Reform UK victory is an extreme longshot due to the combination of the Conservatives' massive incumbency advantage and a First-Past-The-Post system that systematically disadvantages new parties with geographically distributed support. Reform UK would need to go from zero seats to winning a plurality, likely over 25 seats, which would be an unprecedented electoral event at the county council level. However, I am updating my forecast from 1% to 2%. This minor adjustment is not driven by any new evidence, but rather by the consensus judgment of the other two experts. When two other forecasters independently analyze the same facts and arrive at an identical probability, it's prudent to consider whether my initial assessment was slightly too conservative. I am therefore aligning my forecast with theirs, acknowledging that their 2% figure may better capture the small tail risk of a complete and uniquely efficient collapse of the Conservative vote in Reform's favor in a highly volatile national environment.",
