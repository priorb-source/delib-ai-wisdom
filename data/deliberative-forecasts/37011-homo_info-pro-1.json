    "review": "All three forecasters correctly identify the significant structural barriers facing Reform UK, including the First-Past-The-Post (FPTP) electoral system, the party's lack of local infrastructure, and the large notional majority held by the Conservatives. My initial forecast of 1% was closely aligned with Forecaster 2's 2%. Forecaster 2 provided compelling additional arguments that I had not explicitly stated, such as the historical precedent of UKIP failing to convert national polling into control of councils and specific examples of candidate vetting issues, which reinforce the case for a very low probability. Forecaster 3's 8% forecast seems to overweight national polling and underweight the specific mechanics of local FPTP elections. While citing the national surge is valid, Forecaster 3 does not convincingly bridge the gap between national sentiment and the enormous, division-by-division challenge of leapfrogging both the Conservatives and Labour to win the most seats from a starting point of zero.",
    "rationale": "My core reasoning remains unchanged: winning the most seats is an exceptionally high bar for a new party starting with zero representation. The FPTP system is a formidable obstacle, requiring geographically concentrated support that Reform UK has not demonstrated at a local level. The analysis from Forecaster 2 has strengthened my conviction. The historical parallel with UKIP is particularly persuasive; despite significant national support in the 2010s, UKIP's success in gaining outright control of councils was extremely limited. This precedent suggests that even a national surge for a right-wing challenger party is highly unlikely to translate into becoming the largest party on a county council in a single election cycle. Forecaster 3's arguments highlight a volatile national environment, which is the primary reason the forecast is not 0%. However, this volatility is more likely to result in Reform winning a handful of seats and acting as a spoiler than it is to result in them winning a plurality. In light of the deliberation, I am making a minor adjustment to my forecast. While my fundamental analysis has not changed, I am nudging my forecast up from 1% to 2%. This brings me into alignment with Forecaster 2, whose reasoning most closely mirrored and reinforced my own, and it reflects a marginal increase in my assessment of the tail risk in what is an unusually volatile political climate.",
