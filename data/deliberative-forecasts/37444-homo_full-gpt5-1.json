    "review": "Both forecasters’ arguments largely align with my initial take: short timeline and strong political signals against relief make delisting unlikely, with a small tail for a deal-driven pivot. They add two useful points: (1) the 2021 policy reversal on Nord Stream 2 under a different administration shows volatility is possible; (2) OFAC can act quickly if directed, so timing alone doesn’t preclude a late move. I find those points directionally persuasive for keeping a non-trivial tail. However, the 2021 episode was a waiver decision before NS2 AG was on the SDN list, not an OFAC delisting, so the precedent is weaker for this specific resolution. Neither forecaster highlighted that if the White House wants to offer a narrow concession, general licenses or waivers can provide flexibility without removing NS2 AG from the SDN list—an important pathway that would not resolve this question as Yes. That consideration pulls the probability back down. Overall, I agree with their structure and weights, but the GL/waiver alternative makes me slightly more conservative than their 9–10%.",
    "rationale": "- Status quo and timing: With ~8 weeks left, the default is that NS2 AG remains on the SDN list. High-salience Russia sanctions are sticky and typically require clear strategic payoff and interagency alignment to unwind. \n- Political signals: On-record denial by Sec. State Rubio (May 2) and reports of a tougher energy posture (considering a 500% tariff bill on importers of Russian energy, May 5) point away from imminent delisting. EU disinterest in reviving NS2 and preparation of additional sanctions further reduces the payoff of a delist. \n- Practical/optics: One pipeline string is damaged; NS2 AG faces legal/financial constraints. Delisting would be mostly symbolic while incurring domestic political cost. If the administration wanted a reversible, technical concession, it could use general licenses or tailored waivers without removing the SDN listing—these would not resolve this question as Yes. \n- Tail risk: The Politico report suggests internal debate led by the special envoy, and Trump’s decision-making can be abrupt. OFAC can execute delistings quickly if ordered. The 2021 NS2 policy swing shows that rapid shifts are possible, though that case involved waivers rather than delisting. A negotiated Ukraine framework explicitly trading energy sanctions relief could still produce a late surprise. \n- Net: Given the short horizon, strong denials, congressional mood, EU stance, and the availability of non-delisting concessions, the base case remains No with a small tail.\nI keep my forecast at 7%.",
