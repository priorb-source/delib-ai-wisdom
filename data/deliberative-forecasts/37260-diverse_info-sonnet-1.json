    "review": "Both forecasters make compelling arguments that significantly strengthen the case for a lower probability. Forecaster 2 emphasizes the political explosiveness given AfD's 25-26% polling support, which I had underweighted. Forecaster 3 provides crucial clarification that only the federal government, Bundestag, or Bundesrat can file the formal application - and crucially, that NO FORMAL APPLICATION HAS BEEN FILED YET. This is a critical detail I had not fully emphasized. Both forecasters correctly note that we're not just waiting for a Court decision - we don't even have a case before the Court yet. With only 2 months remaining, we would need: (1) formal application filed immediately, (2) Court acceptance, (3) full deliberation, and (4) ban announcement - all within 60 days. The January motion reportedly 'lacked majority support' and had 'no immediate decisions expected,' suggesting we're even further from a formal filing than I initially weighted. The NPD precedent Forecaster 3 cites is particularly damning - the Court took years and ultimately refused to ban despite finding the party's aims unconstitutional. Both forecasters' emphasis on the complete absence of any formal application is the strongest argument for updating downward.",
    "rationale": "Upon reflection, my initial 4% forecast was too high. The most important factor I insufficiently weighted was that no formal application has been filed with the Federal Constitutional Court yet. The January 30 debate was about whether to initiate proceedings, but with reported lack of majority support and no immediate action expected. For a Yes outcome by July 1, we would need: (1) Bundestag or government to file formal application in the next few days, (2) Constitutional Court to immediately accept and fast-track, (3) Court to complete full evidentiary proceedings and deliberations, and (4) Court to announce a ban - all within 8 weeks. This chain of events has zero historical precedent. Germany has banned only 2 parties in 75+ years, each taking substantial time. The 2017 NPD case demonstrates the Court's high bar and slow pace. I maintain slightly above 1% only for genuine epistemic uncertainty about unknown procedural possibilities or extraordinary security events, but the two other forecasters' analyses are more accurate. The political momentum appears insufficient, the timeline impossibly compressed, and the procedural barriers insurmountable within this timeframe.",
