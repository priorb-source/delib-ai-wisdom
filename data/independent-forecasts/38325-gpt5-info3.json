  "information": "The third estimate for Q1 2025 GDP incorporates more comprehensive source data than was available for previous estimates. This includes complete data for March on international trade in goods and services, construction spending, and manufacturers' and trade inventories. The third estimate will also incorporate updated data on federal and state government spending, as well as the results of annual benchmark revisions to trade and services data which can affect the final figures.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "About 3 weeks (BEA’s Q1 2025 GDP Third Estimate is expected in late June 2025, likely June 27).",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No — both the advance and second estimates showed a small contraction; absent sizable positive revisions, the third estimate will remain ≤0.0%.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "March trade and inventory data do not materially improve relative to what was assumed; the net exports drag and inventory drawdown remain; government spending and construction revisions are minor. The third estimate comes in slightly negative (e.g., -0.1% to -0.4%) or exactly 0.0%.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Full March data and benchmark updates add at least ~0.3–0.5 percentage points versus the advance/second estimates: a narrower March trade deficit (especially services exports), higher nonresidential construction or equipment/software investment, and/or smaller inventory drawdown. The third estimate revises to >0.0% (e.g., +0.1% to +0.4%).",
    "rationale": "Baseline: The advance estimate for Q1 2025 real GDP was -0.3% annualized. The second estimate (released end-May) remained slightly negative and close to zero. Historically, revisions from advance to third average about 0.6 percentage points in absolute terms, with sign flips from a small negative to a positive occurring but not being the base case. Because the current reading is only modestly negative, a flip to >0% requires roughly a +0.3–0.4 pp upward revision—well within historical revision ranges, but not more likely than not.\nKey revision levers into the third estimate: complete March data on trade in goods and services, construction spending, and inventories; updated federal/state spending; and some benchmark updates to trade/services. The research assistant’s note aligns with this: the third estimate will incorporate more comprehensive March source data and benchmark revisions that can move the figure.\nWhy not higher than my forecast: The status quo (advance and second both negative) deserves extra weight—most of the time, additional data do not overturn the sign. If March net exports and inventories were significantly better than assumed, we likely would have seen stronger movement already in the second estimate. Also, a print of exactly 0.0% would still resolve as No.\nWhy not lower: The print is very close to zero, and underlying domestic demand in many commentaries appeared firmer than headline GDP (inventory and trade drags). Given typical revision magnitudes, a +0.3 pp swing is plausible, so the chance of a flip to a small positive can’t be dismissed.\nWhat would move me higher: Credible previews indicating March trade (especially services) and inventory data were materially stronger than in the second estimate assumptions; indications of upward benchmark revisions to services exports or business investment.\nWhat would move me lower: Evidence that March trade deficit widened vs. assumptions, larger inventory drawdowns, or downward revisions to PCE or government spending in the comprehensive source data.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill the third estimate of Q1 2025 annualized real GDP growth show an increase?\n\nQuestion background:\nAdvisor Perspectives: [Q1 GDP Advance Estimate: Real GDP at -0.3%, Lower Than Expected](https://www.advisorperspectives.com/dshort/updates/2025/04/30/gdp-gross-domestic-product-q1-2025-advance-estimate)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if the Bureau of Economic Analysis' Gross Domestic Product, 1st Quarter 2025 (Third Estimate) release shows that real gross domestic product (GDP) increased at an annual rate greater than 0.0%.

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
