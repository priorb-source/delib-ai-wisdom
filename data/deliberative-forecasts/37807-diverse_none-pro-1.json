    "review": "The other two forecasters and I are in strong agreement on the core dynamics of this question, with all forecasts falling between 80% and 87%. The consensus is that the short timeline makes a formal policy or regulatory change that would necessitate altering the webpage nearly impossible. The main driver for a 'Yes' outcome is bureaucratic inertia. Forecaster 3 provided the most convincing argument that I had not fully weighted: the distinction between a difficult 'policy change' and an easy 'communications choice.' This highlights the primary path to a 'No' outcome—a politically motivated but simple website text change to signal a new direction without undergoing rulemaking. Forecaster 3 also correctly emphasized the 'brittleness' of the resolution criteria, where a minor editorial change from 'snack foods' to 'snacks' would resolve the question as 'No'. Forecaster 2 added another valid, albeit lower probability, risk I hadn't specified: a coincidental website reorganization that could inadvertently change the text. Both of these points convincingly argue that the likelihood of a 'No' outcome is slightly higher than I initially estimated.",
    "rationale": "I am lowering my forecast from 85% to 81%. My initial reasoning correctly identified that the short timeframe (under two months) makes a substantive policy change on SNAP eligibility impossible due to the lengthy federal rulemaking process. However, my colleagues' analyses convinced me that I underestimated the probability of a simple, non-policy-driven textual change on the USDA webpage. \n\nForecaster 3's point about a 'communications choice' is key. A new administration could easily direct a communications team to make a minor wording change on the website as a quick, symbolic gesture to signal a shift in policy priorities regarding 'junk food,' long before any actual policy could be implemented. This is an operationally simple task. The fragility of the resolution criteria, as Forecaster 3 noted, is crucial; a change from the specific phrase 'snack foods' to 'snacks' or its removal from an illustrative list would trigger a 'No' resolution. This is a much lower bar to clear than a formal policy shift. Forecaster 2's point about the possibility of an unrelated website refresh also adds a small but real probability of the text changing for purely administrative reasons.\n\nWhile I still believe bureaucratic inertia is the most powerful force here, and even minor changes to government websites can take time and multiple sign-offs, the arguments presented have persuaded me that the risk of a simple textual edit is higher than I first assessed. The 4% downward adjustment reflects this increased weighting of a text-only change occurring before July 1st.",
