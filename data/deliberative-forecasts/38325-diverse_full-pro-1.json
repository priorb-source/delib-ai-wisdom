    "review": "My initial forecast was 38%. Forecaster 2 (35%) presented a similar analysis, balancing the historical 35-40% likelihood of a positive revision against the typically small size of second-to-third estimate revisions. Forecaster 3 (30%) provided the most compelling new argument, which has caused me to update my view. They correctly pointed out that the 35-40% statistic applies to the period from the advance estimate, and now that we are at the second estimate, we should focus on the second-to-third revision distribution. The required upward revision of 0.3 percentage points is larger than the typical 0.1-0.2 point revision seen at this stage, which strongly argues for a lower probability than the initial 35-40% range.",
    "rationale": "I am lowering my forecast from 38% to 33%. I was persuaded by Forecaster 3's sharp analysis that my initial forecast was too anchored to the historical data associated with the advance estimate. The most pertinent fact now is that the required revision from the second estimate of -0.2% to a positive number (+0.3 percentage points) is larger than the typical absolute revision of 0.1 to 0.2 percentage points between the second and third estimates. This makes a positive outcome a statistically less likely event than the original 35-40% base rate would suggest. I am revising downward to reflect this higher bar. However, I am not going as low as 30% because I place slightly more weight than Forecaster 3 seems to on two offsetting factors: 1) The 'positive momentum' of the revision from -0.3% to -0.2% is a real, albeit small, signal. 2) The primary driver of the negative print was a massive, -4.90 percentage point drag from imports, an exceptionally volatile component. The third estimate incorporates more complete trade data and annual benchmark revisions, creating a fatter tail for a potential large, one-off revision that corrects this initial noise. My new forecast of 33% discounts the initial base rate due to the high bar for revision but keeps the probability from falling further due to the specific, volatile composition of Q1 GDP.",
