    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Approximately 3 weeks, with the report expected on June 27, 2025.",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No. While consumer sentiment has recently plunged, a level below 54.0 is historically rare and indicative of a severe economic shock. Barring a new negative catalyst in the next three weeks, the index is more likely to stabilize or remain above this low threshold.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "The economic data released in June, particularly the May CPI report and weekly jobless claims, do not show a significant further deterioration of the economy. Consumers begin to digest the factors that caused the May sentiment drop, leading to a stabilization or modest rebound in confidence, keeping the final June index at or above 54.0.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "A significant negative shock occurs in early-to-mid June, such as a surprisingly high inflation report, a sharp rise in unemployment, or a major sell-off in financial markets. This event would compound existing consumer anxieties, sending the sentiment index into a free-fall to a level below the 54.0 threshold.",
    "rationale": "My forecast is based on the historically low threshold of 54.0 for the University of Michigan Consumer Sentiment index. A reading below this level has typically been associated with severe economic downturns or acute crises, such as the 2008 financial crisis or the peak inflation scare of mid-2022. The background information indicates a recent 'plunge' in sentiment, signaling a fragile consumer outlook and heightened downside risks. The information from my research assistant that no additional information was available has been noted. The status quo, even in a weakened state, is likely not dire enough to push the index below 54.0. For that to occur, a new and significant negative economic or geopolitical shock would likely need to materialize within the next three weeks before the final survey data is collected. My probability is not lower than 30% because the recent plunge suggests sentiment is volatile and vulnerable to bad news. An unexpectedly high inflation report or a sudden weakening in the labor market could easily push the index into the low 50s. My probability is not higher than 30% because, in the absence of a new shock, economic conditions and consumer sentiment tend to exhibit inertia. A second consecutive massive drop in the index is a low-probability event. I would increase the probability of a 'Yes' outcome if the preliminary June sentiment report (released mid-month) is well below 60, or if we see a sharp spike in jobless claims or gas prices. Conversely, I would decrease the probability if the preliminary report shows stabilization.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill the June 2025 University of Michigan Consumer Sentiment Final Report number be less than 54.0?\n\nQuestion background:\nAxios: [Why the consumer sentiment plunge is different now](https://www.axios.com/2025/05/19/tariffs-consumer-economy-sentiment)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if the University of Michigan's reported June Final Results of the Index of Consumer Sentiment, expected to be posted [here](https://data.sca.isr.umich.edu/reports.php) on the final Friday of June 2025, is less than 54.0 for June 2025. Greater than or equal to that amount resolves the question as **No**.\n\n\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nNo additional information available.\n\nToday is 2025-06-04.\n\nBefore answering you think:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n(e) You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
