  "information": "North Korea has conducted six nuclear tests, with the last one occurring in September 2017. The current gap of over seven and a half years is the longest interval between tests. According to South Korea's National Intelligence Service (NIS), the tunnels at the Punggye-ri test site are maintained in an operational condition. The U.S. State Department also assesses that the site remains capable of supporting a seventh test. The IAEA has warned about an 'exponential' expansion of North Korea's nuclear program and ongoing plutonium production at the Yongbyon facility. However, analysis of satellite imagery by the think tank 38 North shows no new tunneling activity at Punggye-ri, and there are no public reports of specific preparations such as equipment movement or other logistical arrangements that would typically precede a test.\n\nIn late April 2025, North Korea conducted the first weapons system tests for its new 5,000-ton 'Choe Hyon-class' destroyer. The tests, observed by leader Kim Jong Un, included the launch of supersonic cruise missiles, strategic cruise missiles, and anti-aircraft missiles. The warship is expected to be delivered to the navy and enter service in early 2026. Earlier in 2025, North Korea conducted several other weapons tests. In April, it tested the 'Haeil-2' underwater attack drone. In February, it test-launched strategic cruise missiles. In January, it conducted its first missile test of the year, firing an intermediate-range ballistic missile with a hypersonic glide vehicle.\n\nNorth Korean leader Kim Jong Un has repeatedly called for strengthening the country's strategic forces. Following the destroyer weapon tests in April 2025, he stated, 'The time has come for North Korea's navy to choose to accelerate nuclear armament.' In January 2025, he said the country's nuclear weapons development program would continue 'indefinitely.' In February 2025, the US, South Korea, and Japan issued a joint statement confirming their trilateral partnership and calling for North Korea's complete nuclear disarmament, pledging to strengthen sanctions enforcement. The European Union condemned North Korea's ballistic missile launch in January 2025, calling it a violation of UN Security Council resolutions.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "61 days (until July 1, 2025)",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No nuclear test occurs. North Korea continues the current 7.5+ year gap since its last nuclear test in September 2017, the longest interval in its nuclear testing history.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "North Korea continues its pattern of conventional weapons testing (cruise missiles, ballistic missiles, naval vessels) without escalating to nuclear testing. Despite Kim Jong Un's rhetoric about accelerating nuclear armament, the regime maintains its nuclear deterrent capability without conducting a test, likely due to concerns about international sanctions, potential military responses, or simply not seeing strategic value in testing on this specific timeline.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "North Korea rapidly prepares and conducts its seventh nuclear test at the Punggye-ri site within the next two months. This could be triggered by a geopolitical crisis, as a demonstration of resolve following Kim Jong Un's recent statements about accelerating nuclear armament, or as a strategic response to the US-ROK-Japan trilateral partnership announced in February 2025.",
    "rationale": "The status quo strongly favors no test occurring. The current 7.5+ year gap since September 2017 is unprecedented - more than double the longest previous gap (4 years between 2009-2013). This dramatic change in pattern suggests a fundamental shift in North Korea's testing strategy.\n\nKey evidence against a test: (1) No visible preparations at Punggye-ri according to 38 North satellite analysis - nuclear tests require extensive preparation that would typically be detected; (2) No reports of equipment movement or logistical activities that precede tests; (3) Only 61 days remaining until the deadline; (4) The established pattern break suggests testing is no longer routine.\n\nKey evidence for a test: (1) Kim Jong Un's recent strong rhetoric about 'accelerating nuclear armament' and continuing development 'indefinitely'; (2) Test site confirmed operational by US State Department and South Korean NIS; (3) IAEA warnings about nuclear program expansion; (4) Active conventional weapons testing shows military development continues; (5) North Korea has historically surprised observers.\n\nHowever, rhetoric doesn't always translate to immediate action, especially on a constrained timeline. Nuclear tests are major geopolitical events requiring significant coordination. The absence of detected preparations with only two months remaining is the decisive factor. While North Korea could theoretically accelerate preparations and conduct a surprise test, the complete lack of observable indicators makes this unlikely in such a short timeframe.\n\nMy forecast would be higher (25-30%) if we had 6+ months remaining or if there were any reports of preparations. It would be lower (3-5%) if diplomatic engagement were occurring or if the gap had extended to 10+ years. The combination of strong rhetoric but zero observable preparations in a short timeframe leads to my forecast.",
