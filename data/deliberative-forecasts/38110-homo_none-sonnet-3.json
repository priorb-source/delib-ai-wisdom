    "review": "Both forecasters provided valuable historical context - particularly the precedent of Nigeria's 2019-2020 border closure with Benin lasting over a year, and the potential role of ECOWAS mediation. However, both appear to have made a critical calculation error. They state 'about 1 month remains' and 'just one month' respectively, but today is May 31, 2025 and the resolution date is July 1, 2025 - that's ONE DAY, not one month. This substantially changes the probability calculation. Their forecasts of 15% and 20% might be reasonable for a one-month timeframe, but with only 24 hours (or less) remaining, these estimates seem far too high. The historical precedent they cite actually reinforces a lower probability - if the 2019-2020 closure lasted over a year for similar issues (smuggling), a closure motivated by terrorism and arms smuggling is unlikely to resolve within a single day. Their mention of ECOWAS intervention is interesting but unrealistic within this timeframe.",
    "rationale": "Upon reflection, the other forecasters' analyses strengthen my conviction in a very low probability. The historical precedent they raised - Nigeria's 2019-2020 border closure with Benin lasting over a year for smuggling concerns - is particularly relevant and argues for an even lower forecast than I initially gave. If a smuggling-related closure took over a year to resolve, one involving active terrorism (Mahmuda group) and arms smuggling is even less likely to resolve within 24 hours. The serious security nature of these issues (not just trade disputes) means governments will be especially cautious about reopening. With literally one day remaining until July 1, 2025, there would need to be either: (1) a reopening that has already occurred but not yet been reported, or (2) an announcement today of immediate reopening. Both scenarios are possible but extremely unlikely given no signals whatsoever of progress. I'm adjusting my forecast down slightly from 3% to 2% to reflect the historical precedent showing these closures persist for extended periods.",
