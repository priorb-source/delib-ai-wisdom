    "review": "Both analyses track my priors: no concrete May trigger and strategic value in ambiguity. Forecaster 2 adds the tactical logic of keeping successors sidelined and opponents guessing, and keys on the absence of a May congress—a useful diagnostic. Forecaster 3 emphasizes base rates/timing (4–5 months out) and age/health as dampeners, which slightly strengthens the case against an early declaration. Neither introduces hard news or a scheduled RHDP event in May, but their framing of timing norms and incentives is consistent and marginally pushes me lower.",
    "rationale": "My initial 35% rested on the possibility of a May RHDP gathering creating a declaration moment. With no evidence of such an event and persuasive arguments that June or later aligns better with Ivorian practice (e.g., Ouattara’s August 2020 reversal), the status quo path is No by June 1. The bar for a Yes is a clear, scheduled May forum where he explicitly accepts the nomination; mere hints or “calls” without an explicit acceptance likely won’t meet the declaration threshold. I still leave meaningful weight for a coordinated show-of-force announcement if RHDP wants to preempt opposition momentum, but base rates and incentives favor delay. I’m nudging down modestly to reflect this, not drastically, given the inherent unpredictability of elite signaling in Côte d’Ivoire and incumbency advantages.",
