    "review": "Both forecasters present compelling analyses that closely align with my initial reasoning. Forecaster 3 raises an excellent point I overlooked: the Easter timing in April 2025 (versus late March 2024) could create upside pressure on travel and recreation prices, with potential seasonal adjustment complications. This is a concrete, calendar-specific risk factor. However, Forecaster 3 correctly notes this is likely already incorporated into the 2.1% consensus forecast by professional economists. Both forecasters also emphasize a critical distinction I should have made more explicit: 'above 2.2%' means we need ≥2.3%, requiring a +0.2 percentage point surprise from consensus—at the high end of typical historical forecast errors. Their convergence at 25% versus my 28% suggests I may have assigned slightly too much weight to the proximity to the threshold (March's 2.2%) and insufficient weight to the magnitude of the required surprise from a well-established consensus.",
    "rationale": "After reviewing both analyses, I'm updating my forecast modestly downward. The key factors driving this adjustment: (1) The resolution threshold requires ≥2.3%, not just exceeding 2.2%, which means we need a meaningful +0.2pp positive surprise from the 2.1% consensus—this is more significant than I initially weighted. (2) While Easter timing creates genuine upside risk, consensus forecasters would have incorporated this into their models. (3) The disinflationary momentum is particularly strong with multiple reinforcing factors (weak economy, decelerating wages, negative energy contribution). However, I'm not moving all the way to 25% because: (1) March's 2.2% print shows some stickiness at the threshold level, and month-to-month volatility exists. (2) Services inflation (+1.56pp contributor) remains elevated and could surprise. (3) A small probability mass should be assigned to measurement uncertainty and unexpected price developments. The 25-28% range appears appropriate, with 26% representing a balanced view that acknowledges both the strong disinflationary case and the non-trivial upside risks from services stickiness and Easter effects.",
