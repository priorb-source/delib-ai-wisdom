    "review": "Both forecasters cover the same main drivers I identified: (1) licenses and political will are in place; (2) ISL backhaul reduces need for a local gateway; (3) the key remaining gating item is BTRC approval of tariffs/consumer terms; (4) status quo inertia and administrative friction could push into July; (5) the U.S. Senate probe marginally increases caution/optics risk rather than imposing a hard block. Forecaster 3’s emphasis that “anywhere” in-country counts is correct, but in practice the map flips when consumer orders/pricing go live, not for quiet enterprise/government trials—so that doesn’t materially increase odds. Neither forecaster introduced decisive new evidence beyond what I had; their arguments are largely aligned with mine.",
    "rationale": "Time remaining is ~6.5 weeks (to July 1). Post-license-to-availability timelines vary widely; Bangladesh would be on the fast end if it flips by then, but it’s feasible given explicit government support, two 10‑year licenses granted April 30, prior trial, and technical readiness via ISL. The principal uncertainty is regulatory finish-work: tariff/price approval and any consumer protection filings, plus potential device type approval/tax handling and customs/logistics. These can take weeks and may be affected by normal administrative pacing and June holidays. The Senate probe is unlikely to halt activation but could make both sides slightly more procedural, nudging timelines to the right. Netting these, I still see a modest edge toward Yes, but the distribution’s right tail and current lack of visible tariff approval keep me from moving higher. No material new information from the other forecasters changes that balance, so I keep my estimate unchanged. Signals that would move me up: confirmed BTRC tariff approval, published Bangladesh pricing, order page acceptance, or shipment reports. Down: public delay on tariffs or new conditions (e.g., gateway requirement) or official slippage into July.",
