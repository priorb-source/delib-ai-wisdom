  "information": "Since April 2025, the United States and Iran have engaged in multiple rounds of indirect negotiations, mediated by Oman. The talks have been held in Muscat, Oman, and Rome, Italy, with the most recent fourth round taking place in Muscat on May 11. A fifth round of negotiations has been agreed upon. Both sides have described the discussions with terms such as 'constructive,' 'productive,' and 'difficult but useful,' with an Iranian official stating that the parties' positions have 'converged' and 'progress has been made.' In parallel, Iran is also scheduled to hold talks with the 'Euratrium'—the UK, France, and Germany—in Istanbul. The negotiations are proceeding under a deadline reportedly set by President Trump in March, which gave Iran two months to reach an agreement.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Approximately one and a half months.",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No new nuclear deal is reached. The United States maintains its sanctions regime, and Iran continues its nuclear program activities without the constraints of a new agreement.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Despite progress, negotiators cannot bridge the gap on critical issues, such as the extent of sanctions relief or the verification mechanisms. Domestic pressure from hardliners in both Washington and Tehran forces one or both sides to walk away from the table, and the talks are suspended indefinitely without an agreement.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Building on the momentum of the recent talks in Muscat, a fifth round of negotiations quickly finalizes the remaining details of an agreement. The deal, which likely involves a cap on Iran's enrichment in exchange for specific economic sanctions relief, is formally announced in a joint statement before the July 1st deadline.",
    "rationale": "My forecast of 70% is based on the convergence of several strong positive indicators. The status quo in US-Iran relations is 'no deal', which provides a cautious baseline. However, the evidence provided indicates a significant departure from this status quo. The research report highlights that multiple rounds of serious, indirect negotiations have occurred, with officials using positive language like 'constructive' and 'progress has been made.' The scheduling of a fifth round signals sustained commitment from both sides. This level of diplomatic activity is a prerequisite for any agreement and suggests genuine political will exists to reach one. The most compelling piece of evidence is the reported two-month deadline set by President Trump in March. With today being May 15, this deadline is imminent, creating immense pressure to finalize a deal now rather than engage in protracted negotiations. This timing strongly supports the likelihood of a resolution before July 1. Furthermore, the external report from Israeli media suggests a 'high chance' of a deal, which serves as strong external validation from a key, well-informed regional actor. My probability is not higher because these are incredibly complex negotiations where failure is always a significant risk. A last-minute disagreement on technical details or successful sabotage by domestic hardliners in either country could easily derail the process. The indirect nature of the talks also adds a layer of friction and potential for misunderstanding. My probability is not lower because ignoring the sheer volume of positive signals—the frequency of talks, the optimistic (if cautious) language, the imminent deadline, and external intelligence assessments—would be an oversight. To increase my forecast, I would need to see news of direct talks or a leak of specific, agreed-upon terms. My forecast would decrease if the upcoming fifth round of talks were to be cancelled or if influential political figures in either country publicly came out in strong opposition to the emerging deal.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill the United States and Iran announce a new nuclear deal before July 1, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nIsraeli media (Hebrew): [Senior ministers were informed: There is a high chance that the US and Iran will reach an agreement](https://www.kan.org.il/content/kan-news/politic/895178/)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if the US and Iran sign or announce an agreement with respect to Iran's nuclear program.\n\n\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nSince April 2025, the United States and Iran have engaged in multiple rounds of indirect negotiations, mediated by Oman.

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
