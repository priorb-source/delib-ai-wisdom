    "review": "Both forecasters emphasize base rates, the short timeline, and Fetterman’s explicit statement that he won’t resign. I find this persuasive. Forecaster 2 added specifics I hadn’t incorporated (e.g., roughly 30 missed votes and a 2024 staff email warning), but these mainly raise general concern rather than indicating an imminent caucus break. Forecaster 3’s comparison to Manchin/Sinema-style friction without caucus exit is apt, and their point about the political risk of a switch for a Pennsylvania Democrat is strong. Overall, their arguments reinforce the status quo path and suggest my initial 8% was a touch high for a 1-month window absent concrete signals of negotiations or a health crisis.",
    "rationale": "The decision to cease caucusing is a high-cost, high-salience move that typically comes with public signaling and committee considerations; we have no such concrete signs. The time remaining (~1 month) and Fetterman’s on-record statement that he won’t resign further suppress odds. Party switches are rare events and generally telegraphed. While the current friction, staff turmoil, and GOP outreach create a non-zero tail risk (including a low-probability health shock leading to resignation), the most likely outcome is continuation of the status quo at least through June. Given the others’ base-rate framing and absence of imminent indicators (active negotiations, public break with Schumer, or Democratic sanctions), I’m nudging my estimate down slightly. I would move up if credible reporting emerges of him exploring independence or GOP committee arrangements, or if Democrats formally sanction him; I would move down if he publicly reaffirms caucusing or visibly re-engages with the caucus.",
