    "no_outcome_scenario": "A model from a competitor (such as Anthropic's Claude, Google's Gemini, or another AI lab) is ranked #1 on the leaderboard when checked on July 1, 2025, with no OpenAI models sharing that top position",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "An OpenAI model (such as GPT-4o, GPT-4 Turbo, or a newer variant) maintains or achieves the #1 overall rank on the Chatbot Arena Leaderboard through the end of Q2 2025, either alone or tied with other models",
    "rationale": "With only 16 days remaining until resolution, this is fundamentally a question about the likely current state of the leaderboard, as significant changes are unlikely in such a short timeframe. Major leaderboard movements typically require new model releases, which are infrequent events requiring months of development. Historically, OpenAI has been highly competitive on the Chatbot Arena Leaderboard, with GPT-4 variants consistently ranking near the top. However, the competition has intensified with strong models from Anthropic (Claude 3/3.5 series) and Google (Gemini). The key uncertainty is the actual current state as of June 15, 2025, which I cannot observe. The extremely short time horizon strongly favors the status quo - whatever is #1 now is very likely to remain #1 in 16 days. Given OpenAI's historical strength and market position, there's a reasonable probability they currently hold the top spot. However, the intense competition means this is far from certain - Claude and Gemini models have been formidable competitors. My forecast would be higher if I had confirmation that an OpenAI model currently holds #1, and lower if I knew a competitor held that position. I'd update higher with news of a very recent OpenAI model release performing exceptionally well, or lower with news of a competitor's model dominating recent benchmarks.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill an OpenAI model be ranked #1 overall on the Chatbot Arena Leaderboard at the end of the 2nd Quarter of 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nMethodology: [Chatbot Arena: An Open Platform for Evaluating LLMs by Human Preference](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.04132)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if a model owned by OpenAI is in the number 1 overall rank (ties count) at the [Chatbot Arena Leaderboard](https://lmarena.ai/leaderboard) when accessed by Metaculus on or after July 1, 2025. If this is not the case, this question resolves as **No**.\n\nScroll down to Arena Overview and the resolution is based on the \"overall\" rank.\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nNo additional information available.\n\nToday is 2025-06-15.\n\nBefore answering you think:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n(e) You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
