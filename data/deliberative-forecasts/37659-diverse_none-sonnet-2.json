    "review": "Forecaster 2 provides critical new information: the tracker contains 2,137 total objectives, making 120 only 5.6% of the total (far lower than my assumed 15-25%). This substantially changes the calculation and makes the target more achievable than I initially thought. Forecaster 2's point about Project 2025 being explicitly designed for rapid executive implementation is well-taken. However, I'm skeptical of the 60% forecast given the continued uncertainty about current baseline.\n\nForecaster 3's 30% aligns closely with my initial thinking and appropriately emphasizes baseline uncertainty. However, their concern about administration alignment seems misplaced - we're clearly in a Trump administration period (started Jan 2025), and Project 2025 is a conservative blueprint, so alignment exists. This reduces one source of uncertainty they're worried about.\n\nBoth forecasters make valid points about tracker lag and evidentiary standards. The tension between 'announced' vs 'successfully implemented' remains significant.",
    "rationale": "The most important update from deliberation is learning that 120 represents only 5.6% of 2,137 total objectives - significantly more achievable than I initially estimated. This warrants an upward revision.\n\nSupporting an increase: (1) Lower percentage threshold makes target more realistic; (2) We're 4 months into an administration with 6.5 weeks remaining - sufficient time for substantial early implementation; (3) Project 2025 explicitly designed for rapid executive action; (4) Many objectives likely achievable via executive orders, appointments, and regulatory changes; (5) Administration-agenda alignment is clear.\n\nMaintaining caution: (1) Current baseline remains completely unknown - could be at 50 or 90, which dramatically affects probability; (2) 'Done' standard likely requires actual implementation, not just announcement; (3) Legal challenges can prevent completion; (4) Tracker maintainers from Keep_Track subreddit may apply rigorous standards; (5) Even 0.74 objectives/day is an aggressive sustained pace.\n\nI'm updating from 35% to 43%. The new information about total objectives is significant enough to warrant meaningful upward revision, but baseline uncertainty prevents me from going as high as Forecaster 2's 60%. If we knew the current count was >80, I'd move to 60-70%. If it's <50, I'd stay near 30%.",
