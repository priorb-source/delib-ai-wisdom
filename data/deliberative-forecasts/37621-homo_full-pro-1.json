    "review": "All three forecasters have identified the same core tension: the significant institutional momentum for a ban, driven by the NFL Commissioner and league office, versus the high procedural hurdle of a 24-vote supermajority. We all agree on the key variables: the baseline of 16 votes for the ban, the strategic reframing of the proposal to be more general, and the primary counterargument being the lack of concrete injury data. Forecaster 2 made a particularly cogent point by framing the league office's support as something that 'rarely fails to achieve its desired outcomes.' This qualitative argument, based on historical precedent of the league's power dynamics, is a strong piece of evidence that I had not weighed heavily enough. Forecaster 3's analysis, arriving at the same 65% as my initial forecast, provides validation for the baseline reasoning, but Forecaster 2's point about the league's institutional power is what I find most persuasive for an update.",
    "rationale": "My initial analysis focused on the difficulty of flipping eight votes in a short period. While this remains the most significant obstacle to a 'Yes' outcome, the deliberation has convinced me to place more weight on the influence of the league's leadership. As Forecaster 2 pointed out, when the Commissioner, league office, and Competition Committee are all aligned on a high-profile rule change, they typically succeed. The decision to table the vote and quickly bring it back with a revised, more politically palatable proposal is a strong signal that the league office is actively and confidently whipping the necessary votes. This is not just a casual re-vote; it's a concerted push. The aesthetic argument ('feels more like rugby') from the Commissioner often overrides data-driven counterarguments in NFL rule-making history. Therefore, I now believe the probability of the league successfully lobbying the remaining eight owners is higher than I first estimated. I am increasing my forecast by 5 percentage points to reflect this increased confidence in the power of the league's institutional will.",
