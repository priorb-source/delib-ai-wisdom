    "review": "Both add useful, tightening signals against a near-term delisting. Forecaster 2 introduces key new public cues I hadn’t incorporated: SecState Rubio’s on-record denial, Burgum’s opposition, and reporting that Trump is weighing much tougher Russia energy measures (e.g., 500% tariffs). Those are strong, near-term political constraints that make a reversal costly and unlikely. Forecaster 3 usefully emphasizes EU disinterest in reviving NS2, ongoing EU sanctions work, and NS2 AG’s legal/financial impairments (German court rulings, Swiss moratorium, and physical damage), all of which further reduce the payoff to delisting. I find both sets of arguments convincing; they reinforce the inertia and raise the political cost without creating offsetting benefits. The combination of explicit denials, hawkish policy drift, and short runway argues for a lower probability than my initial 15%.",
    "rationale": "The window to July 1 is short, and the administration now appears to be signaling tougher, not looser, Russia energy policy. Public denials from senior officials and talk of expanded measures (tariffs/sanctions) raise the bar for any delisting. Meanwhile, allied and market incentives to revive NS2 are weak, and NS2 AG’s operational/legal status limits any practical gains from delisting. These factors push me below my prior 15%. I still keep a small tail for a diplomatic trade tied to a Ukraine framework where delisting NS2 AG is used as a symbolic concession; the executive can move OFAC quickly if a decision is made. But absent credible, imminent-sounding signals (e.g., coordinated leaks, formal review announcements, allied buy-in), the base case remains No. Updating down to reflect the new political signals and short timeline.",
