    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Approximately 40 days until outcome is determined. June 2025 begins in 10 days, runs for 30 days, and the outcome will be checked on or after July 1, 2025.",
    "status_quo_outcome": "The status quo suggests a Yes outcome is more likely than not. Historical data shows cube-shaped UFO sightings do occur regularly at NUFORC, with December 2024 having 6 such reports (though noted as rare).",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "No cube-shaped UFO sightings are reported to NUFORC during June 2025. This could occur if witnesses don't observe any cube-shaped objects, observers don't submit reports, or submissions are delayed or categorized under different shapes.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "At least one person observes and reports a cube-shaped UFO/UAP to NUFORC during June 2025, and the report is processed and posted to their database with the cube shape designation by July 1, 2025 or shortly thereafter.",
    "rationale": "The question requires only ONE cube-shaped sighting in June 2025, setting a relatively low bar. Key considerations: (1) December 2024 had 6 cube-shaped sightings despite being described as 'rare,' indicating these reports do occur but are uncommon relative to other shapes. (2) NUFORC has processed 180,000+ reports over 50 years, suggesting active ongoing reporting. (3) June is a summer month in the Northern Hemisphere, when UFO sightings typically increase due to better weather and more people outdoors. (4) The binary nature of the question (only needs ≥1 sighting) works in favor of Yes. The forecast is not higher (80-90%) because 'rare' explicitly indicates cube shapes are uncommon, meaning some months likely have zero such reports. The forecast is not lower (40-50%) because December's 6 reports demonstrate these sightings do occur regularly enough, and requiring just one sighting is a low threshold. To update higher, I'd need data showing most months have at least some cube sightings. To update lower, I'd need evidence that cube sightings occur only a few times per year, making any given month unlikely.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill the National UFO Reporting Center report a sighting of a cube-shaped UFO in June 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nAccording to the [National UFO Reporting Center](https://nuforc.org/about-us/): \"The National UFO Reporting Center was founded in 1974 by noted UFO investigator Robert J. Gribble. The Center’s primary function over the past five decades has been to receive, record, and to the greatest degree possible, corroborate and document reports from individuals who have been witness to unusual, possibly UFO-related events. Throughout its history, the Center has processed over 180,000 reports, and has distributed its information to thousands of individuals.\"\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if The National UFO Reporting Center posts a report of a sighting of a UFO/UAP shaped like a cube in June 2025 at [this link](https://nuforc.org/ndx/?id=event) when accessed by Metaculus on or after July 1, 2025.\n\nFor example, although rare in the history of NUFORC, the month of December 2024 [had](https://nuforc.org/subndx/?id=e202412) six sightings with a cube shape.\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nNo additional information available.\n\nToday is 2025-05-21.\n\nBefore answering you think:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n(e) You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
