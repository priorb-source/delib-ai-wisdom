  "information": "Sheikh Hasina has been in exile in India since being ousted from power in August 2024. In statements made in February 2025, she vowed to return to Bangladesh, accusing the interim government of unleashing terrorists and promising to seek justice. Legally, she faces multiple challenges. Bangladesh's International Crimes Tribunal (ICT) has issued her a show-cause notice in a contempt of court case, with a response required by May 15, 2025. Additionally, a separate ICT investigation into alleged crimes against humanity committed during the July 2024 uprising is reportedly in its final stages, with a probe report expected to be submitted within May 2025.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "54 days until July 1, 2025",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No - Sheikh Hasina remains in exile in India",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Sheikh Hasina continues her exile in India, choosing not to risk arrest and trial for crimes against humanity. India does not extradite her, and she awaits legal and political developments from the safety of her current location, possibly missing the May 15 court deadline while remaining abroad.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Sheikh Hasina makes a dramatic return to Bangladesh, either to face charges directly and mobilize her political base, or she is extradited by India under pressure. Alternatively, she negotiates some form of security arrangement or decides that remaining politically relevant requires physical presence despite the risks.",
    "rationale": "The status quo strongly favors her remaining in India. She has been in exile for 9 months since August 2024 and currently faces serious legal jeopardy, including an ongoing crimes against humanity investigation with a probe report expected in May 2025. Historical precedent shows political leaders rarely return from exile when facing serious criminal charges without negotiated settlements, which there's no evidence of here. The security risks from the uprising that ousted her remain significant. While she publicly vowed to return in February 2025, such statements are common from exiled leaders but rarely lead to immediate action. The May 15 court deadline creates some pressure, but missing a deadline while in exile is far less consequential than returning to face arrest. India appears to be providing safe haven with no indication of pressure for her to leave. The factors preventing a lower forecast: the 54-day timeframe allows for rapid political developments, her public commitment creates some obligation, and bold political moves can't be entirely discounted. The factors preventing a higher forecast: no concrete signs of return preparations, substantial legal and security barriers, and the strong baseline that exiled leaders facing prosecution typically remain abroad. I would update higher if there were signs of negotiations, security guarantees, or pressure from India. I would update lower if arrest warrants were issued or India granted extended asylum.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill Sheikh Hasina return to Bangladesh before July 1, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nFirstpost: [Bangladesh has turned into a ‘terrorist country’: Sheikh Hasina targets Yunus, vows to return](https://www.firstpost.com/world/bangladesh-has-turned-into-a-terrorist-country-sheikh-hasina-targets-yunus-vows-to-return-13878191.html)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below.

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
