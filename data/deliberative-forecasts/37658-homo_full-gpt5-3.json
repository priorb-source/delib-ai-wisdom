    "review": "Both forecasters sharpened the key hinge: whether a formal, enforceable presidential/CFIUS prohibition actually takes effect around June 18 without a stay. I hadn’t explicitly integrated the 8‑K four‑business‑day timing nuance (Forecaster 3) — that matters for this specific resolution and slightly tempers the odds. I also agree with the emphasis (both F2 and F3) on courts’ deference to national‑security determinations and the historical pattern of rapid terminations after adverse CFIUS outcomes. Where I remain more cautious than F3 is on two points: (1) the factual uncertainty over whether there is a signed, enforceable order that compels abandonment on/after June 18; and (2) the non‑trivial chance of an emergency stay or procedural relief that pushes termination (and thus the 8‑K) into July or later. F2’s note that if the “official block” premise is wrong, probabilities drop materially is important. Overall, their arguments justify moving up from my initial 30%, but not to the mid‑60s given the uncertainties and filing‑timing wrinkle.",
    "rationale": "I now frame the outcome as two branches: \n- Enforceable prohibition effective ~June 18 with no stay (probability moderate, courts deferential). Conditional on that, a quick termination and 8‑K in late June is likely. \n- No enforceable prohibition by then (either no formal order or a stay). Conditional on that, the parties’ incentives and ongoing litigation make a pre‑July 1 termination unlikely.\n\nBack‑of‑envelope: assume ~55–60% that an enforceable order is in effect and not stayed by June 18; conditional probability of a June 18–25 termination with an 8‑K before July 1 at ~75–85%; plus a small tail (~5–10%) that the parties terminate anyway before July 1 without such an order. That yields roughly mid‑40s to low‑50s. I land below Forecaster 3 because of: (i) residual uncertainty about the existence/terms of a formal order; (ii) non‑zero stay risk; and (iii) the 8‑K filing window potentially slipping if termination occurs very late in June.\n\nChange from prior: Up from 30% to 48% due to (a) stronger weight on courts’ deference and historical speed of post‑CFIUS terminations and (b) the explicit June 18 enforcement inflection, while (c) incorporating the 8‑K timing constraint keeps me below 50%.",
