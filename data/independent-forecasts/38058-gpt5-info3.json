  "information": "The discussions around U.S. tariff policy have had observable economic effects. President Trump's announcement to delay the EU tariffs led to a positive shift in market sentiment and a surge in U.S. stock futures. In early April 2025, after the signing of an executive order for a 10% 'minimum benchmark tariff', there were reports of U.S. consumers stockpiling goods in anticipation of price increases. According to an estimate by the Tax Foundation, the proposed tariffs could cost U.S. households an additional $830 in 2025, reduce the nation's GDP by 0.4%, and result in the loss of 350,000 jobs.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "At most ~35 days (until July 1, 2025). It could resolve sooner if there is a qualifying day with no “tariff(s)” on either front page.",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No — so far in this window there hasn’t been a qualifying day, and tariff-related news remains highly salient.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Tariff(s) appears on at least one of the NYT or WSJ digital print front pages every day through June 30, driven by ongoing policy steps (implementation details, court fights, foreign retaliation, market reactions), with WSJ’s “What’s News” or NYT front-page decks repeatedly using the word.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "On at least one day before July, both papers’ front pages focus on other stories (e.g., a major domestic or international event), and any trade coverage either moves inside or avoids the exact word “tariff(s)” (using synonyms like “duties”/“levies”), resulting in no “tariff(s)” on either front page that day.",
    "rationale": "Framing: This resolves Yes if there is any single day with zero instances of “tariff”/“tariffs” on both front pages. Over a 5-week window, even modest per‑day chances of omission compound into a substantial chance of at least one qualifying day. Countervailing this, current coverage is unusually tariff-heavy. Evidence: The research assistant notes an April EO for a 10% minimum tariff, consumer stockpiling, and material macro estimates (Tax Foundation: ~$830/household, -0.4% GDP, -350k jobs). There have also been discrete news beats (e.g., tariff delays for the EU) that keep the term newsworthy. Early in the window (post–May 19), the criterion has not yet been satisfied, suggesting at least one of the two papers has featured “tariff(s)” each day so far, consistent with elevated salience. Base-rate logic: It is hard for both papers to include the exact word every single day for another ~35 days, given normal news diversification and limited front-page space. A simple day-by-day model: if the per-day probability that both omit is low but non-zero (~3%), the chance of at least one qualifying day over 35 days is about 65%. Correlation considerations: Mentions are positively correlated across papers (same news cycle), which increases the odds of both including on big tariff days, but also allows for both omitting on non-tariff days; net, correlation does not eliminate the probability of at least one clean day over a month-plus. Why not higher: The status quo trend is persistent tariff prominence, plus WSJ’s “What’s News” often carries brief tariff bullets; upcoming implementation steps, foreign responses, litigation, and political debate can sustain the exact word “tariff(s)” on front pages most days. Why not lower: Achieving No requires effectively zero clean days across both papers for five weeks — a very demanding bar given shifting news priorities and editors’ occasional use of synonyms or different angles. What would move me up: A week or more of consecutive days (into early/mid June) where both papers still carry “tariff(s)” on their front pages, or announced stepwise policy actions (e.g., phased implementation calendars) that reliably generate daily front-page mentions. What would move me down: A lull in policy action, a dominating non-trade news cycle (major crisis, landmark court rulings, elections), or evidence that one paper is consistently using synonyms instead of the word “tariff(s)” on its front page.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill the word \"tariff\" disappear from the front pages of The New York Times and Wall Street Journal before July 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nWhether reading the newspaper or social media or watching the news, it is highly likely you are going to see something about tariffs - mainly due to US President Donald Trump's [renewed love](https://www.france24.com/en/live-news/20250401-tariff-man-trump-s-long-history-with-trade-wars) for this somewhat antiquated form of taxation.\r\n\r\nThe New York Times and the Wall Street Journal are two of the largest print newspapers in the US. Before July, will we see tariffs wiped from the front pages of both papers?\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question will resolve as **Yes** if, on any single day after May 19, 2025 and before July 1, 2025, the words \"tariff\" or \"tariffs\" appear on neither the digital version of the front page of The New York Times nor the Wall Street Journal.

Format is: yyyy-mm-dd.</sup>\n\n* Grammar or spelling will not prevent a **No** resolution.\r\n* \"Tariff(s)\" must be omitted from both papers' front pages on the same day.\r\n* \"Tariff(s)\" can appear anywhere on the page, including \"Pages A2-A3 and Corrections\", \"What's News: Business & Finance\" not just the initial section at the top. The only sections that do not qualify are those that do not change between different front pages such as the \"Most Popular News\" or \"Recommended Videos\" sections on WSJ.\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nThe discussions around U.S. tariff policy have had observable economic effects.

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
