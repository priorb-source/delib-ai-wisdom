  "information": "Following his election win on April 28, 2025, Prime Minister Mark Carney presented a new, smaller cabinet of 29 ministers, down from 39 in the previous administration. Key figures such as François-Philippe Champagne (Finance) and Dominic LeBlanc (US Trade) were retained. Carney's government announced it would not table a full federal budget before the summer, opting for a fall economic statement instead. The new administration's immediate promises include a tax cut and the elimination of all inter-provincial trade barriers by July 1. Carney signed a symbolic decree to lower the first taxable income bracket from 15% to 14%, a measure requiring parliamentary approval. The Liberal party's platform includes additional spending that projects the national deficit for 2025-26 to be $62.3 billion Canadian dollars, an increase from the $42.2 billion forecast in December.\n\nThe relationship with the United States under President Donald Trump was a central theme of the recent Canadian election. Trump had made public remarks about absorbing Canada into the U.S. and imposed tariffs on Canadian goods. In response, Prime Minister Carney stated his government would 'relentlessly' protect Canadian sovereignty and work to define a new economic and security relationship with Washington. After the election, Carney met with Trump but did not secure a removal of the U.S. tariffs. Carney has stated he will maintain Canadian tariffs on U.S. products as long as American tariffs remain in place. The new Canadian cabinet has been explicitly tasked with focusing on Canada-U.S. relations and resolving trade disputes.\n\nPolling data from the period leading up to the April 28, 2025, snap election showed a significant shift in public opinion. After trailing by more than 20 points at the start of the year, the Liberal party under Mark Carney experienced a major comeback. A March 23 Ipsos poll reported Carney's approval rating at 48% with 30% disapproval, while Conservative leader Pierre Poilievre had 35% approval and 52% disapproval. Some outlets cited the same poll as showing Carney with a 71% approval rating. An Abacus Data poll from March 24 found the Conservatives with a national lead of 39% to 36% over the Liberals, but found Carney was the preferred choice for Prime Minister over Poilievre, 38% to 34%. The same poll reported that 77% of Canadians held a negative view of U.S. President Donald Trump.",

    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "About 47 days (until July 1, 2025)",
    "status_quo_outcome": "Yes — new-PM honeymoon effects in Canada likely keep Carney’s approval above Trump’s low-to-mid 40s baseline by early July per Morning Consult patterns.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Carney’s early honeymoon fades quickly amid tariff pain, failure to deliver the touted tax cut, or an early governing stumble, pulling his approval into the low 40s, while Trump benefits from a short-term rally (economic optimism, a perceived win on immigration/trade, or a major event) that lifts him to the mid-to-upper 40s. A rounding tie on the tracker would also resolve No.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Carney sustains a typical post-election honeymoon (mid-to-high 40s or 50s approval) while Trump settles into his usual polarized range (low 40s). Even with ongoing U.S.-Canada trade friction, Canadians reward Carney for a firm posture toward Washington, keeping his rating a few points above Trump’s by July 1.",
    "rationale": "Base rates and Morning Consult history drive this forecast. New leaders commonly see a honeymoon bump in approval during their first 1–3 months. In contrast, Donald Trump’s approval among U.S. adults historically resides in the low 40s with a relatively hard ceiling in the mid-40s, even during favorable news cycles. Morning Consult’s 7-day moving average means the July 1 read will mostly reflect late-June sentiment, when Carney will still be in his first ~60–70 days. \n\nResearch assistant takeaways shaping the view: \n- Carney won April 28 and formed a smaller cabinet, signaling change and competence; early polls pre-election showed him with relatively strong personal ratings versus rivals. \n- Canadians hold very negative views of Trump (per cited polling), and Carney’s stance to “relentlessly” defend sovereignty amid U.S. tariffs is likely popular domestically, supporting a honeymoon. \n- The government’s near-term agenda (tax cut signal, interprovincial trade barriers) is broadly popular, even if implementation lags. \n\nWhy not higher than my forecast: \n- Risk that the tariff standoff bites consumer prices or business confidence, denting the honeymoon. \n- Carney hasn’t delivered concrete wins yet (no full budget until fall), so approval could be more fragile than typical honeymoon cases. \n- Trump could see a short-lived rally on a headline “win,” nudging him to the mid/upper-40s, and Morning Consult’s rounding could produce a tie (which resolves No). \n\nWhy not lower: \n- Base-rate advantage for new PMs remains strong two months in; absent scandal, mid-to-high 40s or 50s approval is common. \n- Trump’s approval tends to revert toward the low 40s; sustained upper-40s would be atypical. \n\nUpdate triggers: \n- Upward (toward Yes): Early Morning Consult readings showing Carney ≥50% or Trump ≤42%; a visible Canadian policy “win” or strong public response to U.S. pressure. \n- Downward (toward No): Credible reports of Canadian economic jitters tied to tariffs, failure or backtracking on the tax cut, an early scandal, or U.S. news driving a Trump bounce into the upper-40s. Also, any indication of Morning Consult presenting equal rounded figures (e.g., both at 45%).",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney have a higher approval rating than US President Donald Trump on July 1, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nResolution source updates monthly. According to Morning Consult for January 2025: \"The latest approval ratings are based on data collected from Jan. 21-27, 2025. Ratings reflect a trailing seven-day simple moving average of views among adults in each country surveyed.\"\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if Mark Carney has a higher approval rating than US President Donald Trump according to [Morning Consult](https://pro.morningconsult.com/trackers/global-leader-approval) when checked by Metaculus on or after July 1, 2025.
