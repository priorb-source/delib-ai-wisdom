  "information": "Han Duck-soo is required by law to resign from his post as acting president by May 4, 2025, to be eligible for the presidential election. He has already missed the April 15 deadline to register for the People Power Party (PPP) primary. Consequently, PPP leadership has publicly stated he will not be included in their primary process. South Korean constitutional norms and historical precedent discourage caretaker heads of state from running for office.\n\nMultiple polls conducted in April 2025 show Han Duck-soo's public support ranging between 2% and 12%. Lee Jae-myung of the opposition Democratic Party leads in polls with approximately 46% support. One poll from April 20 indicated that 66% of respondents found Han's potential candidacy 'unacceptable'. Despite low public support, a faction within the People Power Party, with reports of over 50 lawmakers and a 'National Candidate Support Committee', are actively urging him to run.\n\nIn multiple public statements and interviews with news outlets such as the Financial Times and Yonhap in late April 2025, Han Duck-soo has consistently maintained that he 'has not yet decided' on a presidential run. His stated immediate priority is the US-South Korea trade negotiations scheduled for April 24. No visible campaign infrastructure or preparations for a presidential bid have been observed.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "About 13 days (through May 4, 2025, inclusive; question resolves May 5, 2025)",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No — Han Duck-soo does not announce a presidential candidacy before May 5, 2025.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Han emphasizes caretaker neutrality and completes his acting-presidency duties; PPP proceeds with its established primary/nomination path without him; he explicitly declines or continues to say he’s not running past the resignation deadline, making a candidacy infeasible.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "A PPP ‘draft Han’ push triggers an emergency outside-the-primary nomination or he declares an independent run; he announces by May 4 and resigns to meet the legal eligibility requirement.",
    "rationale": "Time is short and the institutional, political, and normative headwinds are strong. Key considerations:\n- Legal/administrative: The reported requirement to resign by May 4 to be eligible compresses the decision window. Missing the April 15 PPP primary registration and PPP leadership’s public stance that he won’t be in their primary sharply reduces the party-channel pathway. While an emergency/draft mechanism or independent run is possible, it’s procedurally and politically costly on a 10–13 day timeline.\n- Norms and precedent: South Korean constitutional norms discourage caretaker heads of state from running. Departing from this norm during a sensitive period would invite criticism and increases reputational and political risk.\n- Political fundamentals: Polls cited (April 2025) place Han at 2–12% with a high ‘unacceptable’ rating (~66%). Lee Jae-myung reportedly leads with ~46%. Entering under these conditions without groundwork is risky, and there’s no visible campaign infrastructure.\n- Signals from Han: He has repeatedly said he hasn’t decided and is prioritizing near-term state business (e.g., April 24 US–Korea trade talks). If a run were imminent, we’d typically expect clearer preparatory signals by now.\n- Countervailing pressure: A faction reportedly including 50+ PPP lawmakers and a ‘National Candidate Support Committee’ is pushing for him to run. This keeps the probability above near-zero, as late ‘draft’ scenarios do happen when parties perceive a vacuum or need a unifying figure.\nWhy not higher? Because the default (no announcement) is reinforced by missed primary deadlines, leadership resistance, low polling, norms against caretaker candidacies, and lack of campaign prep under a tight clock.\nWhy not lower? Because a nontrivial PPP faction is pressing hard; an emergency nomination or dramatic pivot remains possible, and the legal resignation cutoff could catalyze a last-minute decision if elite backing consolidates.\nWhat would move me up: Credible reports of (a) PPP initiating an emergency draft mechanism, (b) Han assembling a campaign team/fundraising/office, (c) Han signaling intent by scheduling a resignation announcement, or (d) a polling swing showing viability.\nWhat would move me down: PPP formally locks in another nominee, Han publicly rules out a run, or he recommits to serving as acting president through the period past the May 4 eligibility cutoff without resigning.",

These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if Han Duck-soo announces his candidacy for president of South Korea before May 5, 2025.

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
