    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Approximately one month. The BLS data for May 2025 is typically released in mid-June 2025.",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No. The most recent BLS data for banana prices (April 2025) was approximately $0.632 per pound, slightly above the $0.630 threshold. Prices have fluctuated just above and below this level for the past year.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "The price is at or above $0.630. This outcome would occur if persistent background inflation and elevated transportation costs continue to exert slight upward pressure on the supply chain, keeping the price above the threshold, consistent with recent trends.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "The price is under $0.630. A scenario for this outcome would involve a period of excellent growing conditions in Central and South America leading to a temporary supply glut, or a slight decrease in transportation costs, causing the monthly average price to fall just below the threshold.",
    "rationale": "My forecast is based on the remarkable historical price stability of bananas. The BLS data for series APU0000711211 shows that for the past year, the price has moved within a very narrow band, frequently crossing the $0.630 threshold. The most recent data point for April 2025 placed the price just above this line at approximately $0.632. This suggests the status quo is a 'No' outcome, albeit by a tiny margin. The provided article highlights several factors exerting upward price pressure, including inflation, port fees, and long-term disease threats, which supports the 'No' case. However, the banana market is highly efficient, and prices are sensitive to short-term supply and demand fluctuations. Given that the price has often dipped below $0.630 in recent months, a 'Yes' outcome is highly plausible. My forecast is not lower than 45% because the price is already so close to the threshold that even minor positive supply-side news could push it below. My forecast is not higher because the current price trend is slightly above the threshold, and the documented cost pressures in the supply chain make a price increase more likely than a decrease. I would update towards 'Yes' given news of a bumper crop or a drop in fuel prices. I would update towards 'No' if there were reports of new tariffs or significant weather-related supply disruptions.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill the price of bananas reported by the US BLS for May 2025 be under 63 cents a pound?\n\nQuestion background:\nQuartz: [Move over, eggs – bananas are the next victim](https://qz.com/bananas-dole-price-hikes-inflation-port-fees-trump-tari-1851772583)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if the price reported by the Bureau of Labor Statistics [here](https://data.bls.gov/toppicks?survey=ap) for Bananas, per lb. - APU0000711211, to the thousandths of a decimal point, is under $0.6300 for May 2025.\n\n\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nNo additional information available.\n\nToday is 2025-05-13.\n\nBefore answering you think:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n(e) You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
