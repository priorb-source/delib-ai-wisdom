    "review": "Both forecasters present nearly identical reasoning to my initial analysis, converging on 12% versus my 15%. Their key insight that I underweighted is that we're already nearly halfway through the total time window (approximately day 23-25 of a ~55-day period) with zero progress signals. This is significant - if reopening were likely within 60 days, we would typically expect to see some diplomatic momentum by now: high-level meetings, public statements about negotiations, or security cooperation frameworks. Instead, we have silence from both governments and a May 30 AFRICOM assessment noting deterioration. Forecaster 3's framing of Benin extending operations to Lagos borders on May 9 as 'escalation' rather than just expansion is apt - it suggests hardening rather than softening of their position. The other forecasters correctly emphasize that the 20% base rate applies to a 60-day window, but we're already well into that window without any of the typical precursors to reopening. The lack of observable progress at this point is meaningful evidence against reopening before July 1.",
    "rationale": "Upon reflection, I should adjust my forecast downward. The critical insight from the other forecasters is temporal: we're at approximately day 23-25 of a ~55-day window to July 1, meaning we're already 42-45% through the available time. If reopening were going to occur within this timeframe, we would normally expect to see some indicators by now - diplomatic announcements, security negotiations, or at minimum, public statements of intent. The complete absence of such signals, combined with the May 30 AFRICOM report of deteriorating conditions, is strong evidence against reopening. The 20% base rate for security-related closures within 60 days should be adjusted downward when we're already this far into the window with no progress. Additionally, Benin's extension of operations to other borders on May 9 signals escalation of their border security posture rather than preparation for reopening. While economic pressure and Nigeria's House resolution provide some upward pressure on the probability, these factors are insufficient given the serious security concerns (terrorism, arms smuggling) and the compressed remaining timeline of only 31 days. A rapid diplomatic breakthrough remains theoretically possible, preventing a forecast below 10%, but the evidence strongly favors continued closure.",
