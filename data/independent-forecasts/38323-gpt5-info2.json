  "information": "According to ADP data, U.S. private-sector hiring slowed significantly in May 2025, with only 37,000 jobs added, the slowest pace in over two years. Job losses were noted in business services, manufacturing, and education. A separate University of Michigan survey shows consumers expect unemployment to climb. Data on consumer behavior shows personal spending rose by 0.2% last month, while the savings rate increased to 4.9% in March, the highest level in nearly a year. Following the end of the pandemic-era payment pause on student loans, delinquencies jumped from 1% to 7.74%. In contrast to the University of Michigan's findings, the Conference Board's consumer confidence index rose to 98 in May from 85.7 in the prior month.",

    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "About 3 weeks (final Friday of June 2025, June 27)",
    "status_quo_outcome": "Yes — recent Michigan sentiment readings have been well above 60, even after a notable drop in May, so a value >60 remains the baseline.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "A fresh negative shock drives sentiment into the high 50s: e.g., a hot May CPI print that lifts inflation expectations, a weak June 7 jobs report that raises recession fears, equities sell off, and gas prices tick up. June preliminary prints ≤60 and the final stays at or below 60.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Sentiment stabilizes after May’s drop or only drifts modestly lower, landing in the low-to-mid 60s, or even rebounds. Typical small final revisions (±1–2 pts) keep the June final above 60.",
    "rationale": "Status quo: The University of Michigan Index of Consumer Sentiment had a sharp decline in May but remained clearly above 60 in both preliminary and final readings. Over the past year-plus, readings have generally held in the 60s–70s. Crossing below 60 would require another outsized month-to-month deterioration, which is uncommon absent an acute macro shock. Final revisions are usually small, so if June prelim comes in above 60, the final is very likely to remain above 60.\nEvidence and context: The research assistant notes: (1) ADP shows very weak private hiring in May (+37k), and Michigan survey respondents expect higher unemployment—both negatives for sentiment; (2) personal spending rose 0.2% and the saving rate increased, suggesting some caution; (3) student loan delinquencies have climbed, another headwind; but (4) the Conference Board’s confidence index rose sharply in May, indicating mixed consumer signals. The Axios piece framing a “plunge” suggests recent deterioration, but not necessarily into sub-60 territory.\nWhy not higher: There is meaningful downside risk around two near-term data points that can sway sentiment—May jobs report (June 7) and May CPI (June 12). A weak payrolls print alongside a hotter-than-expected CPI could amplify unemployment fears and inflation expectations, pushing June prelim near 60 with a non-trivial chance of a sub-60 final. Headlines on tariffs or market volatility could compound this.\nWhy not lower: The threshold (60.0) is still quite low relative to most readings since late 2023. Even after May’s notable drop, levels stayed well above 60, and large consecutive monthly declines of that magnitude are rare. The Conference Board’s improvement also argues against a collapse in consumer attitudes.\nUpdate triggers:\n- Upward: Solid jobs report (headline payrolls and breadth), benign CPI/PCE inflation, stable or falling gas prices, and equity market resilience would push me higher (to ~85–90%).\n- Downward: Payrolls disappoint with rising unemployment rate, hot inflation that lifts short-term inflation expectations, a selloff in risk assets, or a sharp gas price rise would lower my odds (to ~60–70%).",

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
