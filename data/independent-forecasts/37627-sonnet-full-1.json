  "information": "Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy and Donald Trump have had several communications in 2025. On February 12, they spoke for about an hour about peace efforts and cooperation. On March 19, they spoke again, with Zelenskyy expecting to be briefed on Trump's prior conversation with Vladimir Putin. On May 10, following a meeting with European leaders in Kyiv, Zelenskyy spoke with Trump, stating that Ukraine was ready for direct peace talks if a 30-day ceasefire was agreed upon. On the same day, European leaders also held a joint call with Trump from Kyiv.\n\nA proposal was made for direct Russia-Ukraine talks to be held in Istanbul on May 15, 2025. Volodymyr Zelenskyy agreed to attend and invited Donald Trump to be present at the meeting. Trump expressed optimism about the talks and stated he was considering attending, but noted his schedule was busy. His schedule included a trip to Saudi Arabia, Qatar, and the UAE from May 12, concluding on May 15, the same day as the proposed meeting.\n\nEuropean powers have demanded a 30-day ceasefire from Russia, starting May 12, warning of new sanctions if the demand was ignored. Donald Trump advised Volodymyr Zelenskyy to accept talks with Vladimir Putin without the precondition of a ceasefire. Conversely, Zelenskyy stated that Ukraine's readiness for talks was contingent on Russia agreeing to a 30-day ceasefire and providing for its effective monitoring.",

    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "33 days until June 15, 2025",
    "status_quo_outcome": "Yes - they will speak on the phone",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "The peace talks in Istanbul fail to produce results, diplomatic communications shift to other channels or intermediaries, Trump and Zelenskyy meet in person instead of speaking by phone, or the urgency for direct communication diminishes as the situation stabilizes or deteriorates to the point where phone calls are no longer productive.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Following the May 15 Istanbul talks, Trump and Zelenskyy need to discuss outcomes and next steps. Alternatively, new developments in the Ukraine situation require their coordination, Trump briefs Zelenskyy after his Middle East trip, or ongoing peace negotiations necessitate their direct communication. Given their recent pattern of calls every 4-6 weeks and the last call being May 10, another call before June 15 fits the established pattern.",
    "rationale": "The evidence strongly favors a Yes outcome. Trump and Zelenskyy have demonstrated a clear pattern of regular phone communication in 2025, with calls on February 12, March 19, and most recently May 10 - just three days ago. This establishes a cadence of communication roughly every 4-6 weeks during this critical period. The 33-day window from now until June 15 provides ample time for at least one phone call given this pattern. Crucially, we are in the midst of major diplomatic developments: Istanbul peace talks are scheduled for May 15 (two days away), a 30-day ceasefire demand started May 12, and Trump is considering attending the talks after Zelenskyy's invitation. These high-stakes negotiations create strong incentives for continued direct communication, especially since Trump and Zelenskyy have differing positions on preconditions (Trump advising talks without ceasefire, Zelenskyy demanding ceasefire first). Follow-up discussions after the Istanbul meeting will almost certainly be needed regardless of the outcome. My forecast is not higher (95%+) because: Trump has a busy Middle East travel schedule that could complicate communications; they might meet in person instead of by phone; alternative communication channels exist (video, intermediaries); and unforeseen diplomatic complications could arise. My forecast is not lower (below 70%) because: the recent communication pattern is very strong and consistent; major events are actively unfolding that require their coordination; both leaders have vested interests in maintaining contact during peace negotiations; and the time window is generous. The status quo of regular communication during important periods strongly supports continuation of this pattern.",
