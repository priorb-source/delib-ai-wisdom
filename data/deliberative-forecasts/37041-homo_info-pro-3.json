    "review": "The other two forecasters and I are in strong agreement on the core logic: the primary barrier to a 'Yes' outcome is the very short five-week timeline, which is likely insufficient for a virus to be introduced, establish local transmission, be detected, and trigger a formal CDC advisory. However, my initial forecast of 2% was the most optimistic about this barrier holding. Forecaster 2 (5%) and Forecaster 3 (8%) assigned more weight to the risk of the outbreak spreading from South America. Specifically, Forecaster 3's analysis highlighted details about the severity of the source outbreak—'more than doubling the prior year's cases' and 'disruptions to vaccination programs'—which I had not sufficiently considered. This argument is convincing, as a more intense outbreak significantly increases the 'exportation pressure' and the probability of a case slipping through even robust defenses, making the subsequent chain of events more likely.",
    "rationale": "My initial forecast of 2% was based primarily on the high efficacy of public health measures and the significant logistical and biological hurdles that must be overcome in a tight five-week timeframe. After reviewing my peers' analyses, I believe I underweighted the severity of the yellow fever outbreak in South America. The points raised, particularly by Forecaster 3, about the outbreak's intensity (doubling of cases) and potential disruptions to vaccination programs suggest a higher probability of the virus being exported to a neighboring North American country like Panama. A higher rate of importation attempts increases the chance of a failure in containment. While I still believe the timeline is a major constraint, these factors make the risk of a small, detectable outbreak leading to an advisory non-trivial. I am therefore updating my forecast to better reflect this heightened risk. I am increasing my probability from 2% to 5%. I am not going as high as 8% because I maintain that the multi-step process required for a formal CDC advisory to be issued remains a very significant bottleneck that is unlikely to be completed by June 1st.",
