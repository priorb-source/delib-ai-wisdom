  "information": "A recent UN Economic Commission for Africa (ECA) report highlighted the AfCFTA's potential to boost trade-led growth and increase Africa's GDP by 1.2% by 2045 with full implementation. Other regional developments include a forum in Zambia focused on digital trade integration, an emphasis on arbitration for resolving trade disputes, and the promotion of the Pan-African Payment and Settlement System (PAPSS) to facilitate transactions in local currencies. Meanwhile, Nigeria has ratified the agreement, and South Africa and Lesotho are strengthening bilateral trade ties to advance AfCFTA goals.",

    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "About 25 days (until July 1, 2025)",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Ongoing civil conflict and absent/fragmented legislative authority mean no formal approval or deposit of Sudan’s instrument of ratification with the AU Commission by July 1, 2025. AU ratification lists remain unchanged through the deadline.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "The Sovereign Council or de facto executive authority issues a ratification decree and promptly deposits the instrument with the AU Commission in Addis Ababa, and the AU publicly confirms receipt before July 1, 2025.",
    "rationale": "Ratification, for purposes of resolution, requires Sudan to complete its domestic process and deposit the instrument with the African Union Commission before the deadline. With only ~3.5 weeks left, the base-rate likelihood of a new ratification by a conflict-affected state without a functioning parliament is low. Since April 2023, Sudan has been engulfed in a severe civil war, which typically deprioritizes trade policy legislation and complicates treaty ratification logistics. Publicly visible AU updates on ratifications tend to surface quickly; there has been no widely reported indication of imminent Sudanese ratification. The status quo therefore points to a No. The research assistant’s material indicates strong continental momentum for AfCFTA (ECA advocacy, digital trade forums, PAPSS push, other countries making progress). That slightly raises the tail risk that Sudan’s authorities might pursue a low-cost legitimacy signal by ratifying via executive action and depositing the instrument. It does not, however, provide Sudan-specific evidence of near-term ratification readiness. Why not higher: severe internal conflict, lack of normal legislative process, and very short runway make late-breaking ratification unlikely. Why not lower: executive-led ratification without a sitting legislature is possible in coup/transition contexts, and Sudan’s internationally recognized authorities could pursue it to curry regional goodwill; deposit is administratively feasible if politically desired. What would move me up: credible reports from Sudan’s foreign ministry or Sovereign Council that ratification has been approved; AU Commission or AU Treaty Database indicating receipt is imminent; IGAD/AU-mediated political deals that include trade commitments. What would move me down: escalating conflict limiting basic state functions; official denials or clear signaling that ratification is deferred; continued silence as we approach late June.",

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any).
