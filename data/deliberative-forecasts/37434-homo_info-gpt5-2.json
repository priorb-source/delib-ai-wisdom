    "review": "Both forecasters added useful, moderating points I hadn’t fully weighted. In particular: (1) the extremely low year‑end cash (~$0.23M) is already “stale” in the sense that the company has survived into May without filing, implying either additional liquidity or further cash conservation; (2) very low leverage (debt-to-equity ~0.05) reduces the immediate pressure from secured creditors that often precipitates a filing; and (3) over a short, sub‑two‑month window, base rates for a formal U.S. bankruptcy filing are below 50% even for distressed microcaps, because they frequently secure tiny bridges, defer payables, or pursue out‑of‑court options (including ABCs) that wouldn’t resolve this market as Yes. Forecaster 3’s point about investors accumulating shares (e.g., Epiq) isn’t determinative but is directionally consistent with a non‑BK path in the near term. I still think the operational shutdown and failed financings keep a filing risk meaningfully elevated, but I find their status‑quo/short‑horizon argument and low‑leverage point convincing enough to move my estimate down.",
    "rationale": "The company’s distress is acute: operations ceased in Dec 2024, stock culled, going‑concern warning, and management signaling unsuccessful capital raises and “assessing alternatives” for the Ohio facility. Those factors keep the hazard of a June filing real, especially if a 363 sale is viewed as the cleanest way to dispose of the Ohio asset or address any liens. However, two countervailing considerations push me lower than my prior 55%: (1) we’re already into May with no petition, which suggests some modest liquidity or continued forbearance; and (2) minimal secured debt reduces immediate creditor‑driven triggers, making an out‑of‑court sale or wind‑down more plausible over the next ~8 weeks. Given the short time left to July 1 and the common availability of small bridge financings or payment deferrals, the base case tilts slightly to No while still recognizing a material chance of a June filing if runway ends or a court‑supervised sale is needed. I would move up if the Q1 10‑Q or an 8‑K indicates cash runway ends in June, advisers/DIP lender engagement, vendor lawsuits/liens, or explicit preparation for Chapter 11/7. I would move down on any announced bridge financing, closed asset sale, or guidance that extends runway beyond July 1.",
