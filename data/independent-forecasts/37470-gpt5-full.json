  "information": "On April 29, 2025, Egypt's Minister of Youth and Sports, Dr. Ashraf Sobhy, met with Gilberto Gartner, a Brazilian national who is the President of the International Traditional Karate Federation (ITKF). The purpose of the meeting was to discuss Egypt's bid to host the 2026 World Traditional Karate Championship. Dr. Sobhy stated that Egypt has organized over 440 sports events in recent years, citing its modern sports infrastructure. President Gartner expressed confidence in Egypt's ability to host the championship successfully, noting he had witnessed a high level of organization at the World Gymnastics Championship in Egypt and that the country has a large base of karate practitioners.\n\nEgypt has a recent history of hosting major international sporting events. In April 2025, the country hosted the World Karate Premier League in Cairo, which involved 384 players from 67 countries. In May 2025, Egypt hosted the Pharaohs' Championship for Rhythmic Gymnastics with 18 participating countries, the African Championship for Rhythmic Gymnastics with 8 participating countries, and the 25th World Military Equestrian Championship with 20 participating nations. Egypt is also scheduled to host the Senior World Karate Championships (an event of the separate World Karate Federation) in November 2025.\n\nAnalysis of the International Traditional Karate Federation (ITKF) indicates a pattern of announcing World Championship hosts 24 to 36 months prior to the event. As of mid-May 2025, there is no mention of Egypt's 2026 bid, nor any related bid documentation, on the ITKF's official website. There have been no public reports of other nations submitting competing bids for the 2026 championship. Egypt previously hosted an ITKF event in 2014.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "About 7 weeks (until June 30, 2025)",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No announcement by ITKF before July 1, 2025",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "ITKF defers the 2026 host decision to a later executive meeting or annual congress after July, continues internal negotiations, or selects a host but waits to announce until later in 2025. Alternatively, another country is chosen and announced after July.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Following the late-April meeting, the ITKF Executive Committee quickly approves Egypt’s bid and issues an official announcement (website, press release, or official social channels) in May/June 2025 confirming Egypt as the 2026 host, possibly coordinated with Egypt’s sports ministry.",
    "rationale": "Time is short and the current baseline is no announcement yet. The research assistant reports: (1) a high-level April 29 meeting between Egypt’s Sports Minister and ITKF President with positive signals; (2) Egypt’s strong recent hosting track record and governmental support; (3) no public evidence of competing bids; and (4) ITKF’s historical pattern of announcing World Championship hosts 24–36 months in advance. We are now roughly 18–20 months from 2026, later than that pattern, and as of mid-May there is no ITKF website mention of Egypt’s 2026 bid or a decision. These factors tilt the status quo toward no near-term announcement. Countervailing considerations are that smaller federations can move quickly, Egypt is an attractive, well-resourced host, and the ITKF President expressed confidence—so a rapid greenlight remains plausible. Why not higher: only ~7 weeks remain, no formal bid documentation or ITKF timelines are public, and host decisions often align with scheduled congresses that may occur later in the year. Why not lower: visible political will, proven capacity, lack of known competitors, and a potentially nimble approval pathway could produce a quick announcement. Upward updates: ITKF publishes a decision timeline indicating a May/June vote, reports of Egypt’s bid being recommended/shortlisted, or credible leaks/official teasers. Downward updates: credible reports of decision timing after July, indications of another bidder, or continued silence into mid/late June.",
