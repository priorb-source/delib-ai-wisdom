  "information": "Official data from Eurostat showed the euro area annual inflation rate was 2.2% in March 2025, down from 2.3% in February. The primary contributors to the March inflation rate were services (+1.56 percentage points), followed by food, alcohol & tobacco (+0.57 pp), and non-energy industrial goods (+0.16 pp). Energy prices had a negative contribution (-0.10 pp). According to news reports citing polls from Bloomberg and Reuters, the consensus among economists for the April 2025 inflation figure is 2.1%. A quarterly Survey of Professional Forecasters by the ECB indicated that inflation for 2025 is expected to be 2.2%, with a forecast of 2.0% for 2026.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Less than one month. The flash estimate for April 2025 inflation is typically released at the end of April or the very beginning of May.",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No. The most recent inflation reading for March 2025 was 2.2%, and the trend has been downward. With the threshold for a 'Yes' being *above* 2.2%, the status quo suggests the outcome will be No.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "The current disinflationary trend continues into April. Energy prices remain stable or exert a slight negative pressure, and services inflation moderates as expected due to the lagged effects of past ECB monetary policy tightening. The headline inflation rate is reported as 2.2% or lower, consistent with economist consensus forecasts.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "An unexpected shock pushes prices higher. This could be a modest rebound in energy prices due to geopolitical developments, or services inflation proves to be stickier than anticipated, perhaps due to stronger-than-expected wage growth. In this scenario, these upward pressures outweigh the general disinflationary trend, causing the final figure to be 2.3% or higher.",
    "rationale": "My forecast is primarily based on the strong evidence pointing towards inflation stabilizing at or below the 2.2% threshold. Three key factors support this conclusion. First, the most recent official data for March 2025 showed inflation at exactly 2.2%, down from 2.3% in February, establishing a clear disinflationary trend. For the question to resolve 'Yes', this trend would need to abruptly reverse, which is unlikely without a significant catalyst. Second, the consensus among economists polled by Bloomberg and Reuters is for an April inflation figure of 2.1%. This expert consensus is a powerful indicator, suggesting the most probable outcome is a further slight decrease. Third, the ECB's own Survey of Professional Forecasters projects an average inflation of 2.2% for the entirety of 2025, implying that monthly readings are expected to hover around this level, not significantly exceed it. My probability is not lower than 30% because services inflation remains the primary driver and has proven to be sticky. There is a non-trivial risk of an upside surprise should wage pressures or demand for services be stronger than anticipated. Furthermore, unexpected volatility in energy markets could quickly alter the headline figure. My probability is not higher because the weight of the evidence, including the recent trend and expert consensus, strongly supports a 'No' outcome. For my forecast to move higher, I would need to see initial inflation data from major Eurozone economies like Germany and France coming in significantly above expectations or a sudden, sharp spike in energy prices early in the month. Conversely, my forecast would move lower if those same national indicators came in below 2.1%.",

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any).
