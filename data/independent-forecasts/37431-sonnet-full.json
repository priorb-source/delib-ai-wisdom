  "information": "The recall, issued on April 24, 2025, by ACC Central Kitchen LLC, is for approximately 64,000 to 65,000 pounds of frozen pork bun products. The recall is classified as Class I and was initiated due to misbranding and an undeclared sesame allergen. The affected products were produced over an extended period, with some items dating back to November 2023. Distribution was limited to retail locations in New York. There have been no reported illnesses associated with the consumption of these products.\n\nThe U.S. Department of Agriculture’s Food Safety and Inspection Service (FSIS) oversees the recall process. For a recall to be formally closed, the FSIS must complete effectiveness checks and verify that the company has removed all affected products from commerce, notified customers, and implemented corrective actions. Historical data for similar recalls show varied timelines; medium-scale allergen recalls (10,000-100,000 lbs) typically take 60 to 120 days to close. Other analyses suggest a mean closure time of 45 days for allergen/misbranding recalls, with about half of comparable recalls in 2023-2024 closing within 70 days.\n\nSeveral factors specific to this recall may influence its duration. Factors that could lead to a longer resolution time include the substantial volume of the product, the long production window, and the product's frozen nature, which means it may remain in consumer freezers for longer periods. Conversely, factors that could shorten the timeline include the recall's limited geographical scope (only New York), the reason being a misbranding/allergen issue rather than pathogen contamination (which typically involves a more complex investigation), and the company's proactive and voluntary initiation of the recall.",

    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "57 days until July 1, 2025",
    "status_quo_outcome": "The recall remains Active, as it was only issued 11 days ago on April 24, 2025, and is still in the process of effectiveness checks and product removal verification",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "The recall remains Active through July 1, 2025 because the frozen nature of the products means many remain in consumer freezers, the long production window (back to November 2023) complicates tracking, and FSIS effectiveness checks and verification of corrective actions extend beyond the 68-day window from recall issuance to the resolution date",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "The recall is closed before July 1, 2025 because the limited geographical distribution (only New York), voluntary nature of the recall, absence of illness reports, and focus on misbranding rather than pathogen contamination allow for rapid product removal, swift effectiveness checks, and quick FSIS approval of corrective actions within the 68-day timeframe",
    "rationale": "This recall has been active for 11 days, leaving 57 days until the resolution date—a total window of 68 days from issuance. The research assistant provides critical historical benchmarks: allergen/misbranding recalls average 45 days to close, with approximately half of comparable 2023-2024 recalls closing within 70 days. Medium-scale allergen recalls (10,000-100,000 lbs) typically range from 60-120 days. At 68 days total, we're positioned near the faster end of historical timelines but not at the very quickest. Factors supporting closure include the limited New York distribution (easier to verify removal), voluntary initiation (suggesting company cooperation), misbranding classification (less complex than pathogen investigations), and zero illness reports. However, concerning factors include the substantial 64,000+ pound volume, the extended production window dating to November 2023 (complicating traceability), and the frozen product format (products may sit in consumer freezers indefinitely). The 68-day window sits almost exactly at the historical median, making this a near coin-flip scenario. The forecast is not higher because the 60-120 day typical range for medium-scale recalls suggests many extend beyond our timeframe, and frozen products create unique retrieval challenges. It's not lower because the mean of 45 days and the limited geography are strong positive indicators, and we're within the timeframe where half of comparable recalls closed. I would update higher if news emerged of rapid product retrieval or company announcements of corrective action completion; I would update lower if effectiveness checks revealed widespread remaining product in commerce or if FSIS processing delays were reported",
