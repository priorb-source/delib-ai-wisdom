    "review": "All three forecasts converge remarkably around 35-40%, suggesting strong agreement on the key factors. We all recognize: (1) the El Niño to neutral/La Niña transition reducing temperatures relative to 2024's peak, (2) May 2024 likely set a high benchmark, (3) the underlying warming trend, and (4) the absence of specific May 2025 data. Forecaster 2 raises an interesting 'momentum' argument about continued record-breaking, though I think this is substantially offset by ENSO transitions. Forecaster 3's point that 'not every month breaks records' despite warming trends is well-taken and reinforces natural variability considerations. One critical detail all of us noted but perhaps understated: today is June 2, 2025, meaning May 2025 data should exist in preliminary form. The research assistant's lack of information could suggest either data unavailability or unremarkable results. The narrow 5-point spread in our forecasts (35-40%) indicates we're viewing the evidence similarly, though with slightly different weightings on trend momentum versus ENSO transition effects.",
    "rationale": "Upon reflection, I maintain my core reasoning but recognize I may have weighted the status quo principle slightly too heavily. The confluence of factors - strong 2023-2024 warmth, continued anthropogenic forcing, and the specific question asking about official NOAA reporting (not weather forecasting) - suggests marginally higher odds than my initial 35%. However, the ENSO transition from El Niño peak conditions to neutral/La Niña, the exceptionally high bar May 2024 likely set, and the principle that records don't fall every month despite warming trends all support staying in the lower-to-middle part of the 35-40% range. The fact that it's already June 2 and no preliminary reports of exceptional May warmth have been highlighted is modestly informative, though not definitive. I'll adjust upward slightly to 37% to position myself in the middle of the consensus range while maintaining that the prior record is more likely than not to hold.",
