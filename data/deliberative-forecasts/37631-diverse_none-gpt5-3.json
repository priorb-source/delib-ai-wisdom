    "review": "Both forecasters emphasize that the gap is small and the horizon is short, which I agree are the dominant factors. Forecaster 2 adds a concrete status-quo claim (Tesla slightly ahead) and frames the outcome as a volatility contest; that’s useful, though they don’t quantify the gap or vol. Forecaster 3 underscores status-quo persistence and Tesla’s capacity for sharp rallies due to narrative catalysts and retail support; that’s a good reminder to keep the probability from drifting too high. Neither adds hard, current market-cap figures, but both argue as if Tesla is marginally ahead today, which is plausible and should temper my prior. I find the emphasis on near-term catalysts sound: Walmart earnings (near-term, supportive for Yes) vs. Tesla shareholder meeting and macro/growth sentiment (potentially supportive for No).",
    "rationale": "Time to resolution is ~6 weeks, so current ordering and near-term catalysts dominate. The core mechanics: Walmart is lower beta and has a near-term earnings event that can widen any lead or flip a small deficit; Tesla is higher beta with a shareholder meeting and macro/growth-factor sensitivity that can produce rapid upside moves. If Tesla is indeed slightly ahead right now, that reduces the odds of Walmart finishing ahead versus my prior assumption that Walmart might already be leading. I continue to think the distribution is modestly skewed toward Walmart ending ahead because: (1) Walmart’s event risk (earnings) is more likely to be benign-to-positive than severely negative; (2) Tesla’s fundamental headwinds (EV competition, margins) and sentiment risk still bias downside tails; (3) Tesla’s Q2 deliveries, a key hard catalyst, land after the resolution date. Offsetting that are potential Tesla narrative spikes (AI/FSD, shareholder meeting) and a possible growth bid if macro data or Fed tone turns more dovish. Net, I’m nudging down from 62% to 59% to reflect a slightly higher likelihood that Tesla is currently ahead and the real possibility of a Tesla rebound within the window, while still assigning a modest edge to Walmart given the setup and relative volatility. I would move higher if Walmart beats and guides up or if Tesla sees additional negative demand/margin headlines; I would move lower on a convincing Tesla narrative/catalyst rally or broad growth outperformance.",
