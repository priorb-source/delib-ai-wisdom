    "review": "Both forecasters raised compelling points that challenge my initial pessimism. Forecaster 3's specific detail about the 10-year license granted to Starlink Lesotho Pty Ltd (a local subsidiary) on April 14 is significant - the creation of a local entity suggests more preparation than I initially credited. More importantly, both forecasters correctly frame this as a 2.5-month window from license to deadline, rather than just '55 days remaining.' This reframing matters because 2.5 months falls squarely within the typical 1-3 month Starlink rollout timeframe they both cite. \n\nForecaster 3's point about laser backhaul reducing infrastructure dependencies is particularly relevant for a small, landlocked country. I also realize I may have over-anchored on the DRC comparison - that 2-day turnaround was exceptionally fast, not the norm. A 23-day delay from license grant without announcement is less alarming when viewed against a typical 1-3 month rollout window.\n\nHowever, I remain more cautious than Forecaster 2's 75%. We're nearly a month post-license with no public announcement, pre-orders, or map updates. While the regulatory hurdle is cleared, the operational hurdles (orderability, checkout flows, device logistics) that Forecaster 3 mentions are non-trivial and could easily consume the remaining time.",
    "rationale": "After deliberation, I'm updating upward from 52% to 60%. My initial forecast was too pessimistic by over-weighting the 23-day silence against an inappropriate benchmark (DRC's exceptional 2-day turnaround). The stronger framing is: Lesotho received its license 2.5 months before the deadline, which aligns with Starlink's typical 1-3 month post-approval rollout timeline. The creation of Starlink Lesotho Pty Ltd demonstrates substantive groundwork beyond just regulatory approval. The small geographic size and laser backhaul technology reduce complexity. With 55 days remaining and the main regulatory barrier cleared, the probability should be above 50%. However, I'm not going as high as 75% because operational implementation (website integration, order processing, logistics) typically takes time, and the complete absence of any public signals after 23 days suggests this won't be the fastest rollout. The 60% forecast reflects a modestly-better-than-even probability that captures both the strong fundamentals (license granted, sufficient time, typical rollout window) and real uncertainties (no announcement yet, operational hurdles remain).",
