    "review": "My initial forecast of 75% was aligned with Forecaster 2, focusing on the statistical likelihood that over a 23-day period, the volatile news cycle would produce at least one day where the word 'tariff(s)' was absent from both front pages. We both emphasized the low bar for a 'Yes' resolution. However, Forecaster 3's analysis was highly persuasive and caused a significant revision. Forecaster 3 introduced the critical context of a specific, monumental policy change in April—a sweeping 10% benchmark tariff on all trade partners. This re-frames the issue from a general, ongoing political topic to a single, dominant economic event with massive, unfolding daily consequences. This argument compellingly explains why the story would have exceptional 'inertia' and be much more likely to sustain front-page coverage than I had initially assumed, making a 'No' outcome far more probable.",
    "rationale": "I am significantly lowering my forecast from 75% to 25%. The primary reason for this change is the new context provided by Forecaster 3, which I find highly credible. My initial analysis underestimated the sheer magnitude and newsworthiness of the recent tariff policy. A systemic economic shock like a new 10% blanket tariff and a proposal to replace income taxes with tariffs is not a routine story; it is a fundamental event with daily, front-page-worthy impacts on markets, foreign policy, and domestic politics. This dramatically increases the daily probability that at least one of the two newspapers—the WSJ covering financial fallout, the NYT covering political fallout—will feature the word. The argument for a 'Yes' outcome now rests almost entirely on an external, 'black swan' event being large enough to displace this tariff story from both front pages simultaneously. While possible over a 23-day window, it is a much less likely scenario. I am not lowering my forecast to Forecaster 3's 10% because I believe it slightly undervalues the potential for news cycle volatility. A 25% probability appropriately reflects the very high likelihood of sustained coverage while still accounting for the chance of a single-day aberration triggering a 'Yes'.",
