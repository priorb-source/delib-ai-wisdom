  "information": "In mid-June 2025, OpenAI released a new model, o3-pro, which is focused on high-performance reasoning and is available to paid users. The company has delayed the release of its first open-weights model until later in the summer, and reports indicate a potential GPT-5 release is delayed until July 2025. On June 10-11, OpenAI's services, including ChatGPT, experienced a global outage caused by a system error during a software update, for which the company announced a compensation plan for paid users.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Approximately 16 days. The question resolves based on the leaderboard state on or after July 1, 2025, and today is June 15, 2025.",
    "status_quo_outcome": "The current #1 position on the Chatbot Arena Leaderboard is maintained through June 30, 2025. Without access to real-time leaderboard data as of June 15, the status quo likely involves either OpenAI or a close competitor (such as Anthropic, Google, or another major lab) holding the top position.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "A competitor model (such as Claude 3.5 Opus, Gemini Ultra, or another frontier model) maintains or takes the #1 overall rank and holds it through the resolution date. This could occur if o3-pro doesn't gain sufficient traction on the leaderboard, if it's optimized for reasoning rather than general chatbot capabilities that Chatbot Arena evaluates, or if existing competition remains stronger in human preference evaluations.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "OpenAI's newly released o3-pro performs exceptionally well in human preference evaluations and quickly accumulates enough votes to reach #1, or an existing OpenAI model (like GPT-4 or a variant) maintains its top position through June 30. The o3-pro's focus on high-performance reasoning could translate into strong general chatbot performance if it also handles conversational tasks well.",
    "rationale": "This forecast faces significant uncertainty due to the lack of current leaderboard standings as of June 15, 2025. Key considerations: (1) The 16-day timeframe is very short, suggesting the status quo heavily influences the outcome. (2) OpenAI's mid-June release of o3-pro is recent positive news, but its impact on Chatbot Arena rankings is unclear - reasoning-focused models may not align perfectly with general chatbot evaluation criteria. (3) Chatbot Arena requires substantial human evaluation data, and a newly released model may not have accumulated sufficient votes yet. (4) Historical competition has been intense between OpenAI, Anthropic, Google, and others. (5) The recent service outage is unlikely to directly affect model leaderboard rankings. My forecast would be higher (60-70%) if I knew OpenAI currently held #1 and the question was about maintaining it, or if o3-pro showed clear dominance in early evaluations. It would be lower (25-35%) if I knew OpenAI was currently ranked #3 or below, as climbing multiple positions in 16 days is difficult on Chatbot Arena. Without current data, I'm assigning roughly equal probability to OpenAI being at or very near the top versus being slightly behind, resulting in a moderate probability around 48%.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill an OpenAI model be ranked #1 overall on the Chatbot Arena Leaderboard at the end of the 2nd Quarter of 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nMethodology: [Chatbot Arena: An Open Platform for Evaluating LLMs by Human Preference](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.04132)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if a model owned by OpenAI is in the number 1 overall rank (ties count) at the [Chatbot Arena Leaderboard](https://lmarena.ai/leaderboard) when accessed by Metaculus on or after July 1, 2025. If this is not the case, this question resolves as **No**.\n\nScroll down to Arena Overview and the resolution is based on the \"overall\" rank.\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nIn mid-June 2025, OpenAI released a new model, o3-pro, which is focused on high-performance reasoning and is available to paid users.

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
