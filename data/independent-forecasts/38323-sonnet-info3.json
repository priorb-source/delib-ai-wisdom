  "information": "The ongoing trade war with China is a frequently cited source of uncertainty for American consumers, with the U.S. having doubled steel tariffs. Federal Reserve governor Christopher Waller has outlined a potential path to interest rate cuts later in the year, but noted that considerable uncertainty remains around the level of tariffs. Waller also largely dismissed the high inflation expectations recorded in the University of Michigan survey, stating a preference for market-based measures and professional forecasts.",

    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Approximately 3 weeks until the final Friday of June 2025 (June 27, 2025)",
    "status_quo_outcome": "The consumer sentiment reading will likely be in the 55-65 range based on the recent plunge mentioned in the article, with the question being whether it lands above or below the 60.0 threshold",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Consumer sentiment remains depressed below 60.0 as trade war uncertainty intensifies, tariffs continue to weigh on consumer expectations, negative economic news emerges during June, or inflation concerns persist despite Fed dismissiveness of survey-based inflation expectations",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Consumer sentiment stabilizes or recovers above 60.0 as consumers adapt to the new tariff environment, Fed signals on potential rate cuts later in the year provide reassurance, economic data shows resilience, or there's progress on trade negotiations that reduces uncertainty",
    "rationale": "The 60.0 threshold is historically quite low for the University of Michigan Consumer Sentiment Index. While the Axios article references a 'consumer sentiment plunge,' readings below 60 are relatively rare outside of severe recessions (like 2008-2009) or extreme shocks (like early COVID-19 in 2020). With only 3 weeks until the final June report, most of the month's data will already be collected, limiting the potential for dramatic changes. The research assistant notes ongoing trade war concerns and tariff uncertainty as headwinds, but also highlights that Fed Governor Waller has outlined a path to potential rate cuts and dismissed the high inflation expectations in the Michigan survey itself. This suggests some stabilization factors exist. The status quo principle suggests that if sentiment has recently fallen to the low 60s or high 50s, it's more likely to persist near current levels than to dramatically worsen in the next few weeks. The 60.0 bar is low enough that even in a challenging environment, consumer sentiment often remains above this level. My forecast is not higher because genuine concerns exist around trade policy and tariffs that could keep sentiment depressed, and the article specifically highlights this 'plunge' as being 'different now.' My forecast is not lower because the 60.0 threshold represents a fairly pessimistic scenario historically, and extreme readings require extraordinary circumstances. To update higher, I would need to see: concrete progress on trade negotiations, strong May/early June economic data, or clearer Fed dovishness. To update lower, I would need: escalating trade tensions, negative economic surprises, or preliminary June data showing sentiment in the low 50s.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill the June 2025 University of Michigan Consumer Sentiment Final Report number be greater than 60.0?\n\nQuestion background:\nAxios: [Why the consumer sentiment plunge is different now](https://www.axios.com/2025/05/19/tariffs-consumer-economy-sentiment)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if the University of Michigan's reported June Final Results of the Index of Consumer Sentiment, expected to be posted [here](https://data.sca.isr.umich.edu/reports.php) on the final Friday of June 2025, is greater than 60.0 for June 2025. Less than or equal to that amount resolves the question as **No**.\n\n\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nThe ongoing trade war with China is a frequently cited source of uncertainty for American consumers, with the U.S. having doubled steel tariffs.

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
