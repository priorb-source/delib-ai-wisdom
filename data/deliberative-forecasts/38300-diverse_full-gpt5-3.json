    "review": "Both forecasters largely echo my prior reasoning: the YoY momentum into April, a sizable positive buffer to overcome for a May YoY ≤ 0, mixed-but-not-weak hard proxies (rail/electricity flat vs April), and modestly expansionary PMIs. They appropriately flag concentration risk in energy and global softness (LEI drop, core PPI decline, China). New arguments were limited; Forecaster 2’s concern about April revisions affecting the call is not particularly relevant because the resolution depends on May 2025 vs May 2024 YoY as displayed mid-June, and April revisions don’t change that comparison. Forecaster 3’s “13-day timeframe” comment is also not decision-critical, as we’re assessing underlying May production rather than time to release. Overall, their analyses are consistent and sensible, but do not add decisive new evidence to move my estimate materially.",
    "rationale": "My base case remains that May’s YoY stays positive. With April at +1.49% YoY, flipping to ≤ 0% in May would likely require a fairly large negative m/m shock—on the order of around 1%—unless May 2024 was an unusually high base relative to April 2024. Available proxies (rail/electricity tracking April, auto assemblies rebounding) point to flat-to-slight growth rather than a sharp drop, and PMIs in expansion provide some corroboration. The risks (energy-led gains reversing, persistent non-energy weakness, LEI and global softness) keep me from going higher, but there’s no concrete sign of a one-month downdraft big enough to erase the existing YoY cushion. Given that the other forecasters did not introduce new hard evidence that would materially change the balance of risks, I’m holding my estimate steady.",
