    "review": "The other two forecasters and I have reached a strong consensus, with forecasts tightly clustered at 70% and 75%. We all identify the same key drivers: the company is in a long flight hiatus, reducing the natural sources of news; there is a current three-month gap in posts, establishing a status quo of silence; and most critically, the Q1 earnings release on May 15, the most predictable event of the month, has a strong precedent of being posted to Investor Relations rather than the main News page. The reasoning from both forecasters is convincing and aligns almost perfectly with my own. The minor difference in probability (70% vs. 75%) reflects a slightly different weighting of the chance of an unforeseen, ad-hoc announcement. Forecaster 2 introduced some valuable, specific scenarios for a 'No' outcome that I hadn't explicitly articulated, such as the hiring of a new CCO or increased pressure from competitor communications. These are excellent points that help define the 25-30% chance of a post.",
    "rationale": "After reviewing the other analyses, I will maintain my forecast of 75%. The deliberation process did not uncover new evidence that fundamentally changes the outlook; rather, it reinforced that the core arguments for a 'Yes' outcome are robust and widely agreed upon. The other forecasters' points about potential catalysts for a post—like a new communications head or competitor activity—are valid, but I believe my initial probability already accounts for this category of unpredictable corporate actions. The evidence supporting the 'Yes' outcome remains much more concrete: no flights are scheduled, and the primary scheduled event for May (Q1 earnings) is almost certain to bypass the News page based on recent, established precedent. This combination of no operational activity and a specific, confirmed pattern for handling financial news makes another month of silence the most likely outcome. My 75% forecast acknowledges a 1-in-4 chance that the company makes a strategic decision to post something unexpected, which feels like an appropriate weight for such an uncertainty against the strong evidence for inaction.",
