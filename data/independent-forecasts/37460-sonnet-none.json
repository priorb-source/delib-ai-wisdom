    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Approximately 55 days until July 1, 2025",
    "status_quo_outcome": "Based on the Wikipedia reference to '2025 Turkish protests', it appears protests have already occurred or are occurring in Turkey in 2025, making a Yes outcome increasingly likely if these protests meet the size and reporting criteria",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "No protests in Turkey reach 10,000+ participants before July 1, 2025, or protests of this size occur but the Global Protest Tracker does not report them due to verification challenges, reporting delays, or documentation gaps in their database",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Large-scale protests occur in Turkey with 10,000 or more participants - potentially related to political, economic, or social issues - and the Global Protest Tracker documents these events in their database with appropriate start dates before the July 1, 2025 deadline",
    "rationale": "The Wikipedia reference to '2025 Turkish protests' is a significant positive signal suggesting that notable protests have already occurred or are occurring in Turkey this year. Wikipedia articles typically document events that meet notability thresholds, implying these protests are substantial. Turkey has a documented history of large-scale demonstrations, including the 2013 Gezi Park protests and various political rallies, showing capacity for mobilizing 10,000+ participants. However, several uncertainties affect the forecast: (1) Whether these protests specifically meet the 10,000+ participant threshold, (2) Whether the Global Protest Tracker has documented or will document these specific protests, (3) Potential lag time between protests occurring and database updates, and (4) The Global Protest Tracker's specific selection criteria and coverage gaps. The Carnegie Endowment's Global Protest Tracker is comprehensive but may not capture all protests immediately or may have different participant count estimates. With 55 days remaining, there's adequate time for either new protests to occur or existing protests to be documented. My forecast is not higher because of uncertainty around the Global Protest Tracker's specific coverage and whether protests meet the exact numerical threshold. It's not lower because the Wikipedia reference provides strong evidence of significant 2025 Turkish protest activity, and Turkey's protest history suggests 10,000+ participant events are realistic. I would update higher with evidence of specific large protests being reported in news sources with clear participant counts, or confirmation of Global Protest Tracker entries. I would update lower if reports indicated only smaller-scale protests or if the tracker showed no recent Turkey entries by mid-June.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill the Global Protest Tracker report any protests in Turkey (Türkiye) with 10,000+ participants, before July 1, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nWikipedia: [2025 Turkish protests](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2025_Turkish_protests)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if the [Global Protest Tracker](https://carnegieendowment.org/features/global-protest-tracker?lang=en) reports a protest in Turkey (Türkiye) with 10,000 or more participants with a start date after the launch of this question and before July 1, 2025.\n\nPlease note that the Global Protest Tracker uses the name Türkiye in its database.\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nNo additional information available.\n\nToday is 2025-05-07.\n\nBefore answering you think:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n(e) You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
