    "review": "Both forecasters largely echo my base case: a tug-of-war between persistence of negative catalysts (tariffs, elevated inflation expectations, labor-market worries, equity volatility) and near-floor mean reversion plus month-to-month noise. The main incremental emphasis I took from Forecaster 2 is seasonal gasoline price pressure as an additional headwind, and from both, a clearer articulation of how low the threshold is for a Yes given typical U-Mich volatility. Neither introduced materially new data, but their framing nudges me to acknowledge the bounce/noise risk a bit more than I did.",
    "rationale": "I still lean slightly No because the April plunge reflected accumulating and broad-based concerns, and the jump in 1-year inflation expectations tends to be sticky. Tariff-related price headlines and any lingering market volatility into the early May survey window likely cap a rebound. However, given how depressed 50.8 is, the probability of a small mean-reversion uptick or noise-driven lift above the threshold is non-trivial. Balancing persistence of negatives against floor effects and typical month-to-month variability, I’m modestly increasing my probability of a Yes from 40% to 43%. I’d move higher with evidence of tariff de-escalation, easing gas prices, or a sustained equity rebound; lower with fresh tariff salvos, higher gas prices, or deteriorating labor headlines/claims.",
