    "review": "I reviewed the analyses from two other forecasters. Forecaster 3's analysis was exceptionally strong and aligned closely with my own initial reasoning, but added significant value. They correctly translated the threshold to EUR/USD > 1.25, provided crucial historical context on how rare this level has been since 2014, and accurately framed the required move as a multi-standard-deviation event in such a short timeframe. Most importantly, they identified a specific, plausible catalyst for the resolution window: a potential US debt ceiling crisis in early-to-mid 2025. This adds a concrete scenario to my more general 'systemic shock' reasoning. Forecaster 2's reasoning also pointed toward a 'No' outcome, highlighting factors like mean reversion and potential central bank intervention, which I agree with. However, their final forecast of 18% seems inconsistent with their own arguments, which largely support a very low probability. The justification for such a high number was not compelling to me. Ultimately, Forecaster 3's rigorous analysis reinforced my conviction in a low probability, while Forecaster 2's arguments, despite their high final number, provided additional reasons to lean towards 'No'.",
    "rationale": "After deliberation, my forecast remains unchanged. Forecaster 3's analysis strongly validated my initial assessment. The core of my reasoning is that a depreciation of the USD to under 0.80 EUR (i.e., EUR/USD appreciating past 1.25) would be a massive move of over 15% from the current approximate rate of 1.09 EUR/USD. Accomplishing this in the short, less-than-two-month resolution window would require an extraordinary catalyst. Forecaster 3's base rate analysis confirms this, noting that the 1.25 level has been exceedingly rare since 2014, making a 'Yes' outcome a significant historical outlier. Their identification of the 2025 debt ceiling crisis as a plausible US-specific shock is a crucial consideration. While such a political crisis could certainly induce extreme volatility, a currency move of this magnitude would still be an unprecedented reaction compared to historical precedents. The arguments from Forecaster 2 regarding likely central bank intervention to prevent destabilizing currency moves further supports a 'No' outcome. My 5% forecast is maintained to account for the non-zero probability of a severe, US-centric shock—such as an unexpectedly messy debt ceiling standoff or a sudden financial crisis—causing a brief, sharp spike that crosses the threshold, even if only for an intraday high.",
