  "information": "China's Consumer Price Index (CPI) has registered three consecutive months of year-on-year deflation: -0.7% in February, -0.1% in March, and -0.1% in April 2025. The Producer Price Index (PPI), a measure of factory-gate prices, has also shown sustained deflationary pressure, declining for 31 consecutive months. In April, the PPI fell by 2.7% year-on-year, the largest decline in six months. Core CPI, which excludes food and energy, has remained positive but low, at around +0.5% year-on-year.\n\nChina's manufacturing activity contracted for the second consecutive month in May, with the manufacturing Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) standing at 49.5, below the 50-point mark that separates growth from contraction. The non-manufacturing PMI also showed a slight decline to 50.3 in May from 50.4 in the previous month. In the property sector, new-home sales from the 100 largest developers fell by 8.6% year-on-year in May, following an 8.7% drop in April.\n\nSpecific components influencing China's inflation data include energy and food prices. Brent crude oil averaged $84 in May 2025, a 4% increase from a year earlier. However, the year-on-year change in domestic energy prices remained negative. Pork prices, a key component of the food basket, also remained lower than a year ago due to high inventories. On the policy front, the People's Bank of China implemented a 10 basis point reserve requirement ratio (RRR) cut in mid-May.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "About 10 days (NBS/FRED May CPI typically posts around mid-June 2025)",
    "status_quo_outcome": "Yes — a fourth straight month of slightly negative YoY CPI (around -0.1% to -0.3%)",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Holiday-driven services prices and less-negative energy lift headline CPI to 0.0% or +0.1% YoY despite ongoing weakness in goods, so FRED shows non-negative for May.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Food (notably pork) and energy remain negative YoY, demand stays soft, and core remains tepid (~+0.5%), pulling the headline below 0.0% again for May.",
    "rationale": "Recent data point to continued mild deflation: headline CPI was negative for Feb (-0.7%), Mar (-0.1%), and Apr (-0.1%). PPI deflation deepened in Apr (-2.7% YoY), signaling persistent pipeline disinflation. Activity indicators are soft: manufacturing PMI 49.5 in May, property sales still falling. The research assistant notes pork prices remain below last year and domestic energy prices are still negative YoY; both are key drags on headline CPI. Core CPI remains positive but subdued (~+0.5%), insufficient on its own to pull headline clearly positive. Counterweights exist: Brent averaged ~4% higher YoY in May and the May Day holiday could buoy services prices, potentially nudging the headline toward zero. A modest mid-May RRR cut is unlikely to move May prices materially. Given April’s -0.1% and similar component dynamics in May, the status quo favors another small negative print, but the result is close to zero and sensitive to rounding at FRED’s presentation. Why not higher than my forecast: oil’s YoY rise and holiday services could tip to 0.0–+0.1. Why not lower: entrenched goods deflation, weak property, and pork/energy drags. I would raise the probability if high-frequency hog prices and fuel remained clearly below last year through late May, or if early media leaks guided to sub-zero. I would lower it if indications show a stronger services CPI pop, gasoline price hikes pushing energy positive YoY, or reports of a 0.0/+0.1 consensus ahead of release.",

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
