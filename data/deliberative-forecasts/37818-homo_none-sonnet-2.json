    "review": "All three forecasters converge on similar reasoning and estimates (12-22% range), which suggests we're thinking about the problem correctly. Key areas of agreement include: Florida's strong aviation profile (commercial hubs, military presence, year-round weather), the challenge posed by competitors like California and Texas, the lack of historical baseline data, and the stringent tie-breaks-to-No rule. Forecaster 2 raised a good point about Arizona/Nevada military testing ranges that I hadn't explicitly considered. Forecaster 3's emphasis that California 'likely has even higher total aviation activity' is particularly salient - California has more airports, more flight operations, and a larger aviation sector overall. Both forecasters seem slightly more bullish on Florida's chances than I was initially. The clustering of our estimates around 12-22% suggests treating Florida as one of 5-8 competitive states is reasonable, which mathematically would suggest 12.5-20% for a uniform distribution among competitors.",
    "rationale": "Upon reflection, my initial 12% may have been slightly too conservative. If we genuinely believe Florida is one of 5-8 competitive states with no strong reason to rank it below the others in that group, a uniform distribution would suggest 12.5-20%. Florida's combination of factors - major commercial airports (Miami, Orlando, Tampa), significant military aviation (multiple bases), favorable year-round weather, and extensive coastal airspace - does create a genuinely competitive profile. However, I remain cautious about going too high because: (1) California almost certainly has higher total aviation activity nationally, making it a strong competitor, (2) Texas, Arizona, and Nevada also have compelling profiles, (3) we lack any historical evidence that Florida typically leads in pilot UFO sightings specifically, and (4) the tie-breaks-to-No rule creates a strict threshold. The other forecasters' analyses don't introduce fundamentally new information that would justify a major update, but their slightly higher confidence (17-22%) suggests my initial conservatism may have been excessive. I'll update modestly upward to 15%, acknowledging Florida's competitive position while maintaining caution given California's aviation dominance and the lack of supporting historical data.",
