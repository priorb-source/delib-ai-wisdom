    "review": "Forecaster 3 provides critical empirical data that fundamentally changes this forecast: 105 objectives were already marked 'Done' as of April 16, 2025, with an observed completion rate of 0.625 objectives per day in early-mid April. This means only 15 additional objectives are needed over what was then a 76-day period (now 46 days from today). Even with significant slowdown, this threshold appears highly achievable. Forecaster 2's concerns about policy friction and slow rulemaking are valid in general but seem less determinative when starting from such a high baseline with such a modest increment needed. The math is compelling: at even half the observed April rate (0.3/day), we'd expect ~14 more completions by July 1, reaching ~119. At the full rate, we'd far exceed 120. My initial 48% forecast was anchored too heavily on baseline uncertainty and insufficiently considered that early 2025 likely saw rapid completions through executive actions.",
    "rationale": "The decisive factor is Forecaster 3's data point: 105 objectives were already completed by April 16, 2025. From that baseline, reaching 120 requires only 15 more completions over what was then 76 days (0.2/day required rate). The observed rate in early-mid April was 0.625/day - more than triple what's needed. Even accounting for: (1) potential slowdown as 'easy' objectives are exhausted, (2) typical mid-term policy implementation friction, (3) possible litigation or political obstacles, and (4) one month having passed since that data point - the required increment remains very modest. If we conservatively assume the rate dropped by 60% to 0.25/day, we'd still expect about 19 more completions from April 16 to July 1, reaching ~124. For this to fail, progress would need to have essentially halted since April, which seems unlikely given 44 objectives were listed as 'in progress'. However, I'm not going to 90% because: (1) I cannot independently verify Forecaster 3's data source, (2) tracker methodology could change or items could be reclassified, (3) unforeseen political or technical issues could emerge, (4) the site could experience maintenance issues. But the burden of proof has shifted - the question is now why this wouldn't happen, not why it would.",
