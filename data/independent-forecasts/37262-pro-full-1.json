  "information": "In April 2025, several protests occurred in India related to land and religious laws. On April 14, protests against a Muslim land law in eastern India turned violent, resulting in three reported deaths. Separately, from April 8-12, violent protests against the Waqf Act took place in Murshidabad, West Bengal. Muslim communities also held symbolic \"Lights Off\" protests against the Waqf (Amendment) Act, 2025. Ongoing communal tensions have been noted in West Bengal and Uttarakhand.\n\nReports from various news outlets indicate several planned or recent mobilizations. The Free Press Journal reported on a planned march involving 10,000 farmers. India Today has covered rallies organized by the Trinamool Congress (TMC) for teachers. Additionally, a global housing action day protest was scheduled for April 26, 2025, with events planned in multiple countries, including India.\n\nIndia has a history of large-scale demonstrations that have exceeded 10,000 participants, including the farmers' protests of 2020-2021 and the anti-CAA protests of 2019-2020. The Global Protest Tracker recorded 145 anti-government protests worldwide in the 12 months preceding May 2025. Reports also indicate that authorities in India have used technologies such as drones with facial recognition to identify participants in farmer protests and subsequently confiscate their passports.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Approximately 2 months, until July 1, 2025.",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No. As of today, the Global Protest Tracker has not reported a protest in India meeting the specified criteria within the given timeframe.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Despite ongoing tensions and planned demonstrations, no single protest event in India reaches the 10,000 participant threshold. Alternatively, a protest of this size occurs but is not captured and reported by the Global Protest Tracker before the resolution date of July 1, 2025.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "One of the several current points of contention, such as the protests against land laws or agricultural policies, escalates significantly, drawing a crowd of over 10,000 participants. The protest receives sufficient media attention to be documented by the Global Protest Tracker with a start date before July 1, 2025.",
    "rationale": "My forecast of 65% is based on the high number of active and potent social and political triggers in India, balanced against the short timeframe and specific reporting requirements.\n\nThe key factor supporting a 'Yes' outcome is the current volatile environment. The research report highlights several ongoing issues with the potential for mass mobilization: protests against land and religious laws (Waqf Act, Muslim land law) that have already turned violent, and planned farmer protests, including one intending to mobilize 10,000 participants. This indicates both the means and the motive for large-scale demonstrations are present. Historically, India has seen massive protests, such as the 2020-2021 farmers' protests, demonstrating a capacity to exceed the 10,000-participant threshold.\n\nThe probability is not higher primarily due to two factors. First, the two-month timeframe is relatively short, and protest movements can lose momentum. Second, the resolution hinges specifically on the Global Protest Tracker. There could be a lag in their reporting, or their criteria might exclude an otherwise qualifying event. Furthermore, the report notes active government suppression tactics, including surveillance and passport confiscation, which could deter participation and limit a protest's scale.\n\nConversely, the probability is not lower because the confluence of multiple, high-stakes issues makes the status quo feel unstable. The recent deaths at a protest suggest tensions are at a point where a large-scale event is more likely than not. It seems probable that at least one of the existing flashpoints will boil over into a protest large enough to meet the criteria within the next two months.\n\nI would increase my forecast if there were concrete reports of protest organizers confirming a date and location for a large-scale march. I would decrease my forecast if there were significant de-escalation, such as the government repealing a contentious law or successfully negotiating with protest leaders.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill the Global Protest Tracker report any protests in India with 10,000+ participants, before July 1, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nReuters: [Three dead as protests against Muslim land law turn violent in eastern India](https://www.reuters.com/world/india/three-dead-protests-against-muslim-land-law-turn-violent-eastern-india-2025-04-14/)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below.

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
