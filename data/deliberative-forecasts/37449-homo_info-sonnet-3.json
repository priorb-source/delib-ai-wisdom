    "review": "Forecaster 3 raises crucial historical evidence I had not fully considered: the US avoided using 'blockade' terminology even during the 1995-1996 Taiwan Strait Crisis, a major confrontation. This suggests strong institutional and diplomatic reasons for restraint on this specific term. Additionally, the April 2025 pattern shows the US still using cautious language ('putting regional security at risk') despite Chinese military exercises, reinforcing this restraint pattern. This historical precedent is highly relevant and actually strengthens the case for a low probability. Forecaster 2's analysis closely aligns with mine, emphasizing the exercise vs. actual blockade distinction and the short timeframe. Both Forecaster 2 and I arrived at 4%, while Forecaster 3's 10% appears to weight tail risk more heavily. However, I find the historical evidence about US rhetorical restraint compelling - if they avoided 'blockade' in 1995-1996, the precedent strongly suggests continuation of that pattern.",
    "rationale": "After reviewing the other forecasters' analyses, the most significant new information is the historical precedent of US restraint on blockade terminology, even during major crises. This reinforces my original reasoning rather than challenging it. The question requires two conditions: (1) China must actually blockade Taiwan's seaports (not just conduct exercises), and (2) the US must publicly accuse them using this specific terminology. The historical evidence shows the US has strong diplomatic reasons to avoid the term 'blockade' as it carries significant legal and military implications. With only 56 days remaining, the status quo of exercises without actual interdiction of shipping remains overwhelmingly likely. China continues to achieve intimidation objectives through gray zone tactics without crossing into acts of war. Recent April 2025 events confirm this pattern continues. The 4% probability appropriately captures tail risk of unexpected escalation while heavily weighting the strong historical pattern, short timeframe, and high threshold for both actual blockade implementation and US willingness to use this terminology.",
