    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Approximately 1.5 months.",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No. It is slightly more likely that Donald Trump's stable, base-driven approval rating will be higher than or equal to the initial, more uncertain rating of a brand new Prime Minister Mark Carney.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Donald Trump's approval rating in the initial months of his second term stabilizes in his historical range of 42-45%, supported by his loyal base. Mark Carney, having recently become Prime Minister through a party leadership change rather than a general election, experiences a muted 'honeymoon period' with his approval rating starting in the high 30s or low 40s, failing to surpass Trump's.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Mark Carney's appointment as Prime Minister is viewed favorably by Canadians as a new era of technocratic competence, providing him with a strong honeymoon-period approval rating in the mid-to-high 40s. Simultaneously, Donald Trump's second term begins with a series of divisive policies and controversies, keeping his approval rating suppressed in the low 40s, below Carney's.",
    "rationale": "This forecast is based on the provided hypothetical premise that Mark Carney is the Canadian Prime Minister and Donald Trump is the US President on July 1, 2025. The core of the forecast is a comparison between the likely approval rating of a known political quantity and a new, untested national leader.\n\nDonald Trump's approval ratings throughout his first presidency were remarkably stable and polarized. Data from Morning Consult and other pollsters show his rating consistently fluctuating within a relatively narrow band, typically between the high 30s and mid-40s. This stability is due to a deeply loyal base of support and equally steadfast opposition. Six months into a second term, it is highly probable his approval rating will revert to this historical mean, likely sitting somewhere in the 40-45% range.\n\nMark Carney's approval rating as a new Prime Minister is more speculative. Typically, a new leader replacing a long-serving and less popular predecessor enjoys a 'honeymoon' period with elevated approval ratings. However, Carney's background is in central banking, not electoral politics, making his public appeal an unknown variable. While he may be seen as a competent manager, he could also be attacked by opponents as an out-of-touch 'globalist elite'. His initial approval rating has a wide range of possibilities, but a starting point in the high 30s to mid-40s seems plausible.\n\nThe key to this forecast is the comparison. Trump's approval has a high floor due to his base. Carney's approval is uncertain. Given that a tie resolves as 'No', the question favors Trump. For a 'Yes' outcome, Carney's approval must be definitively higher. It is slightly more probable that Trump's stable rating will be equal to or greater than Carney's initial, more volatile rating.\n\nMy forecast is not lower (i.e., closer to 0) because a strong honeymoon for Carney is a distinct possibility. Canadians may embrace the change, pushing his approval into the high 40s, which would likely be sufficient for a 'Yes' resolution. My forecast is not higher (i.e., closer to 100) because of the stability of Trump's support; it is unlikely his approval rating will crater far below 40%, providing a difficult benchmark for Carney to overcome.\n\nI would update this forecast towards 'Yes' if early polling in Canada showed exceptionally strong public support for a new PM Carney, or if President Trump's administration faced major, base-eroding scandals before July. I would update towards 'No' if the transition to Carney proved politically messy and unpopular in Canada.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney have a higher approval rating than US President Donald Trump on July 1, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nResolution source updates monthly. According to Morning Consult for January 2025: \"The latest approval ratings are based on data collected from Jan. 21-27, 2025. Ratings reflect a trailing seven-day simple moving average of views among adults in each country surveyed.\"\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if Mark Carney has a higher approval rating than US President Donald Trump according to [Morning Consult](https://pro.morningconsult.com/trackers/global-leader-approval) when checked by Metaculus on or after July 1, 2025. If this not the case (including due to a tie), this resolves as **No**.\n\n\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nNo additional information available.\n\nToday is 2025-05-15.\n\nBefore answering you think:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n(e) You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
