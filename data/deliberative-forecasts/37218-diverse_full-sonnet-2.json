    "review": "All three forecasters converge on a very low probability (5-8%), which strengthens confidence in this assessment. Forecaster 2's analysis is nearly identical to mine, emphasizing the unprecedented nature of international attendance and the unfavorable timing. Forecaster 3 raises one argument I didn't explicitly address: Montreal's proximity to the US Northeast as a mitigating factor. This is a fair point - Montreal is only 6-7 hours from NYC by car, making it less logistically challenging than events in Europe or Asia. However, I find this argument insufficient to warrant a meaningful update for several reasons: (1) it's still an international trip requiring border crossing and different security protocols, (2) Trump is now a sitting president in 2025, making diplomatic and security considerations more complex than during his private citizen years, (3) the contentious relationship with Trudeau makes the optics potentially problematic, and (4) Joe Rogan's explicit refusal to attend due to political disagreements with Canada suggests the barrier isn't merely geographical. Forecaster 3's point about the absence of a mega-star like McGregor is also valid and reinforces the low probability. The lack of a compelling draw beyond the Dana White relationship makes attendance even less likely.",
    "rationale": "After reviewing the other forecasters' analyses, I maintain my assessment that the status quo strongly favors non-attendance. The convergence on 5-8% across all three forecasters validates this as the appropriate range. While Forecaster 3's proximity argument has merit, it doesn't overcome the fundamental barriers: (1) the complete absence of precedent for presidential UFC attendance outside the US, (2) Trump's recent Miami appearance just four weeks prior, (3) the strained US-Canada diplomatic relationship under Trump and Trudeau, (4) Joe Rogan's pointed refusal to attend for political reasons, and (5) the lack of a McGregor-level star to serve as a special draw. The fact that Trump is a sitting president in 2025 actually strengthens the case for non-attendance compared to his private citizen years, as security and diplomatic protocols are more complex. Montreal's proximity reduces logistical burden but doesn't eliminate the international border crossing and its attendant complications. I see no compelling reason to deviate from my 5% forecast.",
