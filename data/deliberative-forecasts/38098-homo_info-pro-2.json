    "review": "The other forecasters' analyses reinforce my initial assessment while adding crucial details that warrant a forecast adjustment. Forecaster 2's emphasis on Senator Graham's consolidation of establishment support, particularly the endorsement from Donald Trump, is a powerful argument against a successful primary challenge, thus making an announcement less likely. Forecaster 3 provided the most compelling new argument: the strategic disadvantage for a challenger to declare their candidacy so far in advance of the 2026 filing deadline. This provides a strong reason for why Ralph Norman *would not* announce before July 1, 2025, even if he were secretly planning a run. I find the reasoning for Forecaster 2's 15% to be too high given the mountain of evidence to the contrary, but I find Forecaster 3's analysis and 3% forecast to be extremely convincing and well-supported.",
    "rationale": "I am updating my forecast downward from 5% to 3%. My initial reasoning was based on the strong evidence that Norman is focused on a gubernatorial run and the short time remaining before the deadline. The deliberation with other forecasters has strengthened this conviction. I was particularly persuaded by Forecaster 3's point regarding the strategic disadvantage of an early announcement. There is no procedural requirement for Norman to declare now, and doing so would only expend resources and give the incumbent a clear and early target. This significantly lowers the probability of an announcement in the specific timeframe of this question. Additionally, Forecaster 2's point about Donald Trump's endorsement of Lindsey Graham underscores the immense political barrier Norman would face, making a sudden, ill-prepared campaign launch even more improbable. The combination of all factors—Norman's stated gubernatorial interest, his office's denials of a Senate run, the lack of any preparatory activity, the strength of the incumbent, and the strategic folly of an early announcement—makes a 'Yes' resolution exceedingly unlikely.",
