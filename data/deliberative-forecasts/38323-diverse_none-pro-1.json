    "review": "My initial forecast (35%) was heavily anchored on the reported May 'plunge' in sentiment, assuming strong negative momentum would carry the index below 60. Both other forecasters provided a critical and convincing counter-argument that I had underweighted: the historical significance of the 60.0 level. Forecaster 2 correctly pointed out that sub-60 readings are historically rare and typically correspond to major economic crises. Forecaster 3 quantified this by noting that breaching 60 would require another large, consecutive monthly drop, which is statistically less common than stabilization or a partial rebound. Their reasoning, focused on historical base rates and the magnitude of change required, is more robust than my initial momentum-based analysis. I find their collective argument that the burden of proof lies on the 'No' outcome persuasive.",
    "rationale": "I am significantly updating my forecast based on the deliberation. My initial analysis over-indexed on the negative signal from the May sentiment drop and under-indexed on the historical rarity of sub-60 readings. The other forecasters' arguments have convinced me that the 60.0 level acts as a strong historical floor, and breaching it requires conditions more severe than what is currently described. A large drop in one month is often followed by stabilization or mean reversion, not necessarily another large drop. While the concerns driving sentiment down (tariffs, inflation) are real and create significant downside risk, the base case should be that the index remains above this crisis-level threshold. Therefore, I am shifting my forecast from 35% to 62%, moving from a belief that 'No' is more likely to a belief that 'Yes' is the more probable outcome. My forecast remains below those of the other forecasters to reflect the genuine fragility of consumer confidence and the potential for upcoming data, such as the May CPI report, to deliver a negative shock that could push the index below 60.",
