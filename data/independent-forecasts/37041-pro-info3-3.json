  "information": "Several countries near the outbreak zones have implemented preventive measures. Panama has activated health protocols, although it has not reported a human case since 1974 and has vaccination coverage of over 95% in high-risk areas. Ecuador has also activated protocols and is conducting preventive vaccination campaigns. Costa Rica has made the yellow fever vaccine mandatory for travelers arriving from 43 countries, including many in South America, as of March 11, 2025, due to the presence of the Aedes aegypti mosquito vector in the country.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Approximately 5 weeks.",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No. Currently, no North American country has a CDC travel advisory for yellow fever.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "The current yellow fever outbreak in South America is contained by ongoing public health efforts. Proactive measures in Central American countries, such as vaccination campaigns in Panama and traveler vaccination requirements in Costa Rica, successfully prevent the virus from being imported and establishing local transmission. No cases are reported in North America, so the CDC has no reason to issue a travel advisory.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "An unvaccinated traveler from an outbreak zone in South America introduces yellow fever into a Central American country with the Aedes aegypti mosquito vector, such as Panama or Costa Rica. The virus establishes a local transmission cycle before being detected. The discovery of human cases prompts the CDC to issue a travel health notice for that country to protect U.S. travelers.",
    "rationale": "My forecast is based on the high efficacy of existing public health measures and the short timeframe. The status quo is that no North American country has a yellow fever advisory, and this is a stable, long-standing situation. The research indicates that the countries most at risk, like Panama and Costa Rica, are implementing strong, proactive measures. Panama's vaccination coverage of over 95% in high-risk zones and Costa Rica's vaccine mandate for travelers from affected regions are significant barriers to the virus's spread. Yellow fever is not a novel virus; control strategies are well-established and effective. For the outcome to be 'Yes,' the virus would have to overcome these defenses and establish transmission in a new country within the next five weeks, which is a rapid escalation. The probability is not zero because the PAHO alert indicates a heightened risk environment in South America, increasing the chances of an imported case. A single case slipping through could potentially initiate an outbreak if conditions are right (e.g., presence of the mosquito vector, susceptible population). I would increase my forecast if there were credible reports of confirmed yellow fever cases in any Central American country. Conversely, I would lower my forecast if PAHO announced that the South American outbreak was declining or contained.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill any North American country be listed as having a CDC yellow fever travel advisory on June 1, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\n[PAHO issues new epidemiological alert amid rising yellow fever cases in the Americas](https://www.paho.org/en/news/31-3-2025-paho-issues-new-epidemiological-alert-amid-rising-yellow-fever-cases-americas)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if a country in North America is listed as having a travel advisory by the Centers for Disease Control at its [Travel Health Notices](https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/travel/notices) page when checked by Metaculus on or after June 1, 2025.\n\n\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nSeveral countries near the outbreak zones have implemented preventive measures. Panama has activated health protocols, although it has not reported a human case since 1974 and has vaccination coverage of over 95% in high-risk areas. Ecuador has also activated protocols and is conducting preventive vaccination campaigns. Costa Rica has made the yellow fever vaccine mandatory for travelers arriving from 43 countries, including many in South America, as of March 11, 2025, due to the presence of the Aedes aegypti mosquito vector in the country.\n\nToday is 2025-04-24.\n\nBefore answering you think:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n(e) You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
