  "information": "In the first five months of 2025, three countries signed the Artemis Accords: Finland (January 23), Bangladesh (April 8), and Norway (May 15), bringing the total number of signatories to 55. This follows the signings of Panama and Austria in December 2024. In a statement on May 22, 2025, acting NASA Administrator Janet Petro said that NASA anticipates additional countries will sign the accords in the coming weeks and months.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Approximately one month. The outcome will be determined by events occurring between June 1, 2025, and June 30, 2025.",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No. If no new signatory is announced in June 2025, the status quo of 55 signatories holds through the resolution period.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Despite ongoing diplomatic efforts and interest from several nations, no country completes its internal approval process and arranges a signing ceremony within the 30-day window of June 2025. A signing that was anticipated for June might be pushed into July due to logistical or minor political delays.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "A country that has been in advanced discussions with the United States finalizes its accession to the Accords. A signing ceremony is held and officially announced by the U.S. State Department or NASA between June 1 and June 30, 2025.",
    "rationale": "My forecast is primarily driven by the strong recent momentum and explicit forward-looking statements from officials. There has been a steady pace of new signatories, with three countries joining in the first five months of 2025 (Finland, Bangladesh, Norway) and eight in 2024. This demonstrates a consistent and ongoing diplomatic effort. Crucially, acting NASA Administrator Janet Petro stated on May 22, 2025, that she anticipates additional signatories in the 'coming weeks and months.' The phrase 'coming weeks' is a strong signal that at least one more signing is in the late stages of negotiation and is expected imminently, making the June timeframe highly plausible. My probability is not higher because diplomatic timelines are inherently uncertain. A signing planned for late June could easily slip into early July for mundane administrative or scheduling reasons, which would result in a 'No' outcome for this specific question. The window of one month is narrow. My probability is not lower because the combination of the recent signing rate and the specific, positive language from a key official provides strong evidence against the status quo. To update higher, I would look for news reports naming a specific country as a likely near-term signatory. To update lower, I would require information suggesting a slowdown in diplomatic talks or an extension of expected timelines.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill a country sign the Artemis Accords in June 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nThe most recent signatory was Bangladesh, on April 8, 2025 and [Norway](https://www.state.gov/united-states-welcomes-norways-signing-of-the-artemis-accords/) on May 15, 2025. There are 55 signatories at the time of this question: Angola, Argentina, Armenia, Australia, Austria, Bahrain, Bangladesh, Belgium, Brazil, Bulgaria, Canada, Chile, Colombia, the Republic of Cyprus, Czech Republic, Denmark, Dominican Republic, Ecuador, Estonia, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Iceland, India, Israel, Italy, Japan, Liechtenstein, Lithuania, Luxembourg, Mexico, Netherlands, New Zealand, Nigeria, Norway, Panama, Peru, Poland, the Republic of Korea, Romania, Rwanda, Saudi Arabia, Singapore, Slovakia, Slovenia, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, Thailand, Ukraine, the United Arab Emirates, the United Kingdom, the United States, and Uruguay. [(source)](https://www.state.gov/bureau-of-oceans-and-international-environmental-and-scientific-affairs/artemis-accords)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if a country becomes an Artemis Accord signatory after May 30, 2025 and before July 1, 2025.\n\n\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nIn the first five months of 2025, three countries signed the Artemis Accords: Finland (January 23), Bangladesh (April 8), and Norway (May 15), bringing the total number of signatories to 55. This follows the signings of Panama and Austria in December 2024. In a statement on May 22, 2025, acting NASA Administrator Janet Petro said that NASA anticipates additional countries will sign the accords in the coming weeks and months.\n\nToday is 2025-05-29.\n\nBefore answering you think:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n(e) You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
