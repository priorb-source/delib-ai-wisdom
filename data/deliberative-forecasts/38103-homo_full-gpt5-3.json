    "review": "Both forecasters emphasize the key resolution nuance: it depends on the explicit Tesla mention on the specific BC Hydro page, not just underlying policy. They also highlight the short time horizon and political backing as reasons for persistence. New/useful angles I hadn’t weighed as much: (1) the modest rebate size reduces pressure for rapid policy change; (2) the risk that the page is restructured or shifted to brand-neutral wording is the primary path to a No outcome. I agree that broader sales/protest dynamics are secondary given the page-based criterion and short window. Forecaster 2’s 86% feels a bit high given the nontrivial communication/website-risk; Forecaster 3’s 77% aligns closely with my prior. Overall, their reasoning nudges me slightly upward due to the short horizon and the likelihood BC Hydro keeps explicit consumer guidance visible.",
    "rationale": "Baseline: As of Mar 12, 2025, the page explicitly excludes Tesla products, and provincial leaders publicly defended the stance as part of a broader Canada-first procurement posture. With just about a month to July 1, policy inertia is strong. The most credible No path is not policy reversal but a communications change: shifting the page to brand-neutral eligibility criteria or a page reorg that drops the explicit Tesla line. However, because this is a consumer-facing rebate and Tesla is a common brand, keeping the explicit call-out reduces confusion and is likely to persist into early July. The modest size of the rebate further reduces pressure for a quick reversal or rewrite. I slightly raise my forecast to reflect the short time horizon and website-change inertia, while still accounting for a meaningful risk (about 20%) of a page wording or structure change that removes the Tesla mention on that specific URL by July 1.",
