    "review": "I have reviewed the analyses from two other forecasters. Both agree that the status quo strongly favors a 'No' outcome due to the short two-month timeframe and Russia's deep military commitment in Ukraine. Forecaster 2 provided a crucial insight I had not fully weighted: the possibility of a U.S. *rhetorical shift*. The resolution hinges on a U.S. 'accusation,' which could occur even without a new military event if the U.S. chose to re-label Russia's existing presence in a country like Georgia or Moldova as an 'invasion.' This introduces a separate, non-military pathway to a 'Yes' resolution. I found this argument highly convincing. Forecaster 3's analysis, arriving at a higher 7%, appears to be influenced by specific intelligence reports of a troop buildup which Forecaster 2 flagged as non-credible. I concur with Forecaster 2's skepticism and find Forecaster 3's reasoning less persuasive as it seems to overweight a tail risk based on questionable data.",
    "rationale": "My initial forecast of 3% was primarily based on the low probability of Russia launching a new ground invasion into another country, given its forces are heavily attritted and focused on Ukraine. The operational barriers and the short two-month time horizon make such a scenario very unlikely. However, after considering the other forecasts, I am making a small upward revision. The most compelling point, raised by Forecaster 2, is that the resolution can be met by a U.S. *accusation* alone, which does not strictly require a new military action. This opens a second pathway to a 'Yes' outcome: a political decision by the U.S. to rhetorically reclassify an existing Russian military presence, such as the one in Georgia or Moldova's Transnistria region, as an 'invasion.' While a sudden change in established diplomatic terminology ('occupation' or 'illegal presence') is not common without a specific trigger, it remains a possibility in the current geopolitical climate. This 'rhetorical shift' pathway, which I had previously undervalued, warrants a modest increase in my forecast. I am increasing my forecast from 3% to 4% to account for this additional, albeit low-probability, path to resolution. I am not increasing it further because I believe both a new kinetic invasion and a spontaneous rhetorical shift remain highly improbable events before July 1, 2025.",
