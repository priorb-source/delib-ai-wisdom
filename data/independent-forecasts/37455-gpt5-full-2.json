  "information": "On April 14, 2025, the Lesotho Communications Authority (LCA) granted Starlink Lesotho a 10-year license to operate a satellite network and provide broadband services nationwide. Starlink Lesotho Pty Ltd, owned by Starlink Holdings Netherlands B.V., had submitted its application on January 24, 2025. The LCA had previously rejected a request from Starlink due to concerns over the company's lack of local ownership. The approval followed the imposition of a 50% US tariff on Lesotho in early April 2025. No official timeline for the service launch was provided at the time of the license grant.\n\nStarlink's service rollout timelines in other African nations have varied. In the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC), a license was granted around May 3-5, 2025, and service availability was announced by May 5, with the launch expected within days. The company also received a license from Somalia in April 2025. However, Starlink has faced regulatory challenges in other countries; it lacks a full operating license in South Africa, and authorities in Zimbabwe have asked the company to disconnect kits operating illegally in the country.\n\nStarlink's parent company, SpaceX, has a regional partnership with Airtel Africa to provide high-speed internet services to its customers across the continent. Geographically, Lesotho is a landlocked country, entirely surrounded by South Africa, where Starlink is not yet licensed to operate. The country has a small area of approximately 30,355 km² and is characterized by mountainous terrain.",

    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "About 54 days (until 2025-07-01)",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Post-license operational steps (type approval, importation, pricing, payments, reseller setup) or geofencing concerns with South Africa slow activation; Starlink keeps Lesotho as “Coming Soon” or unlisted and the map never flips to “Available” before July 1.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Starlink completes remaining regulatory/operational steps and enables geofenced service; kits begin shipping or roaming is authorized with Lesotho service addresses; the map updates to show at least part of Lesotho as “Available” in May/June.",
    "rationale": "- Time horizon: ~54 days is enough for Starlink to move fast when everything is lined up, but short if there are lingering regulatory/logistics steps.\n- Evidence pushing up: Lesotho granted a 10-year license on Apr 14, 2025. Starlink has recently moved quickly elsewhere (e.g., DRC: license and availability announced within days in early May). Technically, enabling service in a small, mountainous country via geofencing is feasible, and Starlink increasingly relies on laser backhaul, reducing dependence on local ground stations. A clear license substantially lowers the main barrier.\n- Evidence pushing down: It has already been 3+ weeks since the Lesotho license without the availability map flipping, suggesting at least one outstanding step (equipment type approval, customs, local fulfillment, pricing, payments, reseller/on-the-ground support). Lesotho is entirely surrounded by South Africa, where Starlink lacks a license; SpaceX may be extra cautious to avoid cross‑border leakage and could delay until robust geofencing and compliance processes are in place. Lesotho’s small market could lower prioritization relative to larger countries where Starlink is launching now. Also, the outcome requires the map to show “Available,” not merely “Coming Soon” or “Waitlist.”\n- Status quo weighting: As of today the map does not show availability; if nothing changes, outcome is No. Starlink sometimes takes months post‑license in some markets, so slow change is a real possibility.\n- Why not higher: The lag since Apr 14, enclaved geography with a major non‑licensed neighbor, and possible operational prerequisites (type approval/imports/payments/reseller) could easily push activation past July 1 or lead to a non-Available status.\n- Why not lower: A formal license is a major hurdle cleared; recent African rollouts (e.g., DRC) show SpaceX can move in days; 54 days remain, which is ample if remaining blockers are minor.\n- Watchlist to update:\n  • Upward: Official Starlink/X post or LCA notice of imminent activation; Lesotho added to Starlink order flow or pricing pages; reports of kits shipping to Lesotho addresses; third‑party resellers announced; map changes to “Available Soon/Waitlist” with near-term dates.\n  • Downward: Signals of additional regulatory conditions (e.g., local ownership structure changes, equipment approvals pending), customs/import holdups, or explicit statements delaying activation; continued silence through mid‑June.",

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
