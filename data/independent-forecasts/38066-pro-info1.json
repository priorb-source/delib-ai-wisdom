  "information": "Y Combinator (YC) is launching its inaugural AI Startup School in San Francisco on June 16-17, 2025. The event is a free conference intended for 2,000 top AI students, researchers, and recent graduates, with YC offering up to $500 for travel expenses. The program's goal is to shape the next generation of AI startups by focusing on entrepreneurship, product building, and fundraising. YC has announced that Sam Altman and Elon Musk are among the event's headline speakers.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "About 3 weeks, with final resolution in just over one month.",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No. The standard format for conferences is for headline speakers to have separate sessions. Without a specific announcement of a joint appearance, the default assumption is that they will speak individually.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Y Combinator schedules separate keynote or fireside chat sessions for Sam Altman and Elon Musk. Due to their busy schedules and public disagreements, they may attend on different days or, if on the same day, their paths will not cross on stage. This is the standard and logistically simplest way to organize the event.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "To maximize the impact and media attention for the inaugural AI Startup School, YC's organizers arrange a 'blockbuster' joint session. Seeing it as a prime opportunity to debate their differing philosophies on AI's future in front of the next generation of talent, both Altman and Musk agree to a moderated discussion or debate on stage.",
    "rationale": "My forecast is based on the powerful influence of the status quo and the significant public friction between the two individuals, weighed against the strong incentive for the organizers to create a high-profile event. \n\nThe primary reason for a low probability is that the default for any conference is for speakers to appear separately. A joint session is a special format that would likely have been announced to drive interest. More importantly, there is a well-documented history of professional and personal animosity between Musk and Altman, including a lawsuit filed by Musk against OpenAI. This legal and personal conflict creates a substantial barrier to a voluntary, amicable joint stage appearance.\n\nHowever, the probability is not closer to zero for several key reasons. First, Y Combinator has a strong incentive to orchestrate such a meeting. A live discussion between two of the most influential and now rivalrous figures in AI would generate enormous publicity for their new event. Second, Sam Altman is the former president of YC, giving the organization a unique and close relationship to leverage. Third, both individuals are known for their showmanship and willingness to engage in public discourse; they might be persuaded that a moderated debate on this particular stage is a compelling opportunity.\n\nI would increase my forecast if YC or either individual hinted at a joint session, or if there were news of a resolution to their legal dispute. I would decrease it if a detailed schedule were released showing them in separate, non-overlapping slots, or if their public feud were to escalate further.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill Sam Altman and Elon Musk be on the stage together at YC AI Startup School?\n\nQuestion background:\nY Combinator is an American venture capital firm known for launching over 5,000 companies including Airbnb, Stripe, and Reddit. In 2025, Y Combinator announced AI Startup School, a conference in San Francisco held on June 16–17, aimed at 2,000 final-year students and recent graduates in computer science, artificial intelligence, and related fields.&#x20;\n\nY Combinator has announced that both Sam Altman and Elon Musk are among the headline speakers at the AI Startup School, but it is unknown whether they will appear on stage together at the same time.\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question will resolve as Yes if Sam Altman and Elon Musk share a stage together at YC AI Startup School after 7:59 AM, June 16, 2025, and before 00:00 AM, June 18, 2025. Otherwise, this question will resolve as No.\n\nSharing a stage is defined as both individuals being physically present on the same platform at the same time.&#x20;\n\nThis question will resolve according to a preponderance of evidence. If there is no clear evidence of this occurring before July 1, 2025, this question will resolve as No.\n\nAll times for this question are in Pacific Daylight Time (PDT).  &#x20;\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nY Combinator (YC) is launching its inaugural AI Startup School in San Francisco on June 16-17, 2025. The event is a free conference intended for 2,000 top AI students, researchers, and recent graduates, with YC offering up to $500 for travel expenses. The program's goal is to shape the next generation of AI startups by focusing on entrepreneurship, product building, and fundraising. YC has announced that Sam Altman and Elon Musk are among the event's headline speakers.\n\nToday is 2025-05-27.\n\nBefore answering you think:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n(e) You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
