    "review": "My initial forecast was significantly higher than the others (85% vs. 72% and 68%). Both other forecasters presented sound reasoning, largely aligning on the key drivers: the strong inflationary trend in Q1 2025, the proximity to the 15.0% threshold, and the NBU's guidance for a peak in Q2. Forecaster 2 rightly pointed out the uncertainty regarding the exact timing of the peak within Q2, which could argue for a lower probability. However, Forecaster 3 introduced a crucial piece of evidence I had not considered: the timing of Orthodox Easter. The holiday fell in May in 2024 but falls in April in 2025. This timing shift creates a strong, specific upward pressure on food prices in April 2025 that was not present in the base month of April 2024, making a high monthly inflation print for April much more likely. This new evidence significantly strengthens the case for 'Yes' and outweighs the general uncertainty about the peak's timing.",
    "rationale": "After reviewing the other analyses, I am maintaining my initial forecast. My decision rests on a quantitative assessment reinforced by a key piece of evidence supplied by another forecaster. The annual inflation rate stood at 14.6% in March 2025. For it to reach 15.0% in April, the increase depends on the monthly inflation for April 2025 relative to the base effect from April 2024. Historical data shows that monthly inflation in April 2024 was very low, at just 0.2%. This creates a low bar for the annual rate to climb. A simple calculation indicates that April 2025 monthly inflation only needs to be approximately 0.6% or higher to push the annual rate to 15.0%.\n\nConsidering the recent monthly inflation prints of 0.8% in February and 1.5% in March, a figure of 0.6% seems highly plausible. More importantly, as Forecaster 3 noted, Orthodox Easter falls in April this year, compared to May last year. This holiday a known driver of food price inflation, which adds significant momentum specifically to the April 2025 data. The combination of the strong underlying trend, the very low base effect from April 2024, and the added seasonal pressure from Easter makes it extremely likely that the 15.0% threshold will be met. While I acknowledge the disinflationary pressures from tight monetary policy and the uncertainty about the exact peak month, these factors are insufficient to cause the abrupt deceleration needed for a 'No' outcome.",
