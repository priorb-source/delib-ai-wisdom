  "information": "Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky has issued warnings that Russia may be preparing a new wave of aggression under the guise of the upcoming 'West-2025' military exercises in Belarus. The potential targets mentioned in these warnings include a further invasion of Ukraine, or an attack on Lithuania or Poland. Zelensky stated that intelligence reports indicate Russia is building up its military forces in Belarus, with as many as 150,000 soldiers, for a potential invasion of a NATO country. In response, Ukraine's State Border Guard Service is closely monitoring the border with Belarus and tracking the movement of Russian units.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Approximately 2 months, from May 1, 2025 to July 1, 2025.",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No - Russia continues its military operations in Ukraine but does not invade any other country, and consequently the US does not accuse Russia of such an invasion.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Russia conducts the West-2025 military exercises in Belarus as planned, possibly maintaining an elevated military presence in the region for strategic purposes or intimidation. The exercises conclude without Russian ground forces entering any country other than Ukraine without consent. The military buildup serves as posturing or contingency planning but not immediate invasion.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Russia uses the West-2025 exercises as operational cover to launch ground force incursions into a neighboring country, most likely a non-NATO state like Moldova or Georgia, or in an extreme scenario, a Baltic NATO member like Lithuania. The US government publicly and explicitly accuses Russia of invasion shortly after the incursion begins.",
    "rationale": "The status quo strongly favors No. Invading another country, especially a NATO member, would represent an escalation of almost unprecedented magnitude. For NATO members (Lithuania, Poland), this would trigger Article 5 collective defense commitments and likely lead to direct NATO-Russia military conflict - an outcome Russia would almost certainly want to avoid given its ongoing resource commitments in Ukraine. Zelensky's warnings should be taken seriously as Ukraine has strong intelligence capabilities regarding Russian movements, but Ukraine also has strategic incentives to maintain Western attention on Russian threats to justify continued support. The 150,000 troop figure, while significant, could plausibly be explained by legitimate exercise activities. Historical base rates matter: major interstate invasions are rare events even for aggressive actors. The 2-month timeframe is quite short for such a momentous strategic decision. Russia's military is stretched in Ukraine, limiting capacity for new major operations. However, I cannot assign negligible probability because: (1) Russia did invade Ukraine in 2022, demonstrating willingness to take high-risk military actions, (2) Russia has previously used exercises as cover for military operations, (3) non-NATO targets like Moldova remain vulnerable, and (4) Putin has shown capacity for miscalculation. For my forecast to increase significantly, I would need to see US intelligence warnings of imminent invasion, Russian forces moving from exercise positions toward borders in attack formations, or Russian ultimatums to neighbors. For it to decrease, I would need exercises to conclude peacefully or Russian forces to withdraw from Belarus. Given the extreme stakes, resource constraints, short timeframe, and low historical base rate, but acknowledging Russia's demonstrated aggression and current military positioning, I assess this as highly unlikely but not impossible.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nBefore July 1, 2025, will the United States accuse Russia of invading any country other than Ukraine?\n\nQuestion background:\nSky News [Ukraine war: Which countries could Putin go for next? Is Europe vulnerable to a nuclear-armed bully?

These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if, before July 1, 2025, the US government publicly accuses Russia of invading any country other than Ukraine, by Russia sending its ground military forces into that country without consent from the government of the country.\n\n\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nUkrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky has issued warnings that Russia may be preparing a new wave of aggression under the guise of the upcoming 'West-2025' military exercises in Belarus.

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
