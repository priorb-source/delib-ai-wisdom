  "information": "As of the last filing for Q4 2024, Berkshire Hathaway held approximately 10.7 million shares of Amazon. For 10 consecutive quarters, the company has been a net seller of equities. In Q1 2025, Berkshire increased its cash reserves to a record of approximately $348 billion. During that same quarter, the company's operating earnings declined by 14.1%, and no stock repurchases were made. New investments were focused on the energy sector and Japanese trading firms.\n\nWarren Buffett has announced his intention to step down as CEO by the end of 2025, with Greg Abel set to succeed him. Following the announcement, a Stocktwits poll indicated that 46% of retail investors still view Berkshire Hathaway as a long-term 'buy', and retail sentiment on the stock was described as 'extremely bullish'. UBS analysts stated that the company's structural advantages, including its permanent capital and information collection capabilities, are not expected to be significantly reduced by the leadership change.\n\nAnalysts from sources including NASDAQ and The Motley Fool have highlighted Amazon's growth potential, particularly through its cloud infrastructure service, Amazon Web Services (AWS), which is reportedly growing by a high-teens percentage year-over-year.

    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "The 13F filing for the quarter ending March 31, 2025, is typically due within 45 days of the quarter's end, by May 15, 2025. As today is May 8, 2025, the outcome will be known within approximately one week.",
    "status_quo_outcome": "Yes. As of the last filing for Q4 2024, Berkshire Hathaway held approximately 10.7 million shares of Amazon. If they made no changes to this position in Q1 2025, their holding would remain greater than the 10,000,000 share threshold.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Berkshire Hathaway continues its well-established, 10-quarter trend of being a net seller of equities. As part of a broader move to increase its record cash reserves and de-risk its portfolio, the company sells at least 700,001 shares of Amazon, bringing its total holdings to 10,000,000 or fewer.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Despite its overall trend of net selling, Berkshire views Amazon as a core long-term holding due to the strength of its business, particularly AWS. Consequently, they either maintain their entire position or trim it by less than 700,001 shares, causing their reported Q1 2025 holdings to remain above the 10,000,000 share threshold.",
    "rationale": "My forecast is primarily based on the high bar required to change the outcome from the status quo. Berkshire Hathaway's last reported holding was 10.7 million Amazon shares, which is comfortably above the 10 million share resolution threshold. For the outcome to be 'No', Berkshire would have had to actively sell more than 700,000 shares during the quarter.\n\nThe strongest evidence favoring a 'No' outcome is Berkshire's clear and consistent behavior: they have been net sellers of equities for 10 consecutive quarters and have increased their cash position to a record $348 billion. This indicates a very cautious, if not bearish, stance on the market, making it plausible that they trimmed positions across the board, including high-flying tech stocks like Amazon, to lock in profits.\n\nHowever, the status quo is a powerful anchor. Absent a specific negative catalyst for Amazon, inertia would favor holding the position. Amazon's strong fundamentals, particularly the growth in its AWS division, and the positive price target revisions from major banks like JPMorgan and Morgan Stanley, make it a less likely candidate for a significant trim compared to other, less dominant companies in Berkshire's portfolio. The decision to sell would have to be active, whereas the decision to hold requires no action.\n\nMy probability is not higher than 65% because the 10-quarter selling streak is a very strong contrary signal that cannot be ignored. It shows a clear pattern of capital allocation away from public equities, and a 6.5% trim of the Amazon position would be consistent with this pattern.\n\nMy probability is not lower than 65% because the burden of action lies in selling. The 'Yes' outcome occurs even if Berkshire does nothing. Given Amazon's quality as a business, it is more likely than not that Berkshire either maintained its position or did not trim it substantially enough to fall below the 10 million share threshold.\n\nI would increase my probability if there were reports of Berkshire slowing its equity sales or if Buffett or Abel made specific positive comments about Amazon's long-term value. I would decrease my probability if there was a- significant market downturn during Q1 2025 or if sector analysis showed institutional investors were broadly trimming positions in mega-cap tech.",
