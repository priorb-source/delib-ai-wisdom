    "review": "My initial forecast was 35%. Forecaster 2 arrived at a similar conclusion (30%), reinforcing my analysis with new, crucial data: four recent polls show a consistent Liberal national popular vote lead of 4.9 to 7.4 points. This quantifies the challenge for the Conservatives more clearly than the regional data I initially reviewed. In contrast, Forecaster 3's analysis (94%) is unconvincing as it appears to operate on a completely false premise. It assumes the election is days away (mentioning advance voting and no more debates) and that Conservatives hold a large polling lead, directly contradicting the scenario's date (April 2025) and all provided polling data. Therefore, I will disregard Forecaster 3's reasoning and incorporate the more specific data provided by Forecaster 2.",
    "rationale": "I am updating my forecast downward in light of the new information provided by Forecaster 2. My initial analysis, based on regional polling, correctly identified a likely Liberal lead in the popular vote due to their strength in the populous provinces of Ontario and Quebec. Forecaster 2's contribution of multiple national polls showing a consistent 4.9 to 7.4 point Liberal lead solidifies this assessment. A persistent lead of this magnitude, roughly 6 points on average, is a significant obstacle for the Conservatives to overcome in the approximately six months remaining until the election. While six months is certainly enough time for public opinion to shift, the consistency of the current Liberal lead across several polls suggests it is not an anomaly. The status quo is a clear Liberal popular vote victory. I am discounting Forecaster 3's entire analysis as it is based on a flawed understanding of the election timeline and polling environment described in the prompt. Therefore, I am decreasing my probability for a Conservative win from 35% to 30%, aligning my forecast with Forecaster 2 and reflecting the stronger evidence of a consolidated Liberal lead.",
