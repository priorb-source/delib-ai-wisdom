  "information": "The middleweight bout between Joe Pyfer and Kelvin Gastelum is scheduled for the main card of UFC 316, which will take place on June 7, 2025, at the Prudential Center in Newark, New Jersey. This is a rebooked fight, originally scheduled for UFC Mexico on March 29 before being cancelled. According to UFCStats 'tale of the tape' data, Pyfer has a slight grappling and reach advantage, while Gastelum fights from a southpaw stance.\n\nJoe Pyfer has won six of his last seven professional fights, holding a 4-1 record within the UFC. His most recent victory was a first-round knockout of Marc-Andre Barriault at UFC 303, which earned him a Performance of the Night bonus. Pyfer had to withdraw from the originally scheduled fight against Gastelum in Mexico due to an illness.\n\nKelvin Gastelum is a veteran fighter and the winner of 'The Ultimate Fighter 17'. The fight at UFC 316 will mark his 24th appearance in the UFC Octagon.

  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Approximately 2 weeks.",
    "status_quo_outcome": "The fight between Joe Pyfer and Kelvin Gastelum proceeds as scheduled, and Pyfer defeats Gastelum, resolving the question as Yes.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Joe Pyfer loses his scheduled fight against Kelvin Gastelum by any method. Alternatively, the fight is cancelled for any reason (e.g., injury, illness, weight miss) and Pyfer does not compete against a replacement opponent at UFC 316.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Joe Pyfer wins his scheduled fight against Kelvin Gastelum at UFC 316 via knockout, submission, or decision. If Gastelum withdraws, Pyfer defeats a replacement opponent at the same event.",
    "rationale": "My forecast is based on two primary factors: the probability that the fight occurs and the probability that Pyfer wins if it does. The status quo is that the fight proceeds and Pyfer, who possesses significant momentum and physical advantages, wins. He is 4-1 in the UFC with a recent 'Performance of the Night' victory, and the research report notes his grappling and reach advantages.\n\nHowever, the probability is not higher for two key reasons. First, there is a non-trivial risk of cancellation. This specific bout was already cancelled once due to an illness on Pyfer's part, which slightly elevates the risk of a repeat occurrence or other issues like training injuries preventing the fight from happening. Second, Kelvin Gastelum is a highly experienced and durable veteran. With 23 prior UFC fights and a recent victory, he represents a significant step up in competition for Pyfer and has the skillset to win the fight himself, thus resolving the question as No.\n\nMy forecast is not lower because, despite the risks, Pyfer is the rightful favorite. His recent performances demonstrate powerful finishing ability, and his physical tools give him a clear path to victory. The most probable single outcome is that the fight happens as scheduled and the favored fighter, Pyfer, wins.\n\nI would increase my forecast if reports closer to the event confirm both fighters are healthy and have made weight successfully. I would decrease my forecast upon any news of an injury to Pyfer, a difficult weight cut, or if the fight is cancelled.",
