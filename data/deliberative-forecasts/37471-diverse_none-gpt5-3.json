    "review": "Both forecasters correctly emphasize the large jump required (+50k in three months, ~10%) from the February 2025 baseline of 500k. I agree with their framing that a ‘Yes’ would likely require a sharp demand shock and/or an unusually rapid release of spec inventory. I also agree that builders tend to manage inventory actively, which dampens the probability of a rapid run-up. Where I diverge is on the probability they assign (30–35%), which feels high given historical month-to-month volatility in this series and the fact that it is seasonally adjusted, limiting spring seasonality as a driver. Their arguments do not introduce new data (e.g., March/April prints, builder earnings pointing to swelling spec) that would justify such a high probability. Momentum and seasonality are not, by themselves, sufficient to make a 10% three-month increase at already-elevated levels likely.",
    "rationale": "Baseline: 500k in Feb 2025. To exceed 550k by May requires an unusually large rise versus typical monthly changes for this series. At this stage of the cycle, public builders have generally emphasized inventory discipline and rate buydowns to sustain absorption. Seasonally adjusted data also reduces the impact of spring inventory effects. A ‘Yes’ path still exists—e.g., a sudden sales slowdown from higher mortgage rates or a wave of completions hitting while orders stall—but without evidence of an accelerating build in March/April, the base case is that inventory inches up or is roughly stable, not that it jumps by 10% in a quarter. After considering the other forecasters’ points, I see no new evidence warranting a large move up; I nudge my forecast slightly higher to reflect tail risks they note (e.g., negative demand shock) but keep it low given the magnitude required. Change: up from 12% to 15%.",
