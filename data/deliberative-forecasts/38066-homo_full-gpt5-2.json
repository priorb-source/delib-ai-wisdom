    "review": "Both forecasters emphasize base rates and logistics, which I largely agree with. New points I found persuasive: (1) the event’s student-focused, capacity-limited nature reduces YC’s marginal incentive to manufacture a high-drama joint segment for ticket sales; (2) security/PR/legal risk and Musk’s preference for controlled environments make a spontaneous joint moment unlikely; (3) absent an explicitly billed joint session by late May, the base rate for rivals sharing a stage is very low. I also agree with the heightened execution risk from Musk’s attendance volatility and the possibility of remote participation. I still think there’s a non-trivial upside tail if both are on-site—YC could engineer a brief closing photo-op or joint Q&A—but that requires more planning than we’ve seen signaled.",
    "rationale": "I’m revising down. My prior (25%) implicitly overestimated P(shared stage | both attend) without explicit programming. Updating: P(Musk attends in person) ~65–70%, P(Altman attends) ~95%, and P(shared stage | both attend, no prior billing) ~12–18% given rivalry, security, and control/optics concerns. Using midpoints (0.68*0.95*0.15) ≈ 9.7% suggests a low-teens forecast. I’ll set 12% to reflect a small premium for a last-minute YC-engineered moment if conditions thaw, but still well below even odds. Key up-moves: official agenda listing a joint session; public hints from YC/Garry Tan/Altman/Musk of a conversation; credible reports of détente and joint planning; firm confirmation of Musk’s in-person attendance in SF. Key down-moves: agenda with strictly separate sessions; signs of remote participation or Musk skipping; renewed hostilities or legal escalation; YC/security guidance that forbids overlap. Change: down from 25% to 12% (-13 pp) due to base-rate/logistics and lack of any announced joint segment close to the event.",
