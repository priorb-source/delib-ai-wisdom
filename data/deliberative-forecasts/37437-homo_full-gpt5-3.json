    "review": "Forecasters 2 and 3 largely mirror my priors: the window is short, the bar is high (U.S. public accusation of PLA ground forces entering Taiwanese-controlled territory), and most indicators point to medium-term risk centered on 2027, not the next ~8 weeks. They added two helpful nuances: (1) typhoon-season constraints marginally narrowing amphibious windows and (2) the linguistic uncertainty that Washington might label a limited seizure as an “attack” or “seizure” rather than explicitly an “invasion,” reducing resolution probability even conditional on a landing. Both points modestly reinforce a low estimate. Overall, their arguments are sound and consistent with observable patterns and the assistant’s report.",
    "rationale": "My baseline already emphasized the short horizon, absence of imminent invasion indicators, and the widely cited 2027 readiness target. The added considerations—weather constraints and U.S. wording caution—slightly lower the conditional probability that a qualifying U.S. accusation occurs even if a limited landing were to happen on an outlying island. However, these are incremental refinements rather than material shifts: the dominant factors remain the lack of observable PLA mobilization for amphibious/airborne operations, high strategic costs for Beijing to move prematurely, and the specificity of the resolution criterion. Tail risk persists for a fait accompli against a lightly defended outlying island (Pratas/Kinmen/Matsu/Itu Aba), but even there, language choice by Washington is uncertain. Net, I maintain my estimate given rounding precision and the already low base, with the understanding that credible mobilization indicators or exclusion zones would be the main triggers for an upward revision.",
