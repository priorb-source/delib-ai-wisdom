  "information": "Mahmoud Khalil, a lawful permanent resident and Palestinian activist, was detained by Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) in March 2025. An immigration judge subsequently ruled that he can be deported, concluding that the government had met its burden to prove grounds for deportation based on national security and foreign policy concerns. Khalil's legal team is appealing this decision to the Board of Immigration Appeals (BIA) and has also filed a separate habeas corpus petition in federal court, arguing that the government's actions violate his First Amendment rights.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Approximately 1.5 months (until July 1, 2025).",
    "status_quo_outcome": "Mahmoud Khalil remains in the United States while his legal challenges are pending in the Board of Immigration Appeals and federal court. This results in a 'No' outcome.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Standard legal processes unfold at their typical pace. Khalil's appeal to the Board of Immigration Appeals (BIA) and his habeas corpus petition in federal court remain pending past the July 1, 2025 deadline. A stay of removal, either automatic or court-ordered, remains in effect, preventing his deportation.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "In an extraordinarily rapid series of events, Khalil's appeal is summarily dismissed by the BIA, a federal court denies his request for a stay of removal, and ICE acts with extreme urgency to physically remove him from the US before July 1, 2025.",
    "rationale": "My forecast is primarily based on the extremely short timeframe of approximately 47 days measured against the standard processing times of the US immigration appeals system. The status quo is that Mahmoud Khalil has active legal challenges to his deportation order, including an appeal to the BIA and a federal habeas corpus petition. Such legal actions typically place a stay on removal, and the resolution of these cases almost always takes many months, if not years. The likelihood of both an administrative appeal and a federal case being fully resolved against him, and a deportation being executed within this narrow window, is very low. \n\nMy forecast is not lower than 5% because the deportation order is based on national security grounds, which can sometimes lead to expedited processing and receive significant deference from the courts. There is a small but non-zero chance that the government successfully argues for an emergency process that bypasses the usual timelines.\n\nMy forecast is not higher because doing so would ignore the powerful institutional inertia of the US legal system. The presence of two separate legal challenges, particularly a First Amendment claim in federal court, creates significant procedural hurdles for the government to overcome in such a short period.\n\nI would increase my probability forecast if news emerged that the BIA had summarily dismissed his appeal and a federal judge had explicitly denied his petition for a stay of removal. Conversely, I would decrease the probability if a federal court granted a preliminary injunction preventing his removal while the case proceeds.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill Mahmoud Khalil be deported before July 1, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\n[Mahmoud Khalil's challenge to his detention moves forward]()\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if the United States deports Mahmoud Khalil before July 1, 2025. For purposes of this question, \"deported\" means Khalil being transported out of the territory of the United States against his will.\n\n\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nMahmoud Khalil, a lawful permanent resident and Palestinian activist, was detained by Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) in March 2025.

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
