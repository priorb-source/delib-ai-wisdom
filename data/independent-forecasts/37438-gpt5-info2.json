  "information": "On February 19, 2025, ChargePoint received a notice of non-compliance from the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE). The notice was issued because the company's average closing stock price remained below $1.00 over a consecutive 30-day trading period. This notification does not result in an immediate delisting. The company has publicly stated its intention to cure the stock price deficiency and regain compliance, and is considering measures such as a reverse stock split, which would be subject to stockholder approval.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "About 57 days (until July 1, 2025)",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No bankruptcy filing before July 1, 2025",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "ChargePoint continues to operate, executes or schedules a reverse split to address NYSE compliance, manages liquidity through cost controls and incremental financing options (e.g., ATM equity, supplier terms, small credit facilities), and avoids any covenant breaches or missed payments that would force a filing before July 1.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "A sudden liquidity crunch (e.g., failed capital raise, vendor pressure, covenant breach, or missed interest/payment) leaves the company unable to meet near-term obligations, prompting the board to file a voluntary Chapter 11 in June; or creditors initiate an involuntary petition that leads to a filing before July 1.",
    "rationale": "- Time horizon is short. From May 5 to July 1 is under two months; most public-company bankruptcies, even when expected, typically follow identifiable triggers (near-term maturities, missed interest payments, or covenant defaults) and often take longer than a few weeks from initial warning signs to a filing.\n- Status quo favors No. As of today, there has been no filing. The company recently reported FY25 results (per the SEC reference) and remains an operating concern. Companies in similar situations commonly pursue reverse splits to cure NYSE price deficiencies and often secure incremental liquidity to extend runway rather than file abruptly.\n- Research assistant input: On Feb 19, 2025, ChargePoint received an NYSE notice for sub-$1 average price over 30 trading days and indicated an intent to cure (including considering a reverse split, subject to shareholder approval). That action signals a preference to remain listed and continue operations rather than an imminent bankruptcy.\n- Why not higher: No public indication of an immediate maturity wall or announced payment default; the company has options (reverse split, ATM equity, cost control) that can plausibly bridge a few months. The probability of moving from a price-deficiency notice to a bankruptcy filing within ~4 months is historically low absent a hard catalyst.\n- Why not lower: The equity price signal and NYSE non-compliance reflect distress; EV charging hardware markets have been challenging; cash burn has been a concern historically. If liquidity is thin and capital markets are shut, a negative catalyst (e.g., vendor tightening, covenant breach, or failed shareholder actions) could precipitate a filing within weeks.\n- Upward revision triggers: Disclosure of substantial doubt about going concern without a concrete funding plan; missed or delayed payments (interest, payroll, key vendors); covenant default or acceleration; auditor resignation; inability to obtain shareholder approval for a needed reverse split; indications that suppliers are demanding cash-on-delivery.\n- Downward revision triggers: Successful reverse split and regained NYSE compliance; new financing (equity, convertible, or debt) that adds runway; demonstrated operating cash burn reduction or positive margin updates; credible guidance showing liquidity coverage beyond the summer.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill ChargePoint file for bankruptcy before July 1, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\n[ChargePoint Reports Fourth Quarter and Full Fiscal Year 2025 Financial Results](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1777393/000177739325000009/chpt8-kerfy2025q4exx991.htm)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question will resolve as **Yes** if ChargePoint Holdings, Inc., files any petition for bankruptcy protection in the United States, under any chapter of the United States Bankruptcy Code, before July 1, 2025. The question will resolves on the filing of such a petition, not on whether any bankruptcy protection is granted by a court. If no such petition is filed by that date, this question will resolve as **No**.\n\n\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nOn February 19, 2025, ChargePoint received a notice of non-compliance from the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE). The notice was issued because the company's average closing stock price remained below $1.00 over a consecutive 30-day trading period. This notification does not result in an immediate delisting. The company has publicly stated its intention to cure the stock price deficiency and regain compliance, and is considering measures such as a reverse stock split, which would be subject to stockholder approval.\n\nToday is 2025-05-05.\n\nBefore answering you think:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n(e) You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
