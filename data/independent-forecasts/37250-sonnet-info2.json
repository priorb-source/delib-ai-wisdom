  "information": "The Trump administration has publicly resisted the court orders. President Trump stated the case is 'in the hands of lawyers' but also claimed he 'could' have Garcia returned with a single phone call but would not, citing alleged MS-13 gang affiliations. The Department of Homeland Security acknowledged the initial deportation was an 'administrative mistake'. Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem stated that if Garcia were to return to the U.S., he would be immediately deported again.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Approximately 2 months (from May 1 to July 1, 2025)",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No - Garcia remains outside the United States",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "The Trump administration continues to resist court orders requiring Garcia's return. With only 2 months remaining, legal enforcement mechanisms fail to compel compliance before the July 1 deadline. Garcia remains outside US territory through July 1, 2025.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Federal courts successfully enforce their orders through contempt proceedings or other mechanisms, compelling the administration to return Garcia to US territory before July 1. Alternatively, some political compromise or shift in administration position leads to Garcia's return despite current public statements.",
    "rationale": "The status quo strongly favors a No outcome. Garcia is currently outside the US following deportation, and the Trump administration has taken a clear public position against returning him. Key evidence includes: (1) Trump's explicit statement that he will not return Garcia despite claiming he could do so easily, (2) Secretary Noem's statement that Garcia would be immediately deported again if returned, (3) the administration characterizing this as a political issue involving alleged gang affiliations, and (4) demonstrated willingness to resist court orders. With only 2 months remaining until resolution, there is limited time for legal mechanisms to compel compliance. However, the probability is not near zero because: (1) DHS acknowledged the deportation was an 'administrative mistake' suggesting legal vulnerability, (2) court orders exist requiring his return, (3) federal courts have enforcement mechanisms including contempt proceedings that could theoretically compel action. The main uncertainty is whether legal enforcement can overcome political resistance within the tight timeframe. For my forecast to increase significantly, I would need evidence of accelerated court enforcement actions, administration softening its position, or political pressure mounting. For it to decrease further, I would need evidence courts are accepting delays or administration finding legal grounds to resist indefinitely. Given the brief timeline and entrenched public position, but acknowledging some legal pressure exists, I estimate this at 12%.",

These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if Kilmar Abrego Garcia after the launch of this question and before July 1, 2025 enters territory of the United States according to [credible sources](https://www.metaculus.com/help/faq/#definitions).\n\nSubsequently leaving the United States, such as a deportation, will not cause this question to re-resolve.\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nThe Trump administration has publicly resisted the court orders.

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower.
