    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Approximately 10 days. The 2025 Cornwall Council election is scheduled for May 1, 2025, which is the typical date for local elections in England.",
    "status_quo_outcome": "Liberal Democrats maintain their position as the largest party on Cornwall Council. In the 2021 election, the Liberal Democrats won 37 seats out of 87, making them the largest party on the council.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Another party or group wins more seats than the Liberal Democrats. This could occur if the Conservatives stage a strong recovery, if Labour makes unexpected gains in Cornwall, or if Independent candidates collectively outperform the Lib Dems. A fragmented opposition could also coalesce into a larger voting bloc.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "The Liberal Democrats maintain or strengthen their position as the largest single party on Cornwall Council, building on their 2021 success. This would likely involve retaining their core seats while potentially gaining ground in marginal wards, leveraging strong local campaigning and capitalizing on their track record in Cornwall.",
    "rationale": "The status quo strongly favors a Yes outcome. In 2021, the Liberal Democrats won 37 seats, establishing themselves as the largest party on Cornwall Council. With only 10 days until the election, there is limited time for major political shifts. Historical trends show Cornwall as favorable territory for the Liberal Democrats in local elections, where their ground game and local presence provide advantages. The Southwest has been a Liberal Democrat stronghold, and they have effectively addressed local concerns about second homes, tourism infrastructure, and regional economic issues. However, several factors prevent higher confidence: (1) lack of specific 2025 polling data for this election, (2) potential for strong Independent performance in Cornwall, (3) possible changes in council composition since 2021 due to by-elections or defections, and (4) the inherent volatility of local elections. The Conservative Party's national difficulties could hurt them locally, but Labour remains traditionally weak in Cornwall. My forecast would increase with evidence of Lib Dem polling leads or strong campaign momentum. It would decrease with polling showing other parties gaining ground or evidence of effective opposition campaigns. The proximity to election day and strong status quo baseline support a probability around 72%.",
