  "information": "According to data from the Federal Reserve Economic Data (FRED), the inventory of new single-family homes for sale in the United States stood at 503,000 units in March 2025, an increase from 500,000 in February 2025. This level represents a multi-year high since November 2007. Historically, the number of new one-family homes for sale has only exceeded 550,000 during the 2006-2007 housing market peak, when levels reached between 570,000 and 580,000 units.\n\nData from the U.S. Census Bureau and the Department of Housing and Urban Development for March 2025 showed that new single-family home sales reached a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 724,000, which is up 6% year-over-year. The median sales price of new homes sold was $403,600, a decrease of 7.5% from the same period in the previous year. According to Freddie Mac, the 30-year fixed mortgage rate averaged 6.65% in March 2025 and rose to 6.83% in April 2025.\n\nAccording to the US Census Bureau, housing starts declined by 14.2% month-over-month in March 2025 to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 940,000 units. In the same month, building permits for single-family homes decreased by 2% month-over-month. Builder confidence, as measured by the NAHB Housing Market Index (HMI), was reported to be around 42.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "May 2025 data will be released by FRED in late June 2025, approximately 6-7 weeks from now",
    "status_quo_outcome": "The inventory remains below 550,000. Following the current trend of modest growth (500k in February to 503k in March), May inventory would likely reach approximately 509,000-515,000 units, staying well below the 550,000 threshold.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "The inventory continues its gradual increase at the current pace of approximately 1.5-3k units per month. New home sales remain steady or increase slightly, absorbing new completions. Inventory reaches around 508,000-520,000 by May, falling short of the 550,000 threshold. This aligns with the declining housing starts (-14.2% in March) and reduced building permits (-2%), which limit new supply additions.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "There is a sharp acceleration in inventory buildup requiring approximately 23,500 units added per month (versus the current 3,000/month pace). This would require either: (1) a sudden surge in housing completions from the pipeline while sales stagnate, (2) a dramatic collapse in new home sales due to economic shock, recession fears, or credit tightening, or (3) both occurring simultaneously. Mortgage rates continuing to rise above 7% could contribute to demand destruction.",
    "rationale": "The forecast requires weighing a dramatic acceleration against current trends. March 2025 inventory stands at 503,000, requiring a 47,000+ unit increase (9.3% jump) over two months to exceed 550,000. The February-March increase was only 3,000 units, meaning we would need an approximately 8x acceleration in the inventory growth rate.\n\nSeveral factors argue against reaching 550,000: (1) Housing starts declined significantly (-14.2%) in March, limiting new supply entering the market. (2) Building permits decreased 2%, suggesting continued supply moderation. (3) Builder confidence is weak (HMI=42), making aggressive construction unlikely. (4) New home sales are actually up 6% year-over-year, which absorbs inventory rather than building it. (5) Historically, 550,000 was only exceeded during the 2006-2007 bubble peak - an extreme outlier period.\n\nThe only plausible path to Yes requires a severe demand shock that causes sales to collapse while completions continue. While mortgage rates did rise to 6.83% in April, this alone seems insufficient. A broader economic crisis, credit crunch, or major recession beginning in April-May could create the necessary conditions, but there's limited evidence of such an imminent shock.\n\nMy forecast is not higher because: the required acceleration is extreme (8x current pace), macro indicators point to slowing supply growth, and demand remains reasonably healthy. My forecast is not lower because: (1) there is inherent uncertainty in economic shocks, (2) the current 503,000 level is already historically elevated and within striking distance percentage-wise, and (3) mortgage rates are rising, which could dampen demand. I would revise upward if April data shows a sharp jump (>15,000 units) or if major economic indicators deteriorate rapidly. I would revise downward if April shows continued modest growth (<5,000 units).",
