  "information": "As of early June 2025, Sudan has not ratified the AfCFTA agreement nor submitted its Provisional Schedule of Tariff Concessions. The country is in an ongoing civil war, resulting in fragmented government, the absence of a functioning legislature, and suspension from the African Union (AU). Despite the conflict, a draft national AfCFTA implementation strategy for Sudan was previously reviewed and validated by stakeholders in a process supported by the Intergovernmental Authority on Development (IGAD).",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Less than one month. The deadline is July 1, 2025.",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No. Sudan has not ratified the AfCFTA agreement and the current political and security situation makes ratification impossible.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "The ongoing civil war continues, preventing the formation of a stable, unified government with a functioning legislature. Without the necessary state institutions to carry out the legal process of ratification, the July 1, 2025 deadline passes with Sudan not having ratified the agreement.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "A sudden and comprehensive peace deal is unexpectedly reached between the warring factions in the next few weeks. An internationally recognized emergency government is formed, and in a bid to show commitment to economic recovery and African integration, it fast-tracks and completes the ratification process in the few days before the July 1, 2025 deadline.",
    "rationale": "My forecast is overwhelmingly guided by the current status quo in Sudan, as detailed in the research report. The country is in the midst of a devastating civil war, which has resulted in a fragmented government, the absence of a functioning legislature, and suspension from the African Union. Treaty ratification is a formal legal and political process that requires stable state institutions, none of which currently exist in a unified form in Sudan. The deadline of July 1, 2025, is less than a month away, a timeframe that would be challenging for even a stable government to complete ratification, let alone one embroiled in conflict.\n\nThe fact that a draft implementation strategy was reviewed in the past indicates some prior political will, but this is irrelevant in the face of the complete breakdown of the state's capacity to act on such initiatives. The present reality of war and institutional collapse is the dominant factor.\n\nMy probability is not zero because 'black swan' events, such as a sudden, miraculous peace accord, are theoretically possible, though exceptionally improbable. My forecast is not higher because the logistical, political, and security barriers are immense. For me to update my forecast upwards, I would need to see evidence of an immediate cessation of hostilities and the formation of a unified, internationally recognized government with the stated intent to ratify this treaty as a top priority. Without such a drastic change, the outcome is almost certain to be No.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill Sudan ratify AfCFTA (the pan-African free trade agreement) before July 1, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\n[Draft National AfCFTA Implementation Strategy for Sudan Reviewed and Validated by Stakeholders](https://igad.int/draft-national-afcfta-implementation-strategy-for-sudan-reviewed-and-validated-by-stakeholders/)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if Sudan ratifies the African Continental Free Trade Area (AfCFTA) Agreement before July 1, 2025.\n\n\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nAs of early June 2025, Sudan has not ratified the AfCFTA agreement nor submitted its Provisional Schedule of Tariff Concessions. The country is in an ongoing civil war, resulting in fragmented government, the absence of a functioning legislature, and suspension from the African Union (AU). Despite the conflict, a draft national AfCFTA implementation strategy for Sudan was previously reviewed and validated by stakeholders in a process supported by the Intergovernmental Authority on Development (IGAD).\n\nToday is 2025-06-06.\n\nBefore answering you think:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n(e) You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
