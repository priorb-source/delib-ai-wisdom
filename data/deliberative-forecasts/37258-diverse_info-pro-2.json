    "review": "The other forecasters and I are in strong agreement, with forecasts of 4% and 5% compared to my initial 5%. The consensus underscores the significant barriers to a referendum announcement within the short, two-month timeframe. Forecaster 2's analysis was particularly compelling, introducing two key points I had not sufficiently weighted. First, the specific mention of a government announcement moratorium between May 15 and June 5 due to a by-election. This is a hard, practical constraint that significantly shortens the already narrow window for action. Second, the observation that the polling landscape is more mixed than the single headline poll suggests, with other recent polls showing a lead for 'No'. This lessens the potential political pressure on the Scottish government to act rashly. Forecaster 3's points about the typical lead times for referendums and the lack of preparatory signals reinforced the baseline case for 'No'.",
    "rationale": "I am updating my forecast downward from 5% to 4%. My initial reasoning was already heavily skewed towards 'No' due to the short deadline and the Scottish government's stated focus on domestic policy over constitutional issues. The deliberation has solidified this view and provided additional, concrete evidence that makes a 'Yes' outcome even less likely. The most decisive new information, raised by Forecaster 2, is the effective moratorium on major announcements for three weeks in May and early June. This shrinks the available time for a seismic political announcement to just a few weeks, making it practically very difficult. Furthermore, the more nuanced perspective on polling suggests there isn't a powerful, sustained surge in 'Yes' support that might force the government's hand. While the possibility of a symbolic, surprise announcement to energize the base (mirroring the 2022 precedent) remains, the practical constraints and current political climate make it even more improbable than I first assessed. Therefore, a slight reduction in probability is warranted to reflect this increased certainty.",
