  "information": "As of late May 2025, an International Monetary Fund (IMF) mission is in Beirut for formal negotiations with the Lebanese government. The first negotiating session took place on May 29-30, with a second round scheduled for June 10. According to officials, a draft 46-month Extended Fund Facility (EFF) worth approximately US$3 billion is being discussed. Lebanon's Finance Minister, Yassine Jaber, stated that there has been progress in the talks, describing them as being on a 'good track.' He also affirmed that the government's plan involves better collection of existing taxes rather than imposing new ones. The Lebanese negotiating team includes the Minister of Economy, the Governor of the Central Bank, and other experts, meeting with the IMF delegation led by Ernesto Rigo.\n\nThe IMF has conditioned an agreement on the implementation of several key reforms. While Lebanon has completed some prior actions, including passing amendments to the bank-secrecy law and establishing an electricity-tariff framework, significant obstacles remain. The passage of a bank-restructuring law and measures to control the cash economy are described as unresolved and politically contentious issues. The IMF has publicly characterized the progress in talks as 'slow' and has expressed specific concerns about provisions in the proposed banking reform law, including the composition of a 'Higher Banking Authority' and the scope of its powers.\n\nSeveral international actors are involved in Lebanon's economic recovery efforts. The European Union has announced that a 500 million euro aid payment is conditional on Lebanon restructuring its banking sector and securing an agreement with the IMF. Separately, the World Bank is in active discussions with Lebanese officials regarding a 'Lebanon Emergency Assistance Project' (LEAP) aimed at reconstruction. A meeting to present this project to donor countries and international institutions is scheduled for June 10. On the domestic front, Lebanese President Joseph Aoun has publicly emphasized the importance of reaching an agreement with the IMF before the summer of 2025.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "About one month, until July 1, 2025.",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No agreement is reached. Lebanon's political factions remain deadlocked over necessary reforms, and talks with the IMF continue indefinitely without a concrete deal, as has been the case for several years.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Political infighting over the bank restructuring law intensifies. Key factions refuse to approve a plan that assigns significant losses to their constituents or allied financial institutions. The IMF maintains its position that this reform is non-negotiable. The June 10 meeting passes without a breakthrough, and the IMF mission either leaves or issues a statement noting a lack of progress, causing the talks to stall and miss the July 1 deadline.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Under intense pressure from the EU's conditional aid and the deepening economic crisis, Lebanon's political leaders forge a last-minute compromise on the bank-restructuring law in mid-to-late June. This compromise is just sufficient to meet the IMF's minimum requirements. An announcement of a staff-level agreement on the ~$3 billion Extended Fund Facility is made in the last week of June.",
    "rationale": "My forecast is based on the significant friction between the strong momentum for a deal and the deep-seated structural impediments to reform in Lebanon. The status quo, which heavily favors a 'No' outcome, is one of years of failed negotiations due to an inability of the political elite to agree on sharing the immense losses in the financial system. The information provided highlights that the most contentious issues—the bank-restructuring law and controlling the cash economy—remain unresolved. The IMF's own characterization of progress as 'slow' and its specific concerns about the banking reform proposal are critical data points that temper the optimistic statements from the Lebanese Finance Minister. The timeline is extremely compressed; passing such politically explosive legislation in a month is a formidable challenge. However, there are significant factors pushing for a 'Yes' outcome that prevent a much lower probability. An IMF mission is currently in Beirut for formal negotiations over a specific draft agreement, representing a more advanced stage than previous discussions. Furthermore, external pressure is at a peak, with the EU explicitly tying 500 million euros in aid to an IMF agreement. This creates a powerful incentive for Lebanon's leadership to act. My forecast of 35% reflects that while the path to an agreement is narrow and fraught with political obstacles, the current confluence of active negotiations and acute external pressure creates a non-trivial chance of a breakthrough before the deadline. The forecast is not higher because the historical precedent of political paralysis on these exact issues is a very strong anchor. It is not lower because the current negotiating momentum and external leverage are demonstrably stronger than in previous attempts. I would increase my forecast upon news of a consensus deal on the bank restructuring law among Lebanon's main political blocs. I would decrease it if the IMF mission concludes its visit without announcing significant progress or a clear timeline for finalizing an agreement.",
