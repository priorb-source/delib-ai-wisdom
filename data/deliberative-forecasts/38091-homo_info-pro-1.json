    "review": "I reviewed the analyses from two other forecasters. Forecaster 2's analysis aligns closely with my own, arriving at the same 65% probability based on the strong recent momentum of one new signatory per month. Forecaster 2 adds a helpful point about international workshops acting as catalysts for these decisions. Forecaster 3 provides a bearish forecast of 30%, which serves as a valuable counterargument. Their core thesis is that the lack of a public announcement of an impending signing is strong negative evidence, as these events are often signaled in advance. However, I find this argument unconvincing. A review of recent signings shows that official announcements often coincide with the signing itself, without a long public lead-up. Therefore, the absence of an announcement by May 29 for an event in June is a neutral signal at best, not a strong negative one. Furthermore, Forecaster 3's analysis omits what I consider to be the most critical piece of evidence: the May 22 statement from acting NASA Administrator Janet Petro anticipating more signatories in the 'coming weeks.'",
    "rationale": "After deliberating with my colleagues, I am maintaining my forecast of 65%. The discussion reinforced the key drivers of my initial analysis. Forecaster 2's similar conclusion, based on the same evidence of strong momentum, increases my confidence. I have carefully considered Forecaster 3's argument that a lack of public announcement is a strong negative signal, but I disagree with its premise. The primary positive indicator remains the forward-looking statement from a high-level official. Acting NASA Administrator Janet Petro's specific mention of anticipating new signatories in the 'coming weeks' on May 22 is a very strong signal that at least one signing is in the final stages of arrangement. This statement, combined with the established signing rate of approximately one country per month recently, makes a signing in the June 2025 window highly probable. My forecast is not higher because diplomatic and political schedules are fluid; a signing planned for the last week of June could easily slip into the first week of July for logistical reasons, which would cause this narrowly defined question to resolve as 'No'. However, the evidence for near-term action is too strong to justify a forecast below 50%.",
