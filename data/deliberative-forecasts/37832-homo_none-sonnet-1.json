    "review": "The three forecasts show strong convergence at 8%, 8%, and 10%, which reinforces confidence in this range. All three analyses emphasize the same core factors: the CEO's explicit statement against a 2025 IPO, the extremely short 40-day timeframe, and the typical multi-month preparation required for IPO announcements. Forecaster 2 raises an interesting distinction worth examining: the resolution criteria asks about 'announcing plans' for an IPO, not executing one. This is technically a lower bar - Databricks could announce plans for a 2026 IPO before July 1, 2025, and still satisfy the criteria. However, this distinction doesn't dramatically change my assessment because: (1) Companies don't casually announce IPO plans even if execution is distant - such announcements trigger regulatory scrutiny, market expectations, and strategic commitments, and (2) The CEO's statement 'it's dumb to IPO this year' suggests opposition to the 2025 timeline broadly, which would include announcing plans in June 2025. Forecaster 2 also correctly notes we lack the exact date and full context of the CEO's statement, which introduces some uncertainty. However, its inclusion in the question background suggests recent relevance. No forecaster has identified new information that would materially change the assessment - we all see the same strong signals pointing toward No with a small probability reserved for unexpected developments.",
    "rationale": "After reviewing the other analyses, I find no compelling reason to update my forecast. The convergence at 8-10% across all three forecasters validates that this range appropriately captures the situation. The CEO's recent explicit statement against a 2025 IPO remains the dominant signal. While Forecaster 2's point about 'announcing plans' versus 'executing' is technically valid, it doesn't meaningfully shift the probability because companies still require substantial preparation and strategic commitment before announcing IPO plans publicly. The 40-day timeframe remains too compressed for a major reversal absent extraordinary circumstances like unexpected market opportunities, significant investor pressure, or dramatic competitive shifts - none of which have been indicated. My 8% forecast already accounts for inherent corporate decision-making uncertainty and the remote possibility of surprise announcements. The slight variation between 8% and 10% across forecasters likely reflects individual calibration preferences rather than substantive analytical differences. I maintain 8% as the appropriate forecast given the strong status quo bias toward No, the explicit CEO guidance, and the compressed timeline.",
