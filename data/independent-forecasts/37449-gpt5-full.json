  "information": "In April 2025, China conducted the \"Strait Thunder-2025A\" military exercises, which involved dozens of aircraft and warships. According to a spokesperson for the Chinese Eastern Theater Command, the operation aimed to test China's capabilities in \"controlling zones\" and \"blockading\" Taiwan, and included simulations of \"strikes on key ports and energy infrastructure.\" Following these and other drills, US military officials, including US Pacific Army Commander Ronald P. Clark and US Indo-Pacific Command Commander Admiral Samuel Paparo, stated that China's exercises simulating a blockade of Taiwan have become a \"regular occurrence\" and that Beijing is rehearsing the \"full spectrum of military operations.\"\n\nIn response to China's military exercises around Taiwan, the US has used terms such as \"intimidation tactics,\" \"provocative,\" \"coercive military activities,\" and \"aggressive military activities.\" In April 2025, the US Department of State accused China of \"putting regional security at risk\" with its drills. To date, US government statements have not officially characterized China's actions as a \"blockade.\" Historically, even during the 1995-1996 Taiwan Strait Crisis, the US did not formally accuse China of a blockade. Diplomatic talks between the US and China were held in Shanghai in April 2025.\n\nAccording to US military leaders, the upcoming 2025 National Defense Strategy (NDS) will prioritize \"preventing a Chinese attack on Taiwan\" as the sole major assumption scenario. This represents a strategic shift to focus on the Indo-Pacific region. At the same time, US Admiral Samuel Paparo has warned that China is rapidly increasing its production of warships and submarines relative to the US, stating a production ratio of 6 to 1.8 for warships and 2 to 1.4 for submarines. Paparo stated that while the US would prevail in a conflict now, its military forces are on a \"bad trajectory.\"",

    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "About 55 days (until June 30, 2025)",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "China continues gray-zone pressure and large-scale drills around Taiwan, possibly near the May 20 inauguration and into June, but does not physically prevent merchant vessels from entering or departing Taiwanese seaports. The U.S. condemns the activity as coercive/provocative without using the term “blockade.”",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "China declares and enforces exclusion/inspection zones that materially prevent commercial access to a specific Taiwanese port (e.g., Kaohsiung, Keelung) for a period of time, with credible reports of merchant ships turned away or detained. In response, a U.S. government body (e.g., State Department, DoD, White House) publicly characterizes this as a (de facto) blockade of that port before July 1, 2025.",
    "rationale": "Baseline: The U.S. has been careful to avoid labeling China’s activities as a “blockade,” even during major crises (e.g., 1995–96) or during recent encirclement-style drills. The research assistant notes that April 2025 exercises (“Strait Thunder-2025A”) involved simulated blockade operations and strikes, and that U.S. officials have described these as rehearsals or simulations, using terms like coercive, provocative, or intimidation—but not “blockade.” Historically and legally, calling something a blockade is highly escalatory and implies an act of war. This makes the bar for U.S. usage of that term quite high.  Short-term outlook (through June): A plausible flare-up window is around Taiwan’s May 20, 2025 inauguration, when Beijing often stages larger drills. Even then, the most likely behavior is continued pressure and temporary exercise zones that avoid fully shutting a port. U.S. messaging discipline further reduces the likelihood of using “blockade” language unless China clearly and verifiably prevents port access.  Why not higher: • The U.S. has strong incentives to avoid the legal/political implications of a “blockade” accusation. • China’s pattern has favored coercion short of war—including drills, exclusion zones, and harassment—without crossing to enforced port closures. • The time window is short (~8 weeks).  Why not lower: • Beijing’s exercises increasingly practice blockade-like operations; an escalation around/after the inauguration could include tighter exclusion zones. • An incident turning away merchant shipping at a specific port could compel sharper U.S. language, including “de facto blockade.”  What would move me up: • PLA announces/enforces maritime inspection or exclusion regimes that clearly close approaches to a named Taiwanese port. • Verified reporting of merchant vessels turned back/detained near a port. • U.S. officials begin using phrases like “de facto blockade” or explicitly accuse China of blocking a port.  What would move me down: • Calm post-inauguration period with routine drills only and continued commercial access to ports. • Continued U.S. avoidance of any “blockade” terminology in official briefings despite Chinese activities.  Summary of assistant’s report used: China’s April 2025 drills simulated blockade and strikes; U.S. leaders call it rehearsal but haven’t accused an actual blockade; U.S. statements emphasize coercion/provocation; diplomatic contacts occurred in April; U.S. strategy is shifting focus to Taiwan but that does not imply immediate labeling changes. Given the high linguistic/legal threshold and short window, No remains the status quo.",

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
