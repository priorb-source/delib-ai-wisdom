    "review": "All three of us have converged remarkably tightly on the same forecast range (4-6%), which is reassuring. We're all working from the same base rate calculation: 4-6 pilot reports from Africa over 10 years translates to roughly 0.4-0.6 per year, or 3-5% per month. Forecaster 3's explicit use of the Poisson distribution (1-exp(-λ/12)) is methodologically more rigorous than simple division, but yields effectively the same result. \n\nForecaster 3 raises two considerations I hadn't explicitly addressed: (1) misclassification/delayed tagging risk at NUFORC, and (2) the 'on or after July 1' timing language somewhat offsetting posting lag concerns. These are valid but relatively minor points. Forecaster 2's mention of potential air travel disruptions is also worth noting but seems unlikely to materially affect June 2025 specifically.\n\nNo forecaster has presented genuinely new evidence that would substantially move the needle. We're all working from the same historical data and arriving at the same probability range through slightly different framings. The January 2025 Rwanda report, which all of us acknowledge, provides weak evidence of continued activity but insufficient to justify moving far from the base rate. The tight clustering of our forecasts (4%, 5%, 6%) suggests we've correctly identified the appropriate range given the available information.",
    "rationale": "After reviewing the other forecasters' analyses, I find no compelling reason to change my forecast. All three of us have independently arrived at the same base rate calculation and reached nearly identical conclusions. The 3-5% monthly probability derived from historical data (4-6 reports over 10 years) remains the strongest anchor.\n\nThe minor methodological differences don't materially change the outcome: whether using simple division by 12 or a Poisson distribution approach, we arrive at the same range. The additional considerations raised by others—misclassification risk, posting delays, air travel disruptions—are valid but appear to be second-order effects that don't justify moving outside the 4-6% band.\n\nThe January 2025 Rwanda report continues to be relevant as proof of concept but doesn't indicate a systematic shift in reporting patterns. My original 5% forecast sits comfortably in the middle of our collective range and appropriately reflects both the demonstrated possibility of such events and their historical rarity. The convergence of independent analyses strengthens my confidence that this is the correct probability range.",
