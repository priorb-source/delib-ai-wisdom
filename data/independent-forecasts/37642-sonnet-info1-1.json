  "information": "Multiple Federal Reserve officials have emphasized a patient approach to monetary policy. Fed Chair Jerome Powell stated that the central bank is 'not in a hurry to cut interest rates' and will maintain a 'wait-and-see' approach. Similarly, Fed Governor Adriana Kugler commented that following an agreement to reduce US-China tariffs, the urgency for monetary easing has decreased. The minutes from the January FOMC meeting also indicated that officials decided to hold off on rate cuts until inflation shows more consistent improvement. In March 2025, the Federal Reserve increased its inflation estimate for the year to 2.7% and projected two potential interest rate cuts during 2025.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Approximately 47 days until July 1, 2025",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No rate cut. The Federal Reserve maintains its current interest rate range through June 2025 while continuing its wait-and-see approach.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "The Fed continues its patient stance through June. With inflation still at 2.7% (above the 2% target), economic conditions remain stable enough that officials see no urgency to cut rates. Any FOMC meetings scheduled before July 1 result in holding rates steady as the Fed waits for more consistent evidence of inflation improvement.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Either (1) a significant economic shock occurs - such as financial market instability, sharp deterioration in employment, or unexpected recession signals - forcing an emergency rate cut, or (2) inflation data shows dramatic unexpected improvement, allowing the Fed to begin its projected 2025 rate cut cycle earlier than anticipated at a late June FOMC meeting.",
    "rationale": "The status quo strongly favors no rate cut in the next 1.5 months. The Fed has explicitly stated it is 'not in a hurry to cut interest rates' and will maintain a 'wait-and-see' approach. Key officials have emphasized patience, and the January FOMC minutes confirmed they want to see 'more consistent improvement' in inflation before cutting. Critically, inflation remains elevated at 2.7%, and the Fed actually increased its inflation estimate in March 2025 - a hawkish signal. The recent US-China tariff agreement reduced perceived urgency for monetary easing. While the March projection included two potential rate cuts for 2025, there's no indication these are imminent. The timeframe is very short - only 6-7 weeks - likely allowing for at most 1-2 FOMC meetings. Given explicit Fed messaging about patience and the elevated inflation environment, a scheduled rate cut before July 1 appears quite unlikely. The main upside risk is an unexpected economic shock (financial crisis, sharp unemployment rise, major recession signals) that would force an emergency cut outside the normal schedule. However, such tail events are by definition low probability. The downside risk (making a cut even less likely) would be further inflation increases or additional hawkish Fed statements. My forecast is not higher because of the Fed's explicit patient stance, elevated inflation, and very short timeframe. It's not lower because there remains some non-negligible probability of an economic shock requiring emergency action, and technically there could be a late June meeting where conditions have shifted enough to warrant a cut.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill the Federal Reserve cut interest rates before July 1, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nJP Morgan: [Following the Fed’s decision to pause rate cuts, what could its next move be?](https://www.jpmorgan.com/insights/global-research/economy/fed-rate-cuts)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if, after the launch of this question and before July 1, 2025 the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) announces a reduction of any amount in the target federal funds rate range.\r\nThe primary resolution source is the FOMC's *target federal funds rate or range* webpage [here](https://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/openmarket.htm), the Federal Reserve's official minutes and statements [here](https://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/fomccalendars.htm), or other [credible sources](https://www.metaculus.com/help/faq/#definitions) in case the Federal Reserve's website is unavailable or not timely updated.\n\nThis question resolves based on the announcement.

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
