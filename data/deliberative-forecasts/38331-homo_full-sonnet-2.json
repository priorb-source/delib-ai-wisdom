    "review": "The convergence at 93% across all three forecasters is striking and suggests we've identified similar key factors. Forecaster 3's specific point about Myanmar and Venezuela being potentially less stable than established authoritarian states like China or North Korea is astute - Myanmar's military junta since 2021 and Venezuela under Maduro are indeed less predictable. However, even volatile authoritarian regimes don't typically reverse major censorship policies in 26 days without warning signals. Forecaster 2's observation that policy reversals are usually telegraphed in advance is important - there's been zero indication of policy debates in any of these seven countries. The point about the global trend not moving toward liberalization (evidenced by Tanzania's new ban and India's crackdown) actually reinforces the status quo. All forecasters correctly identified that Wikipedia editing represents the primary uncertainty rather than actual policy changes. The research report confirming that none of the seven target countries are involved in recent policy discussions is reassuring.",
    "rationale": "After reviewing the other forecasters' analyses, I remain confident in my 93% forecast. The convergence across all three independent analyses validates the key factors: (1) the 26-day timeframe is prohibitively short for policy reversals in authoritarian regimes, (2) these seven countries have deeply entrenched censorship policies spanning years or decades, (3) there are no signals of policy reconsideration in any of them, (4) the main risk comes from Wikipedia editing rather than actual policy changes. While Forecaster 3 correctly identifies Myanmar and Venezuela as potentially less stable, this doesn't meaningfully change the probability given the short timeframe and lack of any policy signals. The ~7% risk I'm assigning to NO is primarily driven by Wikipedia-related uncertainties (editing disputes, article reorganization, classification changes) rather than actual unblocking events. The fact that recent global blocking activity occurred in different countries (Tanzania, India) while the seven target countries show no movement reinforces the status quo assessment.",
