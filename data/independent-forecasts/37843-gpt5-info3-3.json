  "information": "The environment for technology IPOs in 2025 is described with mixed signals. Some reports mention a favorable IPO window, noting that other tech firms like CoreWeave, Klarna, and Figma have recently filed to go public. Other reports highlight market volatility, pointing to a recent 7-8.7% drop in the tech-heavy Nasdaq index and uncertainty surrounding Fed rate and trade policies as potential headwinds for companies considering a public launch.",

    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "About 38 days (until 2025-07-01)",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Discord proceeds toward a 2025 IPO but waits for a stronger window, using confidential SEC submissions and making no specific blog/news announcement. No public S-1 appears on EDGAR and nothing specific is posted on discord.com/blog before June 30.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Discord publicly files an S-1 in June to target a late-summer or early-fall listing, or posts a specific news/blog item stating it has confidentially submitted a draft registration statement or is planning an IPO in 2025.",
    "rationale": "- Anchoring on status quo: As of May 23, there has been no public S-1 or specific announcement on Discord’s news page. With roughly 5.5 weeks left, the default outcome is “No,” since most companies either file publicly close to their roadshow or keep confidential submissions quiet until closer to listing.\n- Evidence for a Yes: Reporting (e.g., Ars Technica) that Discord has hired JPMorgan and Goldman for a 2025 IPO suggests real intent and active preparation. The broader 2025 pipeline includes notable tech names, which supports the idea that the window is at least partly open. A company aiming for a late-summer/early-fall debut could plausibly file an S-1 in June, or announce a confidential submission on its news page—either would satisfy resolution.\n- Evidence for a No: The IPO window is mixed. Your research assistant notes recent Nasdaq softness (7–8.7% pullback) and macro uncertainty (rates, policy). Seasonally, many tech IPOs avoid the mid-summer lull and instead file publicly in late August for September/October debuts. If Discord is following that pattern, a public S-1 before July 1 is less likely. Also, companies frequently choose not to announce confidential submissions.\n- Why not higher: Seasonality and the option to keep submissions confidential make a pre–July 1 public signal less likely. If Discord targets a post-summer IPO, a June public S-1 is not necessary.\n- Why not lower: Concrete banker engagement and multiple peers advancing toward IPOs raise the odds that Discord could make its move in June, especially if market conditions stabilize.\n- What would move me up: A credible report that Discord has confidentially submitted (especially if paired with a company news post), an uptick in June tech IPO filings, or a clear market rebound reducing volatility.\n- What would move me down: Further tech selloff/volatility, reports of a delayed target timeline, additional internal restructuring, or an acquisition rumor that pauses IPO plans.\n- Resolution details considered: A public S-1 on EDGAR or a specific announcement on discord.com/blog would count; vague language would not, and in doubt, S-1 carries more weight per the criteria.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nBefore July 1, 2025, will Discord announce that it is planning an IPO?\n\nQuestion background:\nArs Technica: [Discord is planning an IPO this year, and big changes could be on the horizon](https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2025/03/report-discord-partners-with-jp-morgan-chase-goldman-sachs-for-a-2025-ipo/)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question will resolve as **Yes** if Discord, Inc., announces before July 1, 2025, that it is planning an initial public offering. In order to streamline the resolution of this question, there are two resolution sources for the IPO announcement: 1) The company filing an [SEC Form S-1](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/sec-form-s-1.asp) or 2) An announcement at the [news](https://discord.com/blog) section of its website. If there is no such announcement before that date, this question resolves as **No**.\n\nPlease note that for an announcement on the news section of the company's website to resolve the question as Yes, the announcement must be specific. Vague statements such as \"someday becoming a public company\" will not count. If there is any doubt, then greater weight will be placed on whether an S-1 has been filed.\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nThe environment for technology IPOs in 2025 is described with mixed signals. Some reports mention a favorable IPO window, noting that other tech firms like CoreWeave, Klarna, and Figma have recently filed to go public. Other reports highlight market volatility, pointing to a recent 7-8.7% drop in the tech-heavy Nasdaq index and uncertainty surrounding Fed rate and trade policies as potential headwinds for companies considering a public launch.\n\nToday is 2025-05-23.\n\nBefore answering you think:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n(e) You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
