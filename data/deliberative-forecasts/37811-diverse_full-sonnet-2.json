    "review": "The other forecasters raise several compelling points I underweighted in my initial analysis:\n\n**Forecaster 3's strongest arguments:**\n1. The resolution criterion only requires the site to be 'reachable' by IsItDownRightNow - a much lower bar than full functionality or specific content preservation\n2. Historical precedent: During 2017-2020, high-profile NOAA websites remained online even when content was altered\n3. The distinction between content/database changes (clearly happening) versus complete domain takedown (much rarer)\n4. Government .gov domains have very high base rates of stability over short timeframes\n5. Even in aggressive policy shifts, agencies typically maintain redirects rather than completely removing domains\n\n**Forecaster 2's key insight:**\nEmphasizes that taking down a high-profile public website is more visible and controversial than archiving specialized databases or internal staff cuts - creating additional political friction against removal.\n\nBoth forecasters correctly note that the 41-day timeframe is very short for major infrastructure changes, and that the explicit NOAA public commitment (April 4) provides strong near-term protection.\n\n**What I may have overweighted:**\n- The aggressive policy environment - while real, content changes don't necessarily mean infrastructure removal\n- Technical/operational risks - government sites have high uptime even with understaffing\n- The warning memo - consideration doesn't equal implementation\n\n**What remains concerning:**\n- This administration appears more aggressive than 2017-2020\n- Project 2025 is more comprehensive\n- Staff cuts could create genuine operational issues\n- Non-zero tail risk of executive directive overriding institutional assurances",
    "rationale": "After reviewing both analyses, I'm updating upward based primarily on three factors:\n\n1. **Resolution criterion clarity**: I insufficiently weighted that 'reachable' is a low bar. The site could lose content, redirect elsewhere, or be substantially altered and still resolve Yes. Complete unreachability is a much higher threshold than I initially modeled.\n\n2. **Base rate evidence**: Forecaster 3's point about 2017-2020 precedent is strong. Even during significant climate policy rollbacks, major NOAA web properties stayed online. This is directly relevant historical evidence.\n\n3. **Content vs. infrastructure distinction**: The database decommissioning represents content policy, not web infrastructure policy. These are separate decisions with different stakeholders and visibility.\n\nHowever, I'm not updating to 94% because:\n- Current political environment appears more aggressive than 2017-2020\n- The internal memo shows takedown was actively considered\n- Unprecedented scope of changes at NOAA creates genuine uncertainty\n- Executive orders could override institutional commitments\n\nThe explicit April 4 NOAA statement plus base rates plus low resolution bar justify high confidence, but the tail risks of either deliberate removal or operational failure during the 41-day window remain non-trivial. 91% appropriately balances the strong fundamentals with meaningful political and operational uncertainty.",
