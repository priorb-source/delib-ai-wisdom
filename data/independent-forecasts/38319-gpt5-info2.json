  "information": "A survey by the Imperial Data Bank found that for 2025, only 19.2% of companies in the Tohoku region expect an increase in revenue and profits, a three-year low, while 26.2% expect a decrease, citing fluctuating oil prices, inflation, and labor shortages. In April 2025, corporate bankruptcies in the region rose to 53, a 32.5% increase from the same month last year and the third consecutive month of increases. Additionally, new company establishments in the region decreased by 5% in 2024, the first annual decrease in two years.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "About 2–3 weeks (METI Tohoku April 2025 IIP expected around June 21, 2025)",
    "status_quo_outcome": "Slight month-over-month dip or flat after March’s large +7.6% rebound (i.e., No)",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Mean reversion after an unusually strong March; softness in autos or electrical machinery outweighs gains elsewhere; weak local business conditions and higher bankruptcies translate into lower production runs; April orders were tepid and firms draw down inventories.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Momentum from March continues; autos/transport equipment and electrical machinery lift regional output; semiconductor-related demand and export competitiveness from a weak yen support production; inventories are rebuilt into early Q2.",
    "rationale": "Baseline: Industrial production tends to be close to a coin flip month to month, but very large moves often mean-revert. March’s +7.6% m/m in Tohoku is outsized, which slightly tilts the next month toward a pullback or flat result. Regional business signals are also soft: the research assistant notes only 19.2% of Tohoku firms expect revenue/profit increases in 2025 (a 3-year low), corporate bankruptcies in April rose 32.5% YoY, and new company establishments fell in 2024. While these are not tight predictors of a single month’s IIP print, they lean against a continuation of strength.\nCountervailing factors: The global tech/semiconductor cycle has been improving into 2025, and the weak yen supports exporters and domestic substitution. If transport equipment or electrical machinery performed well in April, that could carry the region to another small increase. Also, April is not disrupted by Golden Week (which is in early May), so operationally it can be a steady production month.\nWeighting: I put extra weight on the status quo/mean-reversion pattern after a big jump, nudged further by weak local sentiment and rising bankruptcies, but I keep the forecast near 50% because sectoral dynamics (autos, electronics) could still deliver a marginal positive print. I have not incorporated a definitive national April IIP print for sector mapping; if nationwide April output (especially in transport equipment and electrical machinery) was clearly negative, I would lower this; if clearly positive, I would raise it.\nWhy not higher: Large prior-month surge usually cools; local business indicators skew negative. Why not lower: Potential tech/auto tailwinds and yen-driven competitiveness could be enough for a small positive.\nUpdate triggers: Upward revision if national/sectoral April data show clear strength in autos/electrical machinery or reports indicate continued ramp-ups at key Tohoku plants; downward if national/sectoral April data show broad weakness or reports of production cutbacks/inventory overhang in the region.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill the Northeast Japan region (Tohoku) show a month-over-month increase in April 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\n[Tohoku's March industrial production index rises 7.6% from the previous month, the first increase in three months](https://www.nikkei.com/article/DGXZQOCC214DI0R20C25A5000000/)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if the [industrial production announcement](https://www.tohoku.meti.go.jp/cyosa/tokei/iip.html) for April 2025 (expected approximately June 21, 2025) reports a monthly change in production (\"生産\") of greater than 0.0%.\n\n\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nA survey by the Imperial Data Bank found that for 2025, only 19.2% of companies in the Tohoku region expect an increase in revenue and profits, a three-year low, while 26.2% expect a decrease, citing fluctuating oil prices, inflation, and labor shortages. In April 2025, corporate bankruptcies in the region rose to 53, a 32.5% increase from the same month last year and the third consecutive month of increases. Additionally, new company establishments in the region decreased by 5% in 2024, the first annual decrease in two years.\n\nToday is 2025-06-04.\n\nBefore answering you think:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n(e) You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
