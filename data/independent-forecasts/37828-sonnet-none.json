    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Approximately 40 days, from May 22, 2025 to July 1, 2025",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No - Rippling does not announce an IPO",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Rippling continues operating as a private company, potentially raising additional private capital if needed. The company maintains its current growth trajectory without making any public statements about going public or filing an S-1 form before the July 1 deadline.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Rippling's leadership decides market conditions are favorable and the company is ready for public markets. They either file an SEC Form S-1 or publish an announcement on their company blog at rippling.com/blog stating their intention to pursue an IPO, doing so before July 1, 2025.",
    "rationale": "The time horizon is quite short at approximately 40 days, which significantly constrains the probability. The status quo strongly favors a No outcome since companies don't announce IPOs on a regular cadence, and major corporate decisions like going public typically involve months or years of preparation. My research assistant provided no additional information suggesting imminent IPO plans, rumors, or market signals. The background article mentions Rippling's business expansion and share value appreciation, which are positive indicators of company health but don't directly signal IPO timing. For an IPO announcement to occur within 40 days, preparations would almost certainly need to be already underway with bankers engaged, financial audits completed, and S-1 drafting in progress. The absence of any leaked information or reports about such preparations is telling. The base rate for venture-backed companies announcing IPOs in any random 40-day window is extremely low, likely under 2-3% even for mature unicorns. However, I'm not going lower than 8% because: (1) 40 days is technically sufficient time for a well-prepared company to make an announcement, (2) companies can surprise markets with IPO timing, and (3) the question only asks about announcing plans, not completing the IPO process. I'm not going higher because there are no specific signals, market conditions in 2025 may still be challenging for tech IPOs, and most private companies remain private at any given time. To update higher, I would need to see: leaked reports of IPO preparations, banker engagement rumors, or statements from company leadership about public market readiness. To update lower, confirmation that Rippling recently raised large private rounds would suggest less urgency for public markets.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nBefore July 1, 2025, will Rippling announce that it is planning an IPO?\n\nQuestion background:\n[Startup News: Shares of HR firm Rippling gain value as its business expands](https://forgeglobal.com/insights/blog/startup-news-shares-of-rippling-gain-value-as-its-business-expands/)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question will resolve as **Yes** if Rippling, Inc., announces before July 1, 2025, that it is planning an initial public offering. In order to streamline the resolution of this question, there are two resolution sources for the IPO announcement: 1) The company filing an [SEC Form S-1](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/sec-form-s-1.asp) or 2) An announcement at the [news](https://www.rippling.com/blog) section of its website. If there is no such announcement before that date, this question resolves as **No**.\n\n\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nNo additional information available.\n\nToday is 2025-05-22.\n\nBefore answering you think:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n(e) You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
