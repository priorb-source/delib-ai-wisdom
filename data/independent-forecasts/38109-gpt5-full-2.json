  "information": "Kalshi, a prediction market platform regulated by the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC), has been actively offering daily MLB markets since April 17, 2025. Sports-related contracts represent a significant portion of its business, accounting for over 80% of weekend trading volume. The company has handled substantial trading activity, including $27 million for the Super Bowl and $500 million for the March Madness basketball tournament. Kalshi has also filed with the CFTC to expand its offerings to include single-game predictions.\n\nThe platform faces legal and regulatory challenges. A judge in Nevada is expected to rule quickly on a case involving Kalshi's prediction markets. Major sports leagues have voiced concerns; the NBA has cited 'substantial integrity risks' due to a perceived lack of regulatory oversight compared to traditional sportsbooks, and Major League Baseball has highlighted the need for consumer protections equivalent to state-level regulations. In response, Kalshi has announced plans to enhance user protections, including voluntary opt-outs, self-imposed trading breaks, and deposit caps.\n\nJune is part of the MLB regular season, during which games are scheduled on nearly every calendar day. The MLB All-Star Game is scheduled for July 2025. Other baseball-related events in late June include the Liga Mexicana de Béisbol (LMB) All-Star Game, set to take place from June 27 to 29, 2025.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "About 1 month (outcome knowable by July 1, 2025, after all June days have passed)",
    "status_quo_outcome": "Yes — Kalshi continues listing at least one MLB game market every day, as it has since mid-April 2025",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "A legal or regulatory action (e.g., an injunction or a Kalshi self-imposed pause in response to a ruling or regulator pressure) causes them to suspend MLB markets for at least one day in June; or an operational lapse/outage means no MLB game market is listed on a given day",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Kalshi maintains its current cadence of daily MLB listings through June without interruption, posting at least one market each day that MLB games are played",
    "rationale": "Baseline: Since April 17, 2025, Kalshi has been offering daily MLB markets, and sports now drive a large share of volume (per the assistant: >80% of weekend trading, with substantial event volumes). June is within the MLB regular season, which typically has at least one game every day of the month. Incentives strongly favor continuity: sports are a major business line, and Kalshi has announced enhanced consumer protections to address league and regulator concerns, suggesting an intent to keep offerings live rather than pause them.\n\nMain risks pulling the forecast down:\n- Regulatory/legal: A Nevada judge plans to move quickly on a Kalshi case. While a state ruling would most likely constrain activity in that state rather than nationally, Kalshi could choose to pause certain sports products broadly to mitigate risk. Also, leagues (NBA/MLB) have voiced integrity and consumer-protection concerns; if these prompt CFTC scrutiny or a negotiated pause, even a single missed day yields a No.\n- Operational: A rare site outage, listing pipeline failure, or last-minute compliance check could lead to one day without an MLB market. The question requires a perfect streak across all days in June, so even small daily failure probabilities compound.\n- Exogenous: An extremely unlikely MLB-wide off day or mass postponements could make it impossible to meet the criterion (“game being played that day”). This is a very small tail risk in June.\n\nWhy not higher: The combination of pending legal action, vocal league objections, and the need for an uninterrupted 30-day streak argue against a 90s+ probability. A single-day pause or technical miss would resolve No.\n\nWhy not lower: The status quo is strong — daily MLB listings have been live since mid-April; sports are a core revenue driver; and announced user-protection enhancements point to regulatory risk management rather than retreat. A Nevada ruling is unlikely to mandate a nationwide halt, and Kalshi has strong incentives to maintain MLB markets during peak season.\n\nWhat would move me up: Evidence that (1) the Nevada ruling, if adverse, is explicitly limited in scope and Kalshi won’t pause nationally; (2) Kalshi posts/commits to a June MLB schedule and demonstrates consistent listings in the first week; (3) public CFTC commentary supportive or neutral on sports single-game markets.\n\nWhat would move me down: (1) Any interim court order, regulator notice, or Kalshi blog/email suggesting a pause or product modification; (2) reports of technical instability or a maintenance window overlapping a full MLB slate; (3) new, sharper objections from MLB coupled with Kalshi signaling changes to baseball markets.\n\nResearch assistant inputs used: Kalshi’s active daily MLB markets since April 17, 2025; sports dominance in trading volume; large prior sports-event volumes (Super Bowl, March Madness); filing to expand single-game predictions; league/regulatory concerns; Kalshi’s announced consumer-protection measures; and that MLB games are scheduled on nearly every day in June.",

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any).
