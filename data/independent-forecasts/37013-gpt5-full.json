  "information": "The composition of the Cornwall Council prior to the 2025 election consisted of 44 seats for the Conservatives, 13 for the Liberal Democrats, 4 for Labour, 1 for Reform UK, and 1 for the Greens, with the remainder held by others or independents. This represents a 31-seat lead for the Conservatives over the Liberal Democrats. Historically, the Liberal Democrats have never been the largest party on the Cornwall Council.\n\nNational polling data shows the Conservative party with a 22% approval rating, while Reform UK is polling at 25% and the Liberal Democrats at approximately 14-16%. In the 2024 UK general election, the Liberal Democrats regained the constituencies of North Cornwall and St Ives. Political analyst Professor John Curtice has noted that the surge in support for Reform UK is likely to split the right-wing vote, which could indirectly benefit the Liberal Democrats.\n\nFor the 2025 election, the Liberal Democrat party has launched a significant fundraising effort, including a £100,000 fund, and is fielding a near-full slate of candidates. An Electoral Calculus MRP poll has been cited in analyses of the election. On the Conservative side, several high-profile councillors announced their retirement, including the council leader Linda Taylor.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "~11–12 days (polling day expected 1 May 2025; results likely 2 May)",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No — Conservatives remain the largest party (plurality) even if reduced, given their large starting lead and vote fragmentation among opposition/independents.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "The Conservative vote falls sharply but remains the single largest bloc as Reform UK siphons right-leaning votes inefficiently, Labour consolidates in Truro/Falmouth/Camborne-type wards, and Independents hold many rural seats. Result: No overall control with Conservatives still largest, or Independents edge out both Conservatives and Lib Dems to be largest.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "A pronounced anti-Conservative swing plus Reform UK vote-splitting collapses Tory seat totals, while the Lib Dems’ near-full slate, targeted rural ground game, and tactical anti-Tory voting in former Lib Dem heartlands flip enough wards (especially in North Cornwall and St Ives areas) for the Lib Dems to emerge narrowly as the largest party, even without a majority.",
    "rationale": "Starting point: Conservatives reportedly hold 44 seats vs. 13 for the Liberal Democrats on an 87-seat council (rest Labour/Greens/Reform/Independents). That is a very large 31-seat gap to overcome for the Lib Dems to be the largest party. Historically, the Lib Dems have not been the largest party on Cornwall Council, which lowers the base rate for a Yes outcome.\n\nHeadwinds for Conservatives are significant: national polling pegs them around the low 20s with Reform UK in the mid-20s and Lib Dems around 14–16. Reform’s strength tends not to translate into many local seats but can split the right, damaging Conservatives. Local factors also look challenging for the Conservatives (retirements including the council leader) and the Lib Dems are reportedly well-organized, fundraising strongly (~£100k) and fielding a near-full slate. The 2024 general election saw Lib Dem wins in North Cornwall and St Ives, indicating pockets of strong LD support that could convert in council wards.\n\nCountervailing factors: Cornwall traditionally has strong Independents. Labour is likely to perform better than in past cycles in more urban/industrial areas (e.g., Truro & Falmouth, Camborne/Redruth), which fragments the anti-Tory vote. Even with a Conservative decline, the vote could spread across Labour, Independents, Greens, and Reform, making it easier for Conservatives to remain the largest party on a reduced seat count, or for Independents to top the table. Moving from 13 seats to the largest tally requires a very large number of ward-level gains for the Lib Dems; while plausible in a wave, it remains a tall order.\n\nWhy not higher: The base-rate and arithmetic hurdles are large—going from 13 to the largest party typically requires 15–20+ net gains, while also outpacing Independents and a residual Conservative bloc. Local dynamics in Cornwall often favor Independents, and Reform’s presence may produce chaotic three- and four-way splits rather than clean LD gains.\n\nWhy not lower: The Conservative brand is unusually weak, Reform’s vote-splitting specifically harms Conservatives, and the Lib Dems have recent parliamentary momentum in Cornwall plus a strong local campaign and candidate slate. In fragmented fields, well-targeted Lib Dem operations can win pluralities with modest shares.\n\nWhat would move me up: Credible Cornwall-specific polling showing LD leading on vote share; evidence of widespread Conservative non-candidacies or campaign collapse; clear signs of coordinated anti-Tory tactical voting; reports that Independents are running fewer candidates than usual in key LD target wards.\n\nWhat would move me down: Evidence that Independents are fielding and polling strongly across rural divisions; signs Labour is surging in multiple target wards at LD expense; indications Reform is concentrating in LD-Tory battlegrounds, splitting the anti-incumbent vote; strong local incumbency effects for Conservatives holding up in by-elections or ward-level canvass data.\n\nBottom line: A Lib Dem plurality is plausible but still an underdog outcome given the high starting gap and Cornwall’s independent-heavy landscape. I overweight the status quo (largest-party Conservatives or Independents) while acknowledging meaningful upside risk for the Lib Dems in this cycle.",
