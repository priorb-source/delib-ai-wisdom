    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "About 60 days (until July 1, 2025)",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No – Tanzania remains at Level 2 (Exercise Increased Caution) through July 1, 2025.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "State reissues or leaves in place a Level 2 advisory, possibly updating language about crime or localized risks (e.g., borders, Zanzibar) without changing the overall level; no large-scale terror attack, nationwide unrest, or major health emergency occurs.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "A high-profile terrorist attack or series of incidents targeting tourists or major cities (Dar es Salaam, Arusha, Zanzibar), a sharp spillover of insurgent activity from northern Mozambique into southern Tanzania, widespread violent political unrest, or a serious infectious disease outbreak prompts State to raise the overall advisory to Level 3 before July 1.",
    "rationale": "- Baseline/Status quo: Tanzania has generally been at Level 2 in recent years. The State Department tends to change overall levels infrequently unless there is a material deterioration in risk. With only ~2 months left, the default is that no level change occurs.\n- Triggers for Level 3: The most plausible drivers in the near term would be (1) a significant terror incident, (2) meaningful spillover from Mozambique’s Cabo Delgado insurgency into Tanzania’s Mtwara/Lindi areas, (3) large-scale civil unrest, or (4) a major health emergency (e.g., hemorrhagic fever outbreak). While conceivable, none is currently apparent or likely on a short fuse.\n- Why not higher: The State Department often addresses localized risks by maintaining Level 2 overall while assigning higher levels to specific regions or issuing more detailed cautions. Tanzania’s security environment has been relatively stable compared with higher-risk neighbors, and there is no known, imminent nationwide threat. Two months is a short window for such a shift.\n- Why not lower: There are nontrivial tail risks—regional jihadist activity, sporadic crime against tourists, and the possibility of pre-election tensions or health outbreaks. State can and does update advisories at short notice following significant incidents.\n- Update signals upward: Credible reports of major attacks in tourist/urban areas, sudden cross-border escalation from Mozambique, widespread political violence, or a declared serious outbreak with travel implications.\n- Update signals downward: A fresh State Department update in May/June that explicitly reaffirms Level 2 without major new warnings; continued calm through mid-June.\n- Research assistant info: None new was provided; this keeps the forecast anchored to recent historical patterns and general regional risk assessments rather than any breaking development.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill Tanzania receive a \"Level 3 – Reconsider Travel\" travel advisory from the US State Department before July 1, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nTravel and Tour World: [Travel Advisory for Tanzania: How Increased Crime and Terrorism Threats Impact Tourists in Popular African Destinations](https://www.travelandtourworld.com/news/article/travel-advisory-for-tanzania-how-increased-crime-and-terrorism-threats-impact-tourists-in-popular-african-destinations/)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if the country of Tanzania has received a Level 3 [travel advisory](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/International-Travel-Country-Information-Pages/Tanzania.html) from the US Department of State before July 1, 2025.\n\n\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nNo additional information available.\n\nToday is 2025-05-02.\n\nBefore answering you think:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n(e) You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
