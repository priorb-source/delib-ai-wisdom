    "review": "The other forecasters provided critical perspectives. Forecaster 2 introduced the most significant new information: as of May 20, Aaron Judge's batting average is actually above .400. This reframes the question from whether a player can *reach* .400 to whether Judge can *maintain* it. Their use of advanced metrics like BABIP (.481) and xBA (~.362) provides a powerful, data-driven argument for why regression is highly likely, making their 14% forecast very convincing. Forecaster 3 offered a valuable anchor in the historical base rate, correctly noting the extreme rarity of this feat over the past 25 years and citing the Luis Arráez example from 2023 as a case study in late-stage regression. However, their analysis was hampered by not having the current data on Judge, likely leading to their lower forecast of 6%, which feels too low now that we know a player is already at the threshold.",
    "rationale": "My initial forecast of 15% was based on a player needing to get hot to climb from the .370s to .400. The new information that Aaron Judge is already over the .400 mark fundamentally changes the analysis but leads to a similar conclusion. The problem is now one of staving off regression for approximately six weeks. Forecaster 2's analysis is compelling; Judge's unsustainably high Batting Average on Balls in Play (BABIP) and an Expected Batting Average (xBA) in the .360s strongly signal that his average is due to fall. The historical base rates, emphasized by Forecaster 3, confirm how difficult it is to defy this statistical gravity. However, Judge is currently performing at a historic level, and the ~110-120 at-bats remaining until July 1st is a small enough sample size to allow for continued high variance. The fact that Luis Arráez took a .400+ average deep into June of 2023 shows that it is possible in the modern era to flirt with this mark into the summer. Therefore, while regression is the most likely outcome, Judge's current position makes a non-trivial probability warranted. The convergence of my initial forecast and Forecaster 2's more data-rich analysis gives me confidence in the 15% level. I am not changing my forecast, as the new evidence serves to strongly reinforce my original probability estimate with a much more robust line of reasoning.",
