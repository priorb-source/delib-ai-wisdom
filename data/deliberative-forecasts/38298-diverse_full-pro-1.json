    "review": "The deliberation reveals a strong consensus among all three forecasters, with initial probabilities tightly clustered between 58% and 62%. We all agree on the primary factors: the powerful warming trend seen in early 2025 is the main driver for a 'Yes' outcome, while the transition away from El Niño and mixed regional data (e.g., a cool India) are the main sources of uncertainty. Forecaster 2 rightly emphasized a subtle but important point: the resolution criteria require a definitive 1st place finish, not a tie, which introduces a small amount of additional uncertainty at the margin. Forecaster 3 provided the most compelling new argument by stressing the overwhelming and persistent influence of record-high global sea surface temperatures (SSTs). Their point that the ocean's massive thermal inertia carries more weight than any single regional land anomaly, like the cooling in India, is a critical insight.",
    "rationale": "I am updating my forecast slightly upwards based on the deliberation. My initial forecast of 60% was based on a balance between the year's record-setting momentum and the waning influence of El Niño. Forecaster 3's analysis convinced me that I may have underweight a key physical driver: the immense, persistent heat stored in the oceans. This record ocean heat provides a very high baseline temperature, meaning the system has significant thermal inertia and may not need an active El Niño to continue setting records. This powerful signal likely outweighs the cooling effect observed in India and mitigates the uncertainty from the neutral ENSO state. While I acknowledge Forecaster 2's point about the strictness of a 1st-place ranking adding a slight chance of failure due to measurement noise, I believe the strength of the underlying ocean heat signal is the more dominant factor. Therefore, I am increasing my confidence by a few percentage points to reflect a stronger belief in the underlying warming trend's ability to overcome the hurdles.",
