  "information": "The '50501' movement, a decentralized organization originating from a Reddit forum, planned nationwide protests on May 1, 2025, coinciding with International Workers' Day. The protests were organized to oppose the Trump administration's policies on immigration and labor. The movement's website listed over 1,000 events across all 50 states, with major demonstrations expected in Washington D.C., Chicago, Denver, Seattle, and Los Angeles. Organizations supporting the protests included the Political Revolution PAC and the Service Employees International Union. News reports following the event stated that over 1,100 protests took place under the '50501' banner across the U.S. and worldwide.\n\nOn April 5, 2025, demonstrations under the \"Hands Off!\" campaign occurred across all 50 U.S. states and in several international cities. A coalition of over 150 groups, including Indivisible and MoveOn, organized the events in response to administration policies such as federal layoffs, rising tariffs, and civil rights rollbacks. Participation estimates varied: one report cited over 1,400 events with nearly 600,000 attendees, while another stated over 600,000 people participated in more than 1,200 rallies. Solidarity protests were also held in cities like Berlin, London, and Paris.\n\nData from the Crowd Counting Consortium from early 2025 showed a notable trend in protest activity. The consortium recorded 2,085 protests nationwide in February 2025, more than double the 937 recorded in February 2017. However, the data also indicated that the average size of these events had decreased to an estimated 60-88 participants per protest. In separate protest movements, over 300 actions were reported on university campuses related to the conflict in Israel.",

    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Approximately 2 months until July 1, 2025",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No - The Global Protest Tracker has not yet reported any U.S. protests with 10,000+ participants meeting the criteria",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "The Global Protest Tracker either never reports the recent April 5 and May 1, 2025 protests, or reports them with participation counts below 10,000 for each individual event. No additional large protests occur before July 1, or those that do occur also fall short of the 10,000 participant threshold at any single location.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "The Global Protest Tracker reports at least one of the major protests from April 5 or May 1, 2025 with 10,000+ participants at a single location (such as Washington D.C., Chicago, Los Angeles, or Seattle), or a new large-scale protest event occurs between now and July 1, 2025 that reaches this threshold.",
    "rationale": "Two major protest movements have already occurred in the relevant timeframe: the April 5 'Hands Off!' campaign and the May 1 '50501' movement. The April 5 protests involved 600,000+ participants across 1,200-1,400 events nationally, while May 1 saw over 1,100 protests. However, Crowd Counting Consortium data shows average protest sizes in 2025 have been quite small (60-88 participants). The critical question is whether any individual location reached 10,000+ participants. With 600,000 total participants across events, if distribution followed typical patterns, major cities like Washington D.C., Chicago, Los Angeles, or Seattle could plausibly have had single events reaching 10,000+. The largest protests tend to concentrate in major metropolitan areas during coordinated national actions. However, uncertainty remains about whether the Global Protest Tracker will actually report these events and whether any single location truly reached the threshold. There are still two months remaining for additional protests to occur or for the Tracker to report past events. The forecast is not higher because of uncertainty about individual event sizes and whether the Tracker captures them; it's not lower because the scale and coordination of recent protests, combined with time remaining, suggests reasonable likelihood of at least one 10,000+ event being reported.",

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower.
