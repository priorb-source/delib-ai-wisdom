    "review": "The other forecasters provided critical additional context. Forecaster 2’s key contribution was specifying the March 2025 unemployment rate at a historic low of 2.2%. This single data point is pivotal, as it quantifies the magnitude of the jump (+0.8 percentage points) needed for a 'No' outcome, highlighting how historically improbable such a one-month change would be. Their argument about the lag between economic shocks and statistical reporting is also very compelling. Forecaster 3 provided useful structural context about Mexico's large informal sector dampening official unemployment volatility and the 'threshold risk' of a 3.0% result resolving as 'No'. However, I believe their 60% forecast gives far too much weight to medium-term risks (like tariffs and IMF projections) that are unlikely to manifest as a sudden, massive shock specifically in the April 2025 data release.",
    "rationale": "My initial forecast of 75% was based on the general principle of labor market inertia but was tempered by the stated risks of US tariffs and a potential economic slowdown. After reviewing the other analyses, I am substantially increasing my forecast. The new, decisive piece of evidence is the March 2025 unemployment rate of 2.2%, as highlighted by Forecaster 2. For the rate to reach 3.0% or higher in April, it would require an increase of at least 0.8 percentage points. A single-month jump of this magnitude is extremely rare and would require a catastrophic economic shock, such as the onset of a major recession or a massive, sudden wave of coordinated layoffs. Economic shocks, like the proposed tariffs, typically have effects that are distributed over several months, not concentrated in a single data point. Furthermore, as today is April 29th, a shock severe enough to cause this jump would almost certainly have produced other visible economic indicators or major news reports by now. The structural point from Forecaster 3 about the informal economy adds further weight to the argument for low volatility in the official rate. While the threshold risk is real, the probability of the rate jumping so high as to even approach the 3.0% threshold is exceedingly low. Therefore, I am updating my forecast upward to reflect the very high probability that this historically large one-month jump did not occur.",
