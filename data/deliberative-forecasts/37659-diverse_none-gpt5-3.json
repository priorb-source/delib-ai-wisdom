    "review": "New and useful: Forecaster 2’s claim that the tracker has ~2,137 objectives (making 120 ≈5.6%) and the implied 0.74/day pace to reach 120 by July 1. That materially lowers the bar versus my implicit assumption of a smaller objective set. Also helpful: emphasis on low‑hanging items actionable via EO/memos and the “legal friction + evidentiary standard” headwinds. Less convincing: both F2 and F3 implicitly assume an administration aligned with Project 2025; that assumption drives their probabilities but remains a key branch uncertainty in my model. I find F3’s numerical assumptions (500–800 total objectives) likely incorrect given F2’s more precise figure; this makes F3’s caution somewhat overstated, although his point about rigorous ‘Done’ criteria is persuasive. F2’s 60% feels high if ‘Done’ requires implementation not merely announcement and given probable injunctions/lag in confirmations, but his data point on total objective count justifies a higher estimate than my prior.",
    "rationale": "I update upward mainly on the size of the objective set (~2,137), which implies 120 could be achieved with a relatively modest share of granular actions, especially early in a term. That increases the conditional probability of clearing 120 if the administration is aligned and executing a prepared playbook. Countervailing factors remain: (1) the tracker’s likely strict ‘Done’ criteria, (2) legal injunctions and implementation lags, and (3) only ~6.5 weeks left. I still treat administration alignment as an unresolved branch in this exercise (given no current tracker read or political context provided). Quantitatively: If aligned, I now put P(≥120) ≈ 65% (higher than my prior “moderate” due to the 5.6% threshold and availability of quick wins). If not aligned, ≈5%. With scenario weight ~50/50 given our information constraints, the blended probability is ~35%. Given the plausibility that the others’ alignment assumption reflects context I lack, I nudge modestly higher to 40% but stop well short of F2’s 60% due to ‘Done’ rigor and litigation/confirmation bottlenecks. I would move up quickly with evidence the tracker is already ≥90–100 or showing rapid recent upticks; I would move down if current ‘Done’ is well below ~70 or if many key actions are enjoined and thus not counted as ‘Done.’",
