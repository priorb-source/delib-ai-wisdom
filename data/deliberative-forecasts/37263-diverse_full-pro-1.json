    "review": "All three forecasters agree that a 'No' outcome is overwhelmingly likely. We all identified the same core reasons: the short timeframe, the small market size, the prohibitive regulatory environment targeting unlicensed taxis, and the presence of local competitors. My initial forecast was 2%, Forecaster 2 was at 4%, and Forecaster 3 at 8%. The primary difference in our forecasts stems from the weight given to a specific 'Yes' scenario. Forecaster 3 made a compelling argument that I had not fully weighed: the possibility of a *rapid launch* of an 'Uber Taxi' style partnership with existing licensed taxi fleets. They argued this could be stood up quickly to capitalize on summer tourism demand and would align with, rather than oppose, the government's focus on licensed transport. This is a crucial point because it provides a plausible, though unlikely, path to a 'Yes' outcome that bypasses the main regulatory hurdles.",
    "rationale": "After reviewing the other forecasts, I am updating my own. My initial 2% forecast was heavily influenced by the near-impossibility of a traditional Uber launch within the 60-day timeframe. I did not give enough weight to the 'Uber Taxi' partnership model as a rapid-entry vector, a point well-articulated by Forecaster 3. This model would allow Uber to enter the market without needing to recruit its own drivers, instead leveraging the existing licensed taxi infrastructure. The TCI government's crackdown is on *illegal* taxis, so a partnership with licensed operators could be seen as a modernization effort and might face fewer obstacles. The booming tourism numbers provide a strong commercial incentive for such a move. While the probability remains very low due to the complete absence of any public signals, the extremely short timeline for implementation, and the small market size, this partnership scenario is more plausible than I had initially assessed. I find Forecaster 3's 8% too high, as it implies a greater than 1-in-13 chance of a surprise launch with zero groundwork visible. Forecaster 2's 4% seems like a more calibrated adjustment. Therefore, I am doubling my initial forecast to reflect the increased plausibility of this specific partnership scenario, while still acknowledging that the status quo is by far the most likely outcome.",
