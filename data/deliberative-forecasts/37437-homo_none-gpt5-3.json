    "review": "Both forecasters reach the same core view as mine: with ~8 weeks left, a PLA ground landing on Taiwan-controlled territory is extremely unlikely, and even if a limited seizure occurred, the US might avoid the specific term “invasion,” creating an additional hurdle for resolution. They add a few useful specificity points I agree with: likelihood of NOTAMs/maritime closures as precursors, potential use of PRC coast guard/paramilitary to muddy attribution, and the US tendency toward precise wording. None of this conflicts with my prior; it reinforces it.",
    "rationale": "The bar for a Yes is twofold: (1) PLA ground forces actually land on Taiwan-controlled land without Taipei’s consent, and (2) the US government publicly characterizes it as an invasion. The short timeline, lack of open-source indicators of amphibious/airborne mobilization, and Beijing’s preference for coercive gray-zone tactics over high-risk landings all point strongly to No. The added consideration that Washington might choose calibrated language even in a limited-islet seizure slightly lowers the conditional probability that, if something happened, it would meet the question’s phrasing requirement. However, I had already incorporated that linguistic hurdle. Tail risks remain (a sudden islet grab by PLA Marines, miscalculation during exercises, or political shock), and if PLA ground troops do land, US officials would likely use “invasion” language—but that still hinges on a very low-probability event. Given the alignment with my initial reasoning and no new indicators, I see no basis for a material update.",
