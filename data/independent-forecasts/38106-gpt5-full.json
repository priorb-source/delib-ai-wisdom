  "information": "A Russian delegation is scheduled to visit Istanbul on June 2, 2025, for a second round of peace talks with Ukraine. Kremlin Spokesman Dmitriy Peskov stated that a high-level summit involving President Trump would depend on the achievement of results from these direct talks between the two delegations. Russia proposed the June 2 date, following a previous meeting on May 16. The United States will not send an official delegation, but White House press secretary Caroline Levitt said, 'We will let you know if the President has plans to send a representative.'\n\nIn February 2025, there was media speculation, particularly from French sources, about a potential visit by Donald Trump to Moscow for the Victory Day celebrations on May 9, 2025. Former Russian Prime Minister Sergey Stepanov commented at the time that such a visit would be a 'big sensation.' On February 12, 2025, Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin held a 1.5-hour phone call during which they agreed to a personal meeting and extended mutual invitations to Washington and Moscow. The speculated May 9 visit did not occur.\n\nIn late May 2025, following a major Russian drone and missile attack in Ukraine, President Donald Trump referred to President Vladimir Putin as 'absolutely crazy.' In a separate statement, Trump also expressed his disappointment with Putin's continued attacks, saying, 'I am very disappointed, very, very disappointed.' Trump indicated he would observe Russia's intentions over a two-week period to determine if they were genuine about achieving peace.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "About 31 days (until July 1, 2025)",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No visit",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "June 2 Istanbul talks produce little or no tangible progress; Russia continues strikes in Ukraine; Trump maintains a critical posture toward Putin and opts for either no meeting or a meeting in Washington/neutral venue later in the summer, resulting in no Russia trip before July 1.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "The June 2 talks unexpectedly yield a concrete ceasefire framework or major breakthrough; both sides rush to capitalize with a rapid high-level summit; Trump decides to travel to Moscow (or another Russian city) in mid-to-late June to personally finalize or showcase the deal.",
    "rationale": "Baseline favors no visit. Presidential trips abroad—especially to Russia—are typically planned and signaled in advance, and the remaining window is roughly a month. The research assistant notes: (1) a second round of Ukraine–Russia talks is set for June 2 in Istanbul; (2) the Kremlin said any high-level summit involving Trump depends on results from those talks; (3) the U.S. is not sending an official delegation; (4) a rumored May 9 Moscow visit did not happen; (5) after late-May Russian attacks, Trump called Putin “absolutely crazy” and said he’d watch for about two weeks to judge sincerity. These points collectively suggest limited momentum for a near-term Trump trip to Russia. Even if talks advance, first meetings are likelier in Washington or a neutral venue given optics, security, and domestic politics. Why not higher? A Russia visit in June would require a rapid diplomatic breakthrough plus tight logistical planning and willingness to bear political risk—none currently visible. Why not lower? Trump is unpredictable, frames himself as a dealmaker, and mutual invitations were exchanged in February; a sudden breakthrough from June 2 talks could trigger an accelerated summit timeline. What would move the forecast up: credible reports of a ceasefire framework or major negotiation progress; concrete planning leaks or official announcements of a Trump–Putin summit in Russia; observable Secret Service/press pool indications of imminent foreign travel. What would move it down: continued or escalated Russian strikes, public hardening of U.S.–Russia rhetoric, congressional pushback, or scheduling commitments that preclude late-June travel.",

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
