    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Approximately 2 months.",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No. The Greenlandic government, led by pro-independence 'gradualists', continues to focus on economic development and building capacity for self-governance without scheduling a referendum.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "The ruling coalition adheres to its gradualist platform, prioritizing economic stability and negotiations over a rushed referendum. The short deadline of July 1, 2025, passes without any official announcement, as the political calendar is occupied with more immediate legislative priorities.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "An unexpected political crisis, such as a major dispute with Copenhagen over resource rights or the annual block grant, galvanizes public opinion. To manage intense nationalist pressure from both the public and opposition parties, the Greenlandic government makes a surprise announcement, scheduling an independence referendum for a future date.",
    "rationale": "My forecast is based on two primary factors: the political stance of the current Greenlandic government and the very short timeframe for the question. The March 2025 election was won by parties described as 'independence gradualists,' indicating their political mandate is to pursue independence methodically over time, not to rush into a referendum. Announcing a referendum date is a momentous political step that typically requires extensive groundwork, coalition consensus, and public preparation, none of which appears to be underway. The deadline of July 1, 2025, allows less than two months for such a process to initiate and conclude with an official announcement, which is highly unlikely given the normal pace of governance.\n\nMy probability is not lower than 5% because politics can be unpredictable. A sudden and severe disagreement with Denmark or a surge in populist pressure could hypothetically force the government's hand into making a declarative announcement as a political tactic, even if they remain gradualists at heart. The underlying desire for independence is a constant feature of Greenlandic politics and can be inflamed quickly.\n\nMy probability is not higher because the core evidence points strongly towards inaction in the short term. A government that just won an election on a gradualist platform would risk its credibility by immediately reversing course and calling for a snap referendum without a significant external catalyst. \n\nI would increase my forecast if there were reports of serious discussions about a referendum within the ruling coalition, or if a major diplomatic incident with Denmark erupted. I would decrease my forecast if Greenlandic leaders explicitly stated that a referendum announcement was not on the agenda for 2025.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nBefore July 1, 2025, will the government of Greenland officially announce a date for an independence referendum?\n\nQuestion background:\nReuters: [Greenland's independence gradualists win election amid Trump control pledge](https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/greenland-election-tests-independence-ambitions-us-interest-looms-2025-03-11/)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if, before July 1, 2025, a referendum on the independence of Greenland from the Denmark is officially scheduled. If this does not occur before that date, this question resolves as **No**.\n\nFor purposes of this question, the referendum will be considered \"officially scheduled\" when it is announced by a person or entity with the authority to do so within Greenland. Please note that broader legality, such as it being overturned by the government of Denmark, will be considered irrelevant for this question.\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nNo additional information available.\n\nToday is 2025-05-02.\n\nBefore answering you think:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n(e) You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
