    "review": "Forecaster 3’s DRC example is a useful new datapoint I hadn’t explicitly weighed: a two‑day license‑to‑availability turnaround shows what “prioritized” looks like, and the 3+ weeks of silence in Lesotho is a mild negative signal. I find that argument credible and additive. Forecaster 2’s case leans heavily on “license granted ⇒ fast flip,” which is true in some recent African launches, but I think 75% underweights the operational steps that usually coincide with an “Available” map status (local checkout/tax, device approvals, logistics). Neither forecaster discussed Lesotho’s unique logistics dependence on transiting South Africa, which may introduce friction even if technically surmountable, and supports caution. Overall, I find F3’s tempered stance more compelling than F2’s higher conviction, though I still see >50% given Starlink’s recent pace and the long runway remaining.",
    "rationale": "Key positives remain: the license (major hurdle) is granted; 55 days remain; Starlink has demonstrated rapid post‑approval activations in the region; laser backhaul reduces local ground dependencies; and Lesotho’s small size simplifies coverage. Key negatives: the lack of visible movement 23 days post‑license contrasts with the DRC’s immediate activation, suggesting either lower prioritization or country‑specific frictions; website “Available” generally aligns with orderability, which requires local billing/tax and possibly device type approvals; and Lesotho’s enclave status means practical imports likely transit South Africa, where Starlink faces regulatory headwinds—potentially a minor but real bottleneck. On balance, I trim my estimate slightly from 60% to reflect the negative information value of the delay and potential logistical/bureaucratic steps that could slip past July 1, while keeping it above even odds due to cleared regulation and ample time left. I would move up on evidence of preorders, a Starlink/LCA launch announcement, or the map shifting to a near‑term “Coming Soon” date. I would move down if mid‑June arrives with no signals, or if credible reports of customs/type‑approval/billing delays emerge.",
