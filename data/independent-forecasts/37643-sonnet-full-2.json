  "information": "An executive order signed on March 7, 2025, aims to limit eligibility for the Public Service Loan Forgiveness (PSLF) program by altering the definition of 'public service'. The order directs the Department of Education and the Treasury Department to propose regulatory changes to make certain public-sector employees ineligible. Additionally, a provision within the House GOP's 2025 tax bill would grant the U.S. Treasury Secretary the authority to revoke the tax-exempt status of non-profits designated as 'terrorist supporting organizations,' which would disqualify their employees from the PSLF program.\n\nThe U.S. Department of Education is establishing a Negotiated Rulemaking Committee, named the Student Loans and Affordability Committee, tasked with developing proposed regulations for federal student aid programs. A key focus of this committee will be to refine the definition of qualifying employers for Public Service Loan Forgiveness eligibility. The deadline for nominations for negotiators was June 1, 2025, and the committee is scheduled to hold its first session from June 30 to July 2, 2025, with proposed and final rules anticipated for release later in 2025.\n\nThe Public Service Loan Forgiveness program is established by federal statute, specifically Section 455(m) of the Higher Education Act (codified at 20 U.S.C. §1087e(m)). Consequently, terminating the program is generally understood to require a new act of Congress. Unilateral executive action to end the program is considered to have uncertain legal standing and would require, at a minimum, a formal notice-of-proposed-rulemaking process, including a public comment period, before any changes could be finalized.",

    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "47 days until July 1, 2025",
    "status_quo_outcome": "The objective remains marked as 'in progress' and the question resolves as No",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "The PSLF program continues to exist in some form, with only eligibility restrictions implemented rather than full termination. The negotiated rulemaking process takes longer than expected, and the spreadsheet maintainers do not mark the objective as complete by July 1, 2025.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Congress passes legislation terminating the PSLF program in the next 47 days, or the executive branch implements such severe restrictions that the spreadsheet maintainers consider the program effectively terminated and mark the objective as complete before July 1, 2025.",
    "rationale": "This forecast faces severe timeline constraints and legal barriers. The PSLF program is established by federal statute (20 U.S.C. §1087e(m)), meaning full termination requires congressional action, not just executive orders. The research assistant reports that the negotiated rulemaking committee's first session is June 30-July 2, 2025 - essentially at the resolution date - with proposed and final rules anticipated 'later in 2025.' This makes completion by July 1 nearly impossible through the regulatory process. Current actions focus on limiting eligibility rather than terminating the program entirely. The March 7, 2025 executive order aims to alter the definition of 'public service' to restrict eligibility, and the House GOP tax bill provision would affect nonprofits' tax-exempt status, but neither constitutes program termination. For the objective to be marked 'complete,' the program would need to be fully terminated, not merely restricted. The status quo strongly favors a No resolution - the objective remains 'in progress' as restrictions are being developed but the program itself continues. My forecast is not lower (1-2%) because there's a small possibility the spreadsheet maintainers might interpret severe eligibility restrictions as achieving the termination objective, or unexpected rapid congressional action could occur. My forecast is not higher (10%+) because the procedural timeline is incompatible with completion by July 1 - the rulemaking process is just beginning, congressional action takes time, and any regulatory changes require notice-and-comment periods. I would update upward if I saw imminent congressional legislation to terminate PSLF or if the spreadsheet maintainers indicated they would mark partial restrictions as 'complete.' I would update downward if the rulemaking committee delays its session or if congressional leadership indicates no legislation is planned.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill the Project 2025 Tracker spreadsheet have the objective of terminating the Public Service Loan Forgiveness program marked as complete before July 1, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nAt the time of this question, the objective was marked as \"in progress.\" The 2025 Tracker is a project of the Keep_Track subreddit and is explained [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/Keep_Track/comments/1ii7tbr/project_2025_tracker_is_now_live/).\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if the Project 2025 objective to \"terminate the Public Service Loan Forgiveness program\" is marked as complete according to [this spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1QGG6wNHna-1tt91yXNkOauAJJ7snobFjfEnmxlmzhl4/edit?gid=0#gid=0) before July 1, 2025.

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any).
