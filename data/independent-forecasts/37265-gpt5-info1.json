  "information": "As of May 2, 2025, Tanzania holds a Level 2: Exercise Increased Caution travel advisory from the US State Department, last updated on September 9, 2024. The advisory cites crime, terrorism, and the targeting of LGBTQI+ persons as primary concerns. While the country is at Level 2 overall, specific regions such as Mtwara have a higher, Level 3 warning. In March 2025, the US Embassy issued an alert regarding coastal security.",

    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "About 60 days (until July 1, 2025)",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Tanzania remains at Level 2: Exercise Increased Caution, with localized Level 3 guidance for specific areas (e.g., Mtwara). No major nationwide incident or intelligence-driven threat emerges, and the State Department does not issue an interim countrywide level change before July 1, 2025.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "A significant deterioration in security prompts the State Department to elevate Tanzania to Level 3. Triggers could include a notable terrorist incident or credible threat stream linked to Cabo Delgado spillover into southern Tanzania; a high-profile attack or kidnappings targeting foreigners in Dar es Salaam or Zanzibar; a sharp uptick in violent crime against tourists; or state actions causing widespread unrest or targeted persecution that materially increases risks to U.S. travelers.",
    "rationale": "Current baseline: As of May 2, 2025, Tanzania is at Level 2 (last updated Sept 9, 2024). The advisory cites crime, terrorism, and risks to LGBTQI+ persons; Mtwara carries a higher, localized Level 3. The U.S. Embassy issued a coastal security alert in March 2025, but no nationwide level change followed. This supports a status quo baseline of no change absent a major trigger.\n\nWhy the probability is not higher: State Department level changes are relatively infrequent absent clear precipitating events. Tanzania has been stably Level 2 for years despite sporadic security concerns and proximity to Mozambique’s Cabo Delgado insurgency. Elevating the entire country typically requires either a significant attack, a sustained series of serious incidents, or strong intelligence indicating elevated nationwide risk. With only ~60 days left, the window for both an incident and a subsequent bureaucratic update is limited.\n\nWhy the probability is not lower: There are non-trivial risk factors. The presence of an existing Level 3 advisory for Mtwara shows recognized elevated risk in the south. The March 2025 embassy alert on coastal security indicates some deterioration or concern along the coast. A cross-border or maritime incident, a high-profile attack in a tourist hub (Dar es Salaam, Arusha, Zanzibar), or a targeted incident against Westerners could prompt a rapid reassessment and upgrade to Level 3. Pre-election tensions (with national polls expected later in 2025) could also produce localized unrest, though June timing is somewhat early.\n\nUpdate triggers to move higher: Credible reporting of terrorist plotting or actual attacks in Tanzania (especially outside the far south), kidnappings or violent incidents involving foreigners in major tourist areas, major civil unrest or crackdowns escalating traveler risk, or an official U.S. Embassy security alert that explicitly warns of heightened, imminent threats countrywide. Any State Department interim update to the Tanzania page with strengthened language would also raise odds.\n\nUpdate triggers to move lower: Continued stability through May–June; additional embassy communications that are routine or localized; or a State Department update that refreshes content without changing the overall level.\n\nSummary of research assistant input affecting the forecast: As of May 2, 2025, Tanzania remains Level 2 (last updated Sept 9, 2024), with localized Level 3 in Mtwara, and a March 2025 coastal alert. These facts anchor a low base rate of a near-term upgrade while acknowledging some elevated but localized risk.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill Tanzania receive a \"Level 3 – Reconsider Travel\" travel advisory from the US State Department before July 1, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nTravel and Tour World: [Travel Advisory for Tanzania: How Increased Crime and Terrorism Threats Impact Tourists in Popular African Destinations](https://www.travelandtourworld.com/news/article/travel-advisory-for-tanzania-how-increased-crime-and-terrorism-threats-impact-tourists-in-popular-african-destinations/)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if the country of Tanzania has received a Level 3 [travel advisory](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/International-Travel-Country-Information-Pages/Tanzania.html) from the US Department of State before July 1, 2025.\n\n\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nAs of May 2, 2025, Tanzania holds a Level 2: Exercise Increased Caution travel advisory from the US State Department, last updated on September 9, 2024. The advisory cites crime, terrorism, and the targeting of LGBTQI+ persons as primary concerns. While the country is at Level 2 overall, specific regions such as Mtwara have a higher, Level 3 warning.

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
