  "information": "Dan Osborn, an independent from Nebraska, is exploring a potential run for the U.S. Senate in 2026 against incumbent Republican Pete Ricketts. In early April 2025, Osborn formed an exploratory committee. He previously ran for the Senate in 2024 against Deb Fischer, losing by approximately six percentage points in a race that attracted $14 million in fundraising. Osborn has also launched a political action committee, the Working Class Heroes Fund, aimed at training and supporting working-class candidates for office. In public statements regarding a potential 2026 run, Osborn has framed the race as a choice to \"replace a billionaire with a mechanic.\"\n\nThe incumbent Senator, Pete Ricketts, is expected to seek re-election in 2026. Former President Donald Trump endorsed Ricketts for his reelection bid on April 11, 2025, calling Osborn a \"Radical Left Open Border Extremist\" while praising Ricketts. Ricketts is the seventh richest member of Congress and has a significant political and financial operation in Nebraska. Osborn runs as an independent but received support from the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee during his 2024 campaign.\n\nHistorical data shows that Senate exploratory committees often last three to six months before a formal campaign launch. Many candidates for the 2026 cycle in other states, such as Andy Barr in Kentucky and Haley Stevens in Michigan, announced their candidacies in April 2025. In his previous 2024 Senate run, Osborn formally announced his candidacy in July 2023, approximately 16 months before the election. A similar timeline for the 2026 race would place his announcement in June or July of 2025. Osborn himself has publicly stated that he will \"decide by early summer.\"",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Approximately 39 days (from April 23, 2025 to June 1, 2025)",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No announcement has been made. Osborn formed an exploratory committee in early April 2025 but has not formally declared his candidacy.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Osborn follows through on his stated timeline of deciding 'by early summer' which commonly means June or July, making his announcement after June 1st. Alternatively, he could delay his decision further or decide not to run at all.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Osborn accelerates his timeline and announces in late April or May, possibly in response to Trump's endorsement of Ricketts on April 11th, or because he interprets 'early summer' to include late May. He might rush to announce to match the timing of other 2026 Senate candidates who announced in April.",
    "rationale": "The weight of evidence suggests a No outcome. Key factors: (1) Osborn explicitly stated he will 'decide by early summer' - this phrase typically refers to June/July, not late May; (2) His previous 2024 Senate campaign was announced in July 2023, suggesting he prefers mid-summer announcements; (3) He formed his exploratory committee only in early April 2025, meaning a pre-June 1 announcement would be less than 2 months later, which is on the shorter end of typical 3-6 month exploratory periods; (4) A timeline similar to his 2024 race would place the 2026 announcement in June or July 2025, after the June 1 deadline. Factors that could push toward Yes: (1) Some 2026 Senate candidates announced in April 2025, showing earlier announcements are possible; (2) Trump's April 11 endorsement of Ricketts might motivate Osborn to announce sooner; (3) Late May could arguably be considered 'early summer' by meteorological definitions (June 1 start). However, the status quo strongly favors no announcement yet, and Osborn's stated timeline points to June/July. I'm not higher because there's still a plausible scenario where external pressures or strategic considerations lead to a late May announcement. I'm not lower because 'early summer' does have some definitional ambiguity and 39 days is enough time for circumstances to shift his timeline forward. I would update higher if Osborn begins hinting at an imminent announcement or scheduling major campaign events in May. I would update lower if he reiterates a June/July timeframe or goes quiet on the Senate race.",
