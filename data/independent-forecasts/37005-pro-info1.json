  "information": "According to the 338Canada statistical model, the Liberal Party is projected to win between 188 and 196 seats. National polling data indicates Liberal support is at 40-45%, compared to 37-38% for the Conservative Party. Polls also show strong performance for the Liberals in Ontario and Quebec, which together account for 199 of the 338 seats in Parliament.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Approximately 6 months. The fixed election date is October 20, 2025.",
    "status_quo_outcome": "Yes. Current statistical models and polling data project the Liberal Party will win well over 172 seats.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "The Conservative party's campaign gains significant momentum in the final months, capitalizing on a major Liberal scandal or a perceived economic downturn. This erodes Liberal support in key battleground ridings in Ontario, causing them to fall just short of the 172-seat majority threshold.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Liberal polling numbers remain stable, and their strength in Ontario and Quebec holds through the campaign. The election results align closely with current projections, delivering a comfortable majority government for the Liberal Party with over 180 seats.",
    "rationale": "This forecast is based primarily on the provided data from the 338Canada statistical model and current national polling. The 338Canada projection of 188-196 seats is significantly above the 172-seat threshold, indicating a high probability of a 'Yes' outcome if the election were held today. This data, which incorporates polling, historical trends, and demographics, represents the strongest available evidence. The status quo, which I weight heavily, clearly points to a Liberal majority.\n\nMy probability is not higher because an election is still approximately six months away, which is a substantial amount of time in politics for public opinion to shift. Unforeseen events, major policy blunders, campaign gaffes, or a significant change in economic conditions could erode the current Liberal advantage. Polling models also have innate margins of error and cannot perfectly predict voter turnout.\n\nMy probability is not lower because the current lead is substantial. For the Liberals to fall below 172 seats from a projection in the low 190s would require a major, sustained shift in voter intention, not just minor statistical noise. The party's reported strength in the seat-rich provinces of Ontario and Quebec provides a solid foundation that makes a collapse below the majority threshold a less likely scenario.\n\nI would update this forecast upwards if the Liberals' polling lead widens consistently into the high single digits. I would update downwards if the Conservatives close the polling gap to within 1-2 points nationally, or if a major scandal emerges that directly implicates the Liberal leadership.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill the Liberal Party win 172 or more seats in the 2025 Canadian federal election?\n\nQuestion background:\n[338Canada Federal Projection](https://338canada.com/federal.htm): \"The 338Canada project is a statistical model of electoral projections based on opinion polls, electoral history, and demographic data. This web site is a creation of Philippe J. Fournier, physics and astrophysics professor at Cégep de Saint-Laurent in Montreal.\"\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if the Liberal Party of Canada wins greater than or equal to 172 seats in the [2025 Canadian federal election](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2025_Canadian_federal_election).\n\n\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nAccording to the 338Canada statistical model, the Liberal Party is projected to win between 188 and 196 seats. National polling data indicates Liberal support is at 40-45%, compared to 37-38% for the Conservative Party. Polls also show strong performance for the Liberals in Ontario and Quebec, which together account for 199 of the 338 seats in Parliament.\n\nToday is 2025-04-21.\n\nBefore answering you think:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n(e) You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
