  "information": "The 13-year gas transmission agreement between Bulgaria’s state-owned gas company Bulgargaz and Turkey’s BOTAŞ was signed in January 2023. The contract includes a 'take or pay' clause, obligating Bulgargaz to pay approximately $580,000 per day regardless of whether it uses the reserved capacity. Since July 2024, Bulgargaz has ceased payments, accumulating a debt reported to be around 4 billion leva (approximately €2 billion). Bulgarian officials have stated the company does not have the financial capacity to pay this debt, and Bulgargaz reportedly expects to incur a loss of 280 million leva in 2024.\n\nBulgarian Prime Minister Boyko Borissov has publicly stated to Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan that 'Bulgaria Needs Out of the Botas Gas Deal.' Former Bulgarian Deputy Energy Minister Zhecho Stankov stated that termination of the contract is blocked until the outstanding debt is fully settled. Despite the public statements, talks between the two countries as of May 2, 2025, focused on price and capacity renegotiation rather than outright cancellation. Turkey has publicly maintained a stance of viewing Bulgaria as a strategic partner and has opposed cancellation.\n\nIn early June 2025, Russian energy company Gazprom abandoned its plan to build a major gas distribution hub in Turkey. Reports cited insufficient pipeline capacity from Turkey to Greece and Bulgaria as a key reason for the project's lack of feasibility. Separately, Bulgaria has pursued other energy initiatives, signing gas exploration and drilling agreements with Shell and NewMed for blocks in the Black Sea. Bulgaria also has reserved 1 billion cubic meters of gas per year from the Alexandroupolis LNG terminal in Greece.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Less than 25 days until July 1, 2025",
    "status_quo_outcome": "The agreement continues without formal cancellation despite ongoing non-payment and negotiations between the parties",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Negotiations continue focusing on price and capacity renegotiation rather than cancellation. Despite the massive debt and public pressure, neither party makes a formal announcement of cancellation before July 1, 2025. The stalemate continues with Bulgaria unable to pay the debt and Turkey unwilling to release Bulgaria from the contract without full payment.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Bulgaria or Turkey makes a unilateral announcement of contract termination before July 1, 2025, possibly driven by political pressure, Bulgargaz's near-bankruptcy situation, or a breakthrough in negotiations. Either party declares the agreement cancelled despite the outstanding debt issue, even if the other side disputes it.",
    "rationale": "The status quo strongly favors the agreement continuing despite significant stress. Key evidence: (1) As recently as May 2, 2025 - just one month ago - talks focused on renegotiation rather than cancellation, indicating no imminent termination. (2) The agreement has already survived 11 months of non-payment (July 2024 to June 2025) without cancellation. (3) A former Deputy Energy Minister explicitly stated termination is blocked until debt is paid - a €2 billion barrier Bulgaria cannot overcome. (4) Turkey publicly opposes cancellation and views Bulgaria as a strategic partner. The timeframe of less than 25 days is extremely short for such a major diplomatic and financial shift. While PM Borissov's public statements and Bulgargaz's financial distress create pressure, the established pattern shows this pressure has not led to cancellation over nearly a year. The resolution criteria allows for unilateral announcement, which increases the probability somewhat, but the debt settlement blockage and Turkey's opposition create significant barriers. For my forecast to move higher, I would need evidence of: imminent government decision, Turkey signaling willingness to cancel, or formal termination proceedings initiated. For it to move lower, I would need evidence of successful renegotiation progress or explicit statements ruling out near-term cancellation. The short 24-day window and recent focus on renegotiation rather than cancellation strongly support the status quo continuing.",

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
