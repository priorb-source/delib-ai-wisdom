    "review": "Both forecasters make compelling arguments that have identified weaknesses in my analysis. Forecaster 3's point that the Rwanda example may not actually be a pilot report is crucial - I assumed it was without verification, which undermines my base rate estimate. The posting delay concern is also well-taken; reports submitted in June might not appear by July 1, adding another constraint I hadn't considered. Both forecasters emphasize the conjunction of multiple low-probability events (pilot + Africa + NUFORC specifically + narrow timeframe + timely posting), which is more restrictive than I initially weighted. Their estimate of 'at most a few times per year' for such reports suggests my 1-2 annual assumption may have been optimistic. However, I find 7% potentially too pessimistic. Africa's aviation sector is substantial across 54 countries, and only ONE report anywhere on the continent during the 30-day window is needed. Commercial flights cross African airspace daily, increasing exposure to potential anomalous sightings. The alternative reporting channels argument (Forecaster 3) is valid but doesn't eliminate NUFORC as an option, and international pilots flying African routes may still use it. The key insight is that while each individual criterion reduces probability significantly, the geographic scale and aviation activity provide some counterweight.",
    "rationale": "After reviewing the other forecasters' analyses, I need to significantly revise my estimate downward. My initial 18% was based on an insufficiently validated assumption about base rates. The Rwanda example doesn't confirm pilot reports from Africa reach NUFORC regularly - it may not even be a pilot report. The convergence of pilot + Africa + June window + posted by July 1 + NUFORC specifically is indeed highly restrictive. The posting delay factor is a meaningful additional constraint I missed. However, I don't fully converge to 7% because: (1) Africa's aviation sector spans 54 countries with significant commercial traffic, (2) only one report is needed across this large area, (3) modern satellite phenomena and increased UAP awareness may slightly elevate reporting, and (4) the geographic scale provides more opportunities than the other forecasters seem to weight. My updated forecast splits the difference, acknowledging the other forecasters' stronger reasoning on base rates and constraints while maintaining that 7% undervalues the geographic scope and aviation activity levels.",
