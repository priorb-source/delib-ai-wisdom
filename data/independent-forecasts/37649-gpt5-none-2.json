  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "46 days (~1 month, 16 days)",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No — the map does not currently show Chad as Available and would likely remain Coming Soon or unavailable absent a change.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Despite having a license (Nov 2024), Starlink keeps Chad as Coming Soon through June due to import/logistics, local distribution setup, or regulatory/tax clearance delays, flipping availability only after July 1.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Starlink executes a batch African rollout and opens orders for at least part of Chad (e.g., N’Djamena area), updates the map to Available, and begins shipping or taking deposits before July 1.",
    "rationale": "- Baseline and timing: Starlink reportedly secured a license in Chad in Nov 2024. Historically, after licensing, African launches have often occurred within roughly 3–12 months, with many cases around 4–8 months. We are now ~6 months post-license, which is within the common window for an availability flip but not guaranteed.\n- Time left: 46 days is enough for Starlink to execute a map update if operational prerequisites are in place (regulatory compliance, distribution, shipping lanes, taxes/fees). Starlink sometimes updates multiple countries at once, so a late-Q2 batch is plausible.\n- Headwinds specific to Chad: Smaller addressable market, challenging logistics, and potential import/tax or reseller arrangements could slow official availability and hardware distribution. Starlink may prioritize larger or easier markets first, even when licenses exist.\n- Tailwinds: Laser backhaul reduces dependency on local gateways; a license signals regulatory acceptance; Starlink has been rapidly expanding African availability since 2023 and may continue cadence through mid-2025.\n- Status quo weighting: As of today there’s no confirming evidence that Chad is live; the world usually changes slowly, so I lean slightly toward No unless we see a concrete trigger (official announcement, distributor readiness, map ETA showing Q2 2025, or credible reports of terminals shipping/activating in Chad).\n- Why not higher: Market/logistics/prioritization risks in a small, landlocked Sahel country; many countries linger in Coming Soon for months after licensing. If there are customs or tax hurdles, flips often slip past quarter-end.\n- Why not lower: License is already secured; 6–7.5 months post-license is a common rollout window; Starlink has been accelerating African coverage and can list partial availability (only need “anywhere in Chad” to read Available).\n- What would move me up: Starlink site showing ETA of Q2 2025 for Chad; local partner/distributor announcements; government or Elon/Starlink comms indicating imminent service; credible reports of successful activations in Chad.\n- What would move me down: Signals of regulatory or customs holdups, import restrictions on user terminals, or Starlink roadmap updates pushing Chad to late 2025 or unspecified timing.\n- Research assistant input: No additional information was available; thus, I’m relying on historical rollout patterns and general constraints/opportunities for Starlink in Africa.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill Starlink's website show Chad as a country with Starlink availability before July 1, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\n[SpaceX’s Starlink Secures License to Operate in Chad](https://spaceinafrica.com/2024/11/12/spacexs-starlink-secures-license-to-operate-in-chad/)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if, before July 1, 2025, the [Starlink Availability Map](https://www.starlink.com/us/map) has anywhere in Chad listed as \"Available.\"\n\n\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nNo additional information available.\n\nToday is 2025-05-15.\n\nBefore answering you think:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n(e) You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
