    "review": "Forecaster 2 adds concrete, new-to-me evidence: daily MLB listings since April 17 and sports as a major volume driver. If accurate, that implies a mature, likely automated posting pipeline and strong business incentives to maintain daily coverage in June. That meaningfully raises my confidence versus my initial base. Forecaster 3’s emphasis on legal risk (Nevada case, potential for a brief nationwide pause) is a valid downside scenario, and they correctly stress the fragility of the “every day” requirement. However, I find their weighting a bit high because (a) any Nevada order would likely be state-specific and addressable via geofencing, which Kalshi already uses, and (b) implementing compliance tweaks need not require a full-day halt. Both forecasters properly flag operational outage/listing-lapse risk. Net: Forecaster 2’s operational track record and strategic-focus arguments are more persuasive than Forecaster 3’s nationwide-pause concern, though I still assign nontrivial probability to a one-day interruption from legal or operational causes.",
    "rationale": "I’m updating up from 70% primarily on the claimed two-month track record of daily MLB listings and evidence that sports are now a core focus for Kalshi. That suggests automation, monitoring, and intent to maintain continuity, which directly addresses my main prior uncertainty (manual processes causing a miss). MLB’s June schedule should supply at least one game every day. The main residual risks:\n- Regulatory/legal: A Nevada ruling could force adjustments. I think a nationwide pause is less likely than a Nevada-only geofence or quick operational tweak, but a 1-day pause remains plausible. Assign ~6–8%.\n- Operational/technical: A deployment snafu, vendor outage, or missed listing window across a full 24-hour period is possible but not common for a platform with recent daily success. Assign ~6–8%.\n- Edge cases (true no-MLB day, mass postponements): Very low in June. Assign ~1–2%.\nAggregating these, I get roughly a 14–18% chance of at least one miss, implying an 82–86% chance of success. Given remaining uncertainty about the legal timeline and the all-days constraint, I’ll set 82% now. I would move higher with a clean first week of June and any indication from Kalshi of explicit daily MLB continuity and/or evidence of automated postings and robust uptime plans.",
