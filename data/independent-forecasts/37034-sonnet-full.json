  "information": "According to Baker Hughes data from mid-April 2025, the total number of active drilling rigs in the U.S. rose by 2 to 585. This followed a 7-rig dip in the prior week. The count of oil rigs rose by 1 to 481, and gas rigs also increased by 1 to 98. The total rig count is down by 34 compared to the same period in the previous year. Drilling activity in the Permian basin was steady at 289 rigs, which is 29 fewer than the previous year. The Frac Spread Count, which estimates the number of crews completing wells, fell by 10 to 195.\n\nAs of late April 2025, West Texas Intermediate (WTI) oil prices were around $64-$65 per barrel, after the American Petroleum Institute reported a decrease of 4.565 million barrels in U.S. crude oil inventories for the week ending April 18. This price is near the breakeven point for many drilling operations, which is estimated to be around $65 per barrel. A Dallas Fed survey of 130 energy firms in Texas, New Mexico, and Louisiana indicated that firms are dealing with increased costs, reduced rig counts, and layoffs. The survey's company outlook index decreased by 12 points, while the outlook uncertainty index increased by 21 points, with executives citing tariffs on steel (25%) as increasing costs for casing and tubing.\n\nSeveral major energy and service companies reported on their performance in Q1 2025. Halliburton reported declining profits in North America due to decreased drilling activity. Baker Hughes' oilfield services division saw a 10% sequential drop in revenue. In contrast, Occidental Petroleum announced a capital expenditures plan of $7 billion to $7.2 billion for 2025, with $3.7 billion allocated to the Permian Basin. The company plans to operate 24 gross drilling rigs and bring 500 to 550 new wells online in the Permian during the year.",

    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Approximately 5 weeks, from April 23, 2025 to May 30, 2025",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No - the current count of 585 active US drilling rigs is above the threshold of 583",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Rig count remains at or above 583. This could occur if oil prices stabilize or rise above current levels, giving operators confidence to maintain current drilling levels despite cost pressures. The recent +2 rig increase could signal a bottoming out of the decline.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Rig count drops by 3 or more rigs to below 583. Given weak industry sentiment, breakeven oil prices around $64-65/barrel, increased costs from tariffs, and companies reporting declining profits and layoffs, operators continue to reduce drilling activity. The year-over-year decline of 34 rigs suggests continued downward momentum.",
    "rationale": "The current rig count of 585 is precariously close to the threshold of 583 - only 2 rigs above. This narrow margin is critical to the forecast. Several factors suggest downward pressure: (1) Oil prices at $64-65/barrel are near the breakeven point for many operations, providing little incentive to expand drilling; (2) Industry sentiment is decidedly negative, with the Dallas Fed survey showing decreased company outlook and increased uncertainty, plus reports of layoffs and reduced rig counts; (3) Major service companies like Halliburton and Baker Hughes report declining North American activity and profits; (4) The year-over-year decline of 34 rigs indicates a sustained downward trend; (5) Increased costs from steel tariffs (25%) are squeezing margins. However, tempering factors include: (1) Recent volatility (down 7, then up 2) suggests the count may be stabilizing around current levels; (2) Rig counts are relatively sticky and don't typically change dramatically over 5 weeks; (3) Some operators like Occidental are maintaining substantial capital expenditure plans; (4) The status quo bias suggests the world changes slowly. A drop of just 3 rigs would trigger a Yes outcome, which seems plausible but not certain given the mixed signals. The forecast would increase if oil prices dropped further below $64 or if weekly reports showed continued declines. It would decrease if oil prices rose significantly or if industry sentiment improved.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill the number of active US drilling rigs be less than 583 for the week ending May 30, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nSeekingAlpha: [U.S. rig count falls for third straight week, Baker Hughes says](https://seekingalpha.com/news/4430543-u-s-rig-count-falls-for-third-straight-week-baker-hughes-says)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if the last count of active US drilling rigs for the week ending May 30, 2025, according to the [Baker Hughes North America Rig Count](https://rigcount.bakerhughes.com/na-rig-count), is less than 583. Specifically, it will resolve based on the number listed as the United States Total for the most recent week in the May 30, 2025 North America Rig Count Report. This is the number of active drilling rigs and includes the total of those classified as gas, oil and miscellaneous, in every US location including inland waters, land and offshore.\n\nIf no report dated May 30, 2025, is released before June 1, 2025, Eastern Time, Metaculus may resolve this question using the most recent report available dated between May 23, 2025, and June 1, 2025, inclusive. If no such report exists, this question will be annulled.\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nAccording to Baker Hughes data from mid-April 2025, the total number of active drilling rigs in the U.S. rose by 2 to 585.

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
