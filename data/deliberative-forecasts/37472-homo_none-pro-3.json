    "review": "The other forecasters and I are in strong agreement on the fundamental drivers of this question: Sheikh Hasina faces dire personal and legal risks if she returns, the current interim government in Bangladesh has strong incentives to prosecute her, and the very short timeframe (less than two months) makes any significant change to this status quo highly unlikely. We all correctly identified her public vows to return as political rhetoric rather than a concrete plan. The main point of divergence is the exact probability assigned to a low-probability, high-impact event that could lead to her return. Forecaster 3's analysis was particularly convincing in raising a point I had not sufficiently weighted: India's own strategic interest in maintaining stability in Bangladesh. This makes it less likely that India would either facilitate a voluntary return or expedite an extradition process that could destabilize its neighbor. This argument compellingly reduces the likelihood of one of the main paths to a 'Yes' resolution.",
    "rationale": "My initial forecast of 15% was anchored in the strong status quo but reserved what I now believe was too high a probability for a 'black swan' event, such as a high-risk voluntary return or a rapid extradition. After reviewing the other forecasts, I am updating my position. Forecaster 3's argument regarding India's vested interest in regional stability is a crucial factor that diminishes the odds of a swift resolution. India is unlikely to act in a way that could trigger instability in Bangladesh, which a sudden return of Sheikh Hasina almost certainly would. This significantly lowers the probability of an extradition being completed before July 1. Furthermore, while Sheikh Hasina is a bold political actor, a voluntary return under the current circumstances seems less like a calculated risk and more like a politically irrational act, given the near-certainty of arrest and prosecution. The overwhelming incentives for all parties—Hasina, the Bangladeshi interim government, and the Indian government—are to maintain the current situation for the foreseeable future. I am therefore lowering my forecast to reflect a stronger conviction in the status quo holding through this short resolution period. I am reducing my forecast from 15% to 8%, which still accounts for a small chance of an unpredictable political event but better reflects the immense barriers to her return.",
