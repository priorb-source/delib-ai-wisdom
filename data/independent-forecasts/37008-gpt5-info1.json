  "information": "A state of emergency was declared in Samoa on March 31, 2025, due to a severe energy crisis. The declaration was scheduled to be in effect for 30 days, from April 1, 2025, through April 29, 2025.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "9 days",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No — the declared state of emergency is scheduled to lapse on April 29, 2025, and would not cover April 30 unless extended or re-declared.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Power supply stabilizes sufficiently and/or the government opts to manage under ordinary law, allowing the energy-crisis SOE to expire on April 29 with no new or extended emergency in place on April 30.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "The government extends the current energy-crisis SOE near April 29 (e.g., for another 30 days) or issues a new SOE—whether for energy or another hazard—that remains in force on April 30.",
    "rationale": "The research assistant reports Samoa declared an SOE on March 31, 2025, set to run April 1–29 for a severe energy crisis, meaning the default is that no SOE is in force on April 30. Good forecasting practice gives extra weight to the status quo, so the baseline is No absent new action. However, several factors push the probability upward: (1) The crisis motivating the SOE—widespread power cuts—typically involves procurement, contractual, and operational fixes that are unlikely to fully normalize within nine days; (2) Samoa has a recent track record of rolling monthly SOE extensions during prolonged disruptions (e.g., COVID), suggesting institutional comfort with extensions when conditions persist; (3) If authorities still need emergency powers for rationing/mandates, they are more likely to extend than to abruptly revert to ordinary law. Why not higher? Because the current order explicitly ends April 29, and it’s plausible that supply arrangements or interim deals restore sufficient stability for government to let the SOE lapse, or that they judge ordinary legal tools adequate. Political or legal pushback could also discourage an extension. Why not lower? Because the short time window and the severity of the crisis make full resolution by April 29 uncertain, and the easiest administrative path is a short extension that would cover April 30. What would change my view upward: credible reports that the government plans to extend; continued rolling blackouts; statements from EPC/ministers that emergency powers remain necessary. Downward: credible reports that power supply has stabilized, IPP/fuel issues are resolved, government signals intent not to extend, or a formal cancellation plan is announced.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill a state of emergency be in effect in Samoa on April 30, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\n[Samoan Prime Minister declares state of emergency over power cuts](https://www.stuff.co.nz/nz-news/360634988/samoan-prime-minister-declares-state-emergency-over-power-cuts)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if, according to [credible sources](https://www.metaculus.com/faq/#definitions) Samoa is in a state of emergency that has been declared by a governmental entity with the authority to make such a declaration.\n\nFor example, the state of emergency declaration [posted](https://www.facebook.com/samoagovt/posts/hon-prime-minister-of-samoa-press-statement-proclamation-of-emergency-energy-cri/1059050259591457/) by the government of Samoa on Facebook on March 31, 2025 would count. (Note that when it was declared, it was scheduled to be in effect through April 29, 2025.)\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nA state of emergency was declared in Samoa on March 31, 2025, due to a severe energy crisis. The declaration was scheduled to be in effect for 30 days, from April 1, 2025, through April 29, 2025.\n\nToday is 2025-04-21.\n\nBefore answering you think:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n(e) You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
