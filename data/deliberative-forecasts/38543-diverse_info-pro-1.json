    "review": "The other two forecasters provided crucial new information that I had not considered, significantly altering my assessment. Forecaster 3's analysis was particularly impactful, highlighting the packed and conflicting schedules of both President Trump (G7 and NATO summits) and President Xi (trip to Kazakhstan). This information severely constricts the already tight timeline from ~15 days to only a few scattered, logistically nightmarish windows. Forecaster 2's argument that alternative meeting options exist (e.g., Washington, virtual call, neutral ground) to resolve the tariff issue was also highly convincing; it provides a strong reason why a visit *to China specifically* is not a necessity, even if a leader-level meeting is urgent. Both forecasters correctly emphasized the complete lack of any public signals or evidence of advance preparations, which would be expected for such a major diplomatic event. Their reasoning is sound and grounded in logistical and political realities that I had previously underestimated.",
    "rationale": "I am substantially revising my forecast downward from 20% to 3%. My initial forecast overweighted the declared political will of the two leaders and President Trump's unconventional style, while severely underestimating the hard, practical constraints. The new information from the other forecasters, especially the conflicting schedules of both leaders for much of the remaining time, makes a visit to China logistically improbable. The G7 (June 16-18) and NATO (June 24-25) summits, combined with Xi's travel, reduce the feasible window to practically zero. Furthermore, as Forecaster 2 argued, even if a pre-July 1 meeting is necessary due to tariff deadlines, it is more likely to occur virtually or in a third country than via a hastily arranged state visit to Beijing. The lack of any preparatory signals, leaks, or advance team sightings reinforces this conclusion. My updated 3% forecast reflects that while a visit is now extremely unlikely due to these constraints, it is not completely impossible. It accounts for a slim chance of a highly unorthodox, stripped-down meeting driven by an unforeseen, urgent crisis or a dramatic political calculation.",
