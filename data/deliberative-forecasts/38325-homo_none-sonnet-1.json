    "review": "The other forecasters raise several important points that warrant careful consideration. Forecaster 2 correctly emphasizes that absent specific evidence of systematic underestimation in the advance estimate, we should be cautious about predicting upward revisions. Forecaster 3's emphasis on status quo bias is particularly well-taken - the advance estimate represents the BEA's best professional judgment with available data, and we should weight it heavily unless we have compelling reasons not to. Upon reflection, I may have over-weighted the 'lower than expected' phrase from the article. Market expectations being higher than the actual reading doesn't necessarily indicate the BEA estimate was biased low - it could simply mean markets were too optimistic. This isn't strong evidence for predicting upward revision. However, I find Forecaster 3's argument about revisions not changing direction when estimates are 'clear' less applicable here. A reading of -0.3% is not clear - it's within the noise level of measurement uncertainty. All three of us acknowledge that typical revision magnitudes (0.5-1.5 pp) easily encompass the 0.3-0.4 pp needed to flip the sign. The clustering of our forecasts at 35-45% suggests we're identifying similar base rates and uncertainties, which is reassuring. The main disagreement is how much weight to place on status quo bias versus measurement uncertainty given the extremely narrow margin.",
    "rationale": "After deliberation, I'm adjusting my forecast slightly downward to incorporate the stronger status quo bias arguments. The other forecasters are right that without specific evidence of data collection issues or known biases in the advance estimate, I should weight the initial -0.3% reading more heavily. My previous emphasis on the estimate being 'lower than expected' was likely overweighted. However, I'm not moving to 35% because I maintain that -0.3% represents an ambiguous reading that genuinely falls within normal measurement uncertainty. The required revision of only ~0.3 percentage points to reach positive territory is well within the historical range of typical revisions between advance and third estimates. The extreme proximity to zero creates legitimate uncertainty that justifies a probability closer to 40% than 35%. My updated forecast balances: (1) stronger weight on status quo bias, (2) recognition that the advance estimate is the BEA's professional judgment, (3) acknowledgment that the margin is so thin that normal data refinement processes could easily change the sign, and (4) historical evidence that revisions of this magnitude occur regularly without systematic directional bias.",
