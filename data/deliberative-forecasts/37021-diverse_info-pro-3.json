    "review": "Forecaster 2's analysis was highly influential due to its use of specific, high-frequency data which I had not incorporated. The March inflation print of 14.6% YoY is a critical anchor point, and their breakdown of the simple math required to reach 15.0% was very compelling. This quantitative approach, focusing on the strong recent momentum, makes the 'Yes' outcome seem much more likely than my initial qualitative assessment suggested. Forecaster 3's analysis provided a useful counterpoint by focusing on the National Bank of Ukraine's (NBU) official forecast and active policy stance. However, I found this argument less convincing. The 14.6% March inflation figure already suggests the NBU's forecast is outdated. Furthermore, the point that the NBU expects a peak in Q2 2025, when combined with the 14.6% March reading, actually strengthens the argument that April could be the peak and thus be at or above 15.0%, rather than weakening it.",
    "rationale": "I am updating my forecast upward from 60% to 70%. My initial analysis correctly identified the primary drivers of inflation—severe cost-push shocks from energy infrastructure attacks and other war-related disruptions. However, it lacked the specific quantitative evidence supplied by Forecaster 2. The fact that March 2025 inflation already reached 14.6% is the single most important new piece of information. This high starting point means that only a minor increase is needed to cross the 15.0% threshold. Given the strong monthly inflation in March (1.5%) and the persistence of the underlying supply-side pressures (energy, food costs), it is highly probable that the year-over-year figure will continue to climb in April. While Forecaster 3's points about the NBU's tight monetary policy and official forecasts are valid considerations that prevent me from going higher, the recent data momentum is too strong to ignore. The evidence now suggests that the pre-existing disinflationary forces are insufficient to counteract the acute shocks and halt the accelerating trend in time for the April reading.",
