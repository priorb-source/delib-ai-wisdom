  "information": "The authority to revoke a 501(c)(3) tax-exempt status rests with the Internal Revenue Service (IRS), not the President. According to legal precedent, revocation typically requires evidence that an organization is violating public policy or engaging in illegal activities. The key Supreme Court case, Bob Jones University v. United States (1983), affirmed that tax-exempt status could be revoked for organizations violating clear public policy, such as racial discrimination. The legal and administrative process in the Bob Jones case took over seven years to resolve. Historically, no major university has had its tax-exempt status revoked in recent decades.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Approximately 67 days (from April 25, 2025 to July 1, 2025)",
    "status_quo_outcome": "Harvard University maintains its 501(c)(3) tax-exempt status, which it has held continuously for decades without interruption",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Harvard retains its tax-exempt status through July 1, 2025. The IRS follows standard procedures that require extensive due process, investigation, and legal justification. Given that historical precedent shows such processes take years (Bob Jones University case took 7+ years), and that no major university has lost tax-exempt status in recent decades, the normal administrative and legal timeline prevents any action within the 67-day window. Trump's threats do not translate into completed IRS action within this timeframe.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Harvard loses its 501(c)(3) status before July 1, 2025. This would require the IRS to take unprecedented rapid action, somehow compressing what is normally a multi-year legal and administrative process into just over two months. This would necessitate finding extraordinary grounds for immediate revocation, bypassing standard due process protections, and overcoming Harvard's certain legal challenges—all within an impossibly short timeframe.",
    "rationale": "My research assistant's report highlights critical constraints: (1) The IRS, not the President, has revocation authority, (2) The Bob Jones precedent shows such processes take 7+ years, (3) No major university has lost tax-exempt status in recent decades, and (4) Clear public policy violations must be demonstrated. The 67-day timeframe is the decisive factor here. Even if Trump's threats represented genuine intent and even if the IRS were to initiate proceedings immediately, the administrative and legal requirements make completion by July 1, 2025 virtually impossible. Tax-exempt status revocation requires formal notice, opportunity for response, administrative hearings, and appeals processes. Harvard would exercise all legal defenses, and courts would likely issue preliminary injunctions while any challenges proceeded. The strongest evidence for a low probability is the sheer impossibility of completing such a complex legal process in 67 days. I'm not forecasting 0% because we're in an unusual political environment where unprecedented actions occasionally occur, and there are explicit threats being made. However, I'm not going higher because the procedural, legal, and temporal barriers are insurmountable. For me to revise upward, I would need credible reporting that the IRS has already initiated formal revocation proceedings with expedited timelines, or evidence of specific legal violations that could justify emergency action. For me to revise downward, I would need IRS officials to publicly reject political interference or legal analysis confirming the absolute impossibility of such rapid action.",
