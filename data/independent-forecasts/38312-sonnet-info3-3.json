  "information": "Sikh organizations in Canada, including the 'Sikh Federation' and the 'World Sikh Organization', have publicly demanded that the Canadian government not invite Prime Minister Modi to the G7 summit. They have cited the Indian government's alleged involvement in the murder of Hardeep Singh Nijjar and other human rights concerns. In a letter to Prime Minister Mark Carney, the World Sikh Organization of Canada stated that inviting the Indian Prime Minister would be an 'irresponsible decision' and would signal that Canada is willing to ignore foreign interference.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Approximately 2-3 weeks. G7 summits typically occur in mid-to-late June, and today is already June 3, 2025. The outcome will be known by the end of June 2025 at the latest.",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No - Modi does not attend. India has not yet received an invitation to the G7 Summit according to the Times of India report, while Canada has already invited other non-G7 countries like Australia and Ukraine. With the summit likely only weeks away, the status quo is that no invitation has been extended.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Canada does not extend an invitation to India due to ongoing diplomatic tensions over the Nijjar case and domestic political pressure from Sikh organizations. Alternatively, Canada extends a last-minute invitation but Modi declines due to the strained bilateral relationship or domestic scheduling conflicts.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Canada extends a surprise last-minute invitation to India in an attempt to maintain traditional G7 outreach partnerships and broader geopolitical considerations regarding India's strategic importance. Modi accepts despite tensions, viewing the summit as an opportunity to advance India's international standing and engage with other major democracies.",
    "rationale": "The base rate strongly favors a No outcome. India, while not a G7 member, has traditionally been invited as an outreach partner to recent summits. However, several factors make Modi's attendance highly unlikely: (1) We are already in June with the summit likely 2-3 weeks away, and India has not been invited while other non-G7 countries have been; (2) Severe diplomatic tensions exist between Canada and India over allegations of Indian government involvement in the Nijjar murder; (3) Sikh organizations in Canada are actively lobbying Prime Minister Carney against inviting Modi, creating domestic political pressure; (4) The timing is extremely tight - even if an invitation came now, it would be unusually last-minute for a head of state's international travel. The research assistant's report confirms organized opposition to Modi's potential attendance, which adds political cost for Canada to extend an invitation. For my forecast to move higher, I would need evidence of: (1) An actual invitation being extended soon; (2) Signals of diplomatic rapprochement between the countries; (3) Strategic imperatives that override current tensions. For it to move lower (toward 0%), I would need: (1) Explicit statements that India will not be invited; (2) The summit date to be announced as imminent with no invitation. I'm not going lower because diplomatic surprises can occur, and strategic considerations about India's global importance might still prompt a last-minute invitation. I'm not going higher because the status quo is clear - no invitation yet, significant obstacles exist, and time is running out.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill India's PM Narendra Modi attend the G7 Summit in June 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nTimes of India: [Canada invites Australia, Ukraine for G7 meet but no call for India yet](https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/canada-invites-australia-ukraine-for-g7-meet-but-no-call-for-india-yet/articleshow/121398906.cms)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi attends in person a G7 summit held in June 2025.\n\n\"In person\" is defined as occupying the same physical space closely enough at the G7 Summit that he can see and hear other heads of state through direct un-intermediated exchange of photons and sound waves.\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nSikh organizations in Canada, including the 'Sikh Federation' and the 'World Sikh Organization', have publicly demanded that the Canadian government not invite Prime Minister Modi to the G7 summit.

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
