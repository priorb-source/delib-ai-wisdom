  "information": "Six Democrats are running in the June 17 primary for Virginia lieutenant governor: Alex Bastani, State Sen. Ghazala F. Hashmi, Babur B. Lateef, State Sen. Aaron R. Rouse, Victor Salgado, and former Richmond Mayor Levar Stoney. While the candidates agree on many core policies, such as repealing Virginia's right-to-work law and increasing the minimum wage, they differ on specific issues like gaming and education. Rouse, a former Virginia Beach City Council member, has sponsored legislation to strengthen protections for renters and to create a regulatory framework for the state's recreational cannabis market. Stoney has positioned himself as both business-friendly and committed to helping families. Hashmi, a former professor, highlights her six years of experience in the Senate.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "~21 days (primary is June 17, 2025)",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No — the most likely outcome is that another candidate (most plausibly Levar Stoney) wins the Democratic primary, with Rouse as a close runner-up.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Levar Stoney leverages higher name recognition, fundraising, and statewide endorsements to carry Richmond and perform well in Northern Virginia, while Rouse’s Hampton Roads base isn’t large enough to overcome Stoney’s plurality. Alternatively, Ghazala Hashmi consolidates enough support in the Richmond suburbs and among progressives to edge out both Stoney and Rouse in a split field.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Rouse consolidates Hampton Roads and significant portions of the African American vote statewide, gains a late-breaking marquee endorsement or two, and benefits from Stoney and Hashmi splitting Richmond/central Virginia. Strong field operations and targeted TV/digital buys lift Rouse to a narrow plurality win in a six-way race.",
    "rationale": "- Setup and field: Six Democrats are running: Alex Bastani, Ghazala Hashmi, Babur Lateef, Aaron Rouse, Victor Salgado, and Levar Stoney. The credible top tier appears to be Stoney and Rouse, with Hashmi as a plausible third. This aligns with typical Virginia dynamics: statewide name recognition, fundraising, and regional bases matter in low-turnout primaries.\n- Status quo weighting: In the absence of decisive new polling to the contrary, the default is that the best-funded, best-known candidate with broad establishment ties has an edge. Stoney, a former Richmond mayor with statewide relationships, likely leads on money and endorsements and has a clear base in Richmond/central Virginia and in parts of NoVA. That makes “No” (Rouse does not win) the status quo outcome.\n- Pathways: Rouse’s path is real: he’s an energetic campaigner with a Hampton Roads base, recent Senate win, and appeal to core Democratic primary constituencies (including renters’ rights and cannabis regulation advocates). He could win with a strong regional turnout plus late momentum and favorable vote-splitting. But in a six-way plurality contest, the bar for the front-runner to hold a lead is lower, and Stoney’s profile makes him the most likely beneficiary of that structure.\n- Research assistant inputs: The RA confirms the field and that Rouse, Stoney, and Hashmi have differentiated resumes/messages. That, combined with typical Virginia primary behavior, informs my view that Stoney is slightly ahead and Rouse is a credible second.\n- Why not higher: If Stoney is leading in funds, endorsements, and (likely) name ID, Rouse needs either a unifying endorsement, a clear polling lead, or a visible late surge. Without that, second place is more probable than first.\n- Why not lower: Rouse’s base in populous Hampton Roads, his recent electoral success, and a split field give him a viable plurality path. Intra-field dynamics (e.g., Stoney and Hashmi competing in overlapping media markets) can help him.\n- What would move me up: Public polling showing Rouse leading or within the margin with momentum; a high-salience endorsement (e.g., from top statewide figures or key unions/advocacy groups); evidence of a late money surge and ad presence; strong early vote/turnout indicators in Hampton Roads.\n- What would move me down: Credible polling with Stoney up by high single digits or more; major endorsements consolidating behind Stoney; a pronounced spending gap favoring Stoney; weak Hampton Roads early vote; a negative story hitting Rouse late.\n- Administrative note: Annulment due to no primary by June 30 seems extremely unlikely and does not materially affect the forecast.\n",

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower.
