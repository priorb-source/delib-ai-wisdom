    "review": "All three forecasters converged on similar probability ranges (28-35%), identifying the same key factors: active negotiations with specific parameters, tight 2-month timeline, first-time sale complexity, and lack of recent updates. Forecaster 2 helpfully noted South Korea's successful K9 export track record to other countries, which supports their export capability. Forecaster 3 made an important observation about 'reportedly in negotiations' suggesting unofficial status, and emphasized that first-time deals require establishing entirely new legal and political frameworks. Both forecasters appropriately distinguished between announcing an agreement (resolution criteria) versus full deal completion, though this distinction could cut both ways - announcements can happen faster but also risk being premature without substance.",
    "rationale": "Upon review, I find the convergence around 28-35% validates the key uncertainties. The most compelling new argument is Forecaster 3's emphasis on 'reportedly in negotiations' indicating this may not be officially confirmed, which is concerning given only 2 months remain. If negotiations were truly advanced, we would expect more official statements or visible progress. The complete absence of additional information from the research assistant is a meaningful negative signal in the defense industry where major deals generate ongoing coverage. However, I also note that the resolution criteria only requires announcement of an agreement (not delivery or full completion), which is a lower bar. The specific deal parameters (20 units, $300M) suggest substantive rather than merely exploratory talks. South Korea's established K9 export infrastructure to other countries does provide some capability to move quickly. The first-time nature between these specific countries adds complexity but doesn't make it impossible within 2 months. Balancing these factors, I'm maintaining a forecast centered in the range identified by all three forecasters, perhaps slightly toward the lower end given the significance of having no recent progress indicators.",
