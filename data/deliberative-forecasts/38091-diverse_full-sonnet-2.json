    "review": "Both forecasters raise important points I hadn't fully considered. Forecaster 3's identification of UN COPUOS (Committee on the Peaceful Uses of Outer Space) in Vienna and the Paris Air Show as June venues is particularly valuable - these are established forums where space agreements are naturally announced, elevating June's probability above a simple base rate. Forecaster 3 also makes a compelling point that Artemis Accords signings are 'often announced only at the moment of ceremony,' making the absence of advance notice less informative than I initially thought. Both forecasters correctly calculate a base rate around 55-56% using Poisson models with λ≈0.8/month (including December 2024 signings), which is higher than my initial 0.6/month calculation. However, I find Forecaster 3's 61% slightly optimistic. While the venue factor is real, Forecaster 3's own data shows two zero-signing months in early 2025 (Feb, Mar), and the 'coming weeks and months' language, while positive, remains deliberately vague. Forecaster 2's 55% seems well-calibrated, closely matching the Poisson base rate while accounting for positive signals.",
    "rationale": "I'm updating my forecast upward based on three key insights from the deliberation: (1) The UN COPUOS session and Paris Air Show provide natural June venues for announcements, which I underweighted; (2) The expanded timeframe including December 2024 yields a higher base rate (~0.8/month versus my 0.6/month); and (3) The lack of pre-announcement is less informative than I initially assessed, since these signings can be announced at ceremony. These factors suggest June has above-average probability. However, I remain more conservative than Forecaster 3 for several reasons. The Poisson model with λ=0.8 already yields a 56% base rate, and while June's venues provide a modest boost, two factors constrain my update: status quo bias remains strong (no signing is the default requiring no action), and the recent NASA statement's vagueness ('coming weeks and months') doesn't specifically telegraph June timing. The February-March 2025 gap demonstrates that momentum doesn't guarantee monthly signings. I'm settling at 53%, splitting the difference between my original 45% and the group consensus around 55-61%, giving weight to the venue factor while maintaining appropriate caution about the narrow 32-day window.",
