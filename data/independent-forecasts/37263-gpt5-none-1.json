    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "About 60 days (until 2025-07-01)",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No — Uber is not available in Turks and Caicos and nothing changes before July 1, 2025.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Authorities maintain or tighten enforcement against unlicensed ride-hailing/“illegal taxis,” Uber remains unlisted for Turks and Caicos on its website, and no credible launch announcements occur. Taxi industry opposition and regulatory inertia persist through July 1.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Government quickly approves or pilots a ride-hail framework (e.g., an Uber Taxi model using licensed taxis) or reaches an understanding with Uber; Uber updates its site to list Turks and Caicos and credible outlets report active availability in at least part of the territory (e.g., Providenciales) before July 1.",
    "rationale": "- Timeframe: Only ~2 months remain, which is short for entering a new regulated market, especially if legal status is unclear.\n- Status quo: The referenced article warns stakeholders about encouraging illegal taxis, signaling heightened enforcement and a stance likely unfriendly to rapid ride-hailing entry. Status quo therefore favors No, and good forecasting practice weights status quo heavily because change is usually slow.\n- Market/prior: Small island markets with strong taxi regulation often resist Uber; recent regional precedents show that where ride-hailing is contentious, entry commonly requires government agreements or legal changes that take longer than a few weeks.\n- Uber’s expansion pattern: Recent corporate focus has been on product breadth (delivery, advertising, partnerships) rather than rapidly adding very small new geographies. Launching in a new territory typically involves regulatory work and local supply onboarding.\nWhy not higher: No public signals of imminent approval or partnership, active warnings against illegal taxis, short runway to July 1, and small market economics.\nWhy not lower: A narrow but real pathway exists if the government authorizes a limited, taxi-partner model (Uber Taxi) for tourists; such models can launch relatively quickly once approved and would satisfy the resolution criterion if Uber lists the market.\nWhat would move me up: Credible reports of negotiations or a draft framework for ride-hailing; public statements from TCI government or Uber about an imminent pilot; local taxi associations signaling support for app-based dispatch under existing licensing.\nWhat would move me down: Official statements reaffirming that ride-hailing will not be permitted in the near term; new enforcement actions against app-based transport; continued absence of any mention on Uber’s site or in credible local media as June progresses.\nResearch assistant summary: No additional information available beyond the noted warning article; thus I rely on general priors, the regulatory signal in the article, and typical rollout dynamics.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill Uber be available in the Turks and Caicos Islands on July 1, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\n[Tourism Stakeholders Warned About Encouraging Use of Illegal Taxis](https://magneticmediatv.com/2025/04/tourism-stakeholders-warned-about-encouraging-use-of-illegal-taxis/)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if Uber is available in Turks and Caicos as shown on the [Uber website](https://www.uber.com/us/en/search-results/?query=TURKS+AND+CAICOS) or according to [credible sources](https://www.metaculus.com/faq/#definitions).\n\n\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nNo additional information available.\n\nToday is 2025-05-02.\n\nBefore answering you think:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n(e) You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
