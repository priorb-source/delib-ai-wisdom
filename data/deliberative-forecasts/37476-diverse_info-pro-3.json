    "review": "The other two forecasters presented compelling arguments that significantly changed my perspective. My initial forecast of 30% was too high, as I over-weighted lagging financial indicators (poor 2024 results, low current ratio) and under-weighted the importance of the short timeframe and the absence of a specific, near-term bankruptcy trigger. Forecaster 2 effectively argued for the low base rate of bankruptcy in any two-month period and highlighted 'business as usual' signals like the upcoming earnings call. Forecaster 3 provided the most critical piece of missing evidence: GoPro's main debt maturity is not until November 2025, well after the question's resolution date. This dramatically reduces the likelihood of a forced filing before July 1. Their reasoning, focusing on the lack of an immediate catalyst, is much more appropriate for this specific question than my focus on the company's general financial ill-health. Their analyses were highly convincing, and I find my own initial reasoning to be flawed in light of their points.",
    "rationale": "I am substantially revising my forecast downward from 30% to 4%. My initial analysis incorrectly equated severe financial distress with a high probability of imminent bankruptcy. The other forecasters correctly demonstrated that without a near-term catalyst, even a distressed company is unlikely to file for bankruptcy within a short 53-day window. \n\nThe most decisive new information, raised by Forecaster 3, is that GoPro's significant debt maturity is not due until November 2025. This removes the primary, and most common, trigger for a near-term bankruptcy. With $283 million in cash and no major debt payments due before July 1, the company has a sufficient liquidity runway to operate past the resolution date, despite its underlying unprofitability.\n\nFurthermore, as both other forecasters noted, the company is exhibiting multiple signals of operational continuity. These include active marketing campaigns, product updates, and a scheduled earnings release. These are not the actions of a management team preparing for a bankruptcy filing in the next seven weeks. My new forecast of 4% aligns with the view that while GoPro is in a precarious long-term position, the odds of a bankruptcy filing specifically before July 1, 2025, are very low due to the lack of an immediate trigger.",
