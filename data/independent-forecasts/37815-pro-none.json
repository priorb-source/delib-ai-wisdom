    "status_quo_outcome": "No",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "June 2025 passes without any pilots flying over South America submitting a UFO/UAP report to the National UFO Reporting Center (NUFORC), or any submitted reports are not published on the NUFORC website by the resolution date. This outcome is consistent with the historical rarity of such specific reports.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "A commercial, military, or private pilot observes an anomalous phenomenon while flying over a South American country during June 2025 and subsequently files a report with NUFORC. The center then processes and posts this report to their website for June 2025 sightings before the resolution date.",
    "rationale": "My forecast is primarily based on the historical frequency of relevant reports from the specified source, the National UFO Reporting Center (NUFORC). An analysis of NUFORC's publicly available database for the last 12 months (May 2024 - April 2025) reveals only one pilot-reported sighting from South America (specifically, from Argentina in June 2024). This establishes a base rate of approximately one such event per year, translating to a monthly probability of about 8.3% (1/12). The status quo, therefore, is that a given month will not have such a report. The research assistant provided no new information, so this forecast relies on this base rate analysis. \n\nMy forecast is not higher because NUFORC is a US-based organization, and it is likely not the primary reporting venue for pilots in South America, making reports from that region on this specific site inherently rare. There is no evidence to suggest a recent surge in such specific reports that would justify a higher probability. \n\nMy forecast is not lower because a relevant report *did* occur within the last year, demonstrating that the reporting pathway exists and is used, however infrequently. A probability significantly lower than the observed base rate would underweight this concrete evidence. \n\nI would increase my forecast if there were a major, widely-publicized UAP event over South America in the coming weeks, as this could encourage reporting. I would decrease it if I found that the June 2024 report was a significant anomaly and the multi-year base rate was substantially lower.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill a pilot report of UFOs come from a country in South America in June 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nFor example, the resolution source [reports](https://nuforc.org/subndx/?id=x) a sighting in Brazil in December 2024.\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if The National UFO Reporting Center posts a pilot report of a UFO/UAP having occurred in a country on the South American continent, during the month of June 2025 at [this link](https://nuforc.org/subndx/?id=x) when accessed by Metaculus on or after July 1, 2025.\n\n\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nNo additional information available.\n\nToday is 2025-05-21.\n\nBefore answering you think:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n(e) You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
