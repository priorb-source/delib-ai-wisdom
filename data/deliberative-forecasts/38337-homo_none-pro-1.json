    "review": "Both other forecasters have arrived at the same 55% probability, and their core reasoning aligns closely with my own. The consensus rests on the observation that the 4-week moving average for initial jobless claims is currently trending in the 220,000-225,000 range, placing the question's threshold of 220,000 very near the central tendency. This makes the outcome highly subject to normal weekly volatility. Forecaster 3 introduced a valuable point I had not explicitly articulated: the asymmetric risk distribution of weekly claims. They correctly argue that there is more potential for an unexpected upside surprise from a large layoff event than for a sudden, sharp drop. This argument is convincing and provides a stronger theoretical underpinning for favoring the 'Yes' outcome, even if only slightly.",
    "rationale": "After reviewing the analyses of the other forecasters, I am maintaining my forecast of 55%. The deliberation process has reinforced my initial assessment rather than significantly altering it. The core of the forecast remains unchanged: the recent trend in the 4-week moving average is slightly above the 220,000 threshold, suggesting the status quo outcome is 'Yes'. However, the weekly data is notoriously volatile, and the threshold is too close to the mean to warrant a high-confidence forecast.\n\nThe point raised by Forecaster 3 about asymmetric risk—that large upward spikes are more common than large downward deviations—strengthens my conviction in leaning towards 'Yes'. It provides a structural reason why an outcome greater than 220,000 is slightly more probable. However, this insight doesn't fundamentally change the high level of uncertainty. It solidifies the rationale for a 55% forecast rather than justifying an increase. The strong consensus among all three forecasters on both the probability and the underlying reasoning gives me confidence that this forecast appropriately balances the slight upward trend against the inherent randomness of a single week's data point.",
