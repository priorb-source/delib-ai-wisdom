    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Less than one month. The deadline is June 1, 2025.",
    "status_quo_outcome": "The 'Tush-Push' remains a legal play in the NFL, as no new rule is passed to ban it. This is the 'No' outcome.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "The NFL owners and the Competition Committee do not hold a vote or fail to reach the required 24-vote consensus to ban the play before the June 1, 2025 deadline. The issue is likely postponed for consideration in the next offseason.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "In response to continued debate or a new catalyst, the NFL convenes a special meeting or uses a previously scheduled late-spring meeting to vote on the 'Tush-Push'. A proposal to ban or significantly restrict the play receives approval from at least 24 of the 32 team owners, and the league officially announces the rule change before June 1, 2025.",
    "rationale": "My forecast is heavily weighted by the status quo and the extremely short timeline. The deadline is less than three weeks away, and the primary NFL meeting for rule changes, the Annual League Meeting, occurred in March 2025. The fact that a ban was not passed then, with reports at the time indicating the vote was tabled for more discussion, strongly suggests a lack of the required 24-owner consensus. It is highly irregular for the league to pass a significant, on-field rule change this late in the offseason, as teams are already well into their preparations for the upcoming season. The path of least resistance is for the rule to remain unchanged for the 2025-2026 season. \n\nMy probability is not lower than 5% because the 'Tush-Push' remains a highly contentious issue due to player safety concerns and its impact on competitive balance. A sudden catalyst, such as a prominent figure speaking out, new compelling injury data, or a rapid shift in owner sentiment, could theoretically trigger an emergency vote. However, the procedural hurdles and the resistance to such a late change make this a remote possibility.\n\nMy probability is not higher than 5% because of the immense institutional inertia. The time to pass this rule was in March. Doing so now would be an unprecedented move for a non-urgent issue. Without any reports of a special meeting being scheduled, the default assumption must be that the league will wait until the next offseason cycle to revisit the topic.\n\nA significant increase in my forecast would require news of an imminent owners' meeting to specifically discuss and vote on this rule. Conversely, my forecast would decrease further if an NFL official publicly states the matter is closed until the 2026 offseason.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill the NFL ban the \"Tush-Push\" before June 1, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nESPN: [Vote on tush push ban tabled by NFL owners for more discussion](https://www.espn.com/nfl/story/_/id/44490292/sources-tush-push-ban-vote-tabled-nfl-owners) | CBS Sports: [Expansive 'Tush Push' ban could have strong support at NFL's next owners meeting, per report](https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/news/expansive-tush-push-ban-could-have-strong-support-at-nfls-next-owners-meeting-per-report/)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if the National Football League officially approves or announces a rule restricting the quarterback sneak known as the [Tush-Push](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quarterback_sneak#Tush_push) before June 1, 2025. If there are no reports of this occurring before that date, this question resolves as **No**.\n\n\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nNo additional information available.\n\nToday is 2025-05-12.\n\nBefore answering you think:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n(e) You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
