    "review": "Both other forecasters share my core reasoning: the most critical piece of evidence is the very recent (May 15) extension of martial law until August 6, 2025, which, under current Ukrainian law, legally prohibits the scheduling of an election. We all agree that this legislative act, combined with official denials from President Zelensky's office, makes a 'No' outcome extremely likely. Their analyses were valuable in framing the potential low-probability 'Yes' scenarios more clearly, specifically mentioning international pressure as a potential catalyst for a policy reversal (Forecaster 2) and cleanly outlining the two necessary preconditions for a 'Yes' vote—early termination of martial law or a rapid change in the law (Forecaster 3). Forecaster 3's point about 'status quo bias'—that governments are unlikely to quickly reverse a major decision they just made—is a particularly compelling argument that reinforces the 'No' case. The primary difference between my forecast and theirs is the weight we assign to these low-probability 'Yes' scenarios; they assign a 6-7% chance, whereas I am lower.",
    "rationale": "After reviewing the other experts' analyses, I am maintaining my forecast of 2%. My reasoning remains anchored to the powerful and unequivocal evidence provided by the Verkhovna Rada's vote on May 15, 2025, to extend martial law until August 6, 2025. This action, taken just one day ago, serves as the government's most current and official assessment of the national situation, and it legally precludes an election announcement before this question's July 1 resolution date.\n\nThe other forecasters correctly identify potential pathways to a 'Yes' outcome, such as a sudden peace breakthrough or intense international pressure. While I had considered these 'black swan' events in my initial 2% forecast, their deliberation has not produced new evidence to suggest these possibilities are more likely than I had initially assessed. In fact, Forecaster 3’s argument about 'status quo bias' strengthens my conviction. For the Ukrainian government to reverse a major security declaration made just yesterday would require a truly seismic shift in the conflict or political landscape within the next 45 days, which seems exceptionally improbable.\n\nTherefore, while I acknowledge the theoretical possibility of an unpredictable event, the concrete, recent, and legally binding action of extending martial law far outweighs the speculative nature of these scenarios. The other forecasters’ 6-7% estimates seem to assign too much weight to general uncertainty relative to the specific and powerful evidence at hand. I believe a 1-in-50 chance (2%) accurately reflects the high barriers to a 'Yes' resolution.",
