    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Approximately 32 days until July 1, 2025",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No - several escapees remain at large",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "At least one of the 10 escapees successfully evades capture beyond July 1, 2025. This could occur if escapees flee to other jurisdictions, receive outside assistance, or find effective hiding locations. Even if 9 are recaptured, a single escapee remaining at large results in a No resolution.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Law enforcement successfully locates and either recaptures or neutralizes all remaining escapees within the next 32 days. This would require effective investigative work, public tips, escapees making mistakes, or exhaustion of their resources leading to capture.",
    "rationale": "This forecast hinges on needing ALL 10 escapees recaptured or killed - an all-or-nothing proposition that significantly affects the probability. Based on the May 19 article (11 days ago), 3 of 10 had been recaptured within 3 days of the May 16 escape, but 7 remained at large. This means that as of today (May 30), it has been 14 days since the escape with at least 7 escapees unaccounted for in the last available report. Historical patterns show most recaptures occur in the first 48-72 hours when escapees lack resources and haven't established hiding places. The fact that 7 were still at large after the initial window suggests these individuals may have better resources, planning, or hiding locations. With only 32 days remaining until the resolution date, time pressure works against complete recapture. The requirement for 100% success is critical - even one escapee evading capture means the question resolves No. Factors favoring Yes: active manhunt, state investigation launched, some early successes. Factors favoring No: multiple still at large after two weeks, all-or-nothing requirement, escapees may have fled jurisdiction, historical precedent suggests not all escapees are caught quickly. For my forecast to move higher, I would need evidence that most or all remaining escapees have been located or that capture rate has accelerated significantly. For it to move lower, evidence that escapees have left the region or that the manhunt has stalled would be key.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill all 10 inmates who escaped from jail in New Orleans on May 16, 2025 be recaptured before July 1, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\n[Manhunt continues Monday for 7 Orleans jail escapees as state launches investigation](https://www.fox8live.com/2025/05/19/manhunt-continues-monday-7-orleans-jail-escapees-state-launches-investigation/)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if before July 1, 2025, all 10 inmates who escaped from jail in the [2025 New Orleans jailbreak](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2025_New_Orleans_jailbreak) have been either recaptured or killed, according to [credible sources](https://www.metaculus.com/faq/#definitions). If any are still at large on July 1, 2025, then the question resolves as **No**.\n\n\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nNo additional information available.\n\nToday is 2025-05-30.\n\nBefore answering you think:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n(e) You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
