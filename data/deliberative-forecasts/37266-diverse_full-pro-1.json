    "review": "The other forecasters and I are in broad agreement on the core drivers of this question: the status quo is a Level 3 advisory, the threshold for a country-wide Level 4 is extremely high, and the current violence is largely contained geographically. Forecaster 2 reinforced these points by noting the small number of countries (21) currently at Level 4 and highlighting the relative stability in the capital, Maputo. The most compelling new argument came from Forecaster 3, who detailed the U.S. State Department's established policy of applying targeted Level 4 warnings to specific high-risk regions (e.g., in Nigeria, DRC, Kenya) while maintaining a lower country-wide advisory. This provides a clear and likely alternative path for the State Department to respond to worsening security in northern Mozambique, making a full country-wide escalation less probable.",
    "rationale": "My initial forecast was 15%. After reviewing the other analyses, I am lowering my forecast to 12%. The primary motivator for this change is the argument, most effectively articulated by Forecaster 3, regarding the State Department's common practice of issuing regional Level 4 advisories for countries with localized conflicts. I had noted the existence of regional warnings in my initial analysis, but Forecaster 3's use of specific country examples (Nigeria, DRC, Kenya) makes this precedent a much stronger anchor against a 'Yes' resolution. This policy provides a clear off-ramp for the State Department to signal heightened danger in the north without elevating the entire country. This makes a nationwide Level 4 advisory significantly less likely, as it would require not just a worsening of the northern insurgency but a fundamental change in the security situation across the country, likely threatening the capital. I am not lowering my forecast as far as Forecaster 3's 11% because I place slightly more weight on the tail risk of a 'shock' event—such as a major terrorist attack in a southern city, or a violent turn in the post-election protests—that could cause a rapid, non-standard policy reaction given the volatile mix of political and security threats.",
