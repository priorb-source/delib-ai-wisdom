  "information": "The West Northamptonshire Council election is scheduled for May 1, 2025. The number of council seats has been reduced from 93 to 76 for this election, with 39 seats required for a majority. The current council composition is: 50 Conservatives, 16 Labour, 4 Reform UK, 3 Greens, and 3 Independents. The incumbent Conservative council leader, Jason Smithers, is not seeking re-election.\n\nNational polling data from late April 2025 indicates voting intentions place Reform UK at approximately 25%, Labour at 24%, and the Conservative Party at 22%. Reports suggest the Liberal Democrats are targeting Conservative-held areas with significant campaign resources, and the rise of Reform UK is expected to split the traditional Conservative vote.\n\nA recent parliamentary by-election in Wellingborough, located within the West Northamptonshire council area, saw a swing from the Conservative Party to the Labour Party. The 2025 election will be contested on new electoral boundaries. Political analyst Professor Sir John Curtice has predicted that nationally, Reform UK could win hundreds of council seats in the May 2025 local elections.",

    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "About 12 days (polling day 1 May; results likely 2–3 May 2025)",
    "status_quo_outcome": "Conservatives remain the largest party (though probably lose their outright majority)",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Labour take a clear plurality by sweeping most Northampton town wards, while Liberal Democrats and Greens pick off Conservative rural/suburban seats and Reform splits the right‑leaning vote, leaving the Conservatives short of the most seats (or tied, which would still resolve as No).",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Despite significant losses, the Conservatives’ rural/suburban base plus opposition vote-splitting (Labour/Lib Dem/Green/Reform) leaves them with a narrow seat lead across the new wards.",
    "rationale": "What I’m weighing:\n- Timing and baseline: The council votes on 1 May with 76 seats (39 for a majority). The Conservatives currently hold 50 of 93, so the status quo favors them as the historically dominant party in this largely rural/suburban unitary. Good forecasters overweight the status quo, but also adjust for new information.\n- New information (from the assistant and context):\n  - National headwinds for the Conservatives are severe, with Reform UK rising and expected to split the traditional Conservative vote. Professor Sir John Curtice has flagged the possibility of Reform making notable gains nationally in these locals. Lib Dems are reportedly targeting Conservative-held areas with resources. The Conservative council leader is not re-standing, removing a potential incumbency advantage.\n  - Boundaries have changed and total seats are reduced (93 → 76), adding uncertainty and often eroding the advantage of the incumbent party that previously banked many seats.\n  - A by-election swing in nearby Wellingborough (note: that contest was in North Northamptonshire, not West) indicates broader regional weakness for Conservatives, though it is not directly within West Northamptonshire.\n- Structure of the contest: West Northamptonshire combines a Labour-leaning Northampton town with strongly Conservative-leaning areas (Daventry/South Northants). Under multi-member FPTP, parties with dispersed support (notably Reform) often struggle to convert votes into seats; their main effect can be to depress Conservative tallies, enabling Labour/Lib Dem/Green wins. That dynamic makes a Conservative plurality less certain than historical patterns suggest.\n- Why not higher: National environment, Reform’s rise, and an energized Lib Dem presence all point to sizable Conservative losses. Northampton town likely yields many Labour seats, and boundary changes could magnify losses. A tie for most seats would resolve as No, shaving probability further.\n- Why not lower: Conservative support remains relatively efficient in rural/suburban wards, where they can still top fragmented fields even with reduced vote shares. Reform’s vote is likely to be inefficient in multi-member wards. Labour’s strength is concentrated in Northampton; for Labour to finish first overall, they must add enough seats outside the town while the Lib Dems/Greens also chip away at Conservatives—possible, but not a lock.\n- What would move me up: Evidence of limited Reform candidate coverage locally; data showing strong Conservative incumbency and ground game in rural wards; indications that opposition parties are not coordinating or are competing heavily against each other in key wards; local polling suggesting Conservatives still lead in seat-rich rural divisions.\n- What would move me down: Ward-level data or credible local polling showing tactical voting/targeting by Labour/Lib Dems/Greens, strong Reform coverage in Conservative heartlands, or reports of substantial Conservative defections/retirements beyond the leader, implying an unusually large collapse in the rural/suburban zones.\nBottom line: Expect Conservatives to lose many seats and likely their majority, but still have a meaningful chance to finish as the largest party on seat count due to vote-splitting and geography. I rate them as slight underdogs to retain the most seats under these conditions.",
