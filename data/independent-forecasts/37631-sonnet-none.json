    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Approximately 45 days (from May 13, 2025 to June 27, 2025)",
    "status_quo_outcome": "The current relative positions of Walmart and Tesla market caps will likely persist through the resolution date, given the short timeframe",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Tesla maintains or regains a higher market cap than Walmart through positive catalysts such as strong Q2 delivery numbers, breakthrough announcements in autonomous driving or energy storage, improved sentiment on AI capabilities, or broader market rotation back into growth/tech stocks that lifts Tesla disproportionately",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Walmart maintains higher market cap than Tesla through continued execution of its retail and e-commerce strategy, stable earnings, while Tesla faces continued pressure from competition in EVs, disappointing delivery numbers, regulatory challenges, or negative sentiment around leadership decisions. The decline mentioned in the JPMorgan analysis continues through June",
    "rationale": "The question references a March 2025 article highlighting Tesla's significant decline according to JPMorgan analysts. With only 6.5 weeks until resolution, status quo bias is critical - markets typically don't see dramatic reversals in such short timeframes. The fact this is posed as a genuine forecasting question suggests the companies are competitively positioned, rather than Tesla being dramatically ahead as it historically was. Walmart is a stable, profitable retailer with consistent performance and less volatility. Tesla, while innovative, has faced increased competition in EVs, production challenges, and valuation concerns. The short timeframe means daily volatility matters, but structural positioning matters more. If Tesla has indeed experienced the significant decline described and the companies are close in valuation, small movements either way are plausible. My forecast isn't higher because Tesla has shown ability to rally quickly on positive news and maintains strong retail investor support. It's not lower because the referenced decline suggests real fundamental or sentiment challenges, and Walmart's stability makes it a strong comparison point. I would update higher (toward Yes) with: evidence of continued Tesla underperformance, weak delivery numbers, or clear current data showing Walmart ahead. I would update lower (toward No) with: evidence of Tesla recovery, strong delivery beats, or major positive catalysts emerging.",
