    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Approximately 1.5 months.",
    "status_quo_outcome": "Yes. The USDA's 'What Can SNAP Buy?' page currently lists 'snack foods', and if no action is taken, it will continue to do so on the resolution date.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "A new presidential administration, focused on promoting healthier eating habits, directs the USDA to swiftly implement changes to SNAP messaging. As a quick, symbolic measure, the guidance on the 'What Can SNAP Buy?' page is updated, and the explicit mention of 'snack foods' is removed before July 1, 2025.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Bureaucratic inertia prevails. Despite potential policy discussions about SNAP eligibility for certain foods, the process of formally changing regulations or even official public-facing website content is slow. The USDA does not prioritize or complete this specific textual change on its webpage by the resolution date.",
    "rationale": "This forecast is based heavily on the principle of bureaucratic inertia. The status quo is that 'snack foods' is listed, and the timeframe for a change to occur is very short (approximately six weeks). Government agencies, including the USDA, typically move slowly. Changing official public guidance on a program as large as SNAP, even on a website, often involves a review and approval process that would likely extend beyond the July 1 resolution date. While the provided article suggests a potential policy shift under a new administration, translating a desired policy into a specific textual change on a webpage is a low-priority task that is unlikely to be completed this quickly. My probability is not higher because a new, motivated political appointee could potentially force through this minor cosmetic change as a quick and symbolic 'win' to signal a new policy direction. My probability is not lower because the path of least resistance strongly favors the status quo; a 'No' outcome requires specific, focused action to be taken within a compressed timeframe, making it the far less likely scenario. I would lower my probability if high-level USDA officials made public statements specifically about updating SNAP guidance materials in the immediate future.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill the USDA still list \"snack foods\" on its \"What Can SNAP Buy?\" page on July 1, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nNY Post: [Americans on food stamps could be banned from buying ‘bad food and sugary drinks,’ Trump USDA chief says](https://nypost.com/2025/02/14/us-news/americans-on-food-stamps-could-be-banned-from-buying-bad-food-and-sugary-drinks-trump-usda-chief-says/)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if \"snack foods\" is specifically listed on the United States Department of Agriculture's [What Can SNAP Buy?](https://www.fns.usda.gov/snap/eligible-food-items) webpage as something that is explicitly mentioned as something that can can be purchased by recipients of the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program. (Forecasters please note that it *is* explicitly mentioned as of May 5, 2025.) If it is *not* explicitly mentioned when checked by Metataculus on or after July 1, 2025, this resolves as **No**.\n\nIn order to streamline resolution, synonyms will not count; the phrase must specifically be \"snack foods.\" The question will resolve as soon as the page is accessed by Metaculus Admins on the resolution date. However, if there are issues accessing the page, then resolution will wait up to the end of the question resolutions period, at which point if Metaculus has still not been able to access the resolution source, this question will be **annulled**.\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nNo additional information available.\n\nToday is 2025-05-20.\n\nBefore answering you think:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n(e) You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
