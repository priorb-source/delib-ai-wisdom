    "review": "Both forecasters provided valuable additional evidence that strengthens the case for systematic policy change. Forecaster 2's details about Secretary Hegseth's explicit 'climate nonsense' statements and the revocation of the January 2021 climate executive order demonstrate high-level commitment to this direction. Forecaster 3's information about the Navy's Climate Action 2030 rescission and $377M in removed funding shows this is part of coordinated action across military branches. The most novel argument is Forecaster 3's operational readiness point—that military bases face genuine climate-related operational challenges (flooding, extreme heat, storms) that might create internal pressure for restoration. This is a consideration I underweighed. However, I note that operational needs could be addressed through classified or internal systems rather than restoring the public-facing climate.mil portal. The Trump administration has shown willingness to maintain operational capabilities while removing public-facing climate content. All three of us converged on 8-13%, suggesting our independent analyses reached similar conclusions about the low probability.",
    "rationale": "The additional evidence reinforces that this is deliberate, coordinated policy rather than an isolated decision. The specific policy reversals (Climate Action 2030, $377M removal, executive order revocation) and leadership statements make rapid reversal even less likely than I initially assessed. However, Forecaster 3's operational readiness argument has merit—military installations do face real climate-related challenges affecting operations. This creates a theoretical pathway where operational necessity could drive some form of restoration. That said, 42 days remains an extremely compressed timeframe for bureaucratic reversal, especially given the administration's demonstrated commitment. The operational argument is somewhat weakened by the fact that DOD could address internal needs without restoring the public portal. I'm updating from 8% to 10% primarily because: (1) the operational readiness argument adds a plausible (if unlikely) restoration pathway I hadn't fully weighted, (2) clustering with peer forecasters at 10% represents appropriate epistemic humility, and (3) 42 days provides slightly more opportunity for unexpected developments than I initially credited. I'm not updating higher because the new evidence about systematic policy changes actually strengthens the case for continued offline status.",
