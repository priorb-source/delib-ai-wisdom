    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Approximately one month. The festival runs from June 25 to June 29, 2025, so the outcome will be certain by the end of that period.",
    "status_quo_outcome": "Yes. Kneecap are currently listed on the official Glastonbury 2025 lineup and are scheduled to perform.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Glastonbury organisers succumb to political and media pressure and remove Kneecap from the lineup. This decision could be triggered by an escalation in the police investigation, such as charges being filed, or a determination that the band's presence represents a significant security or reputational risk to the festival.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "The Glastonbury organisers resist the pressure to cancel the performance, deeming it an issue of artistic freedom. The controversy subsides, the police investigation does not lead to immediate legal consequences, and the band performs their set as scheduled.",
    "rationale": "My forecast is based on the significant weight of the status quo. Kneecap are officially on the bill, and cancelling a booked act so close to a major festival is a disruptive and rare event. Glastonbury has a long-standing reputation for embracing counter-culture and withstanding political controversy, suggesting a high tolerance for the kind of backlash the band is currently facing from certain media outlets and politicians. The festival organisers are likely to view dropping the band as an act of censorship that runs contrary to their ethos.\n\nHowever, the probability is not higher due to the seriousness of the allegations. The key risk factor is the police investigation into alleged support for Hamas and Hezbollah, organisations proscribed in the UK. Unlike general political controversy, this carries a tangible legal risk. If the police were to press charges or advise the festival that the band's performance constitutes a public order risk, Glastonbury's hand would likely be forced, irrespective of their principles on artistic freedom. The comments regarding MPs also touch upon a highly sensitive issue in UK politics.\n\nThe forecast is not lower because, as of today, no charges have been filed, and the initial wave of outrage from late April/early May has not yet resulted in the band's cancellation. Major festivals plan for these contingencies, and Glastonbury's decision to keep them on the lineup thus far indicates a willingness to weather the storm. Without a significant development in the police investigation, the default course of action is for the scheduled performance to proceed.\n\nI would lower my forecast significantly if the Metropolitan Police announce charges or formally caution the band. Conversely, I would raise my forecast if the festival organisers release a statement explicitly supporting the band, or if the police publicly drop the investigation.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill Kneecap perform at Glastonbury 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\n[Kneecap](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kneecap_\\(band\\)) are an Irish band who have significantly risen in popularity since their formation in 2017.&#x20;\n\nThe band is a trio consisting of: \"Mo Chara\" (Liam Óg Ó hAnnaidh), \"Móglaí Bap\" (Naoise Ó Caireallain), and \"DJ Próvaí\" (J. J. Ó Dochartaigh) whose songs consist of rap in a mixture of Irish Gaelic and English giving them a unique style.\n\nNamed after a [torture technique](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kneecapping) made infamous by the Irish Republican Army, the group are no stranger to controversies. Whilst most have been minor - complaints about profanity, drug use, violence in their songs, music videos and concerts, and promotion of Irish Republicanism - the band have come under a large amount of controversy resulting in cancelled performances which initially stemmed from a Coachcella performance where the band, \"described Israel's military action in Gaza as a US-funded genocide\".&#x20;\n\nOn top of this, [two reports were made](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/cly5r4gg7l6o) to the UK Metropolitan police:\n\n> \\[...] the band allegedly call for the death of Conservative MPs. Another seems to show a band member shouting \"up Hamas, up Hezbollah\". Both groups are banned in the UK and it is a crime to express support for them.\n\n> \\[...]\n\n> They claimed that footage where they appeared to say \"the only good Tory is a dead Tory\" had been \"taken out of all context\", and apologised for the hurt caused to the families of murdered MPs Jo Cox and Sir David Amess.\n\nThe band are [due](https://www.glastonburyfestivals.co.uk/line-up/) to play at Glastonbury 2025 - the UK's largest and most prestigious music festival - however there have been [calls](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/politics/2025/04/30/kneecap-should-be-banned-full-stop-after-dead-tories-video/) for the band to be removed from the lineup.\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question will resolve as **Yes** if Kneecap officially performs at Glastonbury 2025, scheduled for June 25 to June 29, 2025.\n\n* If Glastonbury 2025 does not take place before September 1, 2025 this question will be **annulled**.\n* Officially perform is defined as a planned performance as allowed by the festival organisers.\n* Any official performance is considered sufficient for this question. If, for example, one band member is banned from the festival, the question will still resolve as **Yes** if the other member(s) perform under the name Kneecap.\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nNo additional information available.\n\nToday is 2025-05-23.\n\nBefore answering you think:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n(e) You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
