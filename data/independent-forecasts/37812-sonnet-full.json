  "information": "Several airlines announced the resumption or launch of new flights to Beirut for the summer 2025 season. Scandinavian Airlines (SAS) is resuming service from Copenhagen and Stockholm in June. Emirates resumed its daily service from Dubai in February 2025 and added a second daily flight in April. Air France and its subsidiary Transavia also resumed flights from Paris in February. Other confirmed additions include a Wizz Air flight from Abu Dhabi starting June 4, a seasonal Middle East Airlines (MEA) route to Barcelona from June 26, and a LOT Polish Airlines flight from Warsaw beginning July 1, 2025.\n\nAccording to airport statistics, Beirut International Airport handled 1,254,550 passengers in the first quarter of 2025, a 1.42% decrease from the same period in 2024. While passenger arrivals increased by 9.33%, departures fell by 11.60%, and the number of transit passengers dropped by over 92%. The Lebanese government has also implemented new security measures at the airport to combat smuggling, including banning certain Iranian flights and increasing security checks.\n\nAs of May 2025, the number of active destinations was estimated to be around 39, based on OAG schedule data, down from 53 in May 2024. A number of airlines that suspended routes in October 2023, including British Airways, Lufthansa Group, Saudia, EgyptAir, and Pegasus, had not fully returned. Key Gulf carriers like Kuwait Airways and Qatar Airways also remained absent. Lebanon’s tourism ministry has projected that summer arrivals for 2025 will be 30% below 2019 levels.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Approximately 41 days (July 1, 2025 is about 6 weeks away from May 21, 2025)",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No - currently there are approximately 39 direct flight destinations from Beirut, which would remain well below the 51 threshold",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "The modest recovery continues with only the already-announced routes materializing (SAS from Copenhagen/Stockholm, Wizz Air from Abu Dhabi, MEA to Barcelona, LOT from Warsaw), bringing the total to approximately 44 destinations by July 1, still significantly short of the 51 needed. Major carriers that suspended service (British Airways, Lufthansa Group, Qatar Airways, Kuwait Airways, Saudia) remain absent due to ongoing security concerns and weak demand indicators.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "A rapid acceleration in airline confidence occurs over the next 6 weeks, with multiple major carriers (Lufthansa Group airlines, British Airways, Gulf carriers) simultaneously announcing route resumptions. Regional security improves significantly, triggering a wave of route launches that, combined with already-announced additions, pushes the total above 51 destinations.",
    "rationale": "Starting from a baseline of 39 destinations in May 2025, the research confirms 5 specific new routes launching by July 1 (Copenhagen, Stockholm, Abu Dhabi, Barcelona, Warsaw), bringing the expected total to approximately 44 destinations. To exceed 51, an additional 8+ destinations would need to be added within 6 weeks. The evidence strongly suggests this is unlikely: (1) Passenger traffic decreased 1.42% year-over-year in Q1 2025, (2) Multiple major carriers remain absent since October 2023 suspensions, (3) Tourism projections are 30% below 2019 levels, indicating weak demand, (4) Airlines typically require substantial lead time for route planning and regulatory approvals - with only 6 weeks remaining, any July 1 launches would need to be announced already or imminently. The gap from 44 to 52+ destinations would require either multiple major carriers returning with several routes each, or numerous smaller carriers adding point-to-point service. Neither seems probable given the cautious industry approach, regional security concerns, and short timeframe. While the summer season traditionally sees route additions, the scale of recovery needed (8+ destinations in 6 weeks from an already-depressed base) exceeds what the available evidence supports. I would update higher if major carriers announced multiple route resumptions in the coming days, or if security/political conditions dramatically improved. I would update lower if announced routes were delayed or if current destination counts were confirmed to be below 39.",
