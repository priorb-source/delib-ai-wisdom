    "review": "Both forecasters make solid, methodical cases grounded in Morning Consult’s 7‑day SMA, short-horizon inertia, and the tie-resolves-No rule. I didn’t see new hard data, but I found their emphasis on (a) the likely current ordering (Ishiba ≥ Starmer), (b) the small plausible month-to-month movement, and (c) the extra headwind from ties persuasive. Forecaster 3’s explicit enumeration of event risks (yen/BoJ/LDP headlines vs. potential UK-positive developments) is reasonable but balanced; it doesn’t tilt me toward a higher Yes. Overall, their arguments slightly strengthen the case that No is modestly favored absent a shock.",
    "rationale": "Time to resolution is about one month, and Morning Consult’s 7-day moving average dampens late-breaking moves. Starmer’s approval since late 2024 has been respectable but not dominant by Morning Consult standards; Japanese PMs often start higher and then drift down over time. The most plausible current state is Ishiba modestly ahead or roughly comparable. Given typical month-ahead volatility (on the order of a few points) and the tie-as-No rule, the base case favors No. A Yes requires either a small Starmer uptick or an Ishiba dip; both are plausible but not more likely than the status quo holding. I previously had 42%. After weighing the two aligned peer views emphasizing the same inertial and tie-rule dynamics, I’m trimming slightly to reflect the modest additional headwinds and the value of independent concurrence.",
