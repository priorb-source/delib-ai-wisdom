    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Approximately 26-32 days until resolution (July 1-7, 2025)",
    "status_quo_outcome": "Yes - All seven countries (China, Iran, Myanmar, North Korea, Russia, Turkmenistan, and Venezuela) continue to block X/Twitter and Wikipedia continues to list them as doing so",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "At least one of the seven countries unblocks X/Twitter before July 1, 2025, or Wikipedia updates its article to remove at least one country from the 'currently blocked' list. Most likely candidate would be Venezuela, which has shown more volatility in social media policy, or possibly a surprise policy shift in another country.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "All seven countries maintain their existing blocks on X/Twitter through the end of June 2025, and Wikipedia's article continues to accurately reflect this status quo with all seven countries listed as currently blocking access.",
    "rationale": "The status quo strongly favors a Yes resolution. All seven listed countries have well-established, long-standing blocks on X/Twitter: China (since ~2009), Iran (since ~2009), Myanmar (since 2021 coup), North Korea (comprehensive internet restrictions), Russia (since March 2022 invasion of Ukraine), Turkmenistan (highly restrictive internet environment), and Venezuela (intermittent but currently maintained blocks). These are authoritarian or semi-authoritarian regimes with entrenched censorship policies and institutional mechanisms for maintaining internet controls. The timeframe is extremely short (less than one month), which significantly reduces the probability of major policy reversals. Internet censorship policy changes typically require political shifts or deliberate policy decisions that don't happen overnight. No credible signals suggest any of these countries are considering unblocking X/Twitter in the immediate future. The main risk factors are: (1) Venezuela has the most volatile social media policy among these seven and could potentially reverse course, though this remains unlikely in such a short timeframe; (2) unexpected political developments could theoretically occur in any country; (3) Wikipedia editing practices could create edge cases, though the question includes provisions for edit wars and lack of consensus. My forecast is not higher (e.g., 98-99%) because there remains some small but non-negligible probability of an unexpected policy change, particularly from Venezuela, or Wikipedia-specific issues. It's not lower because the status quo is very strong, the timeframe is very short, and all seven countries have demonstrated sustained commitment to blocking X/Twitter with no recent indications of policy shifts. For me to update higher, I would need to see explicit statements from all seven governments reaffirming their blocks. To update lower, I would need credible reports of policy discussions about unblocking X/Twitter in one or more of these countries.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nAt the end of June 2025, will Wikipedia still list all these countries as \"currently\" blocking access to X (formerly Twitter)?\n\nQuestion background:\nAccording to the resolution source, \"Censorship of Twitter refers to Internet censorship by governments that block access to Twitter (officially known as X since July 2023). Twitter censorship also includes governmental notice and take down requests to Twitter, which it enforces in accordance with its Terms of Service when a government or authority submits a valid removal request to Twitter indicating that specific content published on the platform is illegal in their jurisdiction.\"\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if Wikipedia still lists X (formerly known as Twitter) as currently blocked in China, Iran, Myanmar, North Korea, Russia, Turkmenistan and Venezuela at [this link](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Censorship_of_Twitter#Current) when accessed by Metaculus on or after July 1, 2025. If the Wikipedia article does not list X as currently being blocked in any of those countries, this question resolves as **No**.\n\nThe question will resolve as soon as the page is accessed by Metaculus Admins on the resolution date. However, if there are issues accessing the page, then resolution will wait up to July 7, 2025, at which point if Metaculus has still not been able to access the resolution source, this question will be **annulled**. Admins will also use their discretion if there appears to be an [edit war](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Edit_warring) or lack of Wikipedia [consensus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Consensus) and may annul the question in such a case; however, Admins will also strive to resolve the question as definitively Yes or No, and such an edge case should be considered a rare outcome.\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nNo additional information available.\n\nToday is 2025-06-05.\n\nBefore answering you think:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n(e) You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
