    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "26 days (until July 1, 2025)",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No - Casey DeSantis has not announced her candidacy yet",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Casey DeSantis does not announce her candidacy before July 1, 2025, either because she decides not to run given the unfavorable polling showing Byron Donalds leading with Trump's endorsement, or she delays any announcement until after the deadline to better assess the political landscape and potentially adjust her strategy.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Casey DeSantis announces her candidacy in the next 26 days, possibly feeling that she needs to enter the race now to build momentum and counter Byron Donalds' surge, or believing that an early announcement will help her compete despite Trump's endorsement of her opponent.",
    "rationale": "With only 26 days remaining until the July 1 deadline, and no indication that Casey DeSantis has announced or is imminently planning to announce, the status quo strongly favors a 'No' outcome. The poll referenced shows Byron Donalds surging ahead with Trump's backing, which creates significant headwinds for any potential DeSantis candidacy. Trump's endorsement of a rival candidate is particularly meaningful in Florida Republican politics. While 26 days provides sufficient time for a formal announcement, the unfavorable political dynamics suggest she may either decide not to run at all or delay any announcement to assess whether the race becomes more favorable. The lack of any reporting about an imminent announcement, combined with the polling disadvantage, suggests she is either not running or waiting. My forecast is not higher because of the unfavorable polling, Trump's backing of a rival, and absence of signals about an imminent announcement. It's not lower because 26 days remains adequate time for a political announcement, and political calculations can change quickly - she might decide that announcing sooner rather than later is strategically necessary. I would update higher if reporting emerged about campaign staff being hired, announcement events being scheduled, or statements suggesting imminent candidacy. I would update lower as we get closer to July 1 without any such signals.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill Casey DeSantis announce her candidacy for Florida governor before July 1, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\n[Poll: Trump's endorsement boosts Byron Donalds over Casey DeSantis for Florida governor](https://www.tallahassee.com/story/news/local/state/2025/05/09/poll-byron-donalds-surges-past-casey-desantis-with-trump-backing/83412367007/)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if Casey DeSantis announces her candidacy for governor of Florida before July 1, 2025. If no such announcement has been made before that date, the question resolves as **No**.\n\n\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nNo additional information available.\n\nToday is 2025-06-05.\n\nBefore answering you think:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n(e) You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
