    "review": "All three forecasters agree on the primary factors pointing towards a 'No' resolution: the website is currently offline, the administration has a clear and hostile policy towards climate initiatives, specific dismantling actions (funding cuts, program cancellations) have been taken, and historical precedent suggests such websites remain offline for long periods. My initial forecast was 5%, while the others were slightly higher at 8% and 10%.\n\nForecaster 2's analysis was strong and reinforced my initial thinking, highlighting the short timeframe and the four months the site has already been down. However, it was Forecaster 3's analysis that I found most compelling and which prompted a revision of my forecast. \n\nForecaster 3 introduced a crucial point I had overlooked: the resolution resolves 'Yes' if the site is merely 'online,' which could be satisfied by a minimal placeholder page, an archive banner, or a redirect. This is a low-cost action the DoD could take to mitigate political criticism from the upcoming June Senate hearings without actually reversing their policy or restoring substantive content. This 'cosmetic restoration' scenario provides a plausible pathway to a 'Yes' outcome that I had not previously considered.",
    "rationale": "I am updating my initial forecast from 5% to 10%. My original reasoning was predicated on the assumption that a 'Yes' resolution would require a significant policy reversal by the administration, which I correctly assessed as highly unlikely. The arguments against a full restoration remain powerful: the administration's explicit anti-climate rhetoric, the cutting of funds, and historical precedent all strongly suggest the site will remain offline.\n\nHowever, I was convinced by Forecaster 3's argument that the resolution criteria can be met by a simple, cosmetic change. The upcoming Senate hearings in June provide a direct catalyst for such an action. The administration may find it politically expedient to restore a minimal placeholder page to defuse criticism, effectively resolving the question as 'Yes' without undermining their broader policy. This is a far more plausible scenario than a full policy reversal. Therefore, I am doubling my forecast to account for this possibility, bringing my probability in line with the other forecasters. The probability remains low because the administration may still choose to ignore the political pressure and leave the site offline, which remains the most likely outcome.",
