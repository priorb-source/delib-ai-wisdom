  "information": "According to Taiwo Oyedele, the Chairman of the Presidential Committee on Fiscal Policy and Tax Reforms, the proposed Tax Reform Bill includes a provision to exempt real estate transactions from Value Added Tax (VAT). Official statements indicate the bill also contains exemptions on stamp duties for rents below N10 million per month and capital gains tax on the sale of dwelling houses. The stated purpose of these reforms is to reduce the tax burden on the construction and real estate sectors, thereby lowering housing costs and improving affordability for low-income earners.\n\nAs of late April 2025, reports indicated that the Tax Reform Bill had been passed by the Nigerian House of Representatives and was awaiting approval from the Senate before requiring presidential assent. Taiwo Oyedele, Chairman of the Presidential Tax Reform Committee, had stated in January 2025 that the bills were expected to be passed into law in the first quarter of 2025, with implementation scheduled to begin on July 1, 2025. The Q1 2025 deadline for passage has been missed.\n\nThe proposed VAT exemption has received public support from Ahmed Dangiwa, the Minister of Housing and Urban Development, as well as from industry groups like the Council of Registered Builders of Nigeria (CORBON) and the Housing Development Advocacy Network (HDAN). However, the broader tax reform package faces opposition from labor unions. The President of the Trade Union Congress (TUC), Festus Osifo, described the bills as 'anti-worker,' with union objections focusing on provisions such as the minimum taxable income and the proposed scrapping of the Tertiary Education Trust Fund (TETFUND).",

    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "About 8 weeks (≈56 days), until July 1, 2025",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No — the legislation is not enacted by July 1, 2025, and the reform slips past the target date.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "The Senate slows consideration or substantially amends the tax package; the VAT exemption is stripped or becomes a point of contention; harmonization between chambers drags into July; or the President delays assent past June. A fallback executive directive can’t substitute for legislation, so the question resolves No.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "The Senate passes the Tax Reform Bill in May/June with the VAT exemption intact, both chambers quickly harmonize any differences, and the President assents in late June with immediate gazetting, making the exemption law before July 1.",
    "rationale": "Evidence suggests meaningful momentum but with a tight timeline. Reports indicate the House has passed the Tax Reform Bill and the Senate’s approval plus presidential assent remain. The VAT exemption for real estate is a clearly articulated element of the package, has ministerial and industry support, and is politically easier than some revenue-raising items. The committee’s target implementation date is July 1, implying executive interest in pre‑July enactment and potential for accelerated Senate action. Countervailing factors include the missed Q1 passage target, organized labor’s opposition to parts of the broader package, possible Senate amendments that trigger time‑consuming harmonization, and Nigeria’s frequent slippage on reform timelines. The exemption could also be traded off if revenue concerns rise, or passage could slide into July even if largely agreed. I weight the status quo (no enactment by deadline) meaningfully, but the reported House passage and executive priority justify odds near-even or slightly favorable. I’m not higher because of the short runway, multi-bill complexity, and political noise around the wider reforms. I’m not lower because the remaining procedural steps can move quickly when prioritized, and the VAT exemption itself is relatively uncontroversial and aligned with the administration’s housing affordability push. I would update up if: the Senate committee reports the bill and it is scheduled for second/third readings within May, public statements from Senate leadership signal accelerated passage, or the Presidency requests urgent assent and harmonization committees are constituted promptly. I would update down if: Senate hearings slip into June without a timetable, union pushback broadens to governing party senators, leadership hints at decoupling or deferring the tax package, or the Assembly schedules a recess that compresses floor time.",

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any).
