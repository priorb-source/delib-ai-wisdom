    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "About 39 days (the qualifying window is May 12–June 15, 2025; today is May 7, 2025).",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Communications are handled via envoys and cabinet-level channels (e.g., diplomacy through foreign/commerce/treasury officials) and public statements. If Trump claims a call but Beijing does not confirm (or vice versa), it does not count under the “both sides acknowledge” rule, resulting in No.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "A tariff/trade, security, or crisis-driven need prompts an officially arranged leader-level call. The White House and China’s MFA release readouts acknowledging the call sometime between May 12 and June 15, 2025.",
    "rationale": "- Baseline: Leader-to-leader US–China calls are relatively infrequent and often clustered around major events (negotiations/crises). Over any given 4–5 week span, the base rate of a publicly acknowledged call is modest.\n- Narrow window: Only 34 eligible days (May 12–June 15). Without a clear, looming catalyst, the status quo favors no call in such a short period.\n- Acknowledgment requirement: Both sides must acknowledge the call. Historically, there have been instances where one side (often the U.S.) suggests contact while Beijing publicly denies or stays silent. That added constraint lowers the chance of a resolving “Yes.” The CBS item provided highlights this coordination gap risk.\n- Incentives for a call: Elevated tariffs/trade decisions, tech restrictions, Taiwan/sea/air incidents, or a broader reset could create pressure for a leader call. Trump’s more ad hoc communication style and preference for top-level engagement raise the tail risk of a sudden call. Both capitals also know markets and allies watch these signals; if they do speak, official readouts are likely—satisfying the criterion.\n- Why not higher: No clear scheduled trigger (e.g., summit lead-in, announced negotiating round) and the short window argue against a call. The recent pattern alluded to in the background—claims of contact with Chinese denials—specifically reduces the probability of a mutually acknowledged call.\n- Why not lower: US–China relations are high-stakes; even a single flare-up or tariff announcement could spur direct leader engagement on short notice. Trump has precedent for rapid outreach, and Beijing has, at times, reciprocated with formal readouts when it suits their interests.\n- What would move me up: Credible reports of a call being planned; significant tariff moves with signals of leader-level engagement; high-level shuttle diplomacy followed by leaks about a possible leaders’ call; crisis/incident in the Taiwan Strait or South China Sea; coordinated pre-briefs to press on a prospective call.\n- What would move me down: Explicit statements that Beijing is refusing leader-level contact; repeated denials after fresh U.S. claims of calls; visible reliance on ministerial channels with messaging that leader calls are “not appropriate now.”\n- Research assistant input: No additional info available; thus the forecast leans on base rates, structural incentives, and the public-acknowledgment constraint.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill Donald Trump and Xi Jinping speak on the phone with each other before June 15, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nCBS News: [Trump says he's talked with Xi about tariffs. China has denied talks are taking place](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/trump-xi-china-tariffs/)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if, after May 12, 2025 and before June 15, 2025, Donald Trump and Xi Jinping speak on the phone with each other, according to [credible sources](https://www.metaculus.com/faq/#definitions).\n\nBoth sides must acknowledge the phone call took place for it to count. \"Speak on the phone with each other\" is defined as both individuals, from different physical spaces, orally uttering words intended for the other individual into a telephone or equivalent device, those words being converted into electrical or digital signals in real time, and then transferred to the other individual via telecommunications links, where they are reconverted into sound waves at the other individual's listening device.\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nNo additional information available.\n\nToday is 2025-05-07.\n\nBefore answering you think:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n(e) You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
