  "information": "The recall was issued on February 24, 2025. According to the FSIS recall webpage, the status of the recall remained 'Active' as of May 8, 2025. The general FSIS process for closing a recall requires verification that all affected product has been accounted for and removed from commerce, and confirmation that the company has implemented appropriate corrective actions to prevent a recurrence.",

    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "About 23 days (until June 1, 2025)",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No — the recall remains listed as Active on the FSIS page when checked on or after June 1, 2025.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "FSIS has not completed verification that all affected product was accounted for/removed, or is awaiting documentation of corrective actions; the webpage remains Active through May 31 due to process or update lag.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "LPK1 demonstrates all product was recovered/controlled and corrective labeling controls are in place; FSIS completes effectiveness checks and updates the recall to Closed in mid-to-late May.",
    "rationale": "As of May 8, the FSIS recall status is still Active. There are roughly three weeks left for the status to change to Closed before June 1. FSIS typically closes recalls after verifying product disposition and corrective actions. For small, contained misbranding/undeclared allergen recalls, closure often occurs within a few months, but many cases remain Active for several months due to verification and administrative timing.\n\nKey considerations:\n- Baseline timing: This recall was posted Feb 24, so it will be about 95–100 days old by May 31. Many FSIS misbranding/allergen recalls close in the 2–4 month range, which makes closure by late May plausible but far from assured.\n- Status quo weight: It is still Active as of May 8. With only ~23 days remaining, the default outcome drifts toward No unless an administrative close happens soon. Government site update cadence can add delay even if field work is done.\n- Case specifics: Limited distribution (vending machines in Washington) and a small volume favor faster accounting. No illnesses reported and straightforward corrective actions also support the possibility of a near-term closure.\n\nWhy not higher: The page remains Active with little time left; FSIS closures often slip into the 3–6 month window, and bureaucratic update lags can push a closure past the deadline even if work is nearly complete.\nWhy not lower: The recall is small and targeted; by ~3 months post-initiation, many such cases do close, so a mid-to-late May closure is credibly on the table.\n\nWhat would move me up: Any FSIS update indicating effectiveness checks completed, firm corrective actions verified, or a pattern of similar small recalls closing around the 90–100 day mark in recent weeks. Direct confirmation from the firm or FSIS that all product is accounted for.\nWhat would move me down: An expanded recall scope, additional distribution identified, delayed consignee responses, or any sign of corrective action gaps or investigation extensions.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill the USDA-posted recall by LPK1 of its ready-to-eat chicken caesar wrap for misbranding and an undeclared allergen issued February 24, 2025 be closed before June 1, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nFood Safety News: [Chicken Caesar wraps sold in vending machines in Washington recalled over undeclared fish](https://www.foodsafetynews.com/2025/02/chicken-caesar-wraps-sold-in-veding-machines-in-washington-recalled-over-undeclared-fish/)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if the status of the recall posted by the U.S. Department of Agriculture’s Food Safety and Inspection Service (FSIS) is changed from Active to Closed on [this page](https://www.fsis.usda.gov/recalls-alerts/lpk1-recalls-ready-eat-chicken-caesar-wrap-products-due-misbranding-and-undeclared) before June 1, 2025. If the recall is still shown as Active when the link is accessed by Metaculus on or after that date, this question resolves as **No**.\n\n\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nThe recall was issued on February 24, 2025. According to the FSIS recall webpage, the status of the recall remained 'Active' as of May 8, 2025. The general FSIS process for closing a recall requires verification that all affected product has been accounted for and removed from commerce, and confirmation that the company has implemented appropriate corrective actions to prevent a recurrence.\n\nToday is 2025-05-08.\n\nBefore answering you think:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n(e) You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
