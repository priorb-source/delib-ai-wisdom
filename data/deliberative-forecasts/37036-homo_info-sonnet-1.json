    "review": "Both forecasters raised compelling points I underweighted. Forecaster 3's most critical insight is that Osborn reportedly said he'd decide by 'early summer' - and June 1 is technically late spring (summer solstice is June 20-21). This timing signal, combined with Forecaster 3's observation that Osborn announced in July 2023 for his 2024 race (16 months out), suggests a June-July 2025 announcement for 2026 is more likely, placing it AFTER the resolution date. Forecaster 2's emphasis on status quo bias and the lack of urgency 19 months before an election are also well-taken. I was overly optimistic about the urgency of his exploratory phase. However, I don't fully agree with going as low as 30% because 'early summer' is imprecise language that could include late May, political circumstances can shift timelines, and 38 days remains meaningful decision-making time.",
    "rationale": "Upon reflection, I gave insufficient weight to three key factors: (1) Osborn's own 'early summer' timeline strongly suggests he's planning for June-July, which would be after June 1; (2) His historical pattern of announcing in July 2023 for the 2024 race suggests a similar June-July 2025 timeline for 2026; (3) There's genuinely no urgency to announce 19 months before an election. While I maintain that Osborn appears likely to run eventually given his active exploration, PAC formation, and messaging preparation, the specific question is about announcement BEFORE June 1. The temporal evidence points toward a later announcement. I'm revising downward significantly from 65% but not going as low as 30% because language ambiguity and potential timeline shifts create meaningful uncertainty. I'm settling near 40% as a middle ground that respects both the strong temporal signals favoring a post-June 1 announcement and the remaining uncertainty in political timelines.",
