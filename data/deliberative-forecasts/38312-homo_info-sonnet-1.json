    "review": "Both forecasters raise important points I hadn't fully considered. Forecaster 2 notes that new PM Carney and Modi have exchanged positive messages about strengthening ties, and that other G7 members might pressure Canada to include India - these are plausible mechanisms for a last-minute invitation. Forecaster 3 makes a crucial base rate observation that India has traditionally been invited as an outreach partner to recent G7 summits, which I underweighted. However, Forecaster 3 also introduces a significant counterpoint I missed: Sikh organizations in Canada are actively lobbying Carney against inviting Modi, creating substantial domestic political cost. This active opposition, combined with the Nijjar murder allegations, makes the political environment particularly difficult for Carney to extend an invitation. Both forecasters converge on 12%, suggesting I may be slightly too pessimistic at 7%. The historical precedent of Indian invitations and positive recent diplomatic signals between the leaders do warrant some upward adjustment. However, I believe 12% may slightly underweight the combination of: (1) active organized opposition to Modi's attendance, (2) the extremely compressed 12-day timeline with zero current preparations, and (3) the diplomatic awkwardness of a last-minute invitation after inviting multiple other countries first.",
    "rationale": "After considering the other forecasters' analyses, I'm updating my forecast modestly upward from 7% to 9%. The key arguments that persuaded me to adjust include: (1) India's historical status as a traditional invitee to recent G7 summits provides a stronger base rate than I initially weighted, (2) the positive diplomatic signals between Carney and Modi suggest some willingness for engagement, and (3) the possibility of other G7 members pressuring Canada to include India is a realistic mechanism I underconsidered. However, I'm not moving all the way to 12% because the other forecasters may be underweighting the significance of active Sikh organizational lobbying against Modi's attendance, which creates substantial domestic political cost for Carney. Combined with only 12 days remaining, no current invitation, no security preparations underway, and the diplomatic awkwardness of issuing a last-minute invitation after already inviting Australia, Ukraine, South Africa, and Brazil, the barriers remain formidable. A 9% forecast reflects that attendance is highly unlikely but acknowledges slightly better odds than my initial assessment given the valid base rate and diplomatic mechanism arguments.",
