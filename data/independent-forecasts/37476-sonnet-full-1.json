  "information": "GoPro's financial results for 2024 showed a full-year revenue of $801 million, a 20% decline year-over-year, with a net loss of $432 million, or $2.82 per share. As of December 31, 2024, the company held $283 million in cash reserves against $131 million in debt. The company's current ratio was reported at 0.5, and its market capitalization was approximately $90.68 million as of May 1, 2025, with a stock price of $0.58.\n\nFor its upcoming first quarter 2025 earnings report, scheduled for May 12, 2025, analysts expect GoPro to report a quarterly loss of approximately $0.13 per share on revenues of around $124.9 million, which would represent a year-over-year revenue decline of about 19.6%. The company itself has stated it expects unit sales and revenue in 2025 to be lower than in 2024, citing macroeconomic headwinds and competition. In response, the company has initiated plans to reduce operating expenses by nearly 30% during 2025.\n\nIn early 2025, GoPro announced it was named the official camera of the 2025 Freeride World Tour for the 12th consecutive year. The company also released a minor upgrade to its GoPro Max panoramic camera in February 2025. Reports in May 2025 also noted the release of a new GoPro Hero13 camera featuring an anamorphic lens. The company's most significant debt maturity is a convertible note due in November 2025.",

    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Approximately 53 days until July 1, 2025",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No bankruptcy filing. Companies typically continue operations unless forced into bankruptcy by immediate liquidity crises or inability to meet obligations.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "GoPro continues operations through July 1, 2025, managing its cash reserves of $283 million to cover ongoing losses. The company successfully implements its 30% operating expense reduction plan, potentially refinances or extends its November 2025 convertible note, and explores strategic alternatives like asset sales or partnerships. The Q1 2025 earnings on May 12 come in at or better than expected, providing some stability.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "GoPro faces an unexpected liquidity crisis in the next 53 days. A major covenant breach, supplier demands for immediate payment, or loss of a critical credit facility forces the company's hand. The Q1 2025 results reveal worse-than-expected cash burn, and attempts to raise emergency capital or refinance debt fail. With current liabilities mounting and unable to meet immediate obligations, management files for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection to restructure.",
    "rationale": "GoPro is clearly in financial distress with concerning indicators: a current ratio of 0.5, massive 2024 net loss of $432 million, declining revenues (down 20% in 2024, expected down 19.6% in Q1 2025), and a tiny market cap of ~$91 million with stock at $0.58. However, several factors make bankruptcy in the next 53 days unlikely. First, GoPro holds $283 million in cash against $131 million in debt - a positive net cash position. At the expected Q1 loss rate (~$20 million per quarter), they have several quarters of runway. Second, there are no immediate debt maturities before July 1; the major convertible note doesn't mature until November 2025. Third, the company is proactively cutting 30% of operating expenses and still releasing products, suggesting management believes they can survive. Bankruptcy is typically a last resort after exhausting alternatives like refinancing, asset sales, or equity raises. While GoPro may face significant challenges later in 2025 (especially around the November debt maturity), the combination of adequate near-term cash, no imminent obligations, and the short 53-day window makes a bankruptcy filing unlikely in this timeframe. The status quo heavily favors continued operations. I would update higher if we see covenant breaches, failed financing attempts, or catastrophic Q1 results on May 12. I would update lower with successful capital raises, debt refinancing announcements, or better-than-expected results.",

These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question will resolve as **Yes** if GoPro, Inc., files any petition for bankruptcy protection in the United States, under any chapter of the United States Bankruptcy Code, before July 1, 2025. The question will resolves on the filing of such a petition, not on whether any bankruptcy protection is granted by a court.
