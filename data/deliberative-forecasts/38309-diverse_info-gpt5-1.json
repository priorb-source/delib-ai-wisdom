    "review": "New, specific evidence surfaced in their analyses that I hadn’t incorporated: (1) a sustained and sizable fundraising edge for Jones (roughly 2:1 cumulatively, with strong cash-on-hand late), and (2) heavyweight endorsements (McAuliffe, Northam, Rep. Bobby Scott) signaling establishment consolidation. Both are materially relevant in a low-turnout, two-way statewide primary. I find their reasoning broadly convincing: late cash and unified endorsements often translate to field strength and voter contact advantages. I remain cautious because there’s still no credible public polling and Taylor is well-funded enough to compete, with a plausible base in NOVA/Richmond suburbs. I weigh Forecaster 2’s fundraising argument highly but not to the 70s without polling; I find Forecaster 3’s endorsement thesis persuasive and consistent with typical primary dynamics.",
    "rationale": "Baseline: I previously had Jones narrowly favored on fundamentals (prior statewide run/name ID, strong base among Black Democrats, clear regional base in Hampton Roads) but noted uncertainty on turnout composition and lack of polling. The added evidence—if accurate—of a multi-quarter fundraising advantage and substantial cash-on-hand two weeks out increases the likelihood that Jones can dominate late voter contact and GOTV. The reported endorsements from former governors and Rep. Bobby Scott further suggest party coalescence and institutional muscle behind Jones, which historically boosts primary performance. Countervailing risks remain: no public polling to validate conversion of resources to votes; Taylor’s credibility, prosecutorial profile, and potential strength with suburban primary voters; and turnout uncertainty tied to concurrent top-of-ticket primaries that could alter regional/demographic mix. Net: I update modestly upward, reflecting stronger late-campaign fundamentals for Jones while respecting residual uncertainty. I would move higher with corroborated polling showing a lead or clear evidence of Jones outspending/out-organizing in NOVA; lower with polling showing a dead heat or Taylor lead, or notable late endorsements breaking her way.",
