    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "About 23 days (final result expected Friday, June 27, 2025)",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No — the June 2025 Final Index of Consumer Sentiment is ≥ 54.0",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "June preliminary prints in the 60s (or high 50s) and the final revises only marginally, reflecting steady labor markets, no major shock to gasoline prices or equities, and inflation data that are not meaningfully hotter than expected.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "A fresh, negative shock pushes the index into the low 50s: e.g., a surprise, hot CPI print and/or tariff escalation that spikes inflation expectations, a sharp equity selloff, a notable rise in gas prices, and/or very weak labor data. Preliminary sentiment lands near the mid-50s and the final is ≤ 53.9.",
    "rationale": "Baseline dynamics favor a No. The University of Michigan index, while volatile, rarely drops into the low 50s absent acute stress (e.g., 1980, 2008–09, mid-2022). Crossing below 54 from recent levels would likely require either a very large one-month decline or a continuation of an already severe slide. The Axios piece signals a recent plunge, likely tied to tariff/inflation concerns, which raises downside risk. However, even sizeable monthly declines typically leave the index in the high 50s/60s rather than sub-54, and the Final reading usually differs little from the Preliminary. Key watch items before the Final: (1) June preliminary sentiment (mid-month) — this will anchor the plausible final range; (2) May CPI on June 12 and the June FOMC tone — a hot print or hawkish surprise could dent expectations; (3) June 7 jobs report and weekly claims; (4) gasoline prices and equity market moves; (5) any concrete tariff escalation headlines. My forecast is not higher because May’s deterioration and policy/inflation uncertainty increase the tail risk of another leg down. It’s not lower because, given base rates and typical month-to-month volatility, dropping below 54 from recent readings would be historically unusual without a major shock. I would raise the probability if the June preliminary lands ≤ 56, if CPI surprises meaningfully hot with rising inflation expectations, or if markets/gas prices deteriorate sharply. I would lower it if preliminary stays ≥ 60, CPI is benign, and markets remain stable. The research assistant provided no additional information beyond the prompt.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill the June 2025 University of Michigan Consumer Sentiment Final Report number be less than 54.0?\n\nQuestion background:\nAxios: [Why the consumer sentiment plunge is different now](https://www.axios.com/2025/05/19/tariffs-consumer-economy-sentiment)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if the University of Michigan's reported June Final Results of the Index of Consumer Sentiment, expected to be posted [here](https://data.sca.isr.umich.edu/reports.php) on the final Friday of June 2025, is less than 54.0 for June 2025. Greater than or equal to that amount resolves the question as **No**.\n\n\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nNo additional information available.\n\nToday is 2025-06-04.\n\nBefore answering you think:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n(e) You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
