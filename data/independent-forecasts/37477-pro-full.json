  "information": "Executives from major publishers, including The New York Times and News Corp, stated confidence in their businesses' ability to grow despite economic uncertainties from tariffs. In Q1 2025, The New York Times reported a 12% growth in digital advertising revenue, while most other publishers saw flat revenue. New York Times executives described the impact of tariffs as 'immaterial.' This contrasts with a survey indicating 54% of marketers plan to reduce their 2025 budgets due to tariff concerns. Following a Federal Reserve statement that it would wait for the full impact of tariffs before making decisions, communications-services stocks declined, though The New York Times and Walt Disney posted positive results.\n\nThe Wall Street Journal's editorial board described a trade deal with the United Kingdom as a step towards unwinding the trade war, writing that the economic damage from tariffs was proving politically risky. The board also has stated that the tariff policy has shaken global confidence in U.S. reliability and called it a 'true gift' to Chinese President Xi Jinping. In April 2025, President Trump suggested tariffs could replace income taxes, a claim that a Wall Street Journal reporter noted reasons to be skeptical of. Following the implementation of tariffs, the Treasury Department raised its borrowing projection for the April-June 2025 quarter to an estimated net marketable borrowing of $514 billion.\n\nAn executive order signed on April 2, 2025, imposes a 10% 'minimum benchmark tariff' on all trade partners, with higher tariffs on certain partners. Reports since the order indicate a 'precautionary consumption' trend in the US, with consumers stockpiling goods. The arrival of container ships from China, which supplies 77% of toys sold in the US, has reportedly fallen by 50%. In March 2025, the Cortland Standard, a 147-year-old newspaper in New York, ceased publication, citing rising costs, including a 25% tariff on newsprint from Canada, as a contributing factor.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "23 days, until June 1, 2025.",
    "status_quo_outcome": "Tariffs remain a dominant political and economic news story, appearing frequently on the front pages of both The New York Times and the Wall Street Journal.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "The tariff story remains so prominent, due to new developments, political speeches, or significant market reactions, that it appears on the front page of at least one of the two newspapers every single day for the entire resolution period (until June 1, 2025).",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "On at least one day during the 23-day period, another major news event (e.g., a natural disaster, a different political scandal, a major international incident) dominates the news cycle, pushing the tariff story off the front page of both newspapers simultaneously. This could also occur on a weekend, when news cycles are often slower.",
    "rationale": "This forecast hinges on the high bar required for a 'No' resolution. For a 'No' outcome, the word 'tariff(s)' must appear on the front page of at least one of the two specified newspapers every single day for 23 consecutive days (May 9 - May 31, 2025). A 'Yes' outcome requires only a single day where the word is absent from both. The research indicates that tariffs are a major, ongoing story due to a recent executive order and presidential comments, making frequent front-page appearances highly likely. However, maintaining an unbroken 23-day streak is improbable for any single news topic. News cycles are volatile, and other major domestic or international events can unexpectedly dominate headlines. The 23-day window includes three weekends, which often have different editorial priorities and could provide a day for the story to be absent from both front pages. A simple probabilistic model illustrates this: even if we assume a 94% chance that the story makes it to at least one front page on any given day, the probability of this happening for 23 consecutive days is only about 25%. Therefore, there is a 75% chance of at least one 'break' in the streak, leading to a 'Yes' outcome. My forecast is not higher because the tariff story is exceptionally dominant and multifaceted, increasing its staying power. It is not lower because 23 days is a long period in news cycles, making an unbroken streak of coverage statistically unlikely. I would lower my probability for 'Yes' if a series of daily, escalating tariff-related events were to occur. I would raise it if another major, non-tariff news story broke that was guaranteed to consume media attention for several days.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill the word \"tariff(s)\" disappear from the front print pages of The New York Times and Wall Street Journal by June 1, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nWhether reading the newspaper or social media or watching the news, it is highly likely you are going to see something about tariffs - mainly due to US President Donald Trump's renewed love for this somewhat antiquated form of taxation.\n\nThe New York Times and the Wall Street Journal are two of the largest print newspapers in the US. When, if ever, will we seen tariffs wiped from the front pages of both papers?\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question will resolve to \"Yes\" if, after \\[OPEN DATE] and before June 1, 2025, the words, \"tariff\" or \"tariffs\", do not appear on the print front page of The New York Times and the Wall Street Journal.

Format is: yyyy-mm-dd.</sup>\n\nGrammar is not relevant (e.g. \"TARIFF\" will suffice to prevent a \"No\" resolution).\n\n\"Tariff(s)\" must be omitted from both papers' front pages on the same day.\n\n\"Tariff(s)\" can appear anywhere on the page, it does not have to be in a title.\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nExecutives from major publishers, including The New York Times and News Corp, stated confidence in their businesses' ability to grow despite economic uncertainties from tariffs.

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
