  "information": "A lobbying scandal involving Huawei has led to a probe by Belgian prosecutors. On June 5, 2025, EPP MEP Fulvio Martusciello was arrested in connection with the investigation. Authorities have also requested that the parliamentary immunity be lifted for at least four other MEPs. The Parliament's Committee on Legal Affairs was expected to vote on these immunity waivers in mid-June, with the full plenary potentially confirming the decision during its session from June 16-19. Citing the precedent set during the 'Qatargate' scandal, major political groups like the EPP, S&D, and Renew have signaled zero-tolerance positions on corruption.\n\nHistorically, the 705-seat European Parliament sees between 80 and 120 replacements over a five-year term, which averages to approximately 1-2 departures per month. This turnover can be due to a variety of reasons, including appointments to national posts, retirement, scandals, or health issues. The rate of departures is often higher during the first year of a new parliamentary term. Precedents from previous scandals are mixed; while events like 'Qatargate' did lead to resignations, some indicted MEPs, such as Eva Kaili and Marc Tarabella, resisted calls to step down for several months while legal proceedings were ongoing.\n\nResignations from the European Parliament frequently occur when a sitting MEP is appointed to a ministerial position within their national government. Following elections in several member states, new governments were in the process of being formed. Specifically, after the May 18 elections in Portugal, there were rumors that at least two MEPs were being considered for cabinet positions in the new government. Other countries, including Germany, the Netherlands, and Belgium, also had fluid political circumstances that could lead to cabinet reshuffles.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "26 days",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No MEP announces their resignation during the specified 21-day period, and the composition of the European Parliament remains unchanged from June 9.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "The MEPs implicated in the Huawei scandal, including the one arrested, refuse to resign while legal proceedings are ongoing, similar to precedents set in past scandals. Concurrently, any MEPs being considered for national government positions are either not appointed or their appointments are announced after the resolution date. No other MEPs resign for personal or health reasons within the timeframe.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "At least one MEP announces their resignation between June 10 and June 30, 2025. This could be driven by the Huawei scandal, where an implicated MEP resigns under intense political pressure following an immunity waiver vote. Alternatively, an MEP from a country like Portugal could be appointed to their national government and subsequently resign their parliamentary seat.",
    "rationale": "My forecast is based on three main factors: the baseline rate of resignations, the acute pressure from the Huawei lobbying scandal, and the potential for appointments to national governments. First, the historical base rate for MEP departures is 1-2 per month. In a 21-day forecast window during the first year of a new term (when turnover is often higher), this baseline alone suggests a non-trivial probability of a resignation. Second, the Huawei scandal is a significant catalyst. The arrest of one MEP and requests to lift the immunity of four others create immense pressure. With major political groups taking a 'zero-tolerance' stance, a resignation from at least one of these members is highly probable, especially following the planned immunity votes in mid-June. Third, there are credible reports of MEPs being considered for cabinet positions in newly forming national governments, particularly in Portugal. The timing of these government formations aligns with the forecast window. The convergence of these independent factors—a solid baseline rate, a major unfolding scandal, and concurrent national political appointments—makes it highly probable that at least one resignation will be announced before July 1. My forecast is not higher because legal and political processes can be slow; implicated MEPs may choose to fight to keep their seats, and government appointments can be delayed. It is not lower because ignoring the combined weight of these distinct and timely potential triggers would be an underestimation of the current political volatility.",
