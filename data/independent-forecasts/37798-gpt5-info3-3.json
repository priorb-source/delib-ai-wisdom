  "information": "Key offensive players for the Dodgers include Shohei Ohtani, who is batting .316 with 16 home runs, and Mookie Betts, who is batting .264. The pitching staff has been managing several injuries. Pitchers Tyler Glasnow and Blake Snell have been recovering from injuries, with Snell having been placed on the 60-day Injured List. The return of Clayton Kershaw is anticipated to bolster the rotation. Pitcher Tony Gonsolin, who holds a 2-0 record with a 2.81 ERA, recently had a start affected by a fingernail issue.",

    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "About 27 days (until June 15, 2025)",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "One of the other current elite teams (e.g., Yankees, Phillies, Orioles, Braves) posts a strong 18–8 type stretch while the Dodgers play closer to .550 ball amid pitching injuries, leaving LA second or third by a few thousandths in winning percentage when the standings are checked.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "The Dodgers continue to win at a ~.620–.660 clip over the next four weeks behind an elite offense (Ohtani/Betts) and adequate starting pitching depth; rivals stumble for a week or two, and LA holds or shares the best MLB winning percentage on June 15.",
    "rationale": "Baseline: With ~4 weeks to go, the identity of the single best winning percentage team on a specific date is volatile. Even for a league leader in mid‑May, the chance to still be number one by mid‑June is well below 50% because several teams are typically within a couple of games and small swings move the top spot.\n\nCurrent read: The assistant’s notes and linked article imply Los Angeles is performing very well despite pitching injuries (Ohtani raking, Betts solid; rotation managing injuries; Kershaw’s return approaching; Snell on the 60‑day IL). That profile is consistent with a true-talent top‑tier team likely to remain near the top of MLB. However, competing elites (AL East powers, Phillies/Braves) likely have comparable records around now, making the race for the best record tight.\n\nStatus‑quo weighting: The most common outcome is that the current multi‑team cluster remains a cluster; even if LA is tied or close to first today, the median path over ~25 games has enough randomness that another contender edges them by a point or two in winning percentage on the check date. Hence my status‑quo outcome is No, with a meaningful but not dominant Yes chance.\n\nWhy not higher: 1) Multiple comparable contenders mean LA must outperform all of them over the next month or at least avoid being edged by a rounding difference in MLB standings; 2) Ongoing rotation uncertainty (Snell out; Glasnow usage; Kershaw return timing) raises variance risk; 3) Exact-day resolution increases sensitivity to a single series right before June 15.\n\nWhy not lower: 1) Dodgers’ roster quality and depth, especially the offense led by Ohtani and Betts, supports a high floor; 2) Even with injuries, LA routinely sustains top‑five run differentials, which historically correlates with staying near the best record; 3) Kershaw’s potential return could stabilize the rotation in early/mid‑June.\n\nTies: The question text suggests ties for best winning percentage should count as Yes (they would still “have the highest” percent). If ties were excluded, I would trim a few points off this forecast.\n\nUpdate triggers:\n- Upward: By early June LA leads MLB by ~2+ games in the loss column or >.015 in win%, or Kershaw returns effectively and the staff stabilizes while a key rival loses a top starter—would move me toward 40–55%.\n- Downward: LA drops to the 3rd–5th best record by >.020 in win% behind a surging rival, or suffers another rotation injury—would move me toward 10–18%.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill the LA Dodgers have the highest winning percentage in the MLB on June 15, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nYahoo Sports: [Even as Dodgers navigate injuries and manage pitcher usage, the wins keep coming](https://sports.yahoo.com/mlb/article/even-as-dodgers-navigate-injuries-and-manage-pitcher-usage-the-wins-keep-coming-053322413.html)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if the Los Angeles Dodgers have the highest winning percentage in Major League Baseball according to the [MLB official standings](https://www.mlb.com/standings/) when checked by Metaculus on or after June 15, 2025.\n\nNo other resolution source will be used to resolve the question. Question resolves based on how the page appears when checked by a Metaculus Admin.\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nKey offensive players for the Dodgers include Shohei Ohtani, who is batting .316 with 16 home runs, and Mookie Betts, who is batting .264.

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
