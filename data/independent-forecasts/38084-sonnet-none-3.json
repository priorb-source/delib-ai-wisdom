    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "30 days until June 28, 2025",
    "status_quo_outcome": "Yes - drought conditions persist or worsen through late June",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Unexpected significant rainfall arrives in early June, or current drought conditions are more limited in geographic scope than headlines suggest, affecting fewer than 20 million residents. Drought conditions improve enough to drop below the 20 million threshold.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Current drought conditions persist through the dry season as California enters summer. The drought either already affects 20+ million residents and maintains that level, or expands geographically over the next 30 days to reach the threshold. No meaningful precipitation arrives to alleviate conditions.",
    "rationale": "The SF Gate article headline states California's drought has 'returned' and is 'already bad,' which is a strong signal. With only 30 days until resolution and California entering its typical dry summer season (June-September), conditions are unlikely to improve significantly. The threshold of 20 million represents approximately 51% of California's ~39 million population, which is substantial but plausible given the 'already bad' characterization. Key uncertainties: (1) I lack current exact figures from the Drought Monitor - the article suggests significant drought but doesn't specify how many residents are currently affected; (2) 'Already bad' is subjective and could mean various severity levels; (3) Drought can be patchy, so geographic distribution matters. Factors supporting a Yes outcome: dry season timing, short timeframe for change, article's alarming tone. Factors that could lead to No: if current conditions affect fewer than 20 million and don't expand rapidly, or if unusual early summer precipitation arrives. I would revise upward if I saw current Drought Monitor data showing conditions near or above 20 million. I would revise downward if forecasts showed significant precipitation systems approaching California or if the drought were more localized than suggested. The 30-day window favors status quo persistence.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill California have 20.0 million or more residents living in drought on June 28, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nSF Gate: [California's drought has returned — and it's already bad](https://www.sfgate.com/bayarea/article/california-drought-problem-20271547.php)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if Drought Monitor at [this link](https://www.drought.gov/states/california) lists greater than or equal to 20.0 million California residents in areas of drought, when the link is accessed by Metaculus on or after June 28, 2025. If the number is below that, this question resolves as **No**.\n\nThe question will resolve as soon as the page is accessed by Metaculus Admins on the resolution date. However, if there are issues accessing the page, then resolution will wait up until the end of the tournament's scoring at which point if Metaculus has still not been able to access the resolution source, this question will be **annulled**.\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nNo additional information available.\n\nToday is 2025-05-29.\n\nBefore answering you think:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n(e) You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
