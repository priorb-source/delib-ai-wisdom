    "review": "Forecaster 2's analysis closely mirrors my own reasoning and independently arrived at a similar conclusion (15% vs my 20%). Their framing of 'status quo bias' is particularly apt. However, Forecaster 3 made a critical temporal error - they stated 'with only one day remaining until the resolution date' when in fact we have 31 days (from May 31 to July 1). This fundamental mistake invalidates their 3% forecast, which was premised on impossibility within 24 hours rather than feasibility within one month. Forecaster 3's reasoning would be sound if the resolution date were tomorrow, but it's not.",
    "rationale": "After reviewing both analyses, I find strong convergence with Forecaster 2's reasoning while identifying a disqualifying error in Forecaster 3's temporal assessment. Forecaster 2 and I independently identified the same key factors: recent closure timing, serious security concerns (terrorism, arms smuggling), historical precedent of prolonged closures, absence of reported negotiations, and insufficient time for complex diplomatic resolution. The narrow band between 15% and 20% represents reasonable disagreement about calibration rather than substantive analytical differences. Forecaster 2's slightly more conservative 15% acknowledges that even emergency diplomatic interventions are rare, while my 20% gives marginally more weight to the possibility of rapid high-level political intervention or economic pressure forcing action. Given that two forecasters independently reached similar conclusions through parallel reasoning, and absent any new evidence of negotiations or progress, I'm making a modest adjustment toward Forecaster 2's position. This reflects appropriate epistemic humility when another expert reaches a similar but slightly lower estimate through sound reasoning.",
