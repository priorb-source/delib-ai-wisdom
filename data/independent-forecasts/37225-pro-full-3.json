  "information": "The most recent poll, conducted on April 22, 2025, projects the Progressive Reform Party (VHP) winning 29% of seats, the National Democratic Party (NDP) 24%, and the National Party of Suriname (NPS) 14%. An earlier poll from January 2025 showed the NDP at 54% and the VHP at 29%. The incumbent VHP, led by President Chandrikapersad Santokhi, aims to secure at least 26 of the 51 available seats in the National Assembly. The opposition NDP has publicly ruled out any post-election collaboration with the VHP.\n\nPositive economic factors for the incumbent VHP government include a reduction in inflation from 60% to 10%, compliance with an IMF program, and the signing of a Final Investment Decision with TotalEnergies for the Granmorgu oil field. The government also instituted a 15% salary increase for government employees and pensioners in 2024, with an additional 5% in January 2025. Conversely, negative factors include high public dissatisfaction, with 56% of the public dissatisfied with the current government and 66% believing the country is worse off than five years prior. The country faces persistent poverty and a $4 billion national debt. One report cited President Santokhi's approval rating at approximately 3%.\n\nThe general election is scheduled for May 25, 2025. A significant change in the electoral process is the shift to a National Proportional Representation system, which replaces the previous district-based system and will be used for the first time. The opposition is described as fragmented. The NDP is facing challenges after the death of former leader Desi Bouterse. Some smaller parties, including the Sociaal Democratische Unie (SDU), Permanente Voorspoed Republiek Suriname (PVRS), and De Nieuwe Wind (DNW), have formed an alliance to run together under the SDU banner.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Less than one month, with the election scheduled for May 25, 2025.",
    "status_quo_outcome": "Yes. The most recent polling from late April 2025 shows the incumbent Progressive Reform Party (VHP) with a lead over its primary rival, the National Democratic Party (NDP).",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "The extremely high public dissatisfaction with the Santokhi government (56% dissatisfied, 3% presidential approval) mobilizes a consolidated anti-incumbent vote. The National Democratic Party (NDP) successfully overcomes its internal challenges and captures this sentiment, reversing the recent polling trend and winning a plurality of seats.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "The positive economic news, including reduced inflation and salary hikes for civil servants, proves salient enough for key voter blocs. The opposition remains fragmented, splitting the anti-government vote and allowing the Progressive Reform Party (VHP) to secure a plurality with under 30% of the vote, as the latest poll suggests.",
    "rationale": "My forecast leans towards the Progressive Reform Party (VHP) winning a plurality of seats, but with moderate confidence. The primary driver for this assessment is the most recent poll from April 22, 2025, which places the VHP ahead of the National Democratic Party (NDP) 29% to 24%. While the status quo can be fragile this close to an election, this poll represents the most current data point on voter intention.\n\nThe VHP government has a mixed but tangible record to campaign on. Successfully reducing inflation from 60% to 10%, securing a major investment from TotalEnergies, and implementing salary increases for government employees are significant talking points that could sway undecided voters or solidify their base. Furthermore, the opposition is described as fragmented, and the main opposition NDP is navigating a post-Bouterse era, which may hamper its ability to present a united and effective front. This fragmentation could prevent any single opposition party from overtaking the VHP's vote share.\n\nHowever, there are powerful reasons why my forecast is not higher. The negative sentiment towards the incumbent government is remarkably strong, with 66% of the population believing the country is worse off and President Santokhi's approval rating at a mere 3%. This level of dissatisfaction creates a highly volatile environment where voters could swing dramatically towards an opposition alternative in the final weeks. The January 2025 poll showing the NDP at 54% demonstrates that a large-scale shift away from the VHP is entirely possible. Additionally, the election will be the first under a new National Proportional Representation system, which introduces a significant element of uncertainty, as its effects on party seat allocation are untested.\n\nI would increase my probability if new polls showed the VHP widening its lead or if the NDP showed public signs of internal disarray. Conversely, I would decrease my probability if new polls showed the NDP closing the gap or overtaking the VHP, or if a significant portion of the fragmented opposition coalesced behind a single anti-VHP movement.",
