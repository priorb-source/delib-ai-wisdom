  "information": "On May 1, 2025, the U.S. announced sanctions related to renewed violence in the Tigray and Amhara regions. Ethiopia has neighboring countries, specifically Sudan and South Sudan, that are already under a Level 4 advisory. As of early May 2025, there have been no reports of a new nationwide offensive, a coup attempt, or a mass-casualty event involving foreigners since the sanctions were announced.",

    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "About 60 days (until June 30, 2025)",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Advisory remains Level 3 (Reconsider Travel) with region-specific Level 4 restrictions (e.g., parts of Amhara, Tigray, Oromia, border areas). Addis Ababa stays relatively stable; no ordered/authorized departure from the U.S. Embassy; no major nationwide escalation or attacks on foreigners.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "A sharp deterioration prompts State to elevate to Level 4 countrywide: e.g., large-scale renewed offensives spreading beyond conflict regions; significant terrorist or mass-casualty incidents in Addis Ababa; nationwide state of emergency with severe movement restrictions; airport disruptions; or the U.S. orders departure of embassy staff, signaling inadequate security and consular support.",
    "rationale": "Baseline: Ethiopia is currently at Level 3 nationally with some regions at Level 4. The U.S. tends to reserve Level 4 for countries with pervasive, nationwide threats, very limited consular access, or active evacuation postures. Absent a major shock, advisories generally change slowly.\nRecent signals: The research assistant notes May 1, 2025 U.S. sanctions tied to renewed violence in Tigray and Amhara. That indicates concern but does not, by itself, imply a nationwide collapse in security. There have been no reports (as of May 2) of a new nationwide offensive, coup attempt, mass-casualty event involving foreigners, or embassy drawdown—events that typically precede a Level 4 shift. While neighboring Sudan/South Sudan are Level 4, Ethiopia’s risk profile—especially in Addis Ababa—has been relatively more controlled.\nWhy not higher: A countrywide Level 4 would likely require either significant spread of conflict into major transport hubs or the capital, a major terror/kidnapping trend targeting foreigners, or U.S. mission posture changes (authorized/ordered departure). None are currently in evidence. The State Department has been comfortable with Level 3 plus regional Level 4s for extended periods when risks are geographically concentrated.\nWhy not lower: Active conflicts persist in multiple regions (Amhara, Tigray, parts of Oromia), making sudden deterioration plausible. U.S. sanctions signal rising concern, and the window (two months) leaves time for an adverse shock that could trigger an upgrade. Past precedent shows Ethiopia has been Level 4 during acute phases of the Tigray war.\nUpdate triggers:\n- Upward: Embassy announces authorized/ordered departure; nationwide state of emergency; major attack in Addis or against foreigners; disruption at Addis Bole International Airport; cross-border escalation with Eritrea; government loses control of key corridors.\n- Downward: Verified de-escalation/ceasefire progress; improved security posture statements; sustained quiet through June.\nGiven the slow-changing baseline, current signals, and short timeline, a modest but nontrivial probability is warranted.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill Ethiopia receive a \"Level 4 – Do Not Travel\" travel advisory from the US State Department before July 1, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nTravel and Tour World: [Is Ethiopia Safe for Travel?

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
