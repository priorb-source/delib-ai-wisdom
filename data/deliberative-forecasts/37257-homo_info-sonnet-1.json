    "review": "Both forecasters make compelling arguments that I should weight more heavily. The base rate argument is particularly strong - RS leadership has a documented pattern of threatening referendums without following through, suggesting brinkmanship rather than genuine intent. Forecaster 3's distinction between symbolic provocations (like the January parade) and actually announcing a referendum is well-taken. Most importantly, both note the absence of concrete referendum preparation logistics, which I may have conflated with general constitutional/legislative activity. The international deterrence factor (US/EU opposition) is also more significant than I initially weighted.\n\nHowever, I believe both forecasters may be underweighting the recency and concreteness of recent actions. The draft constitution completed public consultation only in mid-April 2025 - less than a month ago. The legislative bans on central agencies are also very recent. These aren't stale threats from years past but active, institutional preparations happening right now. Additionally, while historical patterns favor inaction, the very low bar of this question (announcement only, not execution) means RS could make such an announcement as a negotiating tactic without committing to actually holding the referendum. The Crimea precedent shows such announcements can happen rapidly when conditions align.",
    "rationale": "After deliberation, I'm updating my forecast downward but not to 18%. The historical base rate of brinkmanship without action is persuasive evidence I should weight more heavily. The absence of specific referendum logistics preparation (polling stations, voter registration, etc.) is also significant. However, I'm not going as low as 18% because: (1) The constitutional and legislative actions are extraordinarily recent (April 2025), representing active momentum rather than stale threats; (2) The question's low bar means RS could announce a referendum as a negotiating tactic without intending to hold it; (3) Explicit recent leadership statements from both Dodik and Stevanović specifically mention independence as a response to specific conditions; (4) Two months provides enough time for a provocative announcement, especially given that only an announcement is required. The balance between base rate skepticism and recent concrete escalation suggests a probability in the low-to-mid 20s range.",
