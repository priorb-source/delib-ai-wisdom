    "review": "Both forecasters make a useful point I underweighted: UFC 315 plausibly aligns with International Fight Week in Las Vegas, historically a marquee card where Trump is more likely to appear. They also maintain the correct per-event base rate well below 50% and emphasize the importance of location and signaling. I find the IFW/Vegas framing additive and credible; however, without confirmed venue/date or any public hints from Dana White/Trump, I wouldn’t go as high as 35%.",
    "rationale": "Base rate: Trump attends a minority of PPVs, roughly 2–4 per year out of ~12, implying about 15–30% per specific card. Key driver is location. Conditional probabilities: if 315 is International Fight Week in Las Vegas, his attendance could be around 35–45%; if it’s a US city he frequents less (non–Vegas/Miami/NYC-NJ), ~15–20%; if international/Canada, ~5–10%. Without confirmation, a reasonable weighting is something like: 45–55% chance Vegas IFW; 30–35% other US; 15–20% international. Using midpoints (50% Vegas at 40%, 32.5% other US at 18%, 17.5% international at 7%) gives a weighted estimate near 27%. Given Trump’s relationship with Dana White and the political upside of a high-visibility Vegas appearance in a swing state, I nudge this to 30%. What would move me up: official IFW-in-Vegas confirmation for 315 and/or credible hints from UFC/Dana White/Trump’s team, pushing me to ~40–45%. What would move me down: confirmation of a non-US venue or a clear schedule/security conflict, pushing me toward ~10–15%. I’m updating modestly upward from 22% to 30% on the strength of the IFW/Vegas argument while still respecting the low per-event base rate and lack of concrete signals.",
