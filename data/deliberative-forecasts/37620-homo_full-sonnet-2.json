    "review": "All three forecasters converge on similar low probabilities (7-12%), citing the same critical evidence: Kadyrov's pattern of false resignation statements (2016, 2020, 2022), the extremely short 20-day timeframe, Putin's supportive response at their May 7 meeting, and Kadyrov's May 12 backtracking. Forecaster 3's framing of these statements as potential 'loyalty displays to Putin' provides useful interpretive depth without changing the probability assessment. Forecaster 2's higher 12% estimate emphasizes that current health reports and succession planning appear more concrete than previous instances. While this is a fair point, I'm not fully convinced this represents a meaningful departure from the established pattern - particularly given Kadyrov's own downplaying of resignation rumors by May 12. The wartime context (11,000 Chechen troops in Ukraine) that Forecaster 2 mentions actually reinforces status quo probability rather than undermining it. No forecaster has raised evidence I hadn't considered, and the convergence around 7-12% suggests we're all weighting the same factors appropriately. The most important new consideration is whether the succession planning and health reports truly represent a qualitative difference from previous episodes, which could justify moving slightly higher toward Forecaster 2's position.",
    "rationale": "Upon reflection, I maintain that the base rate and short timeframe remain the dominant factors. The pattern of Kadyrov making such statements without following through is now four-fold, and by May 12 we're seeing the same de-escalation pattern as before. Putin's response was supportive rather than transitional. Only 20 days remain for what would be a major leadership change in a strategically critical region during wartime. However, I acknowledge Forecaster 2's point that the specificity of health reports (pancreatic necrosis, kidney problems) and concrete succession moves (Adam Kadyrov's multiple promotions) may represent incrementally more serious indicators than in past episodes. This warrants a marginal update upward from 7% to 8%, aligning with Forecaster 3's assessment while remaining below Forecaster 2's 12%. The adjustment reflects that while succession planning is more visible, the fundamental dynamics - Putin's authority, wartime stability needs, and Kadyrov's own backtracking - still heavily favor status quo continuation through June 1.",
