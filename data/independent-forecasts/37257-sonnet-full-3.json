  "information": "As of early May 2025, Republika Srpska (RS) has taken several legislative and political steps. A draft for a new constitution, which includes rights to self-determination and provisions for confederal relationships, completed its public consultation phase in mid-April 2025. The RS government has also passed laws to ban Bosnia's central judicial, police, and intelligence agencies from operating within its territory. Milorad Dodik, the leader of RS, has stated he is willing to declare independence if the central authorities, with international support, attempt to take control of RS property. Similarly, Nenad Stevanović, President of the RS Parliament, warned that continued pressure would lead to a declaration of independence, stating that RS is a functional entity capable of implementing its decisions independently.\n\nInternational reactions to the political situation in Republika Srpska are varied. The U.S. and EU have expressed strong opposition to secession, with a U.S. envoy labeling RS's proposals as \"secession by another name.\" The U.S. Embassy in Sarajevo has warned that disobeying the decisions of Bosnia's Constitutional Court, such as celebrating the banned January 9th holiday, may constitute a criminal offense. In contrast, Croatian Prime Minister Andrej Plenković has expressed support for Bosnia and Herzegovina's EU membership while voicing concern over secessionist rhetoric from RS, warning that delays in EU integration could allow Russia and China to increase their influence. Russia has appeared supportive of moves by RS, and a Russian military documentary film festival was scheduled to take place in Banja Luka in May 2025.\n\nHistorical and legal precedents provide context for a potential referendum. Bosnia's Constitutional Court has ruled on multiple occasions that celebrating Republika Srpska Day on January 9 is unconstitutional. Despite this, RS held a parade for the banned holiday in January 2025. Analysis of other independence movements shows varying timelines: the process for Catalonia's 2017 referendum took approximately 7-8 months from legislative groundwork to the announcement, while Scotland's 2014 referendum process took about 2 years. In contrast, Crimea's 2014 referendum, under Russian influence, was organized in about two weeks. The political structure of Bosnia and Herzegovina is based on the 1995 Dayton Agreement, which divided the country into two entities: the Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina and Republika Srpska.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Approximately 2 months remain until July 1, 2025, the resolution date for this question.",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No - no referendum date has been officially announced yet, despite escalating rhetoric and legislative preparations by Republika Srpska.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Republika Srpska continues its aggressive posture with legislative changes and threatening rhetoric, but stops short of announcing an actual referendum date before July 1. International pressure from the US and EU, combined with economic concerns and internal political calculations, keeps the situation in a state of elevated tension without crossing the threshold to officially scheduling a referendum. Dodik uses the threat as leverage but doesn't pull the trigger on an actual announcement.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "In response to perceived provocation from Bosnia's central government or international community (such as enforcement actions or additional sanctions), Dodik and RS authorities announce a specific date for an independence referendum. This could happen rapidly (within weeks, as in the Crimea precedent) if RS leadership decides the political moment is right. The announcement might come as a sudden escalation or as the culmination of the constitutional process already underway.",
    "rationale": "The situation in Republika Srpska is genuinely concerning with significant escalation: a new constitution completed public consultation in April 2025, laws banning central authorities have passed, and leadership has made explicit threats of independence. However, there's a critical distinction between preparation/threats and actually announcing a referendum date.\n\nFactors suggesting higher probability: RS has been extremely aggressive; the constitutional groundwork is largely complete; Dodik has demonstrated willingness to defy international pressure (January 9 parade); Russian support provides some backing; the Crimea precedent shows referendums can be organized in as little as 2 weeks; only 2 months remain, which is actually a short enough timeframe that things could move quickly.\n\nFactors suggesting lower probability: Strong US and EU opposition creates real costs; no date has been announced despite months of preparation and rhetoric; the threats appear partly tactical for leverage; most political brinkmanship doesn't immediately materialize into action; even in the Catalonia case (7-8 months) and Scotland case (2 years), there was significant lead time; announcing an actual date is a far more consequential step than current legislative actions; economic consequences would be severe.\n\nThe status quo bias is important here - while the situation is tense, the world changes slowly most of the time. Political leaders often make threats they don't immediately execute. The gap between having a draft constitution and actually announcing a referendum date is substantial. The current pattern appears to be escalating rhetoric and legislative preparation while stopping short of the final step.\n\nFor me to update higher (toward 40-50%), I would need to see: explicit statements about timing rather than just conditional threats; RS authorities beginning logistical preparations for a referendum (printing materials, setting up polling stations); a specific triggering incident from the central government; or clearer Russian encouragement to proceed.\n\nFor me to update lower (toward 10-15%), I would need to see: explicit de-escalation from RS leadership; international mediation gaining traction; economic pressure beginning to have visible effects; or the constitutional process stalling.\n\nWith 2 months remaining, this is genuinely uncertain but the status quo of 'no announcement despite preparation' remains the more likely outcome. I estimate approximately 28% probability.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nBefore July 1, 2025, will the government of Republika Srpska officially announce a date for an independence referendum?\n\nQuestion background:\nFair Observer: [Balkan Tinderbox: How Russia’s Moves Could Reignite Bosnia](https://www.fairobserver.com/politics/balkan-tinderbox-how-russias-moves-could-reignite-bosnia/)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if, before July 1, 2025, a referendum on the independence of Republika Srpska from Bosnia and Herzegovina is officially scheduled. If this does not occur before that date, this question resolves as **No**.\n\nFor purposes of this question, the referendum will be considered \"officially scheduled\" when it is announced by a person or entity with the authority to do so within Republika Srpska. Please note that broader legality, such as within Bosnia and Herzegovina, will be considered irrelevant for this question, so if the Bosnian government declared the referendum illegal, the question would still resolve as Yes.\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nAs of early May 2025, Republika Srpska (RS) has taken several legislative and political steps.
