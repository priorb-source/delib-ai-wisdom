    "review": "- Forecaster 2: Strong emphasis on political inertia and Politico’s averaging is well founded. The point that a 4+ point lead in a poll-of-polls requires a sustained, cross-pollster surge is key. Their “black swan” qualifier and triggers (gap narrowing to <10 points) are sensible. I largely agree; 5% feels slightly high but in the right ballpark of low single digits.\n- Forecaster 3: Correctly stresses the unprecedented nature of a 4+ point Reform lead and the tight time window, but 18% seems miscalibrated. It underweights the dampening effect of the poll-of-polls and the size of Labour’s advantage. Citing broader European populist surges isn’t a strong analog for achieving a poll-of-polls lead over Labour by 4+ in just two months.\n- New useful input: explicit thresholds for updating (e.g., Reform >25% and within ~5 points of Labour) and the reminder that we need a sustained multi-pollster move to shift Politico’s average—both reinforce a low probability baseline.",
    "rationale": "Time left: roughly two months (May–June 2025). The status quo is Labour with a substantial lead, Conservatives depressed, Reform elevated but still well behind Labour in most aggregates. Politico’s averaging methodology makes sudden reversals unlikely; a 4+ point lead for Reform requires multiple consecutive polls across firms showing Reform clearly first and Labour materially down, sustained long enough to move the average.\n\nFor a Yes outcome, overlapping low-probability conditions are needed: a sharp and durable Labour collapse, further Conservative erosion with consolidation to Reform rather than abstention or drift to Labour/Lib Dems, and Farage sustaining high media dominance. Tail risks (major scandal, economic/economic shock, leadership crisis) exist, but achieving not just first place but a 4+ point average lead within ~60 days is an exceptionally high bar.\n\nI find Forecaster 2’s framing largely aligned with mine; Forecaster 3’s 18% overstates volatility relative to the averaging constraint and current base rates. I modestly nudge my forecast up from 2% to 3% to reflect the small but non-zero possibility of a rapid, scandal-driven realignment and the political vacuum on the right—but remain well below 5% due to the structural and temporal constraints.\n\nUpdate triggers upward: multiple reputable polls within weeks showing Reform first by high single digits and Labour sub-30s, narrowing the Politico gap to <5 points. Downward: continued stable Labour lead and Reform failing to break out beyond low-20s.",
