  "information": "For its upcoming first quarter 2025 earnings report, scheduled for May 12, 2025, analysts expect GoPro to report a quarterly loss of approximately $0.13 per share on revenues of around $124.9 million, which would represent a year-over-year revenue decline of about 19.6%. The company itself has stated it expects unit sales and revenue in 2025 to be lower than in 2024, citing macroeconomic headwinds and competition. In response, the company has initiated plans to reduce operating expenses by nearly 30% during 2025.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "53 days (from May 9, 2025 to July 1, 2025)",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No - GoPro continues operating without filing for bankruptcy, as most companies do not file for bankruptcy protection even when facing financial challenges",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "GoPro successfully navigates its financial challenges through the next 53 days. The company implements its planned 30% operating expense reduction, maintains sufficient liquidity, meets its debt obligations, and reports Q1 2025 earnings on May 12 as scheduled. While revenues decline as expected, the company manages its cash position adequately and avoids any immediate insolvency that would trigger a bankruptcy filing.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "GoPro encounters an unexpected acute liquidity crisis within the next 53 days. This could result from inability to meet imminent debt payments, vendors demanding immediate payment, credit lines being pulled, or cash reserves depleting faster than anticipated. The company's cost-cutting measures fail to materialize quickly enough to stabilize the situation, forcing management to file for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection before July 1, 2025.",
    "rationale": "The key factors in this forecast are the very short timeframe (53 days) and the baseline rarity of bankruptcy filings. While GoPro is clearly facing significant financial challenges - including an expected 19.6% year-over-year revenue decline in Q1 2025 and projected lower unit sales for all of 2025 - the company is proactively addressing these issues with a plan to reduce operating expenses by nearly 30%. The fact that they recently announced Q4 2024 results and have Q1 2025 earnings scheduled for May 12, 2025 (just 3 days away) suggests ongoing operations rather than imminent collapse. Bankruptcy filings typically occur when companies face immediate insolvency or inability to meet debt obligations. The base rate for public companies filing bankruptcy in any given 2-month period is very low, typically well under 1% even for struggling firms. Nothing in the available information suggests GoPro is facing an immediate liquidity crisis that would force a bankruptcy filing within the next 53 days specifically. The forecast is not higher because: (1) the timeline is extremely short, (2) the company is actively managing costs, (3) earnings are being reported normally, and (4) base rates strongly favor no bankruptcy. The forecast is not lower because: (1) the company is genuinely struggling financially with significant revenue declines, (2) we lack complete visibility into their cash position and debt obligations, and (3) unexpected developments could theoretically force a filing. I would update higher if we see missed debt payments, delayed earnings reports, credit issues, or any news of acute liquidity problems. I would update lower after a successful May 12 earnings report or news of secured financing.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill GoPro file for bankruptcy before July 1, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\n[GoPro Announces Fourth Quarter and 2024 Results](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1500435/000150043525000003/gpro2024-12x31exh991xer.htm)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question will resolve as **Yes** if GoPro, Inc., files any petition for bankruptcy protection in the United States, under any chapter of the United States Bankruptcy Code, before July 1, 2025. The question will resolves on the filing of such a petition, not on whether any bankruptcy protection is granted by a court. If no such petition is filed by that date, this question will resolve as **No**.\n\n\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nFor its upcoming first quarter 2025 earnings report, scheduled for May 12, 2025, analysts expect GoPro to report a quarterly loss of approximately $0.13 per share on revenues of around $124.9 million, which would represent a year-over-year revenue decline of about 19.6%.

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
