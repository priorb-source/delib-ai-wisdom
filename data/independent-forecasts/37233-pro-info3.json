  "information": "Several key opposition figures face eligibility challenges ahead of the 2025 election. In late April 2025, a court ruled that potential challenger Tidjane Thiam, leader of the PDCI party, was ineligible to run for president due to his French nationality. Former President Laurent Gbagbo was excluded from electoral lists in 2023 following a conviction for embezzlement. Another political figure, Guillaume Soro, remains in exile and is ineligible due to a 2021 conviction; in April 2025, a trial began for his former aide-de-camp for an alleged coup attempt against Ouattara.",

    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Approximately one month, as the deadline is June 1, 2025.",
    "status_quo_outcome": "Alassane Ouattara has not officially declared his candidacy for the 2025 presidential election and continues to maintain strategic ambiguity about his intentions.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "President Ouattara continues to delay a formal announcement past the June 1, 2025 deadline, preferring to wait for a more strategically advantageous time later in the year, such as the RHDP party's nominating convention, to declare his intentions or name a successor.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Yielding to pressure from his RHDP party and seeking to project strength while the opposition is in disarray, President Ouattara formally announces his decision to seek another term at a party event or in a national address before June 1, 2025.",
    "rationale": "My forecast leans against Ouattara declaring his candidacy in the short, one-month timeframe before June 1, 2025. The status quo is that he has remained deliberately ambiguous about running, a political strategy he has used effectively in the past. There is rarely an advantage to declaring candidacy this far ahead of the October election, and it is more common to wait until later in the summer. The information provided by my research assistant is critical and reinforces this view. The recent court rulings sidelining major opposition figures like Tidjane Thiam, alongside the existing ineligibility of Laurent Gbagbo and Guillaume Soro, have significantly weakened the political opposition. This reduces the immediate pressure on Ouattara to run himself as the only candidate capable of securing a victory for his party. With a less formidable opposition, he has more latitude to either delay his own decision or feel confident in anointing a successor, a desire he has previously expressed. Therefore, the most probable course of action is for him to maintain his current stance beyond the June 1 deadline. My probability is not lower because his party, the RHDP, is actively encouraging him to run, and he may decide to make an early declaration to consolidate his base and project an image of inevitable victory. My probability is not higher because the strategic rationale for waiting is compelling, and the weakened state of the opposition reduces the urgency for him to personally enter the race so soon. I would raise my forecast if the RHDP schedules a major party congress for May with the stated purpose of nominating a candidate. I would lower it if credible reports emerge of Ouattara actively promoting a successor within the party.",
