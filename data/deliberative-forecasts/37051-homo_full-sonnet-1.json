    "review": "All three forecasts converge on 3-6%, which gives me confidence in our shared reasoning about the time constraint being the binding factor. We all identified the same key elements: the 67-day timeframe, Bob Jones taking 7+ years, procedural safeguards, Harvard's lawsuit, IRS turmoil, and no historical precedent. The most interesting divergence is how Forecaster 2 interprets IRS chaos as potentially INCREASING susceptibility to political pressure, while Forecaster 3 and I emphasized it as LIMITING capacity for complex action. Both perspectives have merit - chaos can enable rule-breaking but also hampers coordinated execution. Forecaster 2's point that the agency being in disarray might make it more vulnerable to improper pressure is valid and worth weighing more heavily than I initially did. However, I remain convinced that even with maximum political will, the practical barriers are enormous: Harvard's lawsuit would trigger court intervention, any revocation notice would face immediate injunction, and completing this process in 67 days would require courts to approve an unprecedented fast-track - all exceptionally unlikely.",
    "rationale": "Upon reflection, I'm updating slightly upward from 3% to 4% to align with the group consensus, acknowledging Forecaster 2's valid point about IRS vulnerability during leadership chaos. However, my core reasoning remains unchanged: the 67-day window is simply too compressed for the multi-stage legal and administrative process required to revoke a major university's tax-exempt status. Even assuming unprecedented political pressure and expedited procedures, Harvard's active lawsuit creates an essentially insurmountable barrier within this timeframe. Courts would almost certainly issue preliminary injunctions given the extraordinary and potentially arbitrary nature of such rapid action. The historical precedent is clear - these processes take years, not weeks. While I cannot assign zero probability given the unprecedented political environment, the structural and legal barriers to completion before July 1, 2025 remain nearly absolute. The 1% adjustment acknowledges legitimate uncertainty about how institutional chaos might affect IRS decision-making, but doesn't change my fundamental assessment that time is the binding constraint.",
