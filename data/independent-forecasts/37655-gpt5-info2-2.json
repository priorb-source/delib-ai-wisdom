  "information": "President Volodymyr Zelensky's office officially denied media reports suggesting that presidential elections were being planned for July 2025. Sources within the president's office and the Ukrainian government told BBC News Ukraine that no meetings had been held nor instructions given to prepare for elections, labeling the reports as 'fake or manipulative information.' President Zelensky has repeatedly stated that the question of holding elections can only be considered after the conflict is resolved.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "About 46 days (until 2025-07-01)",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No — no authorized body (Verkhovna Rada/CEC) announces a specific election date while martial law continues.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Martial law remains in force and is extended into August; leadership reiterates elections only after the war; the Verkhovna Rada does not pass a resolution setting a presidential election date; no CEC calendar is issued.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "A political breakthrough leads the Verkhovna Rada to pass a resolution naming a specific presidential election date (e.g., in late 2025) and the CEC echoes it, possibly alongside a plan to lift martial law by that time.",
    "rationale": "- Authority and law: Under Ukraine’s legal regime of martial law, national elections are not held. The power to set a presidential election date lies with the Verkhovna Rada (parliament); the Central Election Commission then administers the process. Announcements by the President’s Office or Cabinet would not satisfy the “authority” requirement unless accompanied by a Rada resolution or CEC act.\n- Current signals: Your research assistant notes the President’s Office has explicitly denied reports of planning a July 2025 election and that President Zelensky has repeatedly said elections can only be considered after the conflict is resolved. Recent practice has been to extend martial law in 90-day increments, and it is expected to cover most of the summer. These facts point strongly toward no announcement in the next six weeks.\n- Time factor: With roughly 1.5 months left, there is little runway for the legislative and administrative steps needed to set a date, especially given the public stance of the executive and the prevailing security environment.\n- Why not higher: Legal/operational constraints under martial law; consistent public messaging against near-term elections; absence of preparatory legislative moves; ongoing wartime pressures that make an imminent announcement unlikely.\n- Why not lower: A small tail risk remains that domestic or international pressure, a ceasefire or de-escalation, or a constitutional/legal development prompts the Rada to set a date (even for after martial law is expected to end). A parliamentary resolution naming a specific calendar date, or credible leaks of such a bill gaining cross-faction support, would raise the odds.\n- What would move me up: Concrete parliamentary initiatives to amend wartime election restrictions; public commitments by Rada leadership to schedule a vote on a presidential election date; credible reports of an impending ceasefire or plan to lift martial law by a specific date; CEC beginning technical preparations tied to a specific date.\n- What would move me down: Further extension of martial law into autumn with explicit statements that no election scheduling will occur until it’s lifted; renewed or intensified frontline fighting; reaffirmations by key leaders and the CEC that no date will be set under current conditions.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill Ukraine announce a presidential election before July 1, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\n[Next Ukrainian presidential election](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Next_Ukrainian_presidential_election)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if, before July 1, 2025, a specific date on which a presidential election will be held is officially announced by the government of Ukraine or any of its agencies that have the authority to do so. If no such announcement occurs before that date, this question resolves as No.\n\nThe election does not have to be held before July 1, 2025; this question resolves based on an announcement.\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nPresident Volodymyr Zelensky's office officially denied media reports suggesting that presidential elections were being planned for July 2025. Sources within the president's office and the Ukrainian government told BBC News Ukraine that no meetings had been held nor instructions given to prepare for elections, labeling the reports as 'fake or manipulative information.' President Zelensky has repeatedly stated that the question of holding elections can only be considered after the conflict is resolved.\n\nToday is 2025-05-16.\n\nBefore answering you think:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n(e) You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
