  "information": "Historical data from the National UFO Reporting Center (NUFORC) shows the following counts of reported sightings for the month of June: 357 in 2019, 470 in 2020, 407 in 2021, and 603 in 2022. While specific numbers for June 2023 and June 2024 were not provided in the source material, data tables indicated that all reported months in 2023 exceeded 600 reports and all reported months in 2024 exceeded 450 reports. For the current year, a data scrape on May 22, 2025, showed a total of 2,067 sighting reports for January through April 2025, yielding a monthly average of approximately 517. Each of ahe first four months of 2025 individually exceeded 400 reports.\n\nBetween May 2023 and June 2024, the US government documented 757 reports of Unidentified Aerial Phenomena (UAPs), with 708 of them occurring in the air. Of these, only 49 cases were officially closed. A notable number of these sightings occurred near the U.S.-Mexico border, particularly in Arizona. Media reports have covered recent military-related incidents, including a US Air Force F-16 fighter jet that was struck and damaged by an object over Arizona in January 2023. In a separate event from September 2024, a US Air Force pilot reported a close encounter with an object traveling at Mach 2 during a mission in California.\n\nPublic interest in UFO-related topics is supported by ongoing events and media attention. The 11th annual 'Contact in the Desert' conference, a major gathering for UFO experts and enthusiasts, is scheduled to run from May 29 to June 2, 2025, in California. Regionally, Washington state ranks third in the U.S. for the total number of UFO reports submitted to NUFORC, and several sightings have been reported from the state's Columbia Basin region since the beginning of 2025. The topic of UAPs also continues to receive attention from mainstream news outlets and the U.S. Congress.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Slightly over one month. The data is for the month of June 2025 and the outcome will be checked on or after July 1, 2025.",
    "status_quo_outcome": "Yes. The number of monthly reports has consistently exceeded 400 for at least the past 16 months, establishing a clear baseline that is well above the threshold.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "A combination of factors, such as a prolonged technical outage of the NUFORC reporting website during June and a major global news event that diverts public attention, leads to a significant and anomalous drop in submitted and processed reports for the month.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "The established trend of high reporting volume continues, driven by sustained media coverage and public interest. The number of reports for June 2025 is similar to the monthly averages observed in 2023, 2024, and early 2025, easily surpassing the 400-sighting threshold.",
    "rationale": "My forecast is based primarily on the recent historical data provided, which presents a strong and consistent trend. The threshold of 400 sightings was surpassed in June of 2020, 2021, and 2022. More compellingly, all reported months in 2023 exceeded 600 reports, and all months in 2024 exceeded 450 reports. The average for the first four months of 2025 is approximately 517 reports per month, with each month individually clearing the 400 mark. This data indicates that the baseline number of monthly reports is now significantly higher than the 400-sighting threshold, making the status quo a 'Yes' outcome.\n\nSustaining factors for this trend include ongoing public and governmental interest, as evidenced by continued US government documentation of UAPs and Congressional attention. Events like the 'Contact in the Desert' conference in late May/early June 2025 will also keep the topic in the public consciousness and may contribute to a higher reporting volume.\n\nMy probability is not higher than 90% to account for unforeseen circumstances. This includes the small possibility of a major technical failure on the NUFORC website for a significant portion of June, or an uncharacteristic and sharp drop in reporting that goes against the multi-year trend. The data depends on a single, non-governmental reporting center, which introduces a small amount of uncertainty.\n\nMy probability is not lower because the threshold of 400 is well below the observed monthly figures for the last year and a half. It would require a deviation of over 20% from the most recent monthly average (approx. 517) just to approach the threshold, which seems unlikely without a significant catalyst.\n\nI would lower my forecast if the data for May 2025, once available, shows a sudden, unexplained crash in reporting numbers. I would raise my forecast if a major, credible, and widely reported UFO/UAP event occurs in late May or early June, as this would almost certainly trigger a large spike in public reporting.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill the number of UFO sightings reported by the National UFO Reporting Center exceed 400 for June 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nAccording to the [National UFO Reporting Center](https://nuforc.org/about-us/): \"The National UFO Reporting Center was founded in 1974 by noted UFO investigator Robert J. Gribble. The Center’s primary function over the past five decades has been to receive, record, and to the greatest degree possible, corroborate and document reports from individuals who have been witness to unusual, possibly UFO-related events. Throughout its history, the Center has processed over 180,000 reports, and has distributed its information to thousands of individuals.\"\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if The National UFO Reporting Center posts greater than 400 UFO/UAP sighting reports at [this link](https://nuforc.org/ndx/?id=event) for the month of June 2025, as displayed when accessed by Metaculus on or after July 1, 2025.\n\n\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nHistorical data from the National UFO Reporting Center (NUFORC) shows the following counts of reported sightings for the month of June: 357 in 2019, 470 in 2020, 407 in 2021, and 603 in 2022.

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
