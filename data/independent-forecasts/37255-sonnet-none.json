    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "2 months (from May 1, 2025 to July 1, 2025)",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No - Libya has not ratified the AfCFTA and maintains its current non-ratification status",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Libya continues its pattern of non-ratification due to ongoing political instability, divided governance structures (with rival administrations in Tripoli and eastern Libya), and lack of institutional capacity to complete the formal ratification process within the remaining 2-month window. The government simply does not prioritize or complete this action before the deadline.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Libya experiences a sudden political alignment or resolution between competing factions that enables a unified government decision. International pressure, economic incentives, or diplomatic engagement from African Union partners successfully motivates rapid action. The necessary legislative or administrative procedures are expedited and completed before July 1, 2025.",
    "rationale": "The status quo strongly favors a No outcome. Libya has been in a state of political fragmentation since 2011, with competing governments and ongoing instability. The AfCFTA agreement has been in existence since 2018 (signed) and entered into force in 2021, yet Libya has not ratified it during this extended period. With only 2 months remaining, ratification would require: (1) political will from Libya's governing authority/authorities, (2) completion of internal constitutional/legislative procedures, and (3) formal submission of ratification instruments. Libya is currently one of only a few African countries that hasn't ratified, alongside Eritrea and Somalia. The short timeframe is critical - major governmental actions typically require months of preparation, legislative review, and bureaucratic processing, even in stable countries. Libya's divided political situation makes this exponentially more difficult. No information from the research assistant suggests any active momentum toward ratification. My forecast is not lower (closer to 0%) because: unexpected diplomatic breakthroughs can occur, we lack complete information about internal discussions, and 2 months technically provides enough time if there were extraordinary political will. My forecast is not higher because: there's no evidence of current momentum, Libya's track record shows years of non-action, and the political situation remains fractured. I would update higher if news emerged of ratification procedures beginning or international summits specifically addressing Libya's participation. I would update lower if reports indicated further political deterioration or explicit opposition to ratification.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill Libya ratify AfCFTA (the pan-African free trade agreement) before July 1, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nWikipedia: [African Continental Free Trade Area](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/African_Continental_Free_Trade_Area)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if Libya ratifies the African Continental Free Trade Area (AfCFTA) Agreement before July 1, 2025.\n\n\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nNo additional information available.\n\nToday is 2025-05-01.\n\nBefore answering you think:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n(e) You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
