  "information": "The company is in a flight hiatus, with no crewed flights scheduled until 2026. The next generation of spaceplanes, the Delta SpaceShip, began assembly in March 2025. Commercial flights for this new craft are planned to begin in mid-2026, with private astronaut flights following in the fall of 2026. According to a regulatory filing, Geode Capital Management LLC increased its stake in Virgin Galactic by 19.1% during the fourth quarter of 2024.",

    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Approximately one month. The outcome will be determined after May 31, 2025.",
    "status_quo_outcome": "Yes. The company's last news post was three months ago, and they are in a multi-year flight hiatus. The current trend is to not post news, so the status quo outcome is 'Yes'.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "The company breaks its silence to post its Q1 2025 financial results in early May. Alternatively, an unexpected positive development, such as a major milestone in the Delta spaceship program or a new partnership, prompts a news release.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "The current period of public silence continues. The company may release its Q1 2025 earnings report, but similar to its Q4 2024 report, it does so only via investor relations channels and not with an accompanying article on its main News page.",
    "rationale": "My forecast is primarily based on Virgin Galactic's recent communication frequency and its current operational status. The key factors are:\n\n1.  **Status Quo / Base Rate:** The most compelling evidence is the company's recent posting history. As of late April 2025, there has been a ~3-month gap since the last post (Jan 30, 2025), which followed a ~1.5-month gap. This trend of infrequent communication suggests a high likelihood of another month passing without an update. This is strongly supported by the fact that the company is in a flight hiatus until 2026, which naturally reduces the cadence of operational news.\n\n2.  **Key Counterargument:** The most probable event that could trigger a news post in May is the release of the Q1 2025 earnings report. Public companies typically issue press releases for these events. However, the provided background information implies that the company did not create a news post for its Q4 2024 earnings release in February 2025. This recent precedent significantly weakens the argument that a quarterly report will automatically result in a news post and is a critical factor in my forecast.\n\n3.  **Synthesis:** The established pattern of silence during this operational hiatus outweighs the general expectation of a news post for quarterly earnings. The company appears to be in a 'heads-down' phase, focusing on the development of its Delta-class fleet, and may be reserving communications for more substantial milestones.\n\nMy probability is not higher than 75% because the decision not to post about Q4 earnings might have been a one-off. The company could easily decide to post its Q1 results to reassure investors, or another unexpected piece of news could arise. My probability is not lower than 75% because the combined evidence of the flight hiatus, the three-month silence, and the precedent of not posting financial results creates a very strong case for the status quo continuing.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill Virgin Galactic fail to make any new posts on its News page in May 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nAs of April 19, 2025, Virgin Galactic's most recent post was timestamped January 30, 2025. The most recent one before then was December 12, 2024.\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if no new posts appear at Virgin Galactic's News page, which can be accessed at [this address](https://www.virgingalactic.com/news), timestamped after April 30, 2025 and before June 1, 2025. If there is a new post, then this question resolves as **No**.\n\n\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nThe company is in a flight hiatus, with no crewed flights scheduled until 2026. The next generation of spaceplanes, the Delta SpaceShip, began assembly in March 2025. Commercial flights for this new craft are planned to begin in mid-2026, with private astronaut flights following in the fall of 2026. According to a regulatory filing, Geode Capital Management LLC increased its stake in Virgin Galactic by 19.1% during the fourth quarter of 2024.\n\nToday is 2025-04-29.\n\nBefore answering you think:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n(e) You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
