    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Approximately one and a half months.",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No. The Starlink availability map currently shows Sri Lanka as 'Coming Soon' and 'Pending Regulatory Approval,' not 'Available.'",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Ongoing regulatory or logistical delays, which have already pushed the launch back from the initial Q3 2024 target, persist. Final approvals for spectrum allocation, ground station operations, or terminal imports are not completed by the July 1, 2025 deadline, and the map remains unchanged.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "The Sri Lankan government and Starlink finalize the remaining operational agreements in late May or June 2025. With the major license approval from August 2024 already secured, these final steps are cleared quickly, allowing Starlink to officially launch the service and update its availability map to 'Available' for Sri Lanka before the deadline.",
    "rationale": "My forecast is anchored on the strong evidence of existing delays. The Starlink map's initial target for Sri Lanka was Q3 2024, a deadline that has been missed by several quarters. While the initial license was granted in August 2024, which is a significant positive indicator, the subsequent lack of progress suggests that considerable regulatory or logistical hurdles remain. The status quo is that the service is not yet available, and with only about six weeks until the deadline, the inertia of this delayed state is the most powerful factor. A 'Yes' outcome would require a swift resolution to issues that have already caused a delay of over six months. This is possible, but less likely than the delays continuing. My probability is not lower because the primary political approval has been granted, meaning the remaining steps could be cleared relatively quickly if they become a priority for both parties. My probability is not higher because the extended delay since the initial announcement is a concrete fact that weighs heavily against a rapid launch within the short remaining timeframe. I would increase my forecast on news of specific final approvals from Sri Lanka's Telecommunications Regulatory Commission (TRCSL). I would decrease it if the estimated date on Starlink's map is pushed further into the future.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill Starlink's website show Sri Lanka as a country with Starlink availability before July 1, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nReuters: [Musk's Starlink wins Sri Lanka licence](https://www.reuters.com/business/media-telecom/sri-lanka-regulator-grants-licence-musks-starlink-satellite-broadband-2024-08-13/)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if, before July 1, 2025, the [Starlink Availability Map](https://www.starlink.com/us/map) has anywhere in Sri Lanka listed as \"Available.\"\n\n\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nNo additional information available.\n\nToday is 2025-05-16.\n\nBefore answering you think:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n(e) You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
