    "no_outcome_scenario": "The 250th ranked billionaire on July 1, 2025 remains from a non-US country. This could be Devasini maintaining his position, or another non-American billionaire occupying that spot due to wealth fluctuations that shuffle rankings but keep a non-American at the 250th position.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Market movements, asset revaluations, or wealth changes cause an American billionaire to move into or remain at the 250th position by July 1. This could occur through: American billionaires' wealth increasing, Devasini's wealth declining, or general reshuffling of rankings around this position that places an American there.",
    "rationale": "With only 33 days until resolution and recent data showing an Italian billionaire at the 250th position, status quo bias strongly favors a No outcome. Billionaire rankings typically exhibit relative stability over such short timeframes, though they are not immutable. However, several factors introduce meaningful uncertainty: (1) The United States has historically dominated billionaire lists, with Americans representing a disproportionate share of the Bloomberg Billionaires Index, increasing baseline probability of an American at any given rank. (2) The 250th position sits in the middle of the rankings where wealth differences between adjacent positions are relatively small, making it more susceptible to volatility than top positions. (3) Over a 33-day period, stock market movements and asset revaluations can cause 5-10% swings in net worth, potentially shifting multiple ranking positions. (4) Without historical data on volatility at this specific rank, I must rely on general principles of wealth dynamics. The forecast is not higher because: the timeframe is very short, the most recent data (April 30) clearly shows a non-American, and dramatic ranking changes in one month are uncommon. The forecast is not lower because: the large American billionaire population creates genuine possibility of an American at this position, market movements over 33 days can cause meaningful shifts, and we lack data showing the 250th position is exceptionally stable. To update higher, I would need: data showing high volatility at this ranking level, information about specific American billionaires near this position, or news of market movements favoring American wealth. To update lower, I would need: evidence of exceptional stability at this rank or confirmation that few Americans rank near position 250.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill the median person on Bloomberg's Billionaires Index be from the United States on July 1, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nOn April 30, 2025, the 250th-ranked name on the list was Giancarlo Devasini of Italy\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if the person ranked 250th on the Bloomberg Billionaires Index (available at [this link](https://www.bloomberg.com/billionaires/)) is listed as being from the United States, when accessed by Metaculus Admins on or after July 1, 2025. It resolves as **No** if the 250th-ranked person is from any other country.\n\nFor purposes of this question, the \"median\" from the question's title is defined as the 250th ranked person on the Bloomberg Billionaires Index, no matter how many are on the list.\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nNo additional information available.\n\nToday is 2025-05-29.\n\nBefore answering you think:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n(e) You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
