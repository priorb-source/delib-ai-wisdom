    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "~57 days (until July 1, 2025)",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "AquaBounty secures a small bridge financing, ATM/PIPE raise, or asset-sale proceeds that extend runway into 2H 2025; or further cuts to operations reduce burn so they can avoid a filing through June. Even if evaluating strategic alternatives, they delay any in-court process past July 1.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Liquidity runs out in late Q2 2025; vendors tighten terms; a lender or major creditor pushes for protection; the board authorizes a Chapter 11 (or Chapter 7) filing to preserve value or effect a sale, and the petition is filed before July 1.",
    "rationale": "- Timing and status quo: With only ~8 weeks left and no filing yet, the base tendency is toward No; most companies do not change state abruptly without precipitating news. Good forecasting practice gives weight to the status quo.  \n- Financial condition (inference from context): The company reported FY2024 results on Mar 27, 2025. For micro-caps like AquaBounty that have previously disclosed cash burn, going-concern language, and delays/downsizing (e.g., the Ohio farm pause), Q2 2025 is a plausible crunch period. However, AquaBounty historically relied on dilutive equity and small financings rather than debt-heavy structures, which often lets firms avoid or delay bankruptcy.  \n- Short-horizon hazard: Even distressed small-caps frequently bridge with ATMs or registered directs that can add a few million dollars and push out a decision by months. That lowers the near-term filing probability versus a six–twelve-month horizon.  \n- Triggers to move higher: Any 8-K indicating imminent liquidity exhaustion, covenant/default notices, expiration of forbearance, retention of restructuring advisors with explicit “in-court options,” missed payroll/vendor disruptions, or statements that the company lacks sufficient cash to fund operations beyond June.  \n- Triggers to move lower: Announced financing (equity, convertible, or bridge), closing of asset sales, material cost reductions with updated runway into Q3+, or improved unit economics/production milestones that ease cash burn.  \n- Why not higher: The window is short; equity lifelines are common; limited secured debt reduces immediate creditor pressure to file.  \n- Why not lower: FY2024 results likely contained going-concern risk; the company’s business model has been cash consumptive; strategic alternatives reviews sometimes culminate in a Chapter 11 sale; Q2 is a classic runway pinch point.  \n- Research assistant input: None beyond the existence of the FY2024 results release; thus I rely on base rates for distressed micro-caps and prior public context up to 2024.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill AquaBounty Technologies file for bankruptcy before July 1, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\n[AquaBounty Technologies Announces Full Year 2024 Financial Results](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1603978/000160397825000012/aqb-20250327xex99_1.htm)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question will resolve as **Yes** if AquaBounty Technologies, Inc., files any petition for bankruptcy protection in the United States, under any chapter of the United States Bankruptcy Code, before July 1, 2025. The question will resolves on the filing of such a petition, not on whether any bankruptcy protection is granted by a court. If no such petition is filed by that date, this question will resolve as **No**.\n\n\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nNo additional information available.\n\nToday is 2025-05-05.\n\nBefore answering you think:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n(e) You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
