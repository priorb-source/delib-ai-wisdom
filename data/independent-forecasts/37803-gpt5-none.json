    "status_quo_outcome": "No — climate.mil remains down per IsItDownRightNow’s check.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "The portal stays decommissioned/blocked, with no server response or a configuration that prevents IsItDownRightNow from receiving a valid HTTP response (e.g., firewalling, DNS sink, or inactive host). Metaculus checks on/after July 1 and the site still reads as down.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "DoD brings climate.mil back online or implements a public HTTP redirect to another DoD page (even with rebranded content). IsItDownRightNow receives a 200/301 and reports the site as up when Metaculus checks on/after July 1.",
    "rationale": "- Evidence/status quo: As of May 5, 2025, IsItDownRightNow reports climate.mil is down for everyone. The linked reporting describes an active removal of climate-related web content under the current administration. Given >3 months since the February purge coverage and the site still down in early May, the status quo points to continued downtime.\n- Administrative incentives: Under a policy direction to remove or downplay climate-branded content, there is little incentive to restore a dedicated climate.mil portal soon. If restoration were desired (even as a redirect), it likely would have happened quickly to avoid broken links and bad optics; persistence of downtime suggests intentional decommissioning or deprioritization.\n- Mechanics of resolution: The outcome depends on IsItDownRightNow’s reading. Even if the site is accessible to some users, if the monitor is blocked or receives no valid response, the question resolves No. Security tightening that blocks generic monitors makes a Yes less likely.\n- Paths to Yes: A nontrivial chance remains that DoD stands up a simple redirect or repurposes the domain (e.g., to “energy resilience”), which IsItDownRightNow would flag as up. Also, Metaculus can check any time on or after July 1; if it comes back later than July 1 but before they verify, it could still resolve Yes.\n- Why not higher: Policy trend and recent behavior point toward sustained removal. Limited time (~6 weeks) reduces the window for restoration. The dependency on an external monitor further lowers odds if access is restricted.\n- Why not lower: Bureaucratic cleanups sometimes replace dead microsites with redirects without policy change. A simple DNS/web config flip could make the domain respond before July, and any 200/301 likely yields a Yes per the resolution source.\n- Update triggers upward: Evidence of DNS changes for climate.mil pointing to an active host, public statements/pages from DoD about resilience content returning (even rebranded), or intermittent uptime observed by third-party monitors.\n- Update triggers downward: Continued “down for everyone” readings into late June, reports that the portal was formally decommissioned, or indications that .mil resources are being restricted from public probes.\n- Research assistant input: None beyond the May 5 downtime note; no contrary signals to raise the probability.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill the US military's climate resiliance portal be back online on July 1, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nThe Guardian [Scientists brace ‘for the worst’ as Trump purges climate mentions from websites](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/feb/04/trump-climate-change-federal-websites)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if climate.mil is online according to [Is It Down Right Now?](https://www.isitdownrightnow.com/climate.mil.html) when accessed by Metaculus on or after July 1, 2025.\n\nAs of May 5, 2025, the resolution source returns the message, \"Climate.mil is DOWN for everyone.\"\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nNo additional information available.\n\nToday is 2025-05-20.\n\nBefore answering you think:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n(e) You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
