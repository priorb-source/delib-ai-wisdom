His campaign has also run ads targeting Hispanic voters, including a $100,000 ad buy related to the Puerto Rican Day Parade. In a recent debate, all nine Democratic candidates, including Cuomo and Mamdani, were united in their pledge to protect immigrants and maintain New York's status as a sanctuary city.

    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "~15–20 days (primary June 24, 2025; most credible calls likely 0–3 days after, depending on RCV/absentee tallies)",
    "status_quo_outcome": "Cuomo narrowly wins the Democratic primary after ranked-choice tabulations and is called the presumptive nominee.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Mamdani consolidates progressive voters and secures strong transfer flows from other left-leaning candidates in later RCV rounds, overtaking Cuomo; alternatively, another non-Cuomo candidate benefits from anti-Cuomo transfers and wins.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Cuomo holds a small first-choice lead, proves sufficiently acceptable to moderate and some Hispanic voters to capture enough second- and third-choice transfers, and wins the final RCV round; credible outlets call him the presumptive nominee within a few days.",
    "rationale": "State of the race: Available reporting indicates Cuomo is leading but his margin is narrowing as Mamdani gains. The field is large (nine candidates) and NYC’s Democratic primary uses ranked-choice voting, making transfer patterns decisive. \n\nWhy I lean Yes (but only modestly):\n- Status quo advantage: Cuomo appears to be slightly ahead in recent polling. In most elections, small leads near E‑day tend to persist absent a major shock. \n- Name recognition and turnout: Cuomo’s very high name ID and likely stronger performance with older, moderate, outer-borough Democratic primary voters are advantages in a low-to-mid-turnout June primary.\n- Resources and targeting: Significant outside spending (e.g., $2.5M from the New York Apartment Association) and targeted Hispanic outreach (including a Puerto Rican Day Parade ad buy) suggest a capable, well-funded operation in the closing stretch.\n- Issue convergence: With all major candidates pledging to maintain sanctuary-city protections, issue differentiation may be muted at the top line, making identity, familiarity, and organizational capacity matter more—factors that likely help Cuomo.\n\nKey risks pulling the probability down:\n- RCV vulnerability: Cuomo is polarizing; he may have weak second-choice appeal among progressives. Mamdani could consolidate transfers from left-leaning candidates in later rounds. A narrow first-choice lead can evaporate in RCV.\n- Negative baggage: Cuomo’s past scandals could cap his ceiling, depress transfers, or mobilize anti-Cuomo tactical voting.\n- Momentum: Headlines emphasize a tightening race; if late undecideds skew anti-Cuomo or progressive field voters coordinate transfers, he can lose in the final rounds.\n- Endorsements/ground game: If major progressive groups and unions effectively mobilize for Mamdani and allied candidates, their GOTV plus transfer discipline could outweigh Cuomo’s cash edge.\n\nSummary of assistant’s inputs affecting the view: Outside spending for Cuomo (~$2.5M), targeted Hispanic ads (~$100k), unified pro-immigrant stances in debate (reducing issue contrast), and Cuomo forming an independent line (“Fight and Deliver”) while still competing in the Democratic primary (organizational seriousness, though it doesn’t directly help in the primary). These factors support a slight Cuomo edge but don’t eliminate RCV and image risks.\n\nWhy not higher: The combination of RCV dynamics, Cuomo’s high negatives, and evidence of Mamdani’s momentum makes a comfortable Cuomo probability unjustified.\nWhy not lower: Cuomo’s apparent polling lead, money/name ID advantages, and likely favorable primary electorate composition mean he remains the most probable single winner.\n\nWhat would move me up:\n- Multiple high-quality, late polls showing Cuomo ahead with favorable RCV simulations (strong second-choice among moderates/Latino voters).\n- Major late endorsements (key unions or borough machines) and clear signs of coordinated moderate consolidation behind Cuomo.\n- Strong early vote indicators from outer boroughs consistent with a moderate-heavy electorate.\n\nWhat would move me down:\n- Credible late polls showing Mamdani tied/ahead or winning on simulated RCV transfers.\n- Visible progressive consolidation (endorsements and coordinated GOTV) and/or a damaging late hit on Cuomo’s standing.\n- Evidence of high youth/left turnout relative to baseline or weak second-choice numbers for Cuomo in reputable surveys.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill Andrew Cuomo win the 2025 Democratic primary for New York City mayor?\n\nQuestion background:\n[Cuomo’s lead narrows as Mamdani gains ground in NYC mayoral race: poll](https://pix11.com/news/politics/cuomos-lead-narrows-as-mamdani-gains-ground-in-nyc-mayor-race/)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below.

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
