    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "8 days - the recall election is scheduled for May 20, 2025 and today is May 12, 2025",
    "status_quo_outcome": "Brent Metz currently holds a seat on the Mountain View, Colorado town council, but faces a recall election triggered by an incident where he was accused of shooting a teen in the face",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Voters in Mountain View decide to recall Brent Metz from the town council. Given the serious nature of the accusation - shooting a teen in the face - residents determine he is unfit to continue serving in public office. The recall effort gains sufficient votes to remove him from his position.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Brent Metz successfully defends his seat by convincing voters that either the incident had mitigating circumstances (such as self-defense), that he has addressed the situation appropriately, or that his overall record of service outweighs this incident. His supporters turn out in sufficient numbers in the low-turnout recall election to keep him in office.",
    "rationale": "This is a challenging forecast due to limited information. The research assistant provided no additional details about the shooting incident, criminal proceedings, public sentiment, or polling data. The core tension is between two factors: (1) the extremely serious nature of being accused of shooting a teen in the face, which would typically generate significant public concern and motivate recall votes, and (2) the historical reality that recall elections have mixed success rates and sometimes fail. Without knowing whether Metz faced criminal charges, was convicted, or if the incident involved self-defense or other mitigating circumstances, I must rely on general principles. Small town dynamics in Mountain View, Colorado could cut either way - personal relationships might help him, or tight-knit community concern for the teen might hurt him. Recall elections typically see lower turnout, which can favor incumbents if their base is motivated. However, a shooting incident of this severity would likely overcome typical recall failure rates. My forecast is not higher because recall elections do sometimes fail, we lack specific case details, and small town politics can be unpredictable. My forecast is not lower because the accusation is extraordinarily serious - shooting someone in the face - which would typically be disqualifying for public office in voters' minds. I would update higher if evidence emerged of strong mitigating circumstances, charges being dropped, or polling showing local support. I would update lower if details confirmed the severity without justification or if polling showed strong recall support.",
