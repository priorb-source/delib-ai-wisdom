    "review": "Both forecasters align with my prior view: the required event (PLA ground forces landing on Taiwan-controlled territory) within ~8 weeks is extremely unlikely, and even if a limited seizure occurred, U.S. wording might avoid the specific term “invasion.” They add emphasis on U.S. linguistic calibration and a thorough indicator set (RO-RO requisitions, maritime/airspace closures, medical/logistics staging), all consistent with my priors. No new concrete indicators or contradictory evidence were introduced.",
    "rationale": "The short timeline, very high escalation threshold, and lack of observed prelude indicators keep the odds low. The resolution’s wording adds a second gate: not just a PRC landing, but a U.S. public accusation using invasion language tied to ground forces. Gray-zone tactics or Coast Guard actions would not qualify, and even a limited PLA landing on an outlying islet might be labeled by Washington as a “seizure” or “attack” rather than “invasion.” Tail risks remain (sudden limited grab or miscalculation), but without evidence of mobilization or exclusion zones, I see no reason to move off a low single-digit probability. I maintain my forecast at 2%.",
