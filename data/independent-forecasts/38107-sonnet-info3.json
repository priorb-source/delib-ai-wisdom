  "information": "As of late May 2025, no charges have been filed against James Comey, nor have any warrants or subpoenas been issued in relation to the social media post. Legal experts suggest a prosecution faces significant hurdles due to First Amendment protections and a 2023 Supreme Court ruling that requires prosecutors to prove a subjective intent to threaten. Historically, arresting former FBI directors or other ex-cabinet-level officials is extremely rare in the United States.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "32 days (from May 30, 2025 to July 1, 2025)",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No - James Comey has not been arrested and there are no charges, warrants, or subpoenas filed against him",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "The Secret Service investigation concludes without finding sufficient evidence of a true threat. Prosecutors determine that First Amendment protections and the high bar set by the 2023 Supreme Court ruling on subjective intent make a successful prosecution unlikely. No charges are filed and no arrest occurs within the remaining 32 days.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Federal prosecutors rapidly move forward with charges, arguing the social media post constitutes a credible threat against the president. They obtain an arrest warrant and execute it within the next 32 days, overcoming First Amendment concerns and the unprecedented nature of arresting a former FBI director.",
    "rationale": "The probability of Comey being arrested before July 1, 2025 is extremely low for several compelling reasons. First, only 32 days remain - an extraordinarily short timeframe to move from a Secret Service inquiry to actual arrest of a former FBI director. Second, my research assistant reports no charges, warrants, or subpoenas have been filed as of late May 2025, meaning the legal process hasn't even begun. Third, substantial legal barriers exist: First Amendment protections for symbolic speech are robust, and the 2023 Supreme Court ruling requires prosecutors to prove subjective intent to threaten - a high bar for what appears to be political commentary using seashells. Fourth, arresting former FBI directors or cabinet-level officials is virtually unprecedented in U.S. history, creating strong institutional resistance to such action. The only factors preventing a near-zero forecast are: (1) the ongoing Secret Service investigation shows official concern exists, (2) highly politicized environments can occasionally produce unexpected actions, and (3) emergency legal processes could theoretically be invoked. However, these factors are far outweighed by the structural barriers. My forecast would increase if charges were filed, a warrant issued, or DOJ made statements indicating imminent action. It would decrease further if the Secret Service formally closed the investigation or more time passed without developments.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill James Comey be arrested before July 1, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\n[Secret Service Is Asking Comey About a Photo of Seashells Spelling ‘86 47’](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/16/us/politics/secret-service-comey-social-media-trump.html)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if former FBI director James Comey is arrested before July 1, 2025, according to [credible sources](https://www.metaculus.com/faq/#definitions).\n\nIn order to streamline this question's resolution, please note that an arrest anywhere in the world, for any reason, will resolve this question as Yes. For purposes of this question, we define \"arrest\" using the definition [posted at Nolo](https://www.nolo.com/legal-encyclopedia/justifies-arrest-probable-cause.html): \"An arrest requires taking someone into custody, against that person's will, in order to prosecute or interrogate. It involves a physical application of force, or submission to an officer's show of force. In sum, the arrestee must not be free to leave. Whether the act by the police is termed an arrest under state law is not relevant. When deciding whether someone has been arrested, courts apply the 'reasonable man' standard. This means asking whether a reasonable person, in the shoes of the defendant, would have concluded that he or she was not free to leave.\"\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nAs of late May 2025, no charges have been filed against James Comey, nor have any warrants or subpoenas been issued in relation to the social media post.

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
