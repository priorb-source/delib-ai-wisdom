    "review": "The other two forecasters make a powerful and convincing case that I had not sufficiently weighted: the complete absence of pre-launch indicators. My initial analysis focused heavily on the compelling political logic for Stevens to run, assuming the recent news would catalyze an already-prepared campaign. Forecasters 2 and 3 correctly point out that a modern Senate campaign launch is rarely a total surprise and is almost always preceded by observable signals like leaks, staff hires, donor calls, or FEC filings. Their argument that the absence of this evidence is, in itself, strong evidence against an *imminent* announcement is the most decisive point in this deliberation. They rightly separate the question of 'will she run?' from the much more specific question of 'will she announce in the next 10 days?', a nuance I initially overlooked.",
    "rationale": "I am significantly updating my forecast downward. My initial 75% was an overconfident assessment based on the strategic logic of the situation, ignoring the operational realities and typical patterns of campaign launches. The other forecasters' focus on the lack of empirical evidence is correct. The single most important factor is the a complete lack of public signals that a campaign is being readied for a launch within our extremely short timeframe. Political announcements of this magnitude require immense logistical preparation, and it is highly improbable, though not impossible, that this could all be happening in complete secrecy. While the political opportunity for Stevens is clear, that opportunity does not expire on May 1st. She and her team have every reason to take their time to ensure a flawless launch, rather than rushing an announcement in the next nine days. The strong consensus from the other forecasters on this point has convinced me that the status quo (no announcement) is far more likely than I originally believed. I have therefore adjusted my forecast to align with theirs, as their reasoning, which is grounded in the lack of positive evidence, is more robust than my initial, more theoretical rationale.",
