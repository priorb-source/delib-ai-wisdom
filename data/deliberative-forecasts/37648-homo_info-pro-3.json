    "review": "The forecasts presented show a significant divergence, ranging from 5% to my initial 70%. Forecaster 3's analysis appears to be based on information that contradicts the other reports, such as a 'maximalist US stance' and new sanctions, which seems inconsistent with reports of 'constructive' and 'converging' talks. I find this reasoning unconvincing as it seems anchored in older, public negotiating positions rather than the more recent dynamics of the actual negotiations. Forecaster 2 provides a much more balanced and compelling analysis. Their key contribution was a crucial piece of evidence I had not considered: a specific, major concession offered by an advisor to Iran's Supreme Leader regarding the elimination of the highly enriched uranium (HEU) stockpile. This is a very strong signal of Iranian seriousness. I also find their cautionary notes about the compressed timeline and domestic political opposition to be a valid and important check on overconfidence. While they interpret the short timeline as a primary obstacle, I continue to view the reported presidential deadline as a primary catalyst.",
    "rationale": "After reviewing my peers' analyses, I am adjusting my forecast slightly upward. Forecaster 2's report of a significant Iranian concession on eliminating its HEU stockpile strengthens the case for 'Yes' more than their valid points about structural hurdles weaken it. This specific detail provides concrete evidence of progress that goes beyond the general 'constructive' language I initially relied on. My core rationale remains centered on the convergence of positive signals: the high frequency of recent talks, an imminent presidential deadline acting as a forcing function, external validation from Israeli intelligence, and now, a specific and critical concession from Tehran. Forecaster 2 rightly points out the significant challenges of domestic opposition and the sheer complexity of any deal. However, these are persistent background risks in any such negotiation. The accumulation of new, positive, forward-looking indicators suggests these standing obstacles are in the process of being overcome. The confluence of high-level political will, a hard deadline, and substantive progress on core issues makes an agreement before July 1 more likely than not. I am increasing my forecast from 70% to 75% to reflect that the new evidence of a specific concession outweighs the general, albeit real, risks.",
