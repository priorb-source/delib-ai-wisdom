    "review": "Both forecasters make the same core case: price in bout-occurrence risk separately and anchor the matchup on Merab’s repeatable, five-round wrestling/pressure advantage demonstrated in their first fight and reinforced by his win over Umar. Forecaster 2’s explicit decomposition (≈90% fight happens; ≈72% Merab if it does) is clean and persuasive; it matches my implicit view and appropriately deducts for draw/NC. Forecaster 3 adds little new evidence but underscores the surgery/layoff downside for O’Malley versus a grinder. Neither raised material factors I’d missed; their ranges (62–66%) cluster around my prior. I find F2’s structure slightly more convincing, mainly by clarifying that the non-occurrence risk materially drags the overall Yes probability.",
    "rationale": "I maintain the core reasoning: Merab showed a clear path in the first meeting and has since proven elite, durable five-round form. O’Malley’s win equity is concentrated in early-to-mid fight striking moments or a big counter; his remediation of defensive wrestling in one camp post-hip surgery is uncertain. With ~12 days left, I agree with a roughly 88–92% fight-go rate and a 70–74% conditional win rate for Merab, minus a small draw/NC haircut. Multiplying through supports mid-60s. Relative to my prior 65%, I nudge up 1 point to 66% reflecting Forecaster 2’s explicit decomposition and my comfort with ~90% bout-occurrence and ~72% conditional win. I’d move up on clean fight-week signals (injury/weight) and market steam toward Merab; I’d move down on credible reports of Merab’s injuries hindering wrestling/cardio or sharp money to O’Malley indicating real TDD/mobility improvements.",
