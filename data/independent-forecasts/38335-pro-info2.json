  "information": "When asked about her potential 2026 gubernatorial candidacy, Casey DeSantis has consistently responded with noncommittal phrases such as, \"We'll see.\" As of early June 2025, there have been no public reports of official campaign staff hires, fundraising filings with the Florida Division of Elections, or other formal preparations for a campaign launch. Polling from early 2025 indicated a high favorability rating for her among registered Republicans, with one poll showing her at 57% compared to Byron Donalds' 27%. However, a separate internal poll conducted by the Donalds campaign showed him with a narrow lead over DeSantis, 34% to 30%.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Less than one month. The deadline is July 1, 2025.",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No. As of today, June 5, 2025, Casey DeSantis has not announced her candidacy for governor and public evidence of campaign preparations is absent.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Casey DeSantis continues to be noncommittal about her political future, allowing the July 1, 2025 deadline to pass without a formal campaign announcement. She may be choosing to wait for a more strategically advantageous time to launch later in the cycle or deciding against a run due to a potentially competitive primary.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Capitalizing on her high name recognition, a campaign team working behind the scenes organizes a surprise launch in late June. DeSantis makes a formal announcement via a press conference or video, seeking to consolidate support and fundraising early despite the lack of prior public groundwork.",
    "rationale": "My forecast is heavily weighted on the status quo. With less than a month until the July 1 deadline, there are no public indicators that a gubernatorial campaign launch is imminent. The research report notes an absence of official campaign staff, fundraising filings, or other formal preparations. Major statewide campaigns are logistically complex and are typically preceded by months of such activities. The current political environment, including a poll showing a Trump-backed Byron Donalds with a lead, provides a strong incentive for a potential candidate to be strategic and deliberate, making a rushed, surprise announcement less likely. The status quo of non-candidacy is the path of least resistance and the most probable outcome. \n\nMy probability is not lower than 15% because Casey DeSantis possesses significant name recognition and a formidable political network in Florida. This could allow her to launch a viable campaign on a much shorter timeline than a typical candidate. A surprise announcement, while unconventional, remains a possibility as a strategic maneuver to seize the narrative. \n\nMy probability is not higher than 15% because the lack of observable campaign infrastructure is a very strong contrary indicator. The window for a conventional campaign launch before the deadline is closing rapidly, and each day that passes without news makes a 'No' outcome more certain. \n\nI would increase my forecast if there were credible leaks of an upcoming announcement, reports of key campaign staff being hired, or the registration of a campaign domain name. I would decrease it further if she makes a statement reinforcing her current focus on other activities or if the deadline draws closer with continued public silence.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill Casey DeSantis announce her candidacy for Florida governor before July 1, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\n[Poll: Trump's endorsement boosts Byron Donalds over Casey DeSantis for Florida governor](https://www.tallahassee.com/story/news/local/state/2025/05/09/poll-byron-donalds-surges-past-casey-desantis-with-trump-backing/83412367007/)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if Casey DeSantis announces her candidacy for governor of Florida before July 1, 2025. If no such announcement has been made before that date, the question resolves as **No**.\n\n\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nWhen asked about her potential 2026 gubernatorial candidacy, Casey DeSantis has consistently responded with noncommittal phrases such as, \"We'll see.\" As of early June 2025, there have been no public reports of official campaign staff hires, fundraising filings with the Florida Division of Elections, or other formal preparations for a campaign launch.

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
