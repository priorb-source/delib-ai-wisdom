  "information": "A series of polls conducted between March and June 2025 show Andrew Cuomo as the frontrunner in the Democratic primary. A SurveyUSA poll in May showed Cuomo as the first choice for 43% of likely Democratic voters, with Zohran Mamdani at 11%. A Marist poll from early May placed Cuomo at 37% and Mamdani at 18%, and a simulation showed Cuomo surpassing the 50% threshold to win in the fifth round of ranked-choice voting. An Emerson College/PIX11/The Hill poll from late May placed Cuomo at 39% to Mamdani's 23%. Earlier polls from March by Honan Strategy Group and Data for Progress also showed Cuomo leading Mamdani with 41% to 18% and 39% to 15%, respectively.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "~15 days until the June 24, 2025 primary; a presumptive call likely within 0–7 days after, depending on RCV tabulation and absentee ballots.",
    "status_quo_outcome": "Yes — Cuomo maintains his polling lead and becomes the presumptive Democratic nominee after RCV rounds.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Progressive consolidation and high activist turnout power Zohran Mamdani past Cuomo in late RCV rounds; or a late-breaking scandal/negative story depresses Cuomo’s vote/transfer share enough for him to lose. A sizable polling error concentrated among younger and left-leaning voters could also flip the race.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Cuomo converts his broad name recognition and dominant first-choice lead into an RCV majority by mid-to-late rounds, with enough second-choice transfers from moderate/establishment-leaning candidates to clear 50%. Credible outlets call him the presumptive nominee within days of the primary.",
    "rationale": "Weighting the status quo heavily: Multiple independent polls from March–late May show Andrew Cuomo consistently ahead by mid-to-high single digits to high teens on first-choice vote share. The assistant’s summary cites: SurveyUSA (May) Cuomo 43% vs. Mamdani 11%; Marist (early May) 37–18 with an RCV simulation showing Cuomo surpassing 50% in the 5th round; Emerson/PIX11/The Hill (late May) 39–23; earlier March polls also had Cuomo near 40 with Mamdani in the mid-teens. The trend suggests Mamdani has been gaining, but Cuomo retains a clear lead with two weeks to go. In NYC Democratic primaries with RCV, a candidate sitting near 40% with broad name ID and resources is typically favored to reach a majority after transfers, particularly if moderates and establishment-leaning voters cluster around him and minor candidates’ voters split their backups. Reasons the forecast is not higher: 1) Recent momentum appears to favor Mamdani (narrowing margins). 2) RCV introduces transfer risk for a polarizing figure; Cuomo’s negatives could limit second-choice inflows, allowing a progressive consolidation to overtake him late. 3) NYC primaries can be low-turnout and skew younger/activist in some districts, increasing volatility and the chance of polling error. 4) Late-breaking news or endorsements (e.g., key unions, The New York Times, progressive groups) could shift second-choice dynamics. Reasons the forecast is not lower: 1) Cuomo’s sustained lead across multiple pollsters and time points. 2) A Marist RCV simulation explicitly showed him reaching 50% by round five. 3) Only ~2 weeks remain, limiting time for a full-scale realignment. 4) Cuomo’s resource and name-recognition advantages should help stabilize his floor. What would move me up: New high-quality polls in mid-June showing Cuomo at or above ~40% with stable/favorable favorables, or credible RCV analyses indicating he collects sufficient transfers from minor/moderate candidates; major establishment endorsements consolidating behind him; early vote/turnout patterns skewing older/moderate. What would move me down: Polls tightening to within single digits on first-choice, or showing Mamdani with a clear advantage in second-choice transfers; major negative revelations about Cuomo; a cascade of progressive and union endorsements to Mamdani; signs of unusually high youth/left turnout. I note resolution depends on a presumptive call; while RCV/absentee counting can delay calls by several days, that does not materially change the underlying win probability at this time.",
