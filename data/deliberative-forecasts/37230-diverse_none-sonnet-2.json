    "review": "Both forecasters provide thoughtful analyses that converge on 56%, very close to my 57%. Forecaster 2's contribution of the May-specific historical base rate (~57% positive since 1950) is particularly valuable and directly validates my forecast. Forecaster 3 adds important detail about specific May catalysts I hadn't enumerated: FOMC meeting, CPI/PPI releases, Q1 earnings, and PCE data near month-end. This clustering of potentially market-moving events introduces both volatility and two-sided risk. Forecaster 3's point about post-earnings buyback support is a technical factor I overlooked. All three of us appropriately anchor to base rates given the lack of specific current market information. The convergence around 56-57% suggests we're well-calibrated to the same fundamental uncertainty. The only meaningful difference is whether the event clustering in May tips the balance slightly toward more downside risk (pulling toward 56%) or whether the May-specific historical positive bias (57%) should dominate.",
    "rationale": "After reviewing the other analyses, I find my 57% forecast remains well-supported. Forecaster 2's specific citation that May has been positive 57% of the time since 1950 directly validates my number. While Forecaster 3's enumeration of May events (FOMC, inflation data, earnings) adds useful context about potential volatility sources, these represent two-sided risks that don't clearly push the forecast directionally. The buyback support point is a modest positive I hadn't considered, which if anything supports staying at or above 57%. The bear market/tariff reference in the question background suggests current market stress, but without concrete specifics, I can't quantify this beyond what's already reflected in anchoring close to (rather than well above) the historical base rate. The 1% difference between my 57% and the consensus 56% is within reasonable forecasting noise. Given the May-specific historical data directly supports 57%, I see no compelling reason to adjust downward.",
