    "review": "All three forecasts are strongly aligned that the status quo of political fragmentation and legislative paralysis in Libya makes a 'No' outcome highly probable. My initial forecast of 2% was the most pessimistic, while Forecaster 2 (10%) and Forecaster 3 (7%) assigned more weight to the possibility of an unexpected breakthrough. I found their reasoning very sound, particularly the arguments raised by Forecaster 3 regarding potential external catalysts, such as AU milestones or the desire for a diplomatic win. Forecaster 3 also added a compelling point strengthening the 'No' case: AfCFTA is likely a low priority for Libya's hydrocarbon-centric economy. Forecaster 2's explicit breakdown of the required steps (political will, legislation, deposit) was a clear way to frame the challenge. The main point of divergence is simply the probability assigned to these low-likelihood 'Yes' scenarios. I believe my initial forecast might have been slightly too low by not adequately pricing in the specific possibility of an externally-driven, symbolic political act.",
    "rationale": "My core reasoning remains unchanged: Libya's persistent political division and the paralysis of its legislature (the House of Representatives) are immense barriers to ratifying any international treaty, especially within a two-month timeframe. The status quo of non-action since 2019 is a very strong signal. However, the other forecasters have convinced me to slightly increase my probability. My initial 2% forecast accounted for a generic 'black swan' event. Their analyses provided more specific, plausible (though still very unlikely) scenarios for a 'Yes' outcome, such as a surprise ratification driven by external diplomatic pressure or timed to coincide with an AU event for symbolic value. While I believe the severe internal dysfunction makes success highly improbable, these scenarios merit a slightly higher weight than I first assigned. Therefore, I am doubling my forecast from 2% to 4%. This adjustment reflects the arguments for potential external catalysts while maintaining my strong conviction that the internal political reality of Libya makes ratification before the deadline an extreme long shot. I remain significantly more pessimistic than the other forecasters, as I believe the internal gridlock is a nearly insurmountable obstacle in this short window.",
