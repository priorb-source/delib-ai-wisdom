    "review": "I have reviewed both forecasters' analyses. Forecaster 2's reasoning is closely aligned with my own but adds valuable specifics that I had not fully considered, such as the marquee nature of the O’Malley–Dvalishvili main event, which increases the event's profile and attractiveness for a presidential appearance. Their 'base rate' framing of Trump attending one-third to one-half of major US-based pay-per-views is a useful heuristic. Forecaster 3 provides a bearish case, heavily weighting the recency of Trump's last appearance and general presidential time constraints. However, their reasoning is weakened by an incorrect assumption regarding the venue's location ('Without knowing the specific venue location...'). Forecaster 2 correctly identifies the venue in Newark, NJ, confirming my initial assessment that the location's convenience is a powerful argument for attendance, which Forecaster 3's model fails to incorporate.",
    "rationale": "After deliberation, I am slightly increasing my forecast. My initial assessment of 55% was primarily based on the strong positive signal from the event's convenient location (Newark, NJ) being balanced by the negative signal of his recent attendance in April 2025. Forecaster 2's analysis reinforces my view and adds new evidence that strengthens the case for 'Yes'. Specifically, the confirmation that the main event is a high-profile, marquee fight makes it a more compelling stop for a publicity-focused appearance. This new detail, combined with the extreme logistical ease of attending from his nearby Bedminster residence, now seems more likely to outweigh the historical pattern of spacing out appearances. While I acknowledge Forecaster 3’s point about recency, I believe the unique convenience and high profile of this specific event create the conditions for an exception to that general pattern. Therefore, I am moving my probability up by three points to reflect an increased confidence in the 'Yes' outcome.",
