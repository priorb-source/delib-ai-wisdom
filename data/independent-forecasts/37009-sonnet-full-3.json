  "information": "According to an April 19, 2025, Politico report, Haley Stevens was 'widely expected to declare her Senate candidacy as early as next week.' On the same day, both the Washington Examiner and the Livingston Post reported that Stevens was expected to announce her bid 'in the coming weeks,' a slightly more ambiguous timeframe.\n\nAs of April 15, 2025, Haley Stevens had $1.6 million in her campaign fund, having raised approximately $1.2 million in the first quarter of the year. Reports also indicate that she has expanded her campaign staff and has been contacting potential candidates to replace her in her current House seat.\n\nSeveral prominent Democrats, including Governor Gretchen Whitmer and Secretary of Transportation Pete Buttigieg, have opted not to run for the Senate seat. Meanwhile, other Democratic candidates such as Mallory McMorrow and Abdul El-Sayed have already officially entered the race. As of late April 2025, Stevens had not filed any paperwork with the Federal Election Commission (FEC) to form an exploratory committee.",

    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "10 days - the deadline is May 1, 2025, and today is April 21, 2025",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No - Haley Stevens has not yet announced her candidacy",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Stevens continues deliberating and delays her announcement decision past May 1, or decides not to run for the Senate seat at all, focusing instead on other political opportunities or her current House position",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Stevens follows through on the widely reported expectations and announces her Senate candidacy during the week of April 21-27, as suggested by the April 19 Politico report that she would declare 'as early as next week'",
    "rationale": "The evidence points toward a likely announcement before May 1. Most compelling is the April 19 Politico report stating Stevens is 'widely expected to declare her Senate candidacy as early as next week' - this places the expected announcement in the week of April 21-27, well within the 10-day window remaining. Supporting indicators include: her substantial $1.6M campaign fund with recent $1.2M quarterly fundraising, expansion of campaign staff, and proactive outreach to potential House seat replacements - all signs of imminent candidacy. The competitive pressure is real, with McMorrow and El-Sayed already in the race after Whitmer and Buttigieg declined.\n\nHowever, I'm not assigning higher probability because: (1) no FEC paperwork has been filed yet, (2) the Washington Examiner and Livingston Post used vaguer 'coming weeks' language, which could extend past May 1, (3) political announcements frequently face unexpected delays, and (4) the status quo principle suggests weighting the current reality that she hasn't announced. I'm not lower because the Politico reporting is very recent and specific, the preparation is extensive and concrete, and 10 days provides adequate time for the expected 'next week' announcement. I would revise upward if FEC filings appear or a specific announcement date is set, and downward if reports emerge of delays, hesitation, or alternative plans.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill Haley Stevens announce her candidacy for US Senator from Michigan before May 1, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nCNN: [Democrats lose another top contender for US Senate seat in Michigan after Whitmer and Buttigieg bow out](https://www.cnn.com/2025/04/10/politics/michigan-senate-race-democrats-mcdonald-rivet/index.html)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if Haley Stevens announces her candidacy for US Senator from Michigan before May 1, 2025.

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
