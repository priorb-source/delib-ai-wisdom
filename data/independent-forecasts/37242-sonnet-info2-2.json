  "information": "Passenger arrival data for the Canary Islands showed year-over-year growth in the first quarter of 2025. AENA reported that traffic in the Canary Islands grew by 3.6% in Q1 2025 compared to Q1 2024. Monthly data showed a 2.2% increase in February and another 2.2% increase in March compared to the same months in 2024. The Easter holiday period in 2025 fell entirely within April, whereas in 2024, it was in late March.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Approximately 5-6 weeks. The April 2025 data is expected to be published at the beginning of June 2025.",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No - arrivals continue to grow or remain stable compared to April 2024. The recent trend has been consistent growth.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "April 2025 passenger arrivals match or exceed April 2024 levels. This occurs as the positive growth trend from Q1 2025 continues into April, supported by favorable Easter timing. The entire Easter holiday period falls within April 2025 (Easter Sunday was April 20, 2025), whereas in 2024, Easter was March 31, placing most Easter travel in late March 2024. This timing shift boosts April 2025 numbers significantly.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "April 2025 passenger arrivals fall below April 2024 levels. This could occur due to unexpected economic disruption in key European source markets (UK, Germany, Spain), a significant travel disruption event, or if concerns about Trump's trade policies affect broader consumer confidence and travel spending more severely than anticipated.",
    "rationale": "The status quo strongly favors continued growth. Q1 2025 showed 3.6% year-over-year growth, with February and March each up 2.2%. This momentum suggests underlying strength in demand. Most critically, the Easter holiday timing strongly favors April 2025. Easter 2025 (April 20) meant the entire Easter travel period occurred in April, while Easter 2024 (March 31) placed most Easter travel in late March 2024. Since Easter is a major European travel period and the Canary Islands is a popular destination, this timing shift should provide a substantial boost to April 2025 numbers. The Trump policy concerns mentioned are unlikely to significantly impact arrivals, as US tourists represent a small fraction of Canary Islands visitors, which are predominantly European (UK, Germany, Spain, etc.). For arrivals to decline, we would need either an unexpected disruption event or a significant shift in European economic conditions that emerged after March. Given the data available and the favorable Easter timing, the probability of decline is low. My forecast is not lower because recent trends are consistently positive and structural factors favor April 2025. It's not higher because there's always inherent uncertainty in forecasting, and unforeseen events could occur, though no warning signs are evident.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill inbound airline passenger arrivals to the Canary Islands fall in April 2025 compared with April 2024?\n\nQuestion background:\n[Canarias braces for the consequences of Trump's policies on tourism, potentially leading to a decline in tourist arrivals from the US](https://diariodeavisos.elespanol.com/2025/04/turismo-aranceles/)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if the total number of passenger arrivals to the Canary Islands for the month of April 2025, as presented at the [Canary Islands Tourism Research site](https://investigacion.turismodeislascanarias.com/en/inbound-tourism-arrival-passengers/monthly-data), is lower than the total number for April 2024. If the number for April 2025 is greater than or equal to the number for April 2024, the question resolves as **No**.\n\nSpecifically, Metaculus will access \"Passenger arrivals (AENA). April 2025,\" which is expected to be posted in the beginning of June 2025. The numbers considered will be the monthly totals under Canary Islands. For example, in the [February 2025 report](https://investigacion.turismodeislascanarias.com/sites/default/files/2025-03/Promotur_AENA_febrero%202025_EN.pdf), the number shown for February 2025 is 2,248,198 and the number shown for February 2024 is 2,199,255. Thus, if the question had been comparing February 2025 with February 2024, it would have resolved as No, because the number went up.\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nPassenger arrival data for the Canary Islands showed year-over-year growth in the first quarter of 2025. AENA reported that traffic in the Canary Islands grew by 3.6% in Q1 2025 compared to Q1 2024. Monthly data showed a 2.2% increase in February and another 2.2% increase in March compared to the same months in 2024. The Easter holiday period in 2025 fell entirely within April, whereas in 2024, it was in late March.\n\nToday is 2025-04-30.\n\nBefore answering you think:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n(e) You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
