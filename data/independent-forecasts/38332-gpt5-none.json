    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "About 25 days (until 2025-07-01)",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No — as of today there has been no public confirmation; if nothing changes by July 1, this resolves No.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Montevideo keeps its position “under study,” explicitly says the foreign minister (or another representative) will go instead of the president, or simply waits to confirm until early July (after the resolution date).",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "The Presidency, Foreign Ministry, or an authorized spokesperson publicly confirms before July 1 that President Yamandú Orsi will attend in person the BRICS Summit in Rio in July 2025.",
    "rationale": "Baseline considerations: Uruguay was invited by Brazil, and attending as a guest is low-cost diplomatically and logistically (short trip, host is a key neighbor/partner). Orsi, a center-left president, likely values early symbolic alignment with Brazil’s Lula and regional forums. Those factors point toward eventual attendance. However, this question resolves on the timing of the announcement, not the actual attendance. Governments often release heads-of-state travel schedules close to the date; for a July summit, a late-June confirmation is plausible but not guaranteed. There are also reasons for caution: Uruguay’s tradition of balanced non-alignment, potential optics around BRICS given Russia’s presence, and the option to send the foreign minister instead. Any of these could delay or downgrade participation. Status-quo weight: Nothing has been announced yet months after the invitation, and time is short. If the government remains noncommittal through June or prefers strategic ambiguity, this resolves No by default on July 1 even if Orsi later attends. Why not higher: (1) Non-trivial chance Uruguay sends a minister rather than Orsi; (2) possibility of an announcement slipping into early July; (3) reputational risk management regarding BRICS geopolitics. Why not lower: (1) Strong incentive to show early engagement with Brazil; (2) low travel and security costs; (3) attending as an invitee does not imply BRICS membership; (4) new administration often seeks visible regional presence. What would move me up: Credible reports from Uruguayan media that the Presidency or Cancillería plans to confirm, a published presidential agenda including Rio in July, or statements from Uruguayan officials signaling head-of-state level attendance. What would move me down: Indications that Uruguay will be represented by the foreign minister, signals of scheduling conflicts, or continued deliberate silence past mid-to-late June. Research assistant summary: No additional information available beyond March reporting that participation was “up in the air.” Given the absence of new signals, I give extra weight to the status quo while allowing for a late-June confirmation.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill the government of Uruguay announce that its president, Yamandú Orsi, will attend the BRICS summit in July 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\n[Lula invites Mexico, Colombia, and Uruguay to BRICS Summit](https://en.mercopress.com/2025/03/04/lula-invites-mexico-colombia-and-uruguay-to-brics-summit#google_vignette) | [Uruguay’s participation at the BRICS summit still up in the air](https://www.plenglish.com/news/2025/03/02/uruguays-participation-at-the-brics-summit-still-up-in-the-air/)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if before July 1, 2025 the government of Uruguay, or anyone speaking on its behalf, issues any sort of public communication (written or oral) confirming its acceptance of the invitation for President Yamandú Orsi to attend in person the BRICS Summit scheduled to take place in Rio de Janeiro in July 2025.\n\nSince the summit will be held after this question resolves, actual attendance is not required, merely the announcement of plans to attend.\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nNo additional information available.\n\nToday is 2025-06-05.\n\nBefore answering you think:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n(e) You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
