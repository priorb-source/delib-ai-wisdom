    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Approximately 2 months remain until July 1, 2025, when this question resolves.",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No - no independence referendum date has been officially announced by Republika Srpska authorities",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Republika Srpska leadership continues current patterns, where separatist rhetoric is used primarily for political leverage and domestic positioning without actually scheduling a referendum. International pressure from the EU, US, and regional actors successfully deters formal announcement. President Dodik may continue making threats but stops short of official scheduling given the risks involved.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Milorad Dodik or another authorized Republika Srpska official formally announces a specific date for an independence referendum, possibly in response to: escalating tensions with the Bosnian federal government, increased Russian encouragement or support, domestic political pressures, or a calculated move to force international negotiations. The announcement could be made unilaterally regardless of its legality under Bosnian constitutional law.",
    "rationale": "This forecast weighs heavily toward the status quo outcome given the short 2-month timeframe and historical patterns. Milorad Dodik has repeatedly made separatist threats over many years but has not actually scheduled an independence referendum, suggesting these threats serve as political leverage rather than precursors to action. The research assistant provided no indication of imminent announcements or recent escalations that would suggest departure from this pattern. The article reference to Russia's potential role indicates ongoing geopolitical concerns, but does not constitute evidence of immediate action. Key factors supporting a low probability: (1) No current signals of imminent announcement, (2) Strong international opposition that has historically constrained action, (3) Dodik's established pattern of rhetoric over action, (4) Very short remaining timeframe. However, the probability is not extremely low because: (1) The question only requires announcing a date, not holding the referendum, which is a lower bar, (2) Genuine geopolitical tensions exist in the region, (3) Dodik has demonstrated willingness to take provocative actions, (4) Some small but real possibility of escalation exists in any 2-month period involving volatile actors. For this forecast to move higher, I would need evidence of: concrete preparatory steps being taken, explicit Russian encouragement, recent inflammatory incidents, or statements from RS officials suggesting imminent action. For it to move lower, I would need evidence of: explicit recent backing away from referendum threats, increased international engagement successfully reducing tensions, or clear statements ruling out near-term action.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nBefore July 1, 2025, will the government of Republika Srpska officially announce a date for an independence referendum?\n\nQuestion background:\nFair Observer: [Balkan Tinderbox: How Russia’s Moves Could Reignite Bosnia](https://www.fairobserver.com/politics/balkan-tinderbox-how-russias-moves-could-reignite-bosnia/)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if, before July 1, 2025, a referendum on the independence of Republika Srpska from Bosnia and Herzegovina is officially scheduled. If this does not occur before that date, this question resolves as **No**.\n\nFor purposes of this question, the referendum will be considered \"officially scheduled\" when it is announced by a person or entity with the authority to do so within Republika Srpska. Please note that broader legality, such as within Bosnia and Herzegovina, will be considered irrelevant for this question, so if the Bosnian government declared the referendum illegal, the question would still resolve as Yes.\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nNo additional information available.\n\nToday is 2025-05-02.\n\nBefore answering you think:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n(e) You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
