    "review": "All three forecasters converged on very similar analyses (58-65%), which increases my confidence that we're appropriately weighing the key factors. Forecaster 2's emphasis on Mexico's 2.5-3.5% historical range and economic diversification beyond autos are valuable points. Forecaster 3's observation about the threshold precision (exactly 3.0% counts as No) is an important technical detail I hadn't explicitly emphasized. However, this matters most if rates hover near the threshold - historically, when Mexico's unemployment is low, it tends to be clearly below 3% (often 2.5-2.8%), not borderline. The most compelling shared insight is that employment effects from tariffs lag by months, meaning April 2025 data likely won't fully reflect recent policy impacts. All three of us noted the challenge of forecasting without Q1 2025 data visibility, forcing reliance on historical patterns. Forecaster 2's slightly lower forecast (58%) appears to weight tariff downside risks marginally higher, while maintaining the same core reasoning structure.",
    "rationale": "After reviewing both forecasts, I find no fundamental new information that warrants changing my assessment. The remarkable convergence (58-65%) validates that we're all identifying the same key factors: strong historical baseline of sub-3% unemployment, genuine but likely lagged tariff risks, and uncertainty from lack of current data. Forecaster 2's point about economic diversification reinforces resilience, while the threshold precision concern is noted but doesn't dramatically alter the calculus given that Mexico's low unemployment periods historically fall well below the cutoff rather than hovering at exactly 3%. The 7-percentage-point spread (58-65%) represents reasonable disagreement on weighting identical factors rather than different fundamental views. My original 65% appropriately balanced the strong status quo (Mexico frequently maintains sub-3% rates) against genuine downside risks (tariff impacts, lack of real-time confirmation). Without new data or arguments that materially shift this balance, I maintain my forecast.",
