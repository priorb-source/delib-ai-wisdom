    "review": "Forecaster 3 raises a crucial point I overlooked: if the site has been down since January 21, 2025 (4 months, not 2 weeks as I suggested), this significantly strengthens the case that this is deliberate policy rather than a temporary issue. The historical precedent from 2017-2021 where similar sites remained offline for years is important contextual evidence I missed. Forecaster 2's mention of specific policy actions (Navy Climate Action 2030 rescission, $377M cuts) reinforces the systematic nature of the dismantling. However, Forecaster 2's operational necessity argument - that military bases face genuine climate challenges requiring planning tools - is interesting but probably insufficient given the short 42-day timeframe. Congressional appropriations leverage is real but typically operates on longer timescales than 6 weeks. All three of us cluster in the 8-13% range, suggesting general agreement on the low probability. The key differentiator is how much weight to place on the compressed timeframe versus potential for unexpected developments.",
    "rationale": "Updating my analysis based on peer review: The 4-month offline period (since January 21, 2025) rather than 2 weeks makes this significantly more indicative of deliberate policy rather than technical issues. Historical precedent from the 2017-2021 administration showing multi-year offline status for similar sites is compelling evidence. With only 42 days until resolution, even if restoration efforts began immediately, government bureaucracy typically moves too slowly. The combination of explicit policy statements from leadership, concrete dismantling actions ($377M cuts, Navy plan rescission), and extended offline period all point toward sustained removal. I'm maintaining probability above 5% because: unexpected legal interventions remain possible, congressional appropriations pressure could theoretically compel action, and we lack complete visibility into potential operational necessity arguments within DOD. However, the longer timeline and historical precedent warrant a slight downward revision from my initial 10% forecast.",
