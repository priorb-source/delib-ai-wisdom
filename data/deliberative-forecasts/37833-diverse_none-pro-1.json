    "review": "I have reviewed the analyses from the other two forecasters. My initial forecast of 5% was very close to Forecaster 3's 4%, and our reasoning was nearly identical, focusing on the restrictive exact-phrase requirement, the niche nature of the topic, and the low base rate. I found Forecaster 3's reasoning highly convincing, particularly their added point that Donald Trump's primary platform is Truth Social, not X, which further diminishes the already low probability on his side. Conversely, I found Forecaster 2's forecast of 18% to be unconvincingly high. While they correctly identified the key variables (prolific tweeting vs. specific wording), their final probability seems disconnected from the weight of their own evidence, which largely points to a low-probability event. The high volume of tweets is a factor, but it doesn't sufficiently overcome the strong filters of specific terminology and topic salience.",
    "rationale": "After deliberation, I am slightly decreasing my forecast from 5% to 4%. My core reasoning remains unchanged: the probability is low due to the strict resolution criteria requiring the exact phrase \"diversity visa,\" which neither individual has a history of using, coupled with the short 40-day timeframe and the absence of a specific news catalyst. The analysis from Forecaster 3 reinforced my conviction and added a key piece of evidence I had underweighted: Donald Trump's preference for Truth Social over X. This reduces the number of relevant 'at-bats' for Trump, making his contribution to the 'OR' condition even smaller than I had initially estimated. While both men are volatile and prolific posters on immigration, the combination of specific constraints makes a 'Yes' outcome highly improbable. The 4% probability accounts for the small, non-zero chance that a random news event or a specific political attack forces this exact terminology into their discourse before the deadline.",
