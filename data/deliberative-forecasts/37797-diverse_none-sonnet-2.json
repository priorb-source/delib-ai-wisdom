    "review": "Both forecasters make compelling process-based arguments I initially underweighted. Forecaster 2 correctly emphasizes that the 'default outcome' for any plenary is no change, and that grey-to-black escalations or political additions would likely be preceded by public signals (ICRG statements, member country comments, press reports) - none of which are evident. Forecaster 3's point about escalations requiring 'clear ICRG signaling and repeated failure to meet action-plan milestones' is particularly important, as it suggests we'd have advance warning. Both correctly note that removals of all three current jurisdictions are virtually impossible given their entrenched issues. The key insight I'm updating on is that the complete absence of any pre-plenary signals is more informative than I initially credited. If a change were being seriously considered, we'd likely see some indication by now, just one month out.",
    "rationale": "After reviewing both analyses, I believe my initial 20% was too high. The forecasters convinced me that the process-based nature of FATF decisions means significant changes are typically telegraphed in advance through ICRG processes, grey list progression, or diplomatic signals. The complete absence of such signals one month before the plenary is strong evidence for status quo persistence. However, I don't agree with Forecaster 2's 5% - this seems overconfident given: (1) FATF internal deliberations have some opacity; (2) geopolitical developments can move quickly; (3) historical base rates suggest ~15-20% probability per plenary if changes occur once every 1-3 years across three annual meetings, though this is rough. Forecaster 3's 12% strikes the right balance - acknowledging strong status quo bias while retaining appropriate uncertainty about low-probability surprise additions or unexpected political decisions. I'm updating to 13%, slightly above Forecaster 3, because I weight the historical base rate uncertainty slightly higher than pure process-based arguments alone would suggest.",
