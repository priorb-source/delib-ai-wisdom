    "review": "Both forecasters add helpful specificity. Forecaster 2’s citation of multiple independent polls (Marist, Emerson/PIX11/The Hill, SurveyUSA) consistently placing Cuomo near ~40% with Mamdani trailing, plus Marist’s explicit RCV simulation clearing 50% for Cuomo, is the strongest incremental evidence I hadn’t directly incorporated. Forecaster 3 adds useful color on late spending (e.g., landlord-backed spending and Hispanic-targeted buys) and the potential backlash risk from Cuomo’s independent line—good to flag as a downside. I find F2’s polling-based case convincing on status quo advantage, though 74% feels a bit high given clear momentum toward Mamdani and RCV uncertainties. F3’s 56% seems cautious but reasonable given Cuomo’s negatives and progressive consolidation risk. Overall, the multipoll lead and an RCV sim tipping Cuomo argue for nudging my probability up, while maintaining meaningful downside for late consolidation/transfer dynamics.",
    "rationale": "I initially leaned 62% on the basis of a narrowing but durable Cuomo lead, cohesive bloc endorsements, and name-ID/organizational advantages versus AOC-energized progressive momentum and RCV uncertainty. The additional evidence that multiple reputable polls across spring consistently have Cuomo around 37–43% with Mamdani behind, plus a Marist RCV simulation showing Cuomo surpassing 50%, strengthens the status quo case that a front-runner with two weeks to go is more likely than not to convert. That said, the direction of travel (tightening), Cuomo’s high negatives, and RCV transfer risks—especially if progressives consolidate late—keep me from moving as high as the mid-70s. I’m updating modestly upward to reflect the breadth of polling and the specific RCV modeling evidence while preserving notable downside risk from late movement, turnout composition, and second-choice dynamics.",
