  "information": "Broader labor market indicators suggest a softening trend. A report from Challenger, Gray & Christmas showed that U.S.-based employers announced 93,816 job cuts in May, which is 47% higher than in May 2024. Separately, the ADP employment report revealed that only 37,000 jobs were created in the private sector in May, the lowest figure in a year. Both the Federal Reserve's Beige Book report and an Institute for Supply Management (ISM) survey pointed to weakening conditions, with widespread comments about economic uncertainty delaying new hiring.",

    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Approximately 20 days. The data for the week ending June 21, 2025, is scheduled to be released by FRED on Thursday, June 26, 2025.",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No. Recent initial jobless claims have been hovering just below the 220,000 mark. If this recent level persists without any change, the outcome would be No.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "The labor market shows resilience in early June. The softening trends indicated by May's data stabilize, and businesses, while cautious with new hiring, refrain from significant new layoffs. Initial claims for the week of June 21 remain in the recent range of 210,000-220,000.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "The weakening economic conditions observed in May continue into June. The announced job cuts begin to translate into actual layoffs, and the slow hiring environment prompts more firms to reduce staff, pushing initial claims above the 220,000 threshold.",
    "rationale": "My forecast is based on the confluence of leading indicators pointing to a softening labor market, which makes a small increase in jobless claims more likely than not. The 220,000 threshold is very close to recent levels, meaning only a modest deterioration is needed to trigger a 'Yes' outcome. The research provided is a key driver of this forecast: the 47% year-over-year increase in job cut announcements in May (Challenger, Gray & Christmas) is a strong forward-looking indicator that often precedes a rise in claims. This is corroborated by the very weak ADP private sector jobs number (37,000) and the cautious sentiment expressed in the Federal Reserve's Beige Book and ISM surveys. These data points collectively suggest that the momentum is toward higher unemployment claims.  My forecast is not higher because weekly jobless claims data can be volatile, and the labor market, while softening, is not showing signs of a sharp collapse. A gradual increase is more plausible than a sudden spike in the immediate term. Labor hoarding may also temper the pace of layoffs.  My forecast is not lower (i.e., below 50%) because that would require dismissing the compelling and consistent evidence from multiple independent sources pointing to a cooling labor market. To believe in a 'No' outcome, one would need to assume that the negative May data was an anomaly and that conditions unexpectedly improved in early June. I would increase my forecast probability if the next two weekly claims reports (for the first two weeks of June) show a clear upward trend past 220,000. Conversely, I would decrease my probability if those reports came in surprisingly low, suggesting the labor market is more resilient than the recent data implies.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill initial jobless claims for the week ended June 21, 2025 exceed 220,000?\n\nQuestion background:\nAccording to the resolution source, \"An initial claim is a claim filed by an unemployed individual after a separation from an employer. The claim requests a determination of basic eligibility for the Unemployment Insurance program.\"\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if initial jobless claims for the week ended June 21, 2025 is greater than 220,000 according to [FRED](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/ICSA).&#x20;\n\n\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nBroader labor market indicators suggest a softening trend.

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
