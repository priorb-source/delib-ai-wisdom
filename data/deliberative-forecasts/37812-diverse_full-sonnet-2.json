    "review": "All three forecasters converge on remarkably similar analyses and forecasts (15%, 17%, 18%). We share the same baseline data: ~39 destinations in May 2025, down from 53 in May 2024; 5 confirmed new routes by July 1; and a required gap of 8+ additional destinations to exceed 51. The key insights from the other forecasters include: (1) Forecaster 2's explicit consideration of a ceasefire scenario as a tail risk that could trigger rapid airline returns, (2) Forecaster 3's important methodological note that FlightsFrom might list all scheduled summer destinations rather than just currently active ones, and (3) Forecaster 3's detailed enumeration of 'missing pillars' - the specific absent carriers (Qatar Airways, Kuwait Airways, multiple Saudia routes, EgyptAir, Pegasus, BA, Lufthansa Group) that would need to return to bridge the gap. These perspectives reinforce rather than challenge my original analysis. The ceasefire scenario is indeed a low-probability but high-impact event I should weight slightly more. However, the methodological point about FlightsFrom cuts both ways - while it might capture some late-announced summer routes, the 6-week timeline means any July 1 destinations would need to be scheduled imminently. The consensus around 15-18% suggests we've appropriately calibrated the low but non-zero probability of a rapid recovery.",
    "rationale": "My original analysis identified the core challenge: moving from 44 expected destinations (39 baseline + 5 confirmed adds) to 52+ requires 8 additional destinations in 6 weeks, which contradicts all available evidence about airline behavior, security conditions, and demand trends. The other forecasters' analyses strengthen this view by: (1) itemizing exactly which major carriers remain absent and would need to return, (2) emphasizing the lead-time constraints for route planning, and (3) noting the structural weakness in demand (Q1 traffic down, departures down 11.6%, tourism projected 30% below 2019). The narrow probability band of 15-18% across all three forecasts reflects appropriate uncertainty about tail scenarios - primarily a sudden geopolitical shift or opportunistic carrier returns - while maintaining that the status quo trajectory points clearly toward fewer than 52 destinations. I see no compelling reason to adjust my forecast significantly. The evidence remains consistent: achieving 52+ destinations would require either multiple major carriers announcing simultaneous returns in the next 1-2 weeks, or a dramatic security/political breakthrough, neither of which appears likely based on current information.",
