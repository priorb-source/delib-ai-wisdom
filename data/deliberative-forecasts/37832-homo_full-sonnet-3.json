    "review": "Both forecasters provide well-reasoned analyses that largely align with mine. They raise similar key points: the massive January funding reducing urgency, lack of visible IPO preparation signals, tight 40-day timeframe, and the June summit as a potential catalyst. Forecaster 3 makes an insightful point I should have emphasized: companies rarely announce IPOs at user conferences, typically preferring S-1 filings or formal press releases. This actually weakens the summit-as-catalyst argument.\n\nTheir forecasts (15% and 18%) are higher than mine (10%), suggesting I may be slightly underweighting the possibility. However, I notice a tension in Forecaster 3's reasoning: they note that user conferences aren't typical IPO announcement venues, yet forecast 18%. This suggests perhaps they're overweighting the mere existence of the summit as a catalyst.\n\nThe consensus around 15-18% versus my 10% makes me consider whether I'm being too confident in the status quo. The key question is: how much preparation is truly needed for simply announcing plans (versus actually filing)? While I acknowledge this is a lower bar, any credible IPO announcement still requires board approval, preliminary underwriter discussions, and strategic planning - none of which show evidence of occurring.",
    "rationale": "After reviewing the other analyses, I'm updating slightly upward but remain skeptical. The key factors supporting a modest increase: (1) Two independent forecasters converged on 15-18%, suggesting the baseline probability of an announcement might be slightly higher than my initial 10%; (2) The question asks only about announcing plans, which theoretically could happen with less preparation than I initially weighted; (3) The June summit does provide a specific catalyst window worth acknowledging.\n\nHowever, I'm not updating to match their 15-18% range because: (1) The absence of any preparation signals (underwriters, rumors, confidential filings) as of late May is extremely telling - even announcing intent typically generates market speculation; (2) The January mega-funding round fundamentally changed the calculus, providing 2-3 years of runway and eliminating near-term pressure; (3) As Forecaster 3 noted (yet didn't fully weight), user conferences are atypical venues for IPO announcements; (4) The 40-day window is very short, and if they planned a June announcement, we'd likely see preparatory signals by now; (5) Historical patterns show companies don't surprise-announce IPOs without visible preparation.\n\nThe evidence strongly favors No, but I'm adjusting from 10% to 12% to account for the small but non-negligible possibility of an unexpected announcement at the June summit or in its immediate aftermath.",
