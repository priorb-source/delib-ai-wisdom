  "information": "The broader market for tech IPOs in May 2025 is described as thawing but selective. Several other fintech companies have recently been active in financing and potential public listings. Airwallex closed on $300 million, Chime has filed to go public, and Klarna filed an amended prospectus. In other company news, Rippling is involved in a high-profile legal battle with its rival Deel, involving accusations of corporate espionage. The company is also focused on operational growth, including international office expansion, such as a recent lease in Bengaluru.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Approximately 5 weeks (from May 22, 2025, to the July 1, 2025 deadline).",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No. Rippling remains a private company and does not make any official announcements about planning an IPO.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Rippling's management decides that the current market, while improving, is still too 'selective' for an optimal IPO. They choose to prioritize resolving the distracting and costly legal battle with Deel and focus on their international expansion efforts before undertaking the rigorous process of going public. They may seek another round of private funding if needed, pushing any IPO considerations beyond the resolution date.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Seeing a favorable window in the 'thawing' IPO market and motivated by competitors' moves (like Chime and Klarna), Rippling's board decides to accelerate its long-held IPO plans. They believe the capital and publicity from an IPO would provide a strategic advantage in their competition with Deel. Having already prepared confidentially, they either file their S-1 or post an official announcement on their website just before the July 1 deadline.",
    "rationale": "My forecast is based on the powerful influence of the status quo, the short time remaining, and significant company-specific distractions. The default outcome for any private company is to remain private. An IPO is a massive, resource-intensive undertaking, and with only about five weeks until the deadline, it is highly improbable for a company to initiate and announce such a plan unless it was already in the final stages. The research assistant's report highlights two key factors arguing against an imminent announcement: 1) The ongoing, high-profile legal battle with Deel, which creates uncertainty and is a major distraction for management that they would likely want to resolve before facing public market scrutiny. 2) The company's stated focus on operational growth, such as its international office expansion, which suggests internal priorities lie elsewhere. While the IPO market is described as 'thawing', the term 'selective' implies that only companies with a clean and compelling story will be successful, a narrative complicated by Rippling's lawsuit. The competitor activity (Chime, Klarna) creates some pressure, but it's not enough to overcome these significant hurdles in such a short timeframe. My probability is not lower because the market is improving, and a surprise filing is always possible if the company has been preparing in secret and decides this is a strategic window they cannot miss. My probability is not higher because the barriers of the short timeline and the Deel lawsuit are substantial, making the status quo the most likely outcome. For me to increase my forecast, I would need to see credible rumors from financial news outlets about an impending S-1 filing or a resolution in the Deel lawsuit. For me to decrease it, I would look for news of a new private funding round, which would signal their intent to stay private for longer.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nBefore July 1, 2025, will Rippling announce that it is planning an IPO?\n\nQuestion background:\n[Startup News: Shares of HR firm Rippling gain value as its business expands](https://forgeglobal.com/insights/blog/startup-news-shares-of-rippling-gain-value-as-its-business-expands/)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question will resolve as **Yes** if Rippling, Inc., announces before July 1, 2025, that it is planning an initial public offering. In order to streamline the resolution of this question, there are two resolution sources for the IPO announcement: 1) The company filing an [SEC Form S-1](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/sec-form-s-1.asp) or 2) An announcement at the [news](https://www.rippling.com/blog) section of its website. If there is no such announcement before that date, this question resolves as **No**.\n\n\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nThe broader market for tech IPOs in May 2025 is described as thawing but selective. Several other fintech companies have recently been active in financing and potential public listings.

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
