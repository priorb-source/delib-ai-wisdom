    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "15 days until the Democratic primary on June 24, 2025",
    "status_quo_outcome": "Andrew Cuomo wins the primary, as he is currently leading in polls",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Zohran Mamdani or another candidate continues gaining momentum in the final two weeks, overtakes Cuomo, and wins the primary. This could result from late-deciding voters breaking against Cuomo due to his past controversies, successful ground operations by opponents, or Cuomo making a campaign misstep.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Cuomo maintains his polling lead through the final 15 days and wins the primary on June 24. His name recognition, political experience, and existing support base carry him to victory despite a narrowing margin. The momentum shift proves insufficient for opponents to catch up in the limited remaining time.",
    "rationale": "The status quo strongly favors Cuomo winning since he currently leads in polls. However, the headline indicates his lead is narrowing with Mamdani gaining ground, which introduces meaningful uncertainty. Key factors: (1) We are only 15 days from the primary - enough time for shifts but limited runway for dramatic reversals. (2) Cuomo has very high name recognition as former governor, which typically advantages candidates in primaries. (3) He carries significant political baggage from his resignation amid scandals, which could mobilize opposition turnout. (4) The narrowing trend suggests negative momentum, but we lack specific polling numbers to quantify how close the race actually is. (5) Primary outcomes are harder to predict than general elections due to lower turnout and more volatile voter composition. Good forecasting principles suggest weighting the status quo heavily - Cuomo is ahead, and frontrunners usually win. However, the narrowing margin prevents this from being a high-confidence forecast. I would need to see actual poll numbers showing either a comfortable Cuomo lead (to go higher) or a statistical tie/Mamdani lead (to go lower). The lack of additional information from the research assistant means I'm relying solely on the headline, which provides directional but not precise information.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill Andrew Cuomo win the 2025 Democratic primary for New York City mayor?\n\nQuestion background:\n[Cuomo’s lead narrows as Mamdani gains ground in NYC mayoral race: poll](https://pix11.com/news/politics/cuomos-lead-narrows-as-mamdani-gains-ground-in-nyc-mayor-race/)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if Andrew Cuomo is the presumptive Democratic nominee for Mayor of New York City after the primary is held on June 24, 2025, according to [credible sources](https://www.metaculus.com/faq/#definitions).\n\nIf by the end of this tournament's scoring no presumptive nominee has been called (for example because there are not yet conclusive results from the vote counting), this question will be annulled.\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nNo additional information available.\n\nToday is 2025-06-09.\n\nBefore answering you think:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n(e) You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
