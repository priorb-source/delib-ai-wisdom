    "review": "My initial forecast of 65% was situated between the other two experts (55% and 70%). We all identified the same core evidence: the consistent historical signing rate, the optimistic forward-looking statement from the acting NASA Administrator, and the lack of a publicly named candidate for June. The disagreement lies in the weight assigned to these factors.\n\nForecaster 2 (55%) compellingly argues that the absence of a named candidate or even strong rumors introduces *significant* uncertainty about the precise timing of the next signing. Diplomatic events are often choreographed, and the current silence is a meaningful counter-signal to the general momentum. \n\nForecaster 3 (70%) places the most weight on the NASA administrator's statement, interpreting 'coming weeks' as a strong signal for June specifically. While I agree the statement is the most important piece of evidence, I believe this interpretation may be slightly too optimistic, as 'weeks' provides considerable flexibility and a signing in early July would still fit this description.\n\nUltimately, I found Forecaster 2's reasoning slightly more persuasive. The emphasis on the uncertainty created by the lack of a specific candidate signing in June is a crucial check on the optimism generated by the overall trend and the NASA statement.",
    "rationale": "After reviewing my peers' analyses, I am slightly decreasing my forecast. My initial reasoning stands, but the deliberation has helped me recalibrate the weights I assign to the key variables. I was, and remain, convinced that the steady rate of new signatories (~0.8 per month) and the recent NASA statement anticipating signings in the 'coming weeks' are strong positive indicators. However, I now believe I may have slightly underweighting the negative signal sent by a complete lack of public information about a specific country planning a June signing, a point well-articulated by Forecaster 2. The term 'coming weeks' is intentionally flexible. A signing could be in the final stages of negotiation but be delayed into July by any number of minor administrative or political hurdles, which would cause this question to resolve as 'No'. My initial forecast of 65% reflected a strong belief that the positive signals outweighed this uncertainty. I am adjusting my forecast down by 5 points to 60% to better reflect the significant, tangible uncertainty that the lack of a named candidate introduces into the precise timing of the next signing.",
