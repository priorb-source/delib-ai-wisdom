    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "About 57 days (until July 1, 2025)",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No change is enacted by July 1, 2025; VAT continues to apply to real estate transactions under existing law.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "The Tax Reforms Bill remains in committee, slips on the legislative calendar, or passes only one chamber before recess; alternatively, the real-estate VAT exemption clause is dropped during harmonization, or the bill reaches the President but assent occurs after July 1.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Both chambers pass a tax reform or finance-related bill in May/June that explicitly exempts real estate transactions from VAT, the clause survives conference, and the President gives assent before July 1.",
    "rationale": "Time is short and Nigerian federal legislation typically takes months from introduction to assent unless fast-tracked as a top executive priority. The background reporting (late April 2025) indicates intent to exempt real estate transactions via a Tax Reforms Bill under consideration, which slightly raises odds relative to a pure base rate. However, risks are material: committee review and harmonization can delay; the clause could be pared back to protect revenues; and even if passage occurs in late June, presidential assent might slip past July 1. On the positive side, this reform aligns with the administration’s housing affordability agenda and the broader Fiscal Policy and Tax Reforms Committee recommendations, which could justify expedited handling if leadership prioritizes it in May/June. My forecast balances these: the status quo (no enactment by July 1) is still the default, but recent signals of an active bill and political will keep the probability appreciable. Not higher because of the tight two-month window, typical legislative friction, and potential clause removal. Not lower because there is fresh executive signaling and a plausible vehicle already on the floor. I would move higher if: the bill clears second and third readings in either chamber with the exemption intact; committee reports a clean version quickly; or there are credible reports of imminent presidential assent. I would move lower if: the National Assembly schedule shows slippage, the clause is watered down or removed, or indications arise that the measure will be bundled into a later Finance Act timed for Q4.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill Nigeria enact legislation exempting real estate transactions from VAT before July 1, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\n[FG: Tax reform bill to exempt real estate transactions from VAT, boost housing affordability in Nigeria](https://nairametrics.com/2025/04/25/fg-tax-reform-bill-to-exempt-real-estate-transactions-from-vat-boost-housing-affordability-in-nigeria/)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if, before July 1, 2025, the government of Nigeria enacts legislation exempting real estate transactions from the Value Added Tax (VAT) according to [credible sources](https://www.metaculus.com/help/faq/#definitions).\n\nFor example, the current iteration of the Tax Reforms Bill that is [being considered](https://brtnews.ng/tax-reforms-bill-to-exempt-real-estate-transactions-from-vat/) by the National Assembly, if it should be enacted, would count for purposes of this question.\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nNo additional information available.\n\nToday is 2025-05-05.\n\nBefore answering you think:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n(e) You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
