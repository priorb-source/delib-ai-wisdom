    "no_outcome_scenario": "One or more players may flirt with a .400 batting average in the early months of the season, but as the number of at-bats increases through June, statistical regression will pull their averages down towards their career norms, leaving no player at or above .400 on the resolution date.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "An elite contact hitter, similar to Luis Arráez in 2023, gets off to a historically hot start and maintains it through a combination of skill and good fortune (a high Batting Average on Balls in Play). This player avoids prolonged slumps and injuries, carrying an average of .400 or greater into July.",
    "rationale": "The forecast is based primarily on the overwhelming historical precedent and the statistical principle of regression to the mean. No MLB player has finished a season batting .400 since Ted Williams in 1941, and it is exceedingly rare for a player to maintain such an average even through the first half of the season. The primary driver of this is statistical regression; a player's performance over a larger sample size of at-bats will almost always trend closer to their established career talent level, which for even the best hitters is well below .400. Modern factors like specialized, high-velocity pitching and data-driven defensive alignments further increase the difficulty of achieving this milestone. The research assistant's report provided no new information. \n\nMy probability is not lower than 12% because of recent close calls. Most notably, Luis Arráez was hitting .392 on July 1, 2023, demonstrating that a player with elite bat-to-ball skills can get remarkably close in the modern era. The difference between .392 and .400 over ~300 at-bats can be as small as two or three hits, making a 'Yes' outcome plausible with slightly different batted-ball luck. \n\nMy probability is not higher than 12% because even a generational talent like Arráez ultimately fell short, underscoring the immense difficulty. The weight of over 80 years of history suggests that this is a truly rare event. For every player who gets close, hundreds of others fall away much earlier in the season. Until a player demonstrates the ability to sustain a .400+ average into late June, the base-rate probability must remain low.\n\nI would increase my forecast if a qualified hitter is batting above .410 in mid-June. I would decrease it if no player is batting above .370 by that same time.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill any major league baseball player have a .400 batting average on July 1, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\ntheScore: [How long can Judge's .400 batting average last?](https://www.thescore.com/mlb/news/3284701/how-long-can-judges-400-batting-average-last)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if on July 1, 2025, any Major League Baseball player in the 2025 regular season has a batting average of greater than or equal to .400 according to the [ESPN baseball stats page](https://www.espn.com/mlb/stats)\n\n\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nNo additional information available.\n\nToday is 2025-05-20.\n\nBefore answering you think:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n(e) You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
