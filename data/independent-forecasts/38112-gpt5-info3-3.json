An indication of the current internal climate came at the April 2025 foreign ministers’ meeting, where the bloc failed to reach an agreement on a joint communiqué.

    "status_quo_outcome": "No",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Member states fail to reach unanimity by the Rio summit, citing the need to consolidate the 2024–25 expansion and the new partner-track. The summit communiqué emphasizes deepening cooperation with partners and welcomes Saudi Arabia’s potential acceptance (which doesn’t count for this question), but issues no new full-member invitations.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Pre-summit negotiations yield consensus to upgrade at least one existing partner (e.g., Kazakhstan, Malaysia, Nigeria, Thailand, Uzbekistan, or Bolivia) to full membership to show momentum under Brazil’s chairmanship. A formal invitation is announced during or just before the Rio summit.",
    "rationale": "- Structure and timing: New invitations require unanimous consent. With roughly five weeks left, any deal must be substantially pre-cooked at the sherpa/foreign ministers’ level. The April 2025 foreign ministers’ meeting failed to agree even on a joint communiqué, a signal of coordination frictions that raises the bar for a fresh expansion decision on a tight timeline.\n- Status quo bias: The default is No, because inviting a new member is an affirmative, consensus action while doing nothing (or focusing on partners) is easy and face-saving. BRICS just admitted Indonesia (Jan 2025) and four others on Jan 1, 2024, and created a partner tier in Oct 2024; this provides a ready alternative to full expansion if consensus is elusive.\n- Momentum for expansion: There is genuine pro-expansion pressure from China and Russia, and the partner pipeline offers several plausible, less-controversial candidates (some ASEAN or Central Asian states) that could be upgraded quickly. Brazil, as host, may want a deliverable. That keeps the probability from being too low.\n- Cross-pressures and veto risks: India has signaled caution on the pace/shape of expansion and is likely to veto sensitive candidates (e.g., Pakistan) or highly controversial picks (e.g., Belarus, Cuba, Venezuela). Some partners (Turkey, Vietnam, Algeria) have not even confirmed partner participation, making a fast-track upgrade less likely. These frictions cap the upside.\n- Research assistant takeaways: Unanimity requirement, April 2025 lack of a joint communiqué, and near-term BRICS Parliamentary Forum (June 3–5) suggest ongoing negotiation but no settled consensus yet.\n- Why not higher: Time is short; visible intra-BRICS divergences; partner framework provides a low-cost alternative deliverable. Unanimity plus geopolitically sensitive candidates lowers odds of agreement by July.\n- Why not lower: Demonstrated expansion momentum (2023–25), a stocked partner pipeline, and host-country incentive to claim a win keep a nontrivial chance that one relatively uncontroversial partner is upgraded.\n- Upward revision triggers: Credible reports of pre-summit consensus on expansion criteria; aligned public statements from Brazil and India favoring at least one upgrade; leaks naming a specific candidate; that candidate’s head of state slated for Rio with unusually high-profile bilats; language in the Parliamentary Forum/sherpa meetings hinting at welcoming “new members.”\n- Downward revision triggers: Public pushback from India or Brazil against further expansion in 2025; agenda signaling focus on consolidation/partners only; renewed intra-BRICS splits (e.g., on communiqué language) right before the summit; signals that Saudi acceptance will be framed as the summit’s expansion deliverable (which doesn’t satisfy this question).",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill a new country be invited to BRICS at the 17th BRICS Summit?\n\nQuestion background:\n[BRICS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BRICS) is an intergovernmental organization originally founded by Brazil, Russia, India, and China, which held their first formal summit in 2009. South Africa was invited to join in 2010, completing the original five-member grouping. BRICS serves as a forum for cooperation among major emerging economies, with a focus on economic development, political coordination, and reform of international institutions.\n\nAt the [15th BRICS Summit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/15th_BRICS_summit) in August 2023, the group announced a major expansion. Full membership invitations were extended to Argentina, Egypt, Ethiopia, Iran, Saudi Arabia, and the United Arab Emirates. Argentina later declined the invitation, while Saudi Arabia has not formally accepted. Egypt, Ethiopia, Iran, and the UAE officially joined on January 1, 2024.&#x20;\n\nAt the [16th BRICS Summit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/16th_BRICS_summit) in October 2024, held in Kazan, Russia, BRICS formally introduced a new partner country framework. Thirteen countries were invited as partners at the 16th Summit: Algeria, Belarus, Bolivia, Cuba, Indonesia, Kazakhstan, Malaysia, Nigeria, Turkey, Thailand, Uganda, Uzbekistan, and Vietnam. Algeria, Turkey, and Vietnam have not yet confirmed participation. Indonesia later joined as a full member on January 6, 2025.\n\nThe 17th BRICS Summit is scheduled to take place on July 6–7, 2025, in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. Many countries have formally expressed interest in joining BRICS, but new members can only be admitted with unanimous agreement from existing members. While expansion remains a stated goal of the bloc, no new invitations have been confirmed.\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question will resolve as **Yes** if at least one previously not invited country is invited to join BRICS as a full member during or before the 17th BRICS summit.\n\nThis question will only resolve based upon an invitation for full membership, not partner status or any other status in the organisation.\n\n* An invitation of a partner country to become a full member will resolve this question as **Yes**.\n* Reinvitation of Saudi Arabia or Argentina will not be sufficient to resolve this question as **Yes**.&#x20;\n* Whether or not a country accepts its invitation will have no impact on this question.\n* If the 17th BRICS summit is delayed, that will not impact this question unless the delay is to after August 31, 2025, in which case this question will be annulled.\n* The specific cutoff for resolution will be 00:00 following the final day of the summit. For example, if the summit is held as expected on July 6-7, the cutoff will be July 8, 00:00. This question will use the timezone of the summit's location, if the summit has no physical location, it will use UTC.\n* For the purposes of this question, \"country\" is defined as a UN member state.\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nThe admission of new full members to BRICS requires the unanimous consent of all existing members. An indication of the current internal climate came at the April 2025 foreign ministers’ meeting, where the bloc failed to reach an agreement on a joint communiqué. Ahead of the July summit, the 11th BRICS Parliamentary Forum is scheduled for June 3-5 in Brasília to discuss topics including sustainable development, climate action, and multilateral governance.\n\nToday is 2025-05-31.\n\nBefore answering you think:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n(e) You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
