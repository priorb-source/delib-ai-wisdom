    "review": "- Forecaster 2: The reliance on early-May “7% stake” headlines is a useful signal, but 95% feels too confident. Those stories could be rounding or reflect post–Mar 31 activity. Also, without a corroborating filing (e.g., 13G/A) or explicit Berkshire comment, treating press phrasing as near-conclusive is risky.\n- Forecaster 3: Balanced assessment and good attention to timing risk, but the claim that Domino’s 115k buyback could mechanically move Berkshire from ~6.7% to 7% without additional purchases is almost certainly false. With ~35M shares outstanding, a 115k reduction only nudges Berkshire’s percentage by a few basis points; hitting 7% typically requires an extra ~70k–130k shares. The point about April purchases being conflated with Q1 remains a real risk.\n\nNet: The early-May “7%” reports are meaningful, but not definitive for Q1. The math implies at least some additional shares beyond 2.382M would be needed to credibly claim 7%, which moderately supports a Yes—provided the buying happened by Mar 31 and not in April.",
    "rationale": "Key updates from deliberation:\n- The press “7%” claims are likely inconsistent with Q4’s 2.382M stake unless Berkshire added roughly 70k–130k shares; DPZ’s modest Q1 buyback alone wouldn’t bridge ~6.7% to 7%. That strengthens the case that Berkshire bought more—some time—but not necessarily by Mar 31.\n- Timing risk: Articles surfaced after the annual meeting (early May). If any incremental purchases were April, they won’t appear in the Q1 13F, and the question would resolve No despite a larger stake today. Berkshire doesn’t usually pre-announce specific buys, raising the chance that the “7%” was rounding or post-quarter accumulation.\n- Macro context (Berkshire net seller, focus on OXY/VRSN/SIRI) pulls the probability down somewhat, but doesn’t preclude a small Q1 top-up—especially since only a small add is needed to exceed 2,382,000.\n\nI’m raising my forecast from 44% to reflect the added evidentiary weight of multiple early-May reports implying an increased DPZ stake. But given the non-trivial chance those refer to rounding or April activity, I stop well short of Forecaster 2’s confidence.\n",
