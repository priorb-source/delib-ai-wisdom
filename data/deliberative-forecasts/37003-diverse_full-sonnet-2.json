    "review": "The other forecasters provide valuable perspectives that align closely with my analysis. All three of us independently arrived at forecasts in the 92-98% range, which suggests strong consensus on the fundamentals. Forecaster 3 raises an important technical point I hadn't explicitly considered: the D'Hondt proportional representation system tends to advantage the largest party in seat allocation. This means that even if polling errors reduced SPÖ's vote lead, they would likely still win the most seats unless FPÖ actually surpassed them in raw vote share - not just narrowed the gap. This is a meaningful reinforcement of the Yes outcome. However, Forecaster 3 also notes that FPÖ has outperformed polls in some past contests, which is a valid counterweight. Forecaster 2's 98% forecast seems slightly overconfident given that polling errors and late swings, while unlikely to overcome a 16-19 point lead, are not impossible. The general convergence around 92-98% suggests we're all properly weighing the evidence.",
    "rationale": "After reviewing the other analyses, I find the D'Hondt electoral system detail particularly compelling - it adds another layer of protection for the SPÖ beyond just the polling lead. Even with some polling error in their favor, SPÖ would likely maintain a seat plurality unless FPÖ closed the entire 16-19 point gap. This warrants a modest upward revision. However, I remain slightly more cautious than Forecaster 2's 98% because: (1) FPÖ's history of outperforming polls in some contests is relevant, (2) six days, while short, is not zero time for events to unfold, and (3) maintaining some epistemic humility is warranted even with overwhelming evidence. The convergence of all three forecasts in the 92-98% range reinforces that this is the appropriate confidence level. I'm updating from 92% to 94% to reflect the added weight from the electoral system mechanics while maintaining appropriate caution about the irreducible uncertainty in any election forecast.",
