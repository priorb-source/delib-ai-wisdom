  "information": "A legislative proposal, the SAFE for America Act of 2025, introduced by Representative Mike Collins, seeks to eliminate the Diversity Visa Lottery program. The act would also prevent visa lottery winners from sponsoring family members for permanent residence. The proposal has received support from conservative organizations such as Heritage Action and NumbersUSA, which argue that the program undermines national security and lacks a merit-based selection process. President Trump previously called on Congress to terminate the program in 2017, following a terrorist attack in New York committed by an individual who had entered the U.S. through the visa lottery.\n\nSince taking office in January 2025, the Trump administration has taken numerous actions on immigration. As of February 17, 2025, the administration had issued 62 executive orders, including ones to end Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion (DEI) mandates, an order to end birthright citizenship for children of unauthorized immigrants, and a declaration of a national emergency at the southern border. Other relevant policies implemented include a new rule requiring non-citizens to carry proof of legal status at all times, visa restrictions on Indian travel agencies accused of facilitating illegal immigration, and a policy to limit visas for foreign officials who facilitate irregular migration.\n\nThe Diversity Visa program, which grants up to 55,000 visas annually, has continued to operate. The results for the 2025 lottery were scheduled for release on May 3, 2025, with the application period for the 2027 lottery set to open in October 2025. Of the more than 40 presidential actions issued since January 2025, none have contained the exact phrase 'Diversity Visa.' The U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) website has not posted any official notice of the program's cancellation. Legal analyses mentioned in reports suggest that since the program is established by statute, substantial changes would typically require new legislation passed by Congress.",

    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "42 days (until July 1, 2025)",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No - As of May 20, 2025, President Trump has issued over 60 presidential actions including many on immigration, but none have contained the exact phrase 'Diversity Visa'",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Trump continues his current approach of broad immigration actions without specifically mentioning the Diversity Visa program by name. He may prefer to support the legislative solution (SAFE for America Act) rather than issue a separate presidential action, or simply does not prioritize this specific program enough to warrant a dedicated presidential action before July 1st.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Trump issues an executive order or presidential memorandum specifically addressing the Diversity Visa program, potentially attempting to suspend new lottery admissions, direct agencies to wind down processing, or call for its elimination. Given conservative advocacy pressure and his previous 2017 statements opposing the program, he decides to issue a targeted action using the exact phrase 'Diversity Visa' before July 1st.",
    "rationale": "The key tension is between Trump's documented opposition to the Diversity Visa program and his lack of specific action on it thus far. As of February 2025, Trump had issued 62 executive orders with extensive immigration focus (including DEI elimination, birthright citizenship, border emergency), yet none mentioned 'Diversity Visa' specifically. This established pattern suggests it's not a top priority.\n\nFactors supporting higher probability: (1) Trump called for terminating the program in 2017, showing clear opposition; (2) Conservative groups actively advocate for elimination; (3) Trump has demonstrated willingness to issue aggressive immigration actions; (4) 42 days remains - a reasonable window; (5) The question only requires mentioning the program, not necessarily taking effective action against it.\n\nFactors supporting lower probability: (1) Strong status quo - 60+ actions without mentioning it suggests not urgent; (2) Legal constraint - the program is statute-based, making legislative solution (SAFE Act already introduced) more appropriate and durable; (3) Trump may prefer comprehensive immigration actions over program-specific ones; (4) The exact phrase requirement is restrictive; (5) The program continues operating normally, suggesting no imminent executive action planned.\n\nThe research assistant's report reveals no indication of pending presidential action specifically on Diversity Visa, despite the broader immigration activity. For my forecast to move higher (toward 40-50%), I'd need evidence of draft executive orders targeting the program or Trump rhetoric specifically naming it. For it to move lower (toward 10-15%), I'd need more time to pass without action or clear signals Trump prefers purely legislative approach. The 42-day window prevents going too low, but the strong status quo pattern prevents going too high.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill President Trump issue a new presidential action mentioning the Diversity Visa before July 1, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\n[Federal judge’s order leaves many visa lottery winners out of luck](https://www.siliconvalley.com/2020/10/01/judges-order-leaves-many-visa-lottery-winners-out-of-luck/) | The American Conservative: [Trump Should Cancel the Diversity Visa Program](https://www.theamericanconservative.com/trump-should-cancel-the-diversity-visa-program/) | Mint: [US Green Card Diversity Visa 2026 Lottery results released: What you need to know](https://www.livemint.com/news/us-news/us-green-card-diversity-visa-2026-lottery-results-released-what-you-need-to-know-11746381683106.html)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if, before July 1, 2025, President Donald J. Trump issues a [presidential action](https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/) mentioning the \"Diversity Visa\" (using exactly those words). If this does not occur before that date, this resolves as **No**.\n\nTo count, the presidential action must be published and publicly accessible (appearing on the presidential actions section of the White House website) before the specified time. A verbal statement or other written announcement besides a presidential action (for example a post on social media), is not sufficient.\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nA legislative proposal, the SAFE for America Act of 2025, introduced by Representative Mike Collins, seeks to eliminate the Diversity Visa Lottery program.

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
