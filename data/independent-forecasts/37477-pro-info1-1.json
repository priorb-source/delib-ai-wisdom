  "information": "Executives from major publishers, including The New York Times and News Corp, stated confidence in their businesses' ability to grow despite economic uncertainties from tariffs. In Q1 2025, The New York Times reported a 12% growth in digital advertising revenue, while most other publishers saw flat revenue. New York Times executives described the impact of tariffs as 'immaterial.' This contrasts with a survey indicating 54% of marketers plan to reduce their 2025 budgets due to tariff concerns. Following a Federal Reserve statement that it would wait for the full impact of tariffs before making decisions, communications-services stocks declined, though The New York Times and Walt Disney posted positive results.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "22 days (outcome will be known by June 1, 2025).",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No. Given the political and economic environment described, tariffs are a persistent and major news story. The status quo is that the word 'tariff(s)' will continue to appear on the front page of at least one of these two major newspapers on any given day, meaning a day where both omit the word would not occur.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "A 'No' outcome occurs if the topic of tariffs remains a high-profile news item every day until the deadline. This could be fueled by new tariff announcements by the President, ongoing international trade disputes, Congressional debates, or the release of economic data showing the impact of tariffs. In this scenario, on every single day through May 31, 2025, at least one of the two newspapers finds the story important enough for its front page, preventing a day where both omit the word.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "A 'Yes' outcome requires only a single day where both newspapers' front pages are free of the word 'tariff(s)'. This would likely occur on a day dominated by a major breaking news story unrelated to trade, such as a different international crisis, a major Supreme Court decision, a natural disaster, or a significant domestic political scandal. A weekend with a slower news cycle could also produce this outcome.",
    "rationale": "My forecast is based on the tension between the high salience of tariffs as a news topic and the low bar for a 'Yes' resolution. The status quo, reinforced by the research assistant's report on tariffs impacting business and fiscal policy, strongly suggests the topic will remain in the news, favoring a 'No' outcome. However, the question resolves 'Yes' if there is just *one single day* in the next 22 days where both the NYT and WSJ omit the word from their front pages. The front page of a newspaper reflects the most urgent news of that specific day. While tariffs are a major ongoing issue, it is unlikely to be the top breaking story every single day for over three weeks. The news cycle is volatile. It is highly probable that within a 22-day window, at least one day's news will be so dominated by other events that tariffs are pushed off the front page of both publications simultaneously. The differing editorial focus of the NYT (broad politics and culture) and the WSJ (business and finance) also makes it less likely that they will both find tariffs to be front-page news every single day. My probability is not higher because the current political climate makes tariffs a central and unpredictable policy lever; a single presidential announcement could lock the word onto the front pages for the entire period. My probability is not lower because the volatility of the news cycle and the 22-day window make a single-day alignment on omitting the word a statistically likely event. I would raise my forecast if a major, non-trade-related story broke that was guaranteed to dominate headlines for several days. I would lower my forecast significantly if a new trade war or a major tariff escalation were to occur.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill the word \"tariff(s)\" disappear from the front print pages of The New York Times and Wall Street Journal by June 1, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nWhether reading the newspaper or social media or watching the news, it is highly likely you are going to see something about tariffs - mainly due to US President Donald Trump's renewed love for this somewhat antiquated form of taxation.\n\nThe New York Times and the Wall Street Journal are two of the largest print newspapers in the US. When, if ever, will we seen tariffs wiped from the front pages of both papers?\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question will resolve to \"Yes\" if, after \\[OPEN DATE] and before June 1, 2025, the words, \"tariff\" or \"tariffs\", do not appear on the print front page of The New York Times and the Wall Street Journal. The following URLs will be used to resolve the question:\n\n* The New York Times: [https://www.nytimes.com/section/todayspaper](https://www.nytimes.com/section/todayspaper)\n* Wall Street Journal:\t [https://www.wsj.com/print-edition/20250414/frontpage](https://www.wsj.com/print-edition/20250414/frontpage)\n\n***\n\n<sup>Note: WSJ front page URL for April 14, 2025. Format is: yyyy-mm-dd.</sup>\n\nGrammar is not relevant (e.g. \"TARIFF\" will suffice to prevent a \"No\" resolution).\n\n\"Tariff(s)\" must be omitted from both papers' front pages on the same day.\n\n\"Tariff(s)\" can appear anywhere on the page, it does not have to be in a title.\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nExecutives from major publishers, including The New York Times and News Corp, stated confidence in their businesses' ability to grow despite economic uncertainties from tariffs. In Q1 2025, The New York Times reported a 12% growth in digital advertising revenue, while most other publishers saw flat revenue.

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
