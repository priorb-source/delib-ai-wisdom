    "review": "Forecaster 2 likely overweights Trump’s relationship with Dana White and a single recent appearance into an “exceptionally strong” base rate. Historical behavior suggests he attends a minority of numbered PPVs—probably 1–3 per year—so per-event odds without specifics are well below 50%. Their 75% seems too high absent location/date/card info. Forecaster 3’s base-rate framing is stronger: most events don’t get a presidential appearance, and without concrete signals, the default is No. I find their 20% plausible. I don’t find the “he may have satisfied his attendance for the near term” argument especially convincing—it’s speculative—but it doesn’t push the number up. Net, the arguments reinforce a base-rate-centric view with modest upward adjustment for Trump’s demonstrated willingness to attend in office and the PR upside with UFC audiences.",
    "rationale": "We still lack key event specifics (date, location, headliners). Trump’s demonstrated pattern and incentives (friendly audience, relationship with Dana White) justify an above-baseline probability relative to a generic president, but not a majority chance for any single numbered PPV. A reasonable prior is roughly 15–25% per event; his very recent attendance as president supports the high end of that range but doesn’t justify a jump to >50% without confirming signals (e.g., Las Vegas/Miami venue, marquee card, schedule proximity). I will hold near my original estimate. I would update up meaningfully on confirmation of a US venue he frequents or credible teases of attendance; down if 316 is international or conflicts with major commitments.",
