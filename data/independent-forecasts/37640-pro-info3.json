  "information": "Decommissioning a federal .gov domain typically requires a process lasting several months for internal approvals, security reviews, and coordination with the General Services Administration (GSA). Federal laws, including the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) and record-retention statutes overseen by the National Archives and Records Administration (NARA), mandate archiving procedures. Historically, websites for discontinued federal programs have often remained online as static archives or with placeholder notices for years after the program ended. When other EPA climate-related webpages were targeted for removal in 2017, the outcome was a redirect or a static page, not a complete shutdown of the domain.",

    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Approximately 1.5 months",
    "status_quo_outcome": "Yes. The website EnergyStar.gov is currently online and functional. If nothing changes, it will remain online.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "The administration acts with exceptional speed to decommission the website, bypassing or rapidly accelerating the typical multi-month bureaucratic and legal processes for taking a federal .gov domain offline. The site is successfully taken down before July 1, 2025.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Despite the political announcement to eliminate the Energy Star program, the bureaucratic and legal requirements for decommissioning the website take longer than the roughly seven weeks remaining until July 1, 2025. The domain remains active, possibly hosting a static archive or a placeholder notice, and is therefore considered 'online' by the resolution source.",
    "rationale": "My forecast is based on the significant bureaucratic inertia involved in decommissioning a federal government website. The primary evidence is the short timeline between the political announcement in early May 2025 and the resolution date of July 1, 2025. My research indicates that taking a .gov domain offline is not a simple switch-off; it involves a process with the GSA and adherence to NARA record-retention statutes, a procedure that typically lasts several months. The status quo is that the website is online, and short-term inertia is a powerful force. Historical precedent from 2017, when other EPA climate pages were targeted, resulted in redirects or static pages rather than complete domain removal. This suggests the most probable outcome is that EnergyStar.gov will remain resolvable, even if the program content is archived or replaced with a notice, which would satisfy the 'Yes' criteria.\n\nMy probability is not higher because there is a non-zero chance that a strong political directive could accelerate the standard process, leading to a takedown before the resolution date. There is also a small risk of technical failure (e.g., an expired certificate or DNS issue) that goes unaddressed due to the program's de-prioritization.\n\nMy probability is not lower because the legal and procedural hurdles to remove a major federal domain in under two months are substantial. The default action in large bureaucracies, especially on a short timeline, is to maintain the status quo. I would lower my forecast if there were specific reports of an accelerated takedown order or a formal request to GSA to expedite the domain's removal. I would raise it if an EPA official confirmed the site would be maintained as an archive.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill the EPA's EnergyStar.gov still be online on July 1, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nAccording to the [New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/06/climate/epa-energy-star-eliminated.html), \"'The Energy Star program and all the other climate work, outside of what’s required by statute, is being de-prioritized and eliminated,' Paul Gunning, the director of the E.P.A. Office of Atmospheric Protection, told employees during the meeting, according to the recording obtained by The New York Times. Mr. Gunning’s office itself is also slated for elimination.\n\nFor the past 33 years, Energy Star has been known for its recognizable blue label, which shows that an appliance has met energy efficiency standards set by the federal government.\"\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if EnergyStar.gov is online according to [Is It Down Right Now?](https://www.isitdownrightnow.com/energystar.gov.html) when accessed by Metaculus on or after July 1, 2025.\n\nAs of May 7, 2025, the resolution source returns the message, \"Energystar.gov is UP and reachable by us.\"\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nDecommissioning a federal .gov domain typically requires a process lasting several months for internal approvals, security reviews, and coordination with the General Services Administration (GSA).

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
