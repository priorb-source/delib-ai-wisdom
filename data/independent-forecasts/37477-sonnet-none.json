    "no_outcome_scenario": "Tariffs remain a dominant story throughout the remaining period due to continued Trump administration policy announcements, ongoing trade negotiations, or significant economic impacts. Both newspapers maintain front-page coverage every single day through May 31, 2025, as the topic remains too newsworthy to bump from prime position.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "At least one day between now and June 1 sees both papers focusing on other major stories - perhaps a significant international event, major domestic crisis, Supreme Court decision, or natural disaster dominates the news cycle. Alternatively, Memorial Day weekend (May 24-26) might feature different editorial priorities with lighter political/economic coverage, or tariff news temporarily quiets as negotiations plateau.",
    "rationale": "This question requires only ONE day where both papers omit tariffs from their front pages simultaneously over a 23-day period. While tariffs are clearly a major ongoing story given Trump's policy focus in early 2025, front pages have limited space and news cycles are inherently volatile. The key factors: (1) Tariffs are currently prominent but not necessarily every-day front-page material - major competing stories regularly emerge. (2) Memorial Day (May 26) could shift editorial focus. (3) Weekend editions sometimes have different priorities. (4) The correlation between papers matters - when a major competing story emerges, it likely affects both papers similarly, increasing the chance both skip tariffs together. However, the probability isn't extremely high because: (a) We're still relatively early in Trump's term when tariff policy is most active. (b) Tariffs likely have ongoing economic impacts warranting sustained coverage. (c) Both papers must skip it on the SAME day, which is more restrictive. The forecast would increase if we saw major competing news stories emerge or tariff discussion cooling. It would decrease if tariff announcements intensify or economic impacts worsen. Given 23 days to find just one day where both papers prioritize other stories, and accounting for the likelihood of at least one major competing news event, I estimate a moderate probability of YES.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill the word \"tariff(s)\" disappear from the front print pages of The New York Times and Wall Street Journal by June 1, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nWhether reading the newspaper or social media or watching the news, it is highly likely you are going to see something about tariffs - mainly due to US President Donald Trump's renewed love for this somewhat antiquated form of taxation.\n\nThe New York Times and the Wall Street Journal are two of the largest print newspapers in the US. When, if ever, will we seen tariffs wiped from the front pages of both papers?\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question will resolve to \"Yes\" if, after \\[OPEN DATE] and before June 1, 2025, the words, \"tariff\" or \"tariffs\", do not appear on the print front page of The New York Times and the Wall Street Journal.

Format is: yyyy-mm-dd.</sup>\n\nGrammar is not relevant (e.g. \"TARIFF\" will suffice to prevent a \"No\" resolution).\n\n\"Tariff(s)\" must be omitted from both papers' front pages on the same day.\n\n\"Tariff(s)\" can appear anywhere on the page, it does not have to be in a title.\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nNo additional information available.\n\nToday is 2025-05-09.\n\nBefore answering you think:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n(e) You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
