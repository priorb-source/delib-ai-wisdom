  "information": "US-China trade talks resumed in London on June 9, 2025, with a US delegation that included the Treasury Secretary, Commerce Secretary, and Trade Representative. On June 11, Trump announced that a US-China trade agreement was finalized. Chinese officials characterized the outcome as a 'framework agreement.' A White House official stated that the agreement, which is subject to final approval from both leaders, allows the US to impose a 55% tariff on Chinese imports, while China would impose a 10% tariff on US imports. A 90-day pause on tariffs is set to expire on July 9, 2025, with new tariffs scheduled to take effect on July 8.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "15 days.",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No. Presidential visits to major powers like China require extensive planning, security arrangements, and diplomatic protocol, which are not currently in place. The default is that no such visit will occur in the next two weeks.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "The July 1, 2025 deadline passes without a visit from Donald Trump. The recently announced 'framework agreement' on trade is either finalized through other diplomatic channels or the process continues past the deadline, with no presidential visit deemed necessary in this short timeframe.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "In a surprise diplomatic move, Donald Trump and the Chinese leader agree to a hastily arranged, high-stakes summit in China to personally sign the new trade agreement. This would be framed as a major breakthrough, leveraging Trump's penchant for personal, leader-to-leader deal-making.",
    "rationale": "My forecast is overwhelmingly driven by the extremely short timeframe. As of June 15, 2025, there are only 15 days remaining until the July 1 deadline. Organizing a US presidential visit to China is a massive logistical and security undertaking that is typically planned months in advance. The status quo, which I weight heavily, is that no visit is planned or has even been rumored. The information provided about a 'framework agreement' being reached on June 11 actually reduces the urgency for an immediate presidential visit; the heavy lifting has been done by subordinates. The final deal can be approved without an in-person meeting before July 1. The key tariff deadline is July 8, which is after the resolution date of this question, further decreasing the pressure for a visit within the next 15 days. My probability is not lower than 2% solely because of the 'Trump factor' – his demonstrated preference for unconventional, dramatic, and personal diplomacy could, in a highly unlikely scenario, lead to a surprise summit. However, the probability is not higher than 2% because the practical, logistical, and diplomatic barriers to arranging such a trip in two weeks are immense and almost certainly insurmountable. To increase my forecast, I would need to see credible leaks or official announcements from either Washington or Beijing that a visit is being actively planned. Absent such information, the probability remains very low.",

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
