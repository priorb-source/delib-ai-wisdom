  "information": "The escape from the Orleans Justice Center on May 16, 2025, involved ten inmates and went undetected for seven hours. The inmates created a hole in a wall behind a toilet, climbed out through a maintenance area, and used a mattress to get over a barbed-wire fence. An investigation revealed significant security flaws, including chronic understaffing, with the prison at only 60% of required staffing at the time. A federal monitor's report had previously warned of a deteriorated security situation, citing inmates' ability to manipulate cell locks. At least three jail employees have been arrested in connection with the escape, which the Orleans Parish Sheriff believes was an 'inside job' aided by staff.\n\nA multi-agency manhunt is underway, involving over 200 officers from local, state, and federal bodies, including the FBI, U.S. Marshals, and the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives (ATF). The reward for information leading to the capture of the two remaining fugitives has been increased to $50,000 per person, with funds contributed by Crimestoppers, the FBI, and the ATF. As of late May 2025, law enforcement had received nearly 700 tips from the public. In connection with the escape and subsequent aid to the fugitives, at least 14 accomplices have been arrested, including family members of one of the escapees.\n\nAs of May 30, 2025, eight of the ten escapees have been recaptured. Some captures occurred out of state, including two inmates who were apprehended in Walker County, Texas, after a high-speed chase. The two fugitives still at large are Antoine Massey, 33, and Derrick Groves, 27, who are both considered armed and dangerous. Groves is a convicted murderer awaiting sentencing for a double homicide. Massey is described as a 'serial escapee' with three prior escapes from custody and was also being sought for kidnapping and rape. A former federal warden noted that Massey's housing in a first-floor cell was a significant security risk.",

    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "32 days until July 1, 2025",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No - two fugitives remain at large, so if nothing changes the question resolves negatively",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "One or both of the remaining fugitives (Antoine Massey or Derrick Groves) successfully evade capture beyond July 1, 2025, either by hiding effectively, fleeing to remote areas or out of the country, or benefiting from remaining accomplice support networks",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Both remaining fugitives are captured or killed within the next 32 days through the ongoing multi-agency manhunt, aided by the $100,000 in combined rewards, continued public tips, intelligence from arrested accomplices, or routine law enforcement encounters",
    "rationale": "The baseline situation favors eventual recapture: 80% of escapees have already been caught, demonstrating the effectiveness of the manhunt. The massive law enforcement response (200+ officers from multiple agencies including FBI and U.S. Marshals), substantial financial incentives ($50,000 per fugitive), nearly 700 tips received, and 14 arrested accomplices who may provide intelligence all work in favor of recapture. Additionally, 32 days is a meaningful window of time for law enforcement to work with. However, several concerning factors pull the probability down significantly. Most critically, Antoine Massey is described as a 'serial escapee' with three prior successful escapes, suggesting genuine expertise in evading capture. The fact that these two remain at large after two weeks while eight others were caught suggests they are either the most resourceful, have the best support networks, or both. Historical patterns show that fugitives who survive the initial days of intensive manhunts become progressively harder to catch as they establish hiding patterns and trails cool. Both are considered armed and dangerous, and Groves is a convicted double murderer, indicating they may be desperate and willing to take extreme measures to avoid capture. The previous captures included some out-of-state apprehensions, suggesting these individuals have mobility and resources. My forecast is not higher because Massey's proven escape capability is a serious red flag, and the selection effect (the hardest to catch remain) is significant. It's not lower because of the overwhelming resources deployed, the substantial time remaining, and modern surveillance capabilities that make long-term evasion extremely difficult. I would update higher if additional accomplices are arrested and provide specific intelligence, or if there are credible sightings. I would update lower if we pass mid-June with no captures or credible leads.",
