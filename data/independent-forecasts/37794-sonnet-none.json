    "yes_outcome_scenario": "A player currently at or near .400 maintains or reaches that mark through June 1, either by sustaining exceptional performance or by going on a hot streak during the next 10-12 games",
    "rationale": "We are approximately 6-7 weeks into the 2025 MLB season (May 19). By this point, players typically have 150-200 at-bats, which represents a more stable sample than the early weeks where .400 averages occasionally appear. Historical context is crucial: the last player to finish a season at .400 was Ted Williams in 1941. While players do sometimes reach .400 early in seasons, they virtually always regress as more at-bats accumulate. The Aaron Judge reference suggests someone (likely Judge) had a .400 average at some point, consistent with early-season spikes that don't last. With 13 days remaining, players will accumulate roughly 40-50 more at-bats (10-12 games), which is substantial enough for significant batting average movement. The question's advantage is that it asks about ANY player on a specific date, not sustained performance. However, by mid-May, the probability someone maintains .400 is quite low. My forecast is not higher because: (1) .400 averages are extraordinarily rare in modern baseball, (2) we're far enough into the season that small-sample flukes should have largely dissipated, (3) the historical trend is consistent regression from early-season peaks. My forecast is not lower because: (1) 13 days is short enough that an exceptional hot streak could maintain unlikely numbers, (2) we're asking about a snapshot in time rather than sustained performance, (3) with ~750 active MLB players, there's a small but real chance someone is currently at or approaching .400. I would update higher if I learned a player currently has a .400+ average with strong underlying metrics (high BABIP sustainability, good contact rates). I would update lower if I confirmed no player is currently above .380.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill any major league baseball player have a .400 batting average on June 1, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\ntheScore: [How long can Judge's .400 batting average last?](https://www.thescore.com/mlb/news/3284701/how-long-can-judges-400-batting-average-last)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if on June 1, 2025, any Major League Baseball player in the 2025 regular season has a batting average of greater than or equal to .400 according to the [ESPN baseball stats page](https://www.espn.com/mlb/stats)\n\n\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nNo additional information available.\n\nToday is 2025-05-19.\n\nBefore answering you think:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n(e) You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
