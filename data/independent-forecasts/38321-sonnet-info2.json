  "information": "A primary focus of the summit will be defense spending among NATO members. President Trump has been advocating for member countries to increase their defense spending to 5% of their GDP, a significant increase from the current 2% target. In response to this pressure, NATO Secretary-General Mark Rutte (or Jens Stoltenberg, sources vary) has reportedly proposed a compromise deal: a target of 3.5% of GDP on direct defense spending by 2032, with an additional 1.5% allocated for broader security-related expenditures. The discussions will also address military aid to Ukraine, and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky is expected to attend.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Less than 4 weeks - the summit is scheduled for June 2025 and today is June 4, 2025, so the event is imminent or may occur within the next 1-3 weeks",
    "status_quo_outcome": "Yes - Trump attends the summit. As the sitting US President, attending major NATO summits is standard protocol, and historically US Presidents attend these events regardless of their views on NATO",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Trump decides not to attend due to a last-minute domestic crisis, health issue, or makes an unprecedented decision to send a representative instead as a diplomatic signal. Alternatively, he could be dissatisfied with NATO's compromise on defense spending and boycott to apply pressure",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Trump attends the summit as planned, given his strong interest in pushing NATO members toward higher defense spending. He views this as an opportunity to negotiate directly and claim credit for any agreements reached on the proposed 3.5% GDP target. He is physically present in The Hague for the summit sessions",
    "rationale": "The status quo strongly favors Trump's attendance. We are now in the actual month when the summit is scheduled, meaning preparations would already be well underway if he plans to attend. Several factors support high confidence: (1) US Presidents consistently attend NATO summits as a matter of protocol; (2) Defense spending is Trump's signature NATO issue - he has been the primary driver pushing for increases from 2% to 5% GDP; (3) The research assistant notes active negotiations on a compromise deal (3.5% direct spending plus 1.5% security expenditures), suggesting Trump is engaged in the diplomatic process; (4) Ukraine support will be discussed with Zelensky present, which is a major geopolitical priority; (5) Trump attended NATO summits during his first term despite his critical stance. The probability is not 100% because: we lack explicit confirmation he is already en route or present; unforeseen medical or domestic emergencies could arise; Trump has occasionally defied diplomatic norms. However, given the timing (we're in June already), the importance of the topics, and his demonstrated interest in NATO spending negotiations, the baseline expectation is very strong attendance. I would update upward toward certainty with news of his departure or arrival in The Hague, and downward only with explicit announcements of cancellation or reports of serious impediments to travel",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill Donald Trump attend the NATO Summit in June 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\n[The Netherlands to host 2025 NATO Summit in The Hague](https://www.nato.int/cps/en/natohq/news_225618.htm)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if US President Donald J. Trump attends in person a NATO summit held in June 2025.\n\n\"In person\" is defined as occupying the same physical space closely enough at the NATO Summit such that he can see and hear other heads of state through direct un-intermediated exchange of photons and sound waves.\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nA primary focus of the summit will be defense spending among NATO members.

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
