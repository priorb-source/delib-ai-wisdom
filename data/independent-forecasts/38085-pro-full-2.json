  "information": "According to data from Drought.gov on May 29, 2025, 14.5 million Florida residents, representing 73.9% of the state's population, were in drought-affected areas. Reports from late April 2025 indicated that 84% of the state was classified under moderate to extreme drought conditions, a severity level not seen since April 2012. The state has recorded its 12th driest April-to-March period since 1895, and some regions are 6-10 inches below their average rainfall since mid-October 2024.\n\nThe drought has caused significant ecological and public safety consequences. The Everglades is experiencing its worst drought in 13 years, causing some areas to dry up completely, which has led to the suspension of tourism activities like airboat tours. As of early May 2025, elevated fire risk resulted in over 100 active wildfires burning more than 3,600 acres of vegetation. In response to the dry conditions, at least 21 counties have issued burn bans.\n\nThe forecast period coincides with the start of Florida's typical rainy season on June 1, which is also the official start of the Atlantic hurricane season. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) has forecast a 60% chance of an above-average 2025 hurricane season, with 13-19 named tropical storms expected. This is attributed to factors like warmer ocean temperatures and low wind shear. However, a separate NOAA forecast from March 2025 also predicted that drought conditions in South Florida would likely persist from April through June.",

    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Approximately one month, with the resolution date on or after June 28, 2025.",
    "status_quo_outcome": "Yes. As of May 29, 2025, 14.5 million Florida residents are living in drought, which is above the 14.0 million threshold.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "A 'No' outcome would occur if an unusually wet start to the rainy season in June, potentially enhanced by an early tropical storm system, delivers widespread and significant rainfall to Florida's population centers, reducing the number of residents in drought below 14.0 million by the resolution date.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "A 'Yes' outcome occurs if the initial month of the rainy season provides insufficient or poorly distributed rainfall, failing to overcome the significant existing rainfall deficits. In this scenario, while some areas see improvement, the total number of residents in drought remains at or above 14.0 million on the resolution date.",
    "rationale": "My forecast is heavily weighted by the status quo. As of May 29, 2025, the number of Florida residents in drought is 14.5 million, providing a 500,000-person buffer above the 14.0 million threshold for a 'Yes' outcome. With only one month until the resolution date, this is a significant starting point.\n\nThe primary factor that could change this outcome is the onset of Florida's rainy season and the Atlantic hurricane season, both beginning on June 1. However, the existing drought is severe, with some regions reporting rainfall deficits of 6-10 inches. It is unlikely that one month of even average rainfall will be sufficient to reverse these conditions to the extent required to drop the affected population below the threshold. This view is supported by a NOAA forecast predicting that drought conditions in South Florida would likely persist through June.\n\nMy probability is not higher because of the inherent volatility of Florida's summer weather. NOAA has also forecast an above-average hurricane season, and a single well-placed tropical system could deliver drought-busting rains across the state within a few days, making a 'No' outcome a distinct possibility within the one-month timeframe.\n\nMy probability is not lower because the inertia of the current severe drought is substantial. Reversing this situation for over half a million people in just four weeks requires a significantly wetter-than-average month, not just a typical start to the rainy season. The expert forecast for persistent drought adds confidence to the 'Yes' scenario.\n\nI would update my forecast downward (toward 'No') if weather models show a tropical system poised to bring widespread, heavy rain to Florida before June 28. Conversely, I would update upward if the first few weeks of June are drier than normal across the state's major population centers.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill Florida have 14.0 million or more residents living in drought on June 28, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nUSA Today: [14 million Florida residents are under drought conditions, some extreme: What to know](https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2025/04/28/florida-drought-conditions-what-to-know/83328368007/)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if Drought Monitor at [this link](https://www.drought.gov/states/florida) lists greater than or equal to 14.0 million Florida residents in areas of drought, when the link is accessed by Metaculus on or after June 28, 2025. If the number is below that, this question resolves as **No**.\n\nThe question will resolve as soon as the page is accessed by Metaculus Admins on the resolution date. However, if there are issues accessing the page, then resolution will wait up until the end of the tournament's scoring at which point if Metaculus has still not been able to access the resolution source, this question will be **annulled**.\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nAccording to data from Drought.gov on May 29, 2025, 14.5 million Florida residents, representing 73.9% of the state's population, were in drought-affected areas.

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
