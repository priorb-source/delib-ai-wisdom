    "review": "All three forecasters converged on a similar range (4-10%) using comparable reasoning, which strengthens confidence in this probability band. We all emphasized the extremely short timeframe, base rates, status quo bias, and lack of clear distress signals. Forecaster 2 makes a particularly strong point that I hadn't sufficiently weighted: companies typically show public warning signs (missed payments, going concern warnings, delisting notices) well before bankruptcy filing. This is especially true for public companies with SEC reporting requirements. The fact that ChargePoint just reported Q4/FY2025 results AND the research assistant found 'no additional information available' is actually informative - if there were acute distress signals, we'd likely see news coverage, analyst warnings, or credit rating actions. Forecaster 3's emphasis on 'world changes slowly' further reinforces that 57 days is an exceptionally short window for corporate bankruptcy absent existing crisis indicators. However, I also note that the interview question specifically focuses on ChargePoint with reference to recent financial results, which could indicate the questioner has information suggesting potential concern. The EV charging sector has indeed faced headwinds that all forecasters acknowledge.",
    "rationale": "After reviewing the other analyses, I believe Forecaster 2's reasoning about warning signs typically appearing before bankruptcy is particularly compelling and I had underweighted this factor. Public companies rarely file for bankruptcy within 2 months without clear public indicators of distress first. The combination of recent financial reporting, no additional alarming information from research, and the exceptionally short timeframe (57 days) argues for a lower probability than my initial 8%. However, I don't want to over-update because: (1) the question specifically targets ChargePoint, suggesting potential concern, (2) we lack detailed financial data to confirm financial health, (3) the EV charging sector faces real challenges, and (4) tail risks exist even in short timeframes. I'm updating downward to 7% to reflect stronger weight on the 'warning signs precede bankruptcy' principle while maintaining some probability for unexpected acute financial crises.",
