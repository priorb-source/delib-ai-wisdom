    "review": "All three forecasters, including myself, identified the martial law declaration of December 2024 as the primary driver for this forecast. We share a consensus that this event creates a highly volatile political environment where large-scale protests are likely. We also agree that South Korea's robust culture of civic protest and the relatively low 10,000-participant threshold strongly favor a 'Yes' outcome. The other two forecasters arrived at a 75% probability, slightly more conservative than my initial 80%. Their primary reasons for caution, which I had also considered, were the short two-month timeframe and the possibility of a political stabilization or a lull in protest activity. Forecaster 3 articulated the 'lull' scenario particularly well, suggesting the May-June period could fall 'between major waves of mobilization' and that 'public fatigue' could set in. I found this reasoning convincing as it presents a specific and plausible narrative for a 'No' outcome that I may have slightly underweighted.",
    "rationale": "My initial forecast was 80%, based on the high political tension following the martial law crisis. After reviewing my peers' analyses, I am adjusting my forecast downward to 75%. I am not changing the core of my reasoning; I still believe a 'Yes' outcome is highly probable. However, the other forecasters' consensus at a slightly lower number, particularly Forecaster 3's argument about the potential for 'public fatigue' or a temporary lull between protest waves, persuaded me that my initial forecast was slightly overconfident. This argument provides a stronger basis for the 'No' scenario than I had originally formulated. A small downward adjustment of 5 percentage points better reflects the uncertainty that a two-month window could coincide with a temporary de-escalation in street-level mobilization, even if the underlying political crisis remains unresolved. This brings my forecast into alignment with the group consensus, which appears to be built on solid and consistent reasoning.",
