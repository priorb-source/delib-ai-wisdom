    "review": "The other forecasters raised several important considerations I should weigh more carefully. Forecaster 2 correctly emphasizes that the May 10 call was only 3 days ago, which might reduce immediate communication needs - this temporal proximity is more significant than I initially weighted. Forecaster 3 highlights a critical resolution risk: the requirement that both sides publicly acknowledge the call. Not all diplomatic phone calls receive public confirmation, especially during sensitive negotiations, and this adds meaningful uncertainty I may have underestimated. Both forecasters appropriately flag the in-person meeting possibility at Istanbul as a substitute for phone communication. Their forecasts cluster at 77-78%, compared to my 82%, suggesting I may be slightly overconfident. However, I note that all three analyses agree on the fundamental drivers: established communication pattern, active peace process, and substantial time window. The disagreement is relatively narrow and centers on weighting downside risks rather than directional assessment.",
    "rationale": "Upon reflection, I'm adjusting my forecast downward but maintaining a fairly high probability. The other forecasters make valid points about downside risks I somewhat underweighted: (1) The May 10 call being just 3 days old does reduce immediate pressure for another call, though I still believe the 33-day window and dynamic peace process create multiple future communication needs; (2) The public acknowledgment requirement genuinely adds resolution risk - some sensitive diplomatic calls may not be publicly confirmed; (3) In-person meetings remain a realistic substitute, though Trump's schedule makes Istanbul attendance uncertain. However, I continue to believe the fundamentals strongly favor Yes: the established pattern shows approximately monthly contact during this critical period, the peace process is creating ongoing coordination needs that extend well beyond the Istanbul talks, and both leaders have demonstrated clear willingness to engage directly. The ceasefire deadline extending to June 11 (30 days from May 12) means the entire resolution window coincides with active peace process management. I'm adjusting from 82% to 79% to account for the legitimate concerns about recency of last call and acknowledgment requirements, while maintaining confidence that the pattern will continue.",
