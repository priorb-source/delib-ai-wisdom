  "information": "Multiple Federal Reserve officials have emphasized a patient approach to monetary policy. Fed Chair Jerome Powell stated that the central bank is 'not in a hurry to cut interest rates' and will maintain a 'wait-and-see' approach. Similarly, Fed Governor Adriana Kugler commented that following an agreement to reduce US-China tariffs, the urgency for monetary easing has decreased. The minutes from the January FOMC meeting also indicated that officials decided to hold off on rate cuts until inflation shows more consistent improvement. In March 2025, the Federal Reserve increased its inflation estimate for the year to 2.7% and projected two potential interest rate cuts during 2025.\n\nMajor financial institutions have recently pushed back their timelines for the first interest rate cut. Goldman Sachs adjusted its forecast to expect the first cut in December 2025, a delay from its previous July expectation, citing a stable US economy. Following a stronger-than-expected jobs report, Bank of America also shifted its rate cut expectation from June to July. Morgan Stanley economists now anticipate just one rate cut in 2025, projected for July. A Bloomberg survey of economists also reflects this shift, with the consensus projection for the first Fed rate cut moving from May to July.\n\nRecent economic data and market indicators reflect a mixed economic picture. The US Consumer Price Index (CPI) showed a deceleration in its annual rate. However, the April jobs report indicated a higher-than-expected increase in non-agricultural employment, with the unemployment rate holding at 4.2%. In response to economic developments and Fed communications, market expectations have shifted. Indicators like the CME FedWatch tool show that the perceived likelihood of a rate cut in June has decreased, with many market participants now viewing September or later as the most probable period for the start of an easing cycle.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Approximately 1.5 months. The final relevant FOMC meeting before the deadline is on June 17-18, 2025.",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No. The Federal Reserve continues to hold the federal funds rate at its current level, emphasizing the need for more data confirming inflation is moving sustainably towards its 2% target.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Inflation and labor market data released in May and June 2025 continue to show economic resilience. Inflation remains stubbornly above the Fed's target, and the unemployment rate holds steady. Citing these factors, the FOMC announces its decision to maintain the current federal funds rate target range following its June meeting.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "A series of unexpectedly weak economic reports are released before the June 2025 FOMC meeting. This includes a significant drop in inflation indicators and a surprising jump in the unemployment rate, signaling a rapid cooling of the economy. This data prompts the FOMC to announce a 'preventative' cut to the federal funds rate to mitigate a potential recession.",
    "rationale": "My forecast is primarily driven by the Federal Reserve's consistent and explicit communication, which strongly signals a patient, data-dependent approach. The status quo outcome is heavily weighted, as there is significant inertia in monetary policy, and the bar for a rate cut remains high.\n\nThe research material reinforces this view. Fed officials, including Chair Powell, have stated they are 'not in a hurry to cut'. The Fed's own projections from March 2025 already account for two cuts later in the year, not before July. Furthermore, a strong consensus has formed among major financial institutions (Goldman Sachs, Bank of America, Morgan Stanley), all of whom have recently pushed their forecasts for the first rate cut to July 2025 or later, citing economic stability.\n\nMy probability is not lower because economic conditions can change rapidly. An unforeseen shock or a series of surprisingly weak data points before the June FOMC meeting could still force the Fed's hand. There is a non-zero chance that the labor market weakens more quickly than anticipated, which is a key factor for the committee.\n\nMy probability is not higher because the timeline is very short, with only one FOMC meeting left before the resolution date. The recent economic data, while showing some inflation deceleration, still reflects a strong labor market. It would require a dramatic and unambiguous deterioration in the economic outlook over the next month to overcome the committee's stated patience and trigger a cut in June.\n\nI would increase my forecast's probability if the May CPI and Jobs reports are significantly weaker than expected. I would decrease it if those same reports come in hotter than expected, reinforcing the 'higher for longer' narrative.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill the Federal Reserve cut interest rates before July 1, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nJP Morgan: [Following the Fed’s decision to pause rate cuts, what could its next move be?](https://www.jpmorgan.com/insights/global-research/economy/fed-rate-cuts)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if, after the launch of this question and before July 1, 2025 the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) announces a reduction of any amount in the target federal funds rate range.\r\nThe primary resolution source is the FOMC's *target federal funds rate or range* webpage [here](https://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/openmarket.htm), the Federal Reserve's official minutes and statements [here](https://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/fomccalendars.htm), or other [credible sources](https://www.metaculus.com/help/faq/#definitions) in case the Federal Reserve's website is unavailable or not timely updated.\n\nThis question resolves based on the announcement. Therefore, the effective date of the rate cut does not need to be before the resolution date, as long as the announcement is made before then.\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nMultiple Federal Reserve officials have emphasized a patient approach to monetary policy.

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
