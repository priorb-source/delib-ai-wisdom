    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Less than 2 months - approximately 57 days until July 1, 2025",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No - Chegg does not file for bankruptcy",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Chegg continues operating through June 30, 2025 without filing for bankruptcy protection. Despite facing significant competitive pressure from ChatGPT and AI tools affecting their core business model, the company manages to avoid bankruptcy through cost-cutting measures, debt refinancing, securing bridge financing, or simply maintaining sufficient liquidity to continue operations through the resolution date.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Chegg's financial situation deteriorates rapidly over the next two months. The company faces an acute liquidity crisis, cannot meet debt obligations or covenant requirements, fails to secure additional financing, and management determines that bankruptcy protection under Chapter 11 (or potentially Chapter 7) is the only viable option. They file a petition before July 1, 2025.",
    "rationale": "The WSJ article headline indicates ChatGPT has significantly disrupted Chegg's business model as an online education platform, likely undermining their subscription-based homework help services. This represents a genuine existential threat to their business model. However, several factors strongly favor the status quo (no bankruptcy): First, the timeframe is extremely short at under two months. Bankruptcy filings are discrete, dramatic events that typically occur after companies exhaust multiple alternatives including debt restructuring, asset sales, emergency financing, and operational changes. Even severely distressed companies often operate for extended periods before filing. Second, without access to current financial details (cash position, debt structure, covenant compliance, recent earnings), I must rely on base rates - and the base rate of bankruptcy filings for any company in a 2-month window is very low, even for struggling firms. Third, companies experiencing business model disruption typically have time to adapt, pivot, or manage decline before reaching the point of bankruptcy filing. Why my forecast is not higher: The extremely short timeframe is the primary constraint. Even if Chegg is in serious financial distress, two months is a very compressed period for a bankruptcy filing to occur. Most distressed companies take longer to exhaust alternatives. Why my forecast is not lower: The WSJ headline language 'brought down' suggests severe, not moderate, impact. AI competition is real, immediate, and likely accelerating. If Chegg was already on thin ice financially before this reporting, rapid deterioration is possible. To update higher, I would need evidence of: missed debt payments, hiring of bankruptcy counsel, emergency board meetings, severe credit rating downgrades, or public statements about financial distress. To update lower, I would need: recent financial reports showing adequate liquidity, successful debt refinancing, or signs of business stabilization. My forecast weighs the severe business disruption against the low base rate of bankruptcy filings in such a compressed timeframe.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill Chegg file for bankruptcy before July 1, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nWall Street Journal: [How ChatGPT Brought Down an Online Education Giant](https://www.wsj.com/tech/ai/how-chatgpt-brought-down-an-online-education-giant-200b4ff2)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question will resolve as **Yes** if Chegg, Inc., files any petition for bankruptcy protection in the United States, under any chapter of the United States Bankruptcy Code, before July 1, 2025. The question will resolves on the filing of such a petition, not on whether any bankruptcy protection is granted by a court. If no such petition is filed by that date, this question will resolve as **No**.\n\n\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nNo additional information available.\n\nToday is 2025-05-05.\n\nBefore answering you think:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n(e) You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
