  "information": "GameStop's annual shareholder meetings have historically been held in the first half of June. Recent meetings have shown a pattern of being held on a Thursday. Past dates include June 2, 2022 (Thursday), June 15, 2023 (Thursday), and an initial schedule of June 13, 2024 (Thursday). The 2024 virtual meeting was adjourned to a later date after its servers crashed due to overwhelming interest from shareholders attempting to join the webcast.\n\nAs of late May 2025, no definitive proxy statement (DEF 14A) filed by GameStop with the SEC for its 2025 annual meeting has been located. According to SEC rules, such a filing is required ahead of a shareholder meeting. Business information aggregators present conflicting information: Computershare, GameStop's transfer agent, lists the meeting for June 2, 2025, while sources like Business Insider and Bloomberg terminals list June 12, 2025. The Business Insider entry also contains an apparent error regarding a dividend payment.\n\nIt is standard corporate practice for companies to avoid rescheduling an annual meeting within a two-week period unless there is a significant reason. Meetings can sometimes be intentionally adjourned if a controversial proposal requires more time for proxy solicitation. GameStop has previously done this for a share-increase motion. The technical failure that affected GameStop's 2024 meeting is a known risk, though many other large-cap companies regularly hold virtual meetings without major incidents.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Approximately 16 days.",
    "status_quo_outcome": "The meeting date is unconfirmed. While historical patterns and some data aggregators point to June 12, the lack of an official SEC filing and conflicting information from other sources creates significant uncertainty.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "GameStop's definitive proxy statement (DEF 14A) is filed and officially sets a different date, such as June 2. Alternatively, the meeting is scheduled for June 12 but is postponed and not completed on that day due to a repeat of the technical issues seen in 2024 or for strategic reasons.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "GameStop files its definitive proxy statement with the SEC confirming the annual meeting will be held on June 12, 2025, and the meeting proceeds and is fully completed on that date without adjournment.",
    "rationale": "My forecast of 65% is based on a balance of supporting patterns and significant unresolved uncertainties. The primary factor supporting a 'Yes' outcome is that June 12, 2025, is a Thursday, which aligns perfectly with GameStop's recent history of holding its annual meetings on a Thursday in early-to-mid June (e.g., 2022, 2023, and the initial 2024 schedule). Furthermore, reputable financial data providers like Bloomberg list this as the meeting date.\n\nHowever, I am not forecasting a higher probability due to several critical countervailing factors. The most significant is the absence of an official Definitive Proxy Statement (DEF 14A) filed with the SEC as of May 27, 2025. This document is the ultimate source of truth for the meeting date, and its absence this close to the proposed date is a major source of uncertainty. Compounding this is the conflicting information from Computershare, GameStop's own transfer agent, which lists the meeting for June 2. This is a credible source in direct contradiction with the Bloomberg data.\n\nMy forecast is not lower because the Thursday-in-June pattern is a strong prior. The risk of a technical failure leading to postponement, as happened in 2024, is real and accounts for some of the remaining uncertainty, especially given the strict resolution criteria. The conflicting data, however, is the main reason the probability is not in the 80-90% range.\n\nI would significantly increase my forecast to over 95% upon the filing of a DEF 14A that confirms the June 12 date. Conversely, my forecast would drop to near 0% if the filing confirms any other date.",

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any).
