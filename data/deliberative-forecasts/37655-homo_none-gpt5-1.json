    "review": "Both forecasters reinforce the same baseline I used: elections aren’t held under martial law and Ukraine has favored rolling 90‑day extensions with no commitment to dates. The most useful addition is Forecaster 2’s point about typical timing—Rada usually sets dates roughly within the statutory pre‑election window (around ~90 days), making an early, far‑in‑advance announcement atypical. Forecaster 3 also emphasizes that a parliamentary resolution would be publicly visible and unlikely to materialize overnight, which tightens the near‑term hurdle. I find these arguments credible and directionally consistent with my view; they slightly strengthen the case against a June announcement absent clear precursors.",
    "rationale": "Time left is ~46 days. The status quo is martial law with a well‑established pattern of 90‑day extensions and deferral of national elections. An announcement would almost certainly require a Verkhovna Rada resolution, which tends to occur within the statutory pre‑election period and is usually preceded by visible political/legal preparation. There are no signals of imminent lifting of martial law, a ceasefire, or fast‑tracked legal changes enabling elections during martial law. While a tail scenario exists where Kyiv names a distant date as a political signal contingent on future conditions, the added procedural/timing arguments from the other forecasters make that even less likely on this short horizon. Accordingly, I nudge my estimate down modestly from 12% to reflect the low probability of a June parliamentary move without prior public groundwork.",
