    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "About 1 month (until July 1, 2025)",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Norman continues positioning and fundraising for a possible 2026 run but holds off on a formal declaration until later in 2025 or early 2026; or he publicly recommits to running for House in 2026 and delays any Senate decision.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Norman decides to challenge Sen. Lindsey Graham and announces before the June 30 FEC quarterly cutoff to post a Q2 fundraising number, or he schedules a late-June kickoff event following leaks/endorsements that make an early entry advantageous.",
    "rationale": "- Baseline/time factor: There is only about a month left for a declaration. In U.S. Senate cycles, many challengers announce roughly 12–15 months before a primary, often in late summer/fall. An announcement before July 1, 2025 would be on the early side but not unprecedented.\n- Status quo weight: The default is no declaration in the next month; most potential challengers continue to explore and build quietly before a formal launch. With no fresh signals, the world tends to change slowly, favoring a No outcome.\n- Incentives/countervailing factors:\n  • Reasons for an early Yes: locking in donors and staff, deterring rivals, and capturing a Q2 fundraising report (deadline June 30) can create a small near-term spike in announcement likelihood.\n  • Reasons against: Challenging an incumbent like Graham is high-stakes; Norman may want more private coalition-building (including clarity on Trump’s stance) before committing. He can still announce later in 2025 and be viable.\n- Evidence/signals: The only cited item is a 2023 Axios piece suggesting a possible challenge in 2026; my research assistant provided no additional, recent indications of an imminent launch. Absent credible reporting of a rollout, staff hires, domain activity, or an exploratory committee with a dated timeline, the near-term probability stays modest.\n- Why not higher? Short window left; lack of current reporting or concrete pre-launch signals; early announcements are possible but not the modal behavior for such a challenge.\n- Why not lower? Persistent rumor base since 2023, and the Q2 fundraising deadline can induce late-June announcements. Early entries can also be strategic to box out other right-wing challengers.\n- What would move me up: Reputable reports of a scheduled announcement event, FEC filings indicating a switch to/creation of a Senate committee, visible senior staff recruitment in SC for a Senate bid, or a high-profile endorsement pushing him to launch now.\n- What would move me down: Public statements recommitting to a 2026 House race, endorsements of Graham, or reporting that Norman is deferring any Senate decision until fall 2025.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill Ralph Norman declare his candidacy for the US Senate race in South Carolina before July 1, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nAxios: [Sen. Lindsey Graham may face right-wing primary challenge in 2026](https://www.axios.com/2023/09/13/lindsey-graham-primary-challenge-ralph-norman)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if Will Ralph Norman declares his candidacy for the US Senate race in South Carolina before July 1, 2025. If no such announcement has been made before that date, the question resolves as **No**.\n\n\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nNo additional information available.\n\nToday is 2025-05-30.\n\nBefore answering you think:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n(e) You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
