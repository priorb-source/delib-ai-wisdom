    "review": "All three forecasters are in strong agreement on the core factors driving this forecast. We all concluded that the probability is extremely low due to the very short timeline (less than two months), the complete lack of political or legislative groundwork, and the fact that an independence referendum represents a radical departure from the Alberta government's stated strategy of seeking greater autonomy *within* Canada. We all identified the only plausible path to a 'Yes' outcome as a sudden, severe political crisis with the federal government that provokes an unforeseen, reactive decision from the Premier. The only difference between our analyses is the precise probability we assign to this low-probability tail-risk event, with forecasts ranging from 1% to my initial 3%.",
    "rationale": "I am updating my forecast downward. The other forecasters' analyses were highly convincing and aligned almost perfectly with my own, but their lower probabilities have persuaded me that I may have been slightly overweighting the 'unpredictability' of the Premier and underweighting the immense institutional inertia. I found Forecaster 2's specific mention of likely opposition from the 'business community... and even factions within the Premier's own party' to be a particularly compelling point. These are powerful, concrete constraints that would act as a significant brake on any sudden decision, even in a crisis scenario. My initial forecast of 3% acknowledged the tail risk, but considering these strong internal and external braking mechanisms, a 2% forecast seems more calibrated. It better reflects the overwhelming political and logistical barriers while still acknowledging that in a volatile political environment, a highly improbable event is not an impossible one. Therefore, I am lowering my forecast from 3% to 2%.",
