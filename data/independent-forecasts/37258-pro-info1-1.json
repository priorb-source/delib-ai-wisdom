  "information": "A 2022 UK Supreme Court ruling established that the Scottish Parliament cannot unilaterally hold a legally binding independence referendum without the approval of the UK Parliament in Westminster. The UK government has consistently denied requests for another referendum, a position reiterated by the UK Labour party. The previous independence referendum in 2014 was announced approximately two years before it was held, and precedent suggests constitutional changes require around 18 months of legal and administrative lead time.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Approximately 2 months",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No. The current political and legal situation presents significant barriers to the Scottish Government announcing a referendum date, and this is unlikely to change in the short timeframe.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "The new SNP leader prioritizes stabilizing their party and government, and focuses on building support for independence ahead of the next UK General Election. Given the UK Supreme Court ruling and opposition from Westminster, they do not make a unilateral announcement of a referendum date before July 1, 2025.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "In a bid to galvanize the independence movement and consolidate their new leadership, the next First Minister makes a bold political statement by officially announcing a date for a consultative, non-binding independence referendum, deliberately creating a constitutional clash with the UK government.",
    "rationale": "My forecast is heavily weighted towards the 'No' outcome, primarily due to the powerful constraints of the status quo. The primary barrier is the 2022 UK Supreme Court ruling, which established that the Scottish Parliament cannot legislate for a referendum without Westminster's approval. This legal reality is paired with a firm political reality: both the current Conservative UK government and the Labour party, who are favored to win the next general election, have consistently refused to grant the necessary authority. The timeframe for this question, less than two months, is also extremely short for such a momentous political announcement, especially considering historical precedent for planning referendums. Furthermore, the governing Scottish National Party (SNP) is currently undergoing a leadership transition, and it is far more likely a new leader will focus on party unity and domestic priorities than on initiating a high-risk constitutional confrontation with no clear legal path forward. The probability is not lower than 5% because the question's resolution criteria hinge only on an announcement from a Scottish authority, not on the referendum's legality. A new, radical leader could use such a symbolic announcement as a political tool to rally their base, making it a low-probability but not impossible scenario. The probability is not higher because the combined legal, political, and logistical hurdles are substantial, and pursuing this path would be a strategically risky move for a new leader. I would raise my forecast if the new SNP leader explicitly campaigns on and wins the leadership with a promise to announce a date immediately. I would lower it if the new leadership publicly commits to a more long-term strategy.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nBefore July 1, 2025, will the government of Scotland officially announce a date for an independence referendum?\n\nQuestion background:\nThe National: [Yes posts huge 11-point lead in new Scottish independence poll](https://www.thenational.scot/news/25089457.yes-posts-huge-11-point-lead-new-scottish-independence-poll/)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if, before July 1, 2025, a referendum on the independence of Scotland from the United Kingdom is officially scheduled. If this does not occur before that date, this question resolves as **No**.\n\nFor purposes of this question, the referendum will be considered \"officially scheduled\" when it is announced by a person or entity with the authority to do so within Scotland. Please note that broader legality, such as within the United Kingdom, will be considered irrelevant for this question, so if the federal government declared the referendum illegal, the question would still resolve as Yes.\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nA 2022 UK Supreme Court ruling established that the Scottish Parliament cannot unilaterally hold a legally binding independence referendum without the approval of the UK Parliament in Westminster. The UK government has consistently denied requests for another referendum, a position reiterated by the UK Labour party. The previous independence referendum in 2014 was announced approximately two years before it was held, and precedent suggests constitutional changes require around 18 months of legal and administrative lead time.\n\nToday is 2025-05-02.\n\nBefore answering you think:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n(e) You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
