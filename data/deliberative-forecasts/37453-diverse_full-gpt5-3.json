    "review": "Both forecasters converge on a low probability driven by the compressed timeline and sequential procedural hurdles. They add emphasis on the time cost of Elections Alberta’s verification and the need for a formal petition submission, which are good practical constraints. I agree with the general direction and the “status quo = No” framing. Where I diverge slightly is that a verified petition is not strictly necessary for a Yes outcome: the cabinet has the authority to set a referendum date without petition certification if it chooses, and the resolution cares only about an authorized actor announcing a date. That slightly offsets the heavy weight they place on verification as a prerequisite. They also implicitly assume the government would only announce after verification and with a fully specified date; governments often prefer vague timing (“2026”), which would not meet the resolution’s bar, further lowering odds. Net, their arguments largely reinforce my view; the added emphasis on verification time is counterbalanced by the possibility of cabinet action without it, leaving my estimate essentially unchanged.",
    "rationale": "Time remaining is ~55 days. The modal path to Yes is: rapid petition submission in May, unusually fast verification in June, and a cabinet decision to announce a specific 2026 date before July 1. Each step is feasible but collectively unlikely, especially given Premier Smith’s stated preference for a citizen-led process and a 2026 horizon, and visible political risks (Indigenous opposition, NDP criticism). The government retains unilateral authority to announce a date even without verification, but its incentives favor preserving leverage without committing to a specific date yet. Announcing an exact date is a high-salience escalation with few immediate benefits and real costs. The petition organizers’ early claims are unverified, and even if the threshold is met, specifying an exact date (not just “2026”) by July 1 is an additional hurdle. Upside movers: confirmed petition submission plus credible signals of expedited verification; major political shock increasing separatist mobilization; explicit government guidance that certification will immediately trigger a date announcement. Downside movers: delays in petition submission; Elections Alberta indicating standard/lengthy verification timelines; government statements ruling out any date announcement before summer. Given these, I keep my estimate low and unchanged.",
