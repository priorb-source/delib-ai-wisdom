    "review": "The other two forecasters and I are in strong agreement on the fundamental reasoning. We all identified the extremely short timeframe (~45 days) and the complete lack of any public preparatory signals (e.g., hiring bankers, media leaks) as the dominant factors making a 'Yes' outcome highly unlikely. We also all noted that Anthropic's successful private funding rounds reduce the immediate need for a public offering. The only difference is the final low-probability estimate, with Forecaster 2 aligning with my initial 10% and Forecaster 3 arguing for a more conservative 5%. I found Forecaster 3's reasoning compelling, as they placed a slightly heavier, and I believe more appropriate, weight on the logistical and regulatory hurdles of the IPO process, which are less subject to the 'dynamic' nature of the AI industry.",
    "rationale": "After reviewing the other analyses, I am lowering my forecast. My initial reasoning stands, but the deliberation has convinced me that my 10% probability was slightly too high. The other forecasters reinforced the sheer improbability of an IPO announcement within the next ~45 days, given the typical 6-12 month preparation timeline and the total absence of any preparatory signals. Forecaster 3's analysis, in particular, made me weigh these logistical barriers more heavily. While the AI sector is volatile and a strategic surprise is possible, the operational realities of filing an S-1 make such a surprise extremely difficult to execute in secret and on this timeline. Therefore, I am reducing my forecast from 10% to 7% to better reflect the very high probability of the status quo holding for the resolution period, while still acknowledging a small, non-zero chance of an unexpected announcement.",
