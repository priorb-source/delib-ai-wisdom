  "information": "Starlink's parent company, SpaceX, has a regional partnership with Airtel Africa to provide high-speed internet services to its customers across the continent. Geographically, Lesotho is a landlocked country, entirely surrounded by South Africa, where Starlink is not yet licensed to operate. The country has a small area of approximately 30,355 km² and is characterized by mountainous terrain.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Less than 2 months.",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Despite the license being granted in April 2025, minor bureaucratic or logistical delays in setting up ground services, importation of hardware, or finalizing operational details push the official service launch just past the July 1, 2025 deadline.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Leveraging the recent license grant, Starlink prioritizes the rollout in Lesotho. Making use of its agile deployment capabilities and potentially existing ground stations in nearby active countries like Eswatini or Mozambique, the company completes the necessary preparations and officially lists the service as 'Available' on its map sometime in June 2025.",
    "rationale": "The most significant factor driving this forecast is the official granting of a license to Starlink by Lesotho in April 2025. This removes the largest and most unpredictable barrier to entry. Starlink has a history of rapid deployment in new markets following regulatory approval. The small geographic size of Lesotho also simplifies a nationwide rollout. The primary factor against a 'Yes' resolution is the very tight timeline, with less than two months remaining until the deadline. Rollouts, even for an agile company like SpaceX, can encounter unforeseen logistical or final-stage bureaucratic delays that consume time. The status quo is 'No', and pushing a new country live involves more than a simple switch-flick. However, the precedent of fast rollouts in other African nations and the momentum from the recent approval suggest that a launch within this timeframe is more likely than not. My forecast is not higher because a 2.5-month turnaround from license-to-launch is quick, and a small delay could easily push the date into July. It is not lower because the main hurdle has been cleared, and Starlink has a strong commercial incentive to activate service as quickly as possible. I would raise my probability if Starlink opened pre-orders for Lesotho or made an official announcement of an upcoming launch. I would lower it if the deadline approaches with no official updates or if credible reports of implementation delays emerge.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill Starlink's website show Lesotho as a country with Starlink availability before July 1, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\n[Lesotho grants license to Musk's Starlink](https://www.ewn.co.za/2025/04/14/lesotho-grants-license-to-musks-starlink)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if, before July 1, 2025, the [Starlink Availability Map](https://www.starlink.com/us/map) has anywhere in Lesotho listed as \"Available.\"\n\n\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nStarlink's parent company, SpaceX, has a regional partnership with Airtel Africa to provide high-speed internet services to its customers across the continent. Geographically, Lesotho is a landlocked country, entirely surrounded by South Africa, where Starlink is not yet licensed to operate. The country has a small area of approximately 30,355 km² and is characterized by mountainous terrain.\n\nToday is 2025-05-07.\n\nBefore answering you think:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n(e) You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
