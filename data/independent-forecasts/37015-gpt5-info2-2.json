  "information": "Multiple polls conducted in April 2025 show Han Duck-soo's public support ranging between 2% and 12%. Lee Jae-myung of the opposition Democratic Party leads in polls with approximately 46% support. One poll from April 20 indicated that 66% of respondents found Han's potential candidacy 'unacceptable'. Despite low public support, a faction within the People Power Party, with reports of over 50 lawmakers and a 'National Candidate Support Committee', are actively urging him to run.",

    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "About 13 days (until May 5, 2025)",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No announcement by May 5, 2025",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Han, citing the need for neutrality as acting president and weak public support, explicitly declines or keeps deferring a decision past May 5 while PPP consolidates around an alternative (e.g., a governor/mayor, senior party figure, or compromise candidate). He remains a caretaker through the election period.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Under mounting elite pressure and a rapid nomination process, PPP leaders publicly coalesce behind Han as the unity/stability candidate. He signals acceptance and announces before May 5 (potentially paired with or followed by a resignation timetable to avoid neutrality concerns).",
    "rationale": "Time is short and the status quo favors caution. As acting president, Han would face intense scrutiny over neutrality and likely pressure to resign upon announcing or soon after—an unusually high cost in a compressed timeline. The most relevant precedent is 2017, when Acting President Hwang Kyo-ahn ultimately declined to run in the snap presidential election, reinforcing a norm against using the acting presidency as a launchpad. Polling headwinds are substantial: per the research assistant, Han’s support sits roughly 2–12% and 66% view his potential candidacy as unacceptable, while opposition leader Lee Jae-myung polls around 46%. These numbers make a late-breaking candidacy risky and reduce the incentive to jump in. \n\nHowever, there is real elite pressure: over 50 PPP lawmakers and a formal support committee reportedly urging him to run. A June snap election compresses calendars, so if he were to run, an announcement could plausibly come before May 5 to allow registration and campaign ramp-up. That elite coordination risk prevents assigning a very low probability.\n\nWhy not higher: weak public support, strong negatives, acting-president neutrality optics, and a strong precedent against running from that position all bias toward a ‘No’. Why not lower: organized intra-party drafting effort, the need for a quick nominee in a June election, and the possibility that party elites decide only Han can carry a ‘stability’ message, prompting a swift announcement.\n\nWhat would move me up: credible reports that PPP leadership formally anoints Han as the consensus nominee; news of Han preparing to resign as PM/acting president; scheduling of a PPP nomination process tailored to him; formation of an official exploratory/campaign apparatus with a near-term announcement date. What would move me down: Han publicly ruling out a run; PPP coalescing around another named candidate; internal PPP leaks indicating he refused; worsening polling or negative events tying his acting role to campaign controversy.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill Han Duck-soo announce his candidacy for South Korean president before May 5, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nThe Chosun Daily: [Support grows in PPP to draft Acting President Han for June election](https://www.koreaherald.com/article/10464554)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if Han Duck-soo announces his candidacy for president of South Korea before May 5, 2025. If no such announcement has been made before that date, the question resolves as **No**.\n\n\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nMultiple polls conducted in April 2025 show Han Duck-soo's public support ranging between 2% and 12%.

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
