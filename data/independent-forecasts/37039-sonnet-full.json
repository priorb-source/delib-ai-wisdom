  "information": "On April 2-3, 2025, the U.S. President announced comprehensive tariffs. The policy included a 10% base tariff on goods from almost all countries, effective April 5, and additional country-specific tariffs to take effect on April 9. For Switzerland, the total tariff was set at 31%. The stated justifications included that Switzerland had been 'taking advantage' of the US and as a response to alleged 61% tariffs imposed by Switzerland on American products.\n\nThe Swiss government, including President Karin Keller-Sutter, expressed 'incomprehension' regarding the tariff calculation. Swiss officials stated that the country imposes a 0% tariff on US imports, and that Swiss companies have created 500,000 jobs in the US. Switzerland's trade surplus with the US was $38.5 billion in 2024. The Swiss watch industry was noted as being particularly affected, with share prices for major exporters like Richemont and Swatch falling after the announcement.\n\nThe 31% additional ad valorem duty for Swiss products was officially listed under subheading 9903.01.60 of the U.S. Harmonized Tariff Schedule (HTS). On April 10, 2025, the U.S. administration announced that the country-specific tariffs, including the one for Switzerland, would be suspended for 90 days to allow for negotiations. This suspension period is scheduled to run until July 9, 2025, covering the June 1 resolution date. The HTS listing for Switzerland under subheading 9903.01.60 reflects the 31% rate but is marked as 'suspended'.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "38 days until June 1, 2025",
    "status_quo_outcome": "YES - The 31% tariff for Switzerland is already listed in the Harmonized Tariff Schedule under subheading 9903.01.60 as of April 10, 2025, and the resolution criteria explicitly state that suspension status does not affect resolution",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "The US and Switzerland reach a trade agreement during the 90-day negotiation period that results in the tariff being removed or modified in the HTS listing before June 1, or the US unilaterally removes or changes the tariff listing through administrative action",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "The status quo persists - the 31% tariff remains listed in subheading 9903.01.60 of the HTS regardless of whether it remains suspended or becomes active, as negotiations continue through the 90-day suspension period ending July 9",
    "rationale": "The critical factor here is that the 31% tariff is ALREADY officially listed in the Harmonized Tariff Schedule under subheading 9903.01.60 as of April 10, 2025. The resolution criteria explicitly state that 'Whether the provision is listed as suspended will not affect resolution,' meaning the current suspended status is irrelevant - only the listing itself matters. With just 38 days until resolution, the status quo strongly favors YES. The tariff was formally implemented on April 9, then suspended on April 10 for 90 days (until July 9), but the HTS listing itself remains at 31%. For a NO outcome, there would need to be active administrative changes to remove or modify the HTS listing before June 1. However, several factors make this unlikely: (1) bureaucratic inertia typically prevents rapid changes to official tariff schedules, (2) negotiations are ongoing with a July 9 deadline, suggesting the US would wait for negotiation outcomes before making permanent changes, (3) the short 38-day timeframe makes major policy reversals less probable. While US-Switzerland negotiations could theoretically produce an early agreement removing the tariff, Switzerland's strong objections and the complexity of trade negotiations make a resolution within 38 days unlikely. The Swiss government's 'incomprehension' and emphasis on their 0% tariffs on US goods suggests difficult negotiations ahead. My forecast is not higher (e.g., 95%) because: genuine possibility exists for negotiated removal, potential for broader tariff policy reversal under political pressure, and administrative corrections remain possible. My forecast is not lower (e.g., 50%) because: the tariff is already listed, bureaucratic systems change slowly, the negotiation period extends beyond June 1, and the explicit exclusion of suspension status from resolution criteria means the current listing satisfies the YES condition. I would update higher with signs of stalled negotiations or reaffirmed US tariff stance, and lower with breakthrough negotiation news or signals of imminent tariff removal.",
