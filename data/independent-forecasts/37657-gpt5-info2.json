  "information": "As of May 16, 2025, no human cases of HKU5-CoV-2 have been reported by any major global health organizations, including the WHO, US CDC, ProMED, or GISAID. Post-COVID surveillance systems are in place in several countries, including China, Korea, and the U.S., which involve routine metagenomic sequencing of severe acute respiratory infection (SARI) cases. To date, these surveillance efforts have not detected any signals of HKU5-CoV-2 in human populations.",

    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "About 46 days (until July 1, 2025)",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No human cases reported (No)",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Ongoing zoonotic surveillance (SARI/severe pneumonia sequencing and sentinel systems in China, Korea, U.S., etc.) continues to find no HKU5-CoV-2 in humans; no WHO/CDC/ProMED reports; the date passes without any credible-source confirmation.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "A spillover case (or small cluster) with severe pneumonia occurs in a region conducting metagenomic sequencing; the virus is identified as HKU5-CoV-2 (or an unmistakably synonymous designation) and WHO/CDC reference it in a report or situation update before July 1, 2025.",
    "rationale": "- Baseline: As of 2025-05-16, there are zero human cases reported by WHO, US CDC, ProMED, or GISAID (per research assistant). Multiple countries maintain routine sequencing of SARI cases post-COVID, and no HKU5-CoV-2 signal has emerged.\n- Timeframe: Only ~6.5 weeks remain. For this to resolve Yes, both a zoonotic spillover and timely detection/confirmation/reporting by a credible source must occur within this window. That compound event is rare on short horizons.\n- Biology/plausibility: HKU5-lineage coronaviruses are bat merbecoviruses. While merbecoviruses include MERS-CoV (known to infect humans via DPP4), most HKU5 viruses have not demonstrated efficient human infection. In the absence of data showing human receptor usage or human-airway replication, immediate spillover risk appears low.\n- Surveillance and reporting bar: The question requires a credible-source report (WHO/CDC). Even if a sporadic human infection occurred, it would still need to be sequenced, attributed specifically to HKU5-CoV-2 (or clearly synonymous nomenclature), and publicly reported before July 1.\n- Why not higher: No current signals; strong negative evidence from ongoing SARI sequencing; short time left; additional hurdle that major orgs may not adopt the HKU5-CoV-2 label unless the event is notable.\n- Why not lower: Nonzero spillover risk remains for merbecoviruses; improved metagenomic surveillance raises the chance a single unusual case could be detected; occasional fast-turnaround reporting can occur for novel coronaviruses causing severe disease.\n- What would move me up: (1) Lab or preprint evidence that HKU5-CoV-2 uses a human receptor (e.g., DPP4) and replicates in primary human airway cells; (2) detection in intermediate hosts with close human contact (e.g., camels or livestock) near outbreak-prone areas; (3) ProMED/local CDC reports of unexplained severe pneumonia clusters in regions where HKU5-CoV-2 was found in animals, with hints of a merbecovirus; (4) any credible source mentioning suspected or confirmed HKU5-CoV-2 in humans.\n- What would move me down: (1) Clarifications that the initial finding is retracted/reclassified; (2) explicit statements from WHO/CDC or national CDCs that no human infections have been detected alongside additional weeks of quiet surveillance; (3) mid-June passes with no signals, further compressing the window for detection and reporting.\nGiven the short horizon, lack of signals, and credible-source requirement, the status quo outcome is No, with a small tail risk of a detected spillover.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill there be any human cases of the novel coronavirus, HKU5-CoV-2, before July 1, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\n[Discovery of HKU5-CoV-2, a Novel Coronavirus in China](https://assure-test.com/discovery-of-hku5-cov-2-a-novel-coronavirus-in-china/)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if before July 1, 2025, there are any human cases reported anywhere globally of HKU5-CoV-2.\n\nQuestion resolves according to [credible sources](https://www.metaculus.com/help/faq/#definitions), especially the World Health Organization or US Centers for Disease Control.\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nAs of May 16, 2025, no human cases of HKU5-CoV-2 have been reported by any major global health organizations, including the WHO, US CDC, ProMED, or GISAID. Post-COVID surveillance systems are in place in several countries, including China, Korea, and the U.S., which involve routine metagenomic sequencing of severe acute respiratory infection (SARI) cases. To date, these surveillance efforts have not detected any signals of HKU5-CoV-2 in human populations.\n\nToday is 2025-05-16.\n\nBefore answering you think:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n(e) You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
