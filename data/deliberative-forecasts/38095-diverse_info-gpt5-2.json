    "review": "New and useful points: Forecaster 2 adds an empirical claim about a ~25/month cadence Jan–Apr and a more institutionalized process (new pardon attorney/“pardon czar”), which, if accurate, meaningfully raises the base rate versus my earlier “lumpy bursts” framing. Forecaster 3 contributes a historical base rate (zero June clemencies in Trump’s first term) and specific pending cases (Whitmer plot defendants). I find F2’s argument more decision-relevant: the current-term flow and infrastructure dominate first-term month-specific seasonality, especially with the very low threshold (>2). F3’s base-rate argument feels miscalibrated to a different regime; the administration appears to be actively using clemency this term. That said, F3 rightly highlights lumpy timing and the risk that June could be skipped in favor of a July 4 package. Overall, F2 pushes me upward modestly; F3 reinforces, but doesn’t outweigh, the “June lull” risk I’d already considered.",
    "rationale": "My prior (65%) leaned Yes due to the low threshold, fresh May spree (≈25 actions), and likely pipeline, but allowed for a post-spree cooldown and a July 4 cluster. Incorporating F2’s points about a sustained monthly pace and institutionalization increases the likelihood that at least a trickle continues into June even if the next big tranche is July. The threshold is so low that a single small announcement (3 names) resolves Yes. F3’s first-term June-zero base rate is less persuasive given the apparent change in tempo and structure this term. Key downside risks remain: strategic deferral to Independence Day optics, or a temporary pause due to blowback or process friction. On balance, current-term evidence and operational capacity argue for a higher probability than my initial call, but I stop short of F2’s 85% to reflect the meaningful “skip June” risk after a late-May blitz. I will update higher if we see early-June individual grants or credible reporting tying clemencies to Juneteenth; I’d move lower if reporting indicates consolidation for a July 4 package or an explicit pause.",
