    "review": "Both forecasters largely mirror my initial logic: small current edge for Milei, slow-moving Morning Consult series, and the tie-as-No rule pulling the probability back toward even. Forecaster 3 adds two useful emphasis points: the integer rounding on the MC display and the fact that the specific weekly snapshot “when checked” introduces extra timing noise—both increase effective tie risk. Forecaster 2’s mention of potential Argentine macro/legislative tailwinds is reasonable, but it’s balanced by Sheinbaum’s early-term stickiness around ~60%. Neither brings decisive new evidence that would materially shift my view; their ranges (53–56%) bracket my prior.\n",
    "rationale": "Time remaining is ~6 weeks. The current 1-point Milei edge is within typical MC week-to-week variation and rounding, and a tie resolves No. Sheinbaum’s approvals are plausibly sticky near 60 in an early term; Milei may enjoy modest macro tailwinds (disinflation/fiscal wins), but his series has been more volatile. The “on or after June 28” resolution adds snapshot risk that again favors No at the margin if the gap collapses to a tie. Netting a slight status-quo advantage for Milei against tie-and-timing penalties, I keep a narrow Yes lean. I am not changing my forecast because the other analyses reinforce, rather than alter, my assessment and offer no new data to shift the balance.\n\nWould move up: MC updates showing Milei widening to ≥2–3 points, visible Argentine positive economic/legislative news, or Sheinbaum easing to high-50s. Would move down: parity or Sheinbaum lead in upcoming MC waves, Argentine economic/political turbulence, or a Mexico-specific positive shock pushing Sheinbaum back into mid-60s.\n",
