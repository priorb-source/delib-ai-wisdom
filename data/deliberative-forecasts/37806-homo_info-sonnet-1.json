    "review": "Both forecasters make compelling arguments that I under-weighted in my initial analysis. The most significant point is the 4+ month pattern of inaction. Forecaster 2 notes that Trump issued 62 executive orders by mid-February covering major immigration areas, yet none mentioned the Diversity Visa. Forecaster 3 emphasizes that 40+ presidential actions have been issued without this specific language. This established pattern is stronger evidence than I initially credited - if this were a genuine priority, we would expect action during the initial wave of immigration executive orders. Forecaster 3 also raises a good point about the DV-2025 results being released on May 3rd without triggering any response, now 17 days ago. Additionally, both forecasters correctly note that the program's relatively small scale (50,000 visas) suggests it's lower priority compared to border security and mass deportations. Forecaster 3's point about statutory limitations is also well-taken - substantive changes require Congress, which may explain why the legislative route (SAFE Act) is being pursued instead.",
    "rationale": "Upon reflection, I should update downward based on the strength of the 4-month inaction pattern. My initial forecast of 28% didn't sufficiently weight this behavioral evidence. While my original reasoning remains valid (Trump's opposition to the program, his willingness to use executive actions, the possibility of symbolic action), the fact that we're 4+ months into his presidency with intensive immigration activity and zero mentions of the Diversity Visa is quite telling. The May 3rd DV-2025 results announcement provided a natural catalyst that went unused. However, I don't want to go as low as 20% because: (1) 42 days remains meaningful time in a high-velocity administration, (2) Trump's ideological opposition is well-documented and could manifest late, (3) a symbolic or limited-scope action remains plausible even if substantive changes require legislation. The balance between the strong pattern of inaction and the remaining time window with demonstrated opposition leads me to update to 23%.",
