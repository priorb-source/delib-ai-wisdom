  "information": "Direct air travel between Iraqi Kurdistan and Europe has expanded in 2025. In February, Aegean Airlines launched a direct route between Athens and Erbil, initially operating two flights per week. The new route brought the total number of countries with direct air links to Iraqi Kurdistan to 21. Following this, Athens International Airport's summer 2025 expansion plan includes new flights to Erbil operated by easyJet. Separately, German airline Eurowings has added Erbil to its summer flight plan from Cologne/Bonn airport, along with other new destinations such as Funchal and Bastia.\n\nErbil International Airport has undertaken developments to enhance its operational capabilities. The airport has commenced preliminary tests for night flights after receiving clearance for night landings, as part of a strategic plan to improve air communication systems and safety. In January 2025, a committee from the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) visited the airport to conduct an inspection for its inclusion in the official list of international airports. This inclusion is expected to facilitate an increase in the number of international flights. The airport's operational capacity was also demonstrated during the Hajj season, with the Iraqi Ministry of Transportation successfully operating numerous pilgrim flights from Erbil and other Iraqi airports.\n\nBroader regional aviation activity and international interest in the area have seen recent developments. Dubai-based carrier flydubai announced the resumption of direct daily flights to Damascus, Syria, starting from June 1, 2025, after a 12-year suspension. This move is part of a wider effort to enhance regional connectivity. In a different development indicating tourism interest, British travel company Wild Frontiers is offering a 15-day tour of Iraq, which includes visits to historical sites such as the citadel of Erbil, despite official UK government warnings against travel to the country.",

    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "About 39 days (until July 1, 2025)",
    "status_quo_outcome": "Yes",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Security or regulatory disruptions (e.g., regional escalation or missile/drone incident near Erbil) prompt multiple airlines to suspend service, trimming the scheduled network on flightsfrom.com to 31 or fewer by early July; or seasonal/Hajj routes drop off before July 1 and new European adds slip or are canceled.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "The current network already exceeds 31 destinations and/or typical summer seasonal routes (e.g., Antalya, Batumi/Black Sea, Saudi/Umrah-adjacent, holiday markets) plus newly announced links (Aegean/easyJet to Athens, Eurowings to Cologne) keep the listed total at 32+ on flightsfrom.com on or after July 1.",
    "rationale": "Baseline: Erbil has historically maintained a broad network across Turkey, the Gulf (DXB, SHJ, AUH, DOH, BAH, KWI, MCT), Jordan, Lebanon, Egypt, multiple Saudi cities, Syria (Damascus via Cham Wings), the Caucasus (EVN, GYD, TBS/BUS seasonally), Iran (several cities), and a growing set of European points. That mix typically yields a destination count in the low-to-mid 30s on schedules trackers, sometimes higher in summer.\n\nNew additions and momentum: The research assistant notes Aegean launched ATH–EBL in Feb 2025, with easyJet also planning ATH for summer, and Eurowings adding CGN in its S25 plan. These are incremental, visible adds on flightsfrom.com. Operationally, EBL has advanced night-flight capability testing and hosted an ICAO inspection—both supportive signals for sustained or growing international operations. The airport also handled significant Hajj traffic, indicating capacity and airline engagement.\n\nWhy not higher: The margin above the 32+ threshold may be modest. flightsfrom.com lists scheduled (not charter-only) routes; some putative destinations might be seasonal, ad-hoc, or dropped before July 1. Regional security is a live risk: past missile/drone incidents around Erbil have prompted temporary suspensions. Post-Hajj schedule thinning in late June could momentarily reduce Saudi or other seasonal services.\n\nWhy not lower: Multiple confirmed European adds (ATH, CGN) and robust Gulf/Turkey/Iran connectivity make a drop below 32 unlikely absent a significant disruption. Summer typically brings more, not fewer, seasonal leisure routes (e.g., Antalya, Batumi). The assistant’s note that Iraqi Kurdistan now connects directly to 21 countries (across EBL and ISU) suggests breadth that, for EBL alone, plausibly translates to >31 destinations once multi-city countries (Iran, Saudi, Turkey) are counted.\n\nUpdate triggers:\n- Up: Verified flightsfrom.com showing 32+ in late June; confirmation of easyJet ATH and Eurowings CGN operating as scheduled; additional seasonal listings (AYT, BUS/TBS, Salalah/Medina) posted.\n- Down: NOTAMs or incidents leading to broad suspensions (especially EU/Gulf carriers), or visible removal of multiple Iranian/Saudi/Turkish seasonal routes before July 1.",
