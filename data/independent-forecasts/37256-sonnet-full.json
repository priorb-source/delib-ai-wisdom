  "information": "South Sudan signed the African Continental Free Trade Area (AfCFTA) agreement in 2019 but, as of early May 2025, is one of the few states that have not deposited their instruments of ratification with the African Union. The ratification process requires a bill to pass the Transitional National Legislative Assembly, be signed by the President, and have the formal instrument lodged with the AU Commission. Historically, South Sudan's legislative processes can be lengthy; for example, the country took six years to ratify the Maputo Protocol.\n\nThe government of South Sudan is currently focused on several pressing domestic issues, including a delayed peace roadmap and preparations for national elections scheduled for December 2025. The country is also facing a fiscal crisis following a collapse in oil revenue due to a shutdown of a Red Sea pipeline. Further complicating the political landscape, the Vice-President and other senior officials were arrested in late April 2025. The national legislature has been meeting infrequently, sitting for only 32 days in the second half of 2024, and its published calendar for May-June 2025 includes no trade-related bills. Additionally, the Finance Ministry has not budgeted for the obligations associated with AfCFTA ratification, such as tariff reductions.\n\nOn the continental level, the AfCFTA has achieved 92% consensus on trade rules, with 49 of 54 African countries having joined the agreement. To support implementation, initiatives such as the Pan-African Payment and Settlement System (PAPSS) have been introduced. Within South Sudan, both the Chamber of Commerce and the Ministry of Trade have publicly advocated for ratification, with the Trade Minister reaffirming the government's commitment at an April 2025 summit. In February 2025, the East African Community (EAC) launched a new trade committee in South Sudan to help harmonize standards with the AfCFTA framework.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Approximately 60 days (until July 1, 2025)",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No - South Sudan does not ratify AfCFTA before the deadline",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "South Sudan's legislature remains consumed by domestic priorities including election preparations, the peace roadmap, and managing the political crisis following the Vice-President's arrest. No AfCFTA ratification bill appears on the legislative calendar, and the country continues as a signatory without ratification, as it has since 2019.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "The government fast-tracks AfCFTA ratification as a symbolic diplomatic achievement amid domestic challenges. The Trade Ministry introduces emergency legislation, the legislature convenes a special session to pass the bill, the President signs it immediately, and the instrument is deposited with the AU Commission before July 1.",
    "rationale": "The status quo strongly favors non-ratification. South Sudan signed AfCFTA in 2019 but has not ratified it in six years. With only 60 days remaining and significant obstacles, the baseline expectation is continued non-ratification. Critical negative factors include: (1) The legislature meets very infrequently (only 32 days in H2 2024) and the May-June calendar contains no trade-related bills; (2) Historical precedent shows slow legislative action - the Maputo Protocol took 6 years to ratify; (3) Severe domestic crises demand attention - fiscal crisis from oil revenue collapse, Vice-President arrested in late April 2025, elections in December 2025; (4) No budgetary allocation for AfCFTA obligations suggests lack of preparation; (5) The legislative body is focused on the peace roadmap and electoral preparations. However, some factors prevent an even lower forecast: The Trade Minister reaffirmed commitment in April 2025 (very recent and relevant); both the Chamber of Commerce and Ministry of Trade are actively advocating; the EAC established a trade committee in February 2025 specifically to help South Sudan align with AfCFTA; and ratification could theoretically be fast-tracked if prioritized. The arrest of senior officials in late April suggests political instability that makes coordinated legislative action difficult. For me to revise upward, I would need to see concrete evidence such as introduction of a ratification bill, scheduling of emergency legislative sessions, or high-level political statements with specific timelines. For a downward revision, further political deterioration or explicit government statements postponing ratification would be determinative.",
