  "information": "Several jurisdictions on the FATF grey list are actively seeking removal. The Nigerian government is working to exit the list by the end of May 2025, with its Minister of Interior emphasizing the administration's commitment to improving financial transparency. South Africa's National Treasury has stated that the country has addressed or largely addressed 20 of its 22 action items and aims to resolve the remaining two by June 2025, for a potential exit from the list by October 2025. Mozambique completed its technical reforms, and an FATF on-site visit, which is a prerequisite for removal, reportedly took place in April 2025 with positive feedback.\n\nThere are potential new additions to the grey list. The British Virgin Islands underwent a mutual-evaluation follow-up that found major gaps, and its grace period for remediation expired in February 2025; the UK has signalled it will not block a listing. Separately, India is preparing to submit new intelligence to the FATF concerning Pakistan's terror infrastructure, aiming to have Pakistan re-listed after its removal in October 2022. The most recent changes to the list occurred in February 2025, when Laos and Nepal were added and the Philippines was removed.\n\nHistorical data on FATF plenaries shows consistent changes to the grey list. Since the current monitoring process was adopted in 2018, there have been 17 plenary meetings up to February 2025. Of these 17 meetings, only one—the October 2020 plenary—concluded without any additions or removals. That session was a virtual meeting delayed by the COVID-19 pandemic and was noted to have focused on policy work rather than country evaluations. For a country to be removed, it must complete its action plan and then undergo a successful on-site visit to verify the implementation of reforms.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Approximately 2-3 weeks until the June 2025 FATF Plenary, with the outcome typically announced shortly after the meeting concludes",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No - no jurisdictions are added to or removed from the grey list",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "The June 2025 plenary concludes without making any changes to the grey list. Countries actively working toward removal (like Mozambique, Nigeria) are not yet deemed ready for exit despite progress, and potential additions (like British Virgin Islands) are deferred to a later meeting for procedural or political reasons. This would mirror the exceptional October 2020 plenary.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "At least one jurisdiction is either added or removed. Most likely, Mozambique is removed after its positive April 2025 on-site visit, and/or British Virgin Islands is added given its expired grace period and major compliance gaps. Nigeria could also secure removal given its stated goal of exiting by end of May 2025.",
    "rationale": "The historical base rate is the most compelling factor: of the 17 FATF plenaries since 2018, only one (October 2020, a COVID-affected virtual meeting focused on policy rather than country evaluations) concluded without changes to the grey list. This yields a 94% historical rate of change. The current situation suggests multiple plausible catalysts for change. For removals, Mozambique appears well-positioned having completed technical reforms and received positive feedback from its April 2025 on-site visit—the final prerequisite for removal. Nigeria has explicitly stated it's working to exit by end of May 2025. For additions, British Virgin Islands has major compliance gaps, its grace period expired in February 2025, and the UK has signaled it won't block listing. There's no indication that the June 2025 plenary will be exceptional like October 2020. It appears to be a standard meeting where country evaluations would occur. My forecast is not higher because: (1) there's inherent uncertainty about whether any specific country has fully completed all requirements in time, (2) political or procedural complications could delay decisions, and (3) I should respect the 6% base rate of no changes. My forecast is not lower because: (1) the 94% historical rate is remarkably consistent, (2) multiple concrete candidates exist for both addition and removal with documented progress, (3) we're very close to the meeting date (2-3 weeks), making timing viable, and (4) this appears to be a normal plenary. I would update higher if I learned of confirmed on-site visits with positive outcomes for additional countries, or official confirmation of BVI listing. I would update lower if key candidates explicitly stated they're targeting October 2025 instead, or if procedural delays were announced.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill any jurisdictions be added to or removed from the FATF \"grey list\" following the FATF Plenary meeting in June 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nAML Intelligence (February 2025) [UPDATE: Philippines removed from FATF ‘grey list’ as Laos, Nepal added to watchlist](https://www.amlintelligence.com/2025/02/breaking-fatf-grey-list-update-laos-and-nepal-added-the-philippines-removed/)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below.

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower.
