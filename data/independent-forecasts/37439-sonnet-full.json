  "information": "According to media reports citing the Kremlin, Donald Trump and Vladimir Putin held phone conversations on February 12, 2025, and March 18, 2025. The February call reportedly lasted nearly 90 minutes. The March call was to discuss the war in Ukraine and a potential 30-day ceasefire proposal. On April 4, 2025, Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov stated that no phone conversations between the leaders were planned for the near future.\n\nOn May 5, 2025, Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov stated that a meeting between Putin and Trump is 'certainly necessary' and 'on everyone's lips.' However, Peskov emphasized that any such meeting requires 'adequate preparation' at 'various expert levels' and that, as of that date, there were no specific details or a set date.\n\nDonald Trump is scheduled to travel to Saudi Arabia, Qatar, and the United Arab Emirates in mid-May 2025 to participate in a Gulf summit. In late April, Trump mentioned the possibility of a meeting with Putin during this trip. On May 5, Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov stated that Putin's schedule does not currently include a trip to the Middle East.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Approximately 40 days until June 15, 2025, though the relevant window for the phone call is May 13 to June 14 (32 days).",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No phone call between Trump and Putin during the specified window. As of May 5, 2025, the Kremlin stated there are no specific plans for contact in the near future.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Trump and Putin continue diplomatic engagement through subordinates and expert-level preparation but do not have a direct phone call during the May 13-June 14 window. The emphasis on needing 'adequate preparation' delays any leader-level contact beyond mid-June.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Developments in Ukraine negotiations or other geopolitical circumstances create urgency for a direct phone call. Alternatively, Trump's mid-May Middle East trip generates diplomatic momentum that leads to a scheduled call between the two leaders during the specified window.",
    "rationale": "The base rate suggests moderate probability: Trump and Putin have already had two phone calls in 2025 (February 12 and March 18), averaging roughly one call every 5-6 weeks. The specified 32-day window (May 13-June 14) is comparable to this cadence. However, several factors temper this baseline. The Kremlin's April 4 statement that no calls were planned for the 'near future' and May 5 emphasis on needing 'adequate preparation' through 'various expert levels' suggest nothing imminent. The fact that as of yesterday (May 5) there were no specific details or set date is particularly relevant given the window starts in just one week. The ongoing Ukraine diplomacy and acknowledgment that a meeting is 'certainly necessary' provide upside potential—urgent developments could necessitate a call. Trump's mid-May Middle East trip could also catalyze diplomatic activity. However, given the status quo is 'no planned call' and we're already quite close to the window starting with no indication of plans, I weight this heavily. My forecast is not higher because recent explicit statements indicate no imminent plans and preparation is still needed. It's not lower because the established pattern of communication, active ongoing diplomacy, and a 32-day window provide sufficient time for circumstances to change. I would revise upward if credible reports emerge of specific planning for a call, or if geopolitical events create obvious urgency. I would revise downward if the window shrinks significantly without any indication of planning.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill Donald Trump and Vladimir Putin speak on the phone with each other before June 15, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nWikipedia: [February 2025 Putin–Trump call](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/February_2025_Putin%E2%80%93Trump_call)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below.

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any).
