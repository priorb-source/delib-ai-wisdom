    "review": "The other forecasters provided excellent, contrasting arguments that refined my perspective. Forecaster 2 compellingly argued that the two-month period of silence since the initial strong reports in March is itself significant negative evidence, suggesting a delay or less concrete plans than I had assumed. This point about the 'delay' is something I had understated. Forecaster 3 provided a critical and sophisticated counterpoint by explaining the mechanics of IPO timelines, particularly the role of confidential S-1 filings. This context explains why a lack of public news isn't definitive proof that plans have stalled and provides a clear mechanism for how a 'Yes' resolution could still occur suddenly before the deadline (e.g., an announcement that a confidential filing has been made). Their combined reasoning convinced me that my initial forecast was too high.",
    "rationale": "I have significantly updated my forecast downwards based on the other forecasters' analyses. My initial 60% probability was too reliant on the strength of the March reports and did not adequately discount for the lack of any official action in the intervening two months. Forecaster 2's emphasis on this delay being a strong negative signal is a valid critique. However, Forecaster 3's insights into IPO mechanics—specifically that a confidential filing could precede a last-minute public announcement before the July 1 deadline—persuaded me not to swing too far in the other direction. The absence of news is concerning, but it is not conclusive proof that plans have been shelved. A pre-July 1 announcement is less likely than I first thought, but a credible path to 'Yes' remains. I am therefore lowering my forecast by 15 points to 45%. This new forecast reflects a sub-50% probability, acknowledging that the status quo and the delay make 'No' the more likely outcome, but it remains higher than the other forecasters' estimates because I still believe the specificity of the March reports (naming two top-tier banks) indicates a level of seriousness that makes a last-minute announcement a very real possibility.",
