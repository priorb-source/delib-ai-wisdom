    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "About 32 days (deadline: before July 1, 2025)",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No agreement is announced or approved by the IMF Executive Board before July 1, 2025.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Lebanese authorities do not pass or implement the core prior actions (banking resolution, capital controls, credible fiscal framework/budget, central bank reforms), political paralysis persists amid security tensions, and IMF statements continue to stress insufficient progress—leaving no Board-approved financing arrangement in time.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "A rapid, limited IMF financing arrangement (e.g., Rapid Financing Instrument) is requested and swiftly approved due to spillover shocks and urgent balance-of-payments needs, or an Extended Fund Facility is rushed to Board approval after a surprise breakthrough on prior actions—leading to a joint announcement of a new IMF-supported program providing funds.",
    "rationale": "Only about a month remains. Since 2022, Lebanon has struggled to convert an initial staff-level understanding into a Board-approved, money-bearing program due to reform delays, political deadlock, and the banking crisis. The IMF has repeatedly emphasized that key prior actions are outstanding. With the current security environment and legislative gridlock, a fully-fledged EFF before July 1 is unlikely. The question also requires that the agreement involve the IMF agreeing to provide money; staff-level agreements alone typically do not meet this bar because they are not Board approvals and are contingent. The fastest plausible pathway is an emergency instrument (RFI), but even that would require a credible policy package and rapid IMF Board scheduling—tough within ~4 weeks absent clear signals. The linked background article citing ministerial confidence is not new evidence; similar assurances have been made repeatedly without resulting in a program. My research assistant provided no additional information, which means I have no sign of imminent Board consideration, passed prior-action legislation, or an IMF press release indicating an impending program—so I put extra weight on the status quo. Not higher: because of the short window, history of delays, and lack of visible preconditions or IMF signaling. Not lower: because a small, emergency financing window remains conceivable if the authorities coalesce around a minimal package and the IMF moves quickly. What would move me up: credible reports of Parliament passing core reforms; Cabinet approval of a concrete, IMF-aligned recovery plan; an IMF staff statement noting that prior actions are complete and Board consideration is imminent; or news of a requested RFI with near-term Board date. What would move me down: IMF statements that prior actions are still not met, further political breakdown, or escalation of conflict that derails legislative action and IMF engagement over the next weeks.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill the IMF and Lebanon announce an agreement before July 1, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\n[Lebanon finance minister confident of a new deal with IMF to help crumbling economy](https://www.newarab.com/news/lebanon-finance-minister-confident-new-deal-imf)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if Lebanon and the International Monetary Fund announce any economic agreement between the two entities signed after the launch of this question and before July 1, 2025. In order to count, it must involve the IMF agreeing to provide money to Lebanon, whether through loans, grants, or any other means.\n\n\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nNo additional information available.\n\nToday is 2025-05-30.\n\nBefore answering you think:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n(e) You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
