    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "About 3 weeks (the summit is expected in late June 2025)",
    "status_quo_outcome": "Yes — a sitting U.S. president typically attends NATO leaders’ summits in person.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Trump opts to snub the summit and sends the Vice President or Secretary of State instead, or an acute domestic/health/security issue keeps him in the U.S., or the meeting slips beyond June (thus not meeting the question’s timing criterion).",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Trump travels to The Hague and participates in the leaders’ sessions and bilaterals, physically present with other heads of state (meeting the “in-person, unmediated photons/sound” standard).",
    "rationale": "Baseline: U.S. presidents almost always attend NATO leaders’ summits; Trump himself attended NATO summits in 2017, 2018, and the 2019 leaders’ meeting. Institutional and diplomatic inertia favor attendance, especially amid ongoing European security issues where the U.S. president’s presence is influential. The event is in The Hague (a straightforward transatlantic trip) and occurs on a predictable late-June cadence, allowing advance scheduling. These factors make attendance the status quo. Countervailing factors specific to Trump: he is more willing than typical presidents to skip multilateral fora to signal displeasure (he has skipped other regional summits before) and could try to use absence as leverage on burden-sharing or Ukraine policy. There is also non-zero risk of an acute domestic issue (e.g., sudden legislative or security crisis) or health concerns that could ground him. Nevertheless, attending gives him a prime stage to press his agenda directly on allies—something he has historically embraced—and with many allies now closer to or above 2% defense spending, the optics are more favorable than in 2018–2019. No new, specific reporting is available from the research assistant to shift this from a norms-and-behavior prior. Why not higher: Trump’s unpredictability and potential strategic snub keep the probability from the 90s. Why not lower: Historical precedent, diplomatic stakes, and the usefulness of attending for leverage keep it well above 50. Upward updates: official White House travel announcement/press guidance, NATO schedule confirmations with U.S. participation, or signaling that Trump intends to unveil an initiative at the summit. Downward updates: credible reports he will send a surrogate, schedule conflicts on the public calendar, new public threats to boycott unless demands are met, or an emergent domestic/health/security crisis.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill Donald Trump attend the NATO Summit in June 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\n[The Netherlands to host 2025 NATO Summit in The Hague](https://www.nato.int/cps/en/natohq/news_225618.htm)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if US President Donald J. Trump attends in person a NATO summit held in June 2025.\n\n\"In person\" is defined as occupying the same physical space closely enough at the NATO Summit such that he can see and hear other heads of state through direct un-intermediated exchange of photons and sound waves.\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nNo additional information available.\n\nToday is 2025-06-04.\n\nBefore answering you think:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n(e) You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
