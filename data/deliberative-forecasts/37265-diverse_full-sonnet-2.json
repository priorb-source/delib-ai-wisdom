    "review": "The other forecasters make several compelling arguments I should weigh more heavily. Most importantly, both emphasize that Mtwara already holds a Level 3 designation, demonstrating the State Department's preferred approach of using targeted regional warnings rather than nationwide upgrades. This is a strong institutional signal about their calibrated response strategy. They also appropriately emphasize the 60-day timeframe more than I did - bureaucratic processes for advisory changes are inherently slow absent major catalyzing events. Forecaster 3's point that 'a single embassy alert rarely triggers a nationwide jump' is well-taken, and their observation that terrorism incidents within Tanzania proper have been infrequent since 2020 (with most risk being Mozambique spillover) adds important context. However, I think both somewhat underweight the significance of the recent timing: the March 2025 coastal alert and April 2025 border terrorist activity are extremely fresh indicators occurring within the last 1-2 months, suggesting elevated active concern rather than static historical risk. The regional pattern of recent upgrades (Uganda, Burundi) also indicates the Department is actively reviewing East African security posture.",
    "rationale": "After deliberation, I'm updating my forecast downward but not as low as 12%. The strongest arguments for lowering my estimate are: (1) The Mtwara Level 3 designation reveals the Department's institutional preference for targeted warnings over full country upgrades - this is a crucial methodological insight I underweighted; (2) The 60-day window is genuinely short for bureaucratic advisory changes absent a major event; (3) Tanzania has maintained Level 2 stability for years, providing a strong base rate. However, I'm not going as low as 12% because the March and April 2025 security indicators represent very recent, active concerns rather than historical background noise. The timing matters - these aren't old risks the Department has already processed, but fresh developments within the last 1-2 months. The regional upgrade pattern also suggests active reassessment is occurring. My updated forecast of 16% reflects stronger weight on bureaucratic inertia and the targeted warning approach, while maintaining that recent security developments create non-trivial near-term risk of a triggering event that could prompt rapid upgrade.",
