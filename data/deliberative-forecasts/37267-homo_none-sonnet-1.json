    "review": "The other forecasters raise several compelling points I hadn't fully considered. Most notably, Forecaster 3's distinction between regional Level 4 designations versus country-wide Level 4 is crucial - the State Department often assigns Level 4 to specific dangerous regions while keeping the overall country at Level 3. This significantly raises the bar for what would constitute a 'Yes' resolution. Forecaster 2's observation that the background article discusses tourism and exploring Addis Ababa's culture strongly suggests Ethiopia is NOT currently at Level 4, which is important baseline information. Both forecasters also provide useful context: only a handful of countries globally have full Level 4 status (Afghanistan, Syria, Yemen, Libya), reinforcing just how exceptional this designation is. The reference to the Tigray conflict ending in 2022 is helpful historical context showing Ethiopia has experienced major conflicts without receiving country-wide Level 4 status. All three of us independently arrived at low probabilities (8-15%), which increases my confidence in this range.",
    "rationale": "Upon reflection, my initial 15% forecast was slightly too high. The key insight from the deliberation is the regional vs. country-wide distinction - Ethiopia could have serious security problems in specific areas without triggering a full country Level 4 advisory, especially if Addis Ababa remains relatively stable (which has historically been the case). The framing of the background article, which discusses tourism possibilities rather than complete prohibition, suggests the current status is not Level 4 and likely Level 2 or 3. For a full country upgrade to Level 4 in just 2 months, we would need catastrophic deterioration affecting all regions including the capital - events like civil war reaching Addis Ababa, government collapse, or widespread attacks on foreigners. While Horn of Africa conflicts can escalate, such dramatic country-wide collapse within 2 months remains low probability. The mention of 'new travel warnings in 2025' provides some upside risk, but warnings don't necessarily mean imminent Level 4. I'm updating down to 11% to reflect the higher bar for country-wide Level 4 designation while maintaining some probability for rapid unexpected deterioration.",
