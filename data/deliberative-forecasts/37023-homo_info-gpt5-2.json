    "review": "Both add useful nuance without introducing decisive new evidence. Forecaster 2 helpfully emphasizes the timing (prelim May reading likely comes after the jobs report and Fed meeting but before mid-month CPI), and the asymmetry that “unchanged” resolves No. They also note four straight declines and gas price seasonality as negative momentum. Forecaster 3 underscores the extreme low base and mean-reversion tendency, with the small threshold making a Yes plausible on noise alone, and points to key near-term drivers (jobs, equities, fuel). I find both arguments generally sound. The timing point slightly tempers my prior mean-reversion edge because a potentially positive CPI print likely won’t influence the prelim. The rest largely echoes my prior reasoning.",
    "rationale": "April’s 50.8 is near a record trough, and month-to-month U-M sentiment changes are often several points; even modest stabilization or sampling noise can lift May above 50.8. That supports a slight lean to Yes. However, headwinds remain: elevated inflation expectations, tariff/policy uncertainty, rising gas prices into spring, and continued deterioration in unemployment expectations/LEI. With four consecutive monthly declines, a flat or slightly lower print is plausible—and “unchanged” is a No. The prelim’s timing (post-Fed, post-jobs, pre-CPI) removes a potential positive catalyst from mid-May CPI, while jobs and market tone are two-sided risks. Netting mean reversion and low bar versus persistent macro anxiety and the unchanged=No asymmetry, I keep a modest edge to Yes but trim slightly. I move from 58% to 57% to reflect the timing nuance and momentum risk highlighted by Forecaster 2.",
