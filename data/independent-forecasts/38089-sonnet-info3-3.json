  "information": "Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan has initiated work on a new constitution, appointing a team of legal experts to draft it. Erdoğan stated the current constitution is outdated, while critics raised concerns the move could be intended to extend his presidency beyond 2028, a claim he has denied. Erdoğan also ruled out early elections. In foreign affairs, he publicly criticized Pedro Sánchez for showing support for the detained Istanbul Mayor, Ekrem İmamoğlu. The two leaders met in Istanbul in May 2025 to discuss bilateral relations, including trade, security, and the situation in Gaza.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Approximately 32 days from May 29, 2025 to July 1, 2025",
    "status_quo_outcome": "The current relative approval ratings between Sánchez and Erdoğan as of late May 2025 are likely to persist through July 1, 2025, given the short timeframe and the typically slow-moving nature of approval ratings",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Erdoğan maintains his approval rating or sees a modest increase while Sánchez's approval remains stable or declines slightly. This could occur if Erdoğan's constitutional reform initiative is well-received domestically as decisive leadership, or if Sánchez faces continued coalition pressures in Spain. A tie in approval ratings would also result in a No outcome",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Sánchez's approval rating increases or remains stable while Erdoğan's declines due to domestic concerns about the constitutional reform being a power grab, economic pressures in Turkey, or other domestic political challenges. Alternatively, Sánchez could benefit from positive developments in Spanish politics or international diplomacy",
    "rationale": "With only 32 days remaining until the resolution date, approval ratings are unlikely to shift dramatically. The research assistant's report indicates some relevant developments: Erdoğan is initiating constitutional reform, which his critics suggest could extend his presidency beyond 2028. This is potentially controversial but could cut either way - either showing strong leadership or raising concerns about authoritarian tendencies. The bilateral tensions (Erdoğan criticizing Sánchez over İmamoğlu support) are unlikely to significantly affect domestic approval ratings. Historically, both leaders have operated in similar approval rating ranges (typically 35-50%), though Erdoğan has generally shown more resilient approval in Turkey despite controversies, while Sánchez has faced more volatility due to Spain's complex coalition politics. Without access to the specific current Morning Consult ratings from May 2025, I must weight the historical baseline that both leaders tend to maintain relatively comparable approval levels. The short timeframe strongly favors the status quo. My forecast is not higher because: (1) approval ratings are sticky over one month, (2) Erdoğan has historically maintained stable ratings even during controversies, and (3) the constitutional reform initiative could actually bolster his support among his base. My forecast is not lower because: (1) Erdoğan's constitutional moves could backfire and decrease his approval, (2) Sánchez could benefit from any positive political or economic developments in Spain, and (3) historically both leaders have had comparable approval levels. To update higher, I would need evidence of: current polling showing Sánchez already ahead, major scandals affecting Erdoğan, or significant positive developments for Sánchez. To update lower, I would need: current data showing Erdoğan significantly ahead, major problems emerging for Sánchez's government, or evidence that Erdoğan's constitutional reform is popular",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill Spanish Prime Minister Pedro Sánchez have a higher approval rating than Turkey's President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan on July 1, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nResolution source updates monthly. According to Morning Consult for January 2025: \"The latest approval ratings are based on data collected from Jan. 21-27, 2025. Ratings reflect a trailing seven-day simple moving average of views among adults in each country surveyed.\"\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if Pedro Sánchez has a higher approval rating than Recep Tayyip Erdoğan according to [Morning Consult](https://pro.morningconsult.com/trackers/global-leader-approval) when checked by Metaculus on or after July 1, 2025. If this not the case (including due to a tie), this resolves as **No**.\n\n\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nTurkish President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan has initiated work on a new constitution, appointing a team of legal experts to draft it.

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
