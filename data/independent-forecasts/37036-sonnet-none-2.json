    "status_quo_outcome": "No - Dan Osborn has not yet announced his candidacy",

    "rationale": "The Nebraska Examiner article from April 3, 2025 (20 days ago) indicates Dan Osborn is actively 'exploring' a Senate bid, which is typically an earlier stage before formal announcement. This recent activity is a positive signal, but several factors temper the probability: First, the status quo heavily favors 'No' since he hasn't announced yet, and good forecasting requires weighting continuity. Second, 'exploring' doesn't equate to announcing - many politicians explore candidacies without ultimately running. Third, while 39 days is enough time for an announcement, the 2026 midterms are still over a year away, reducing urgency. The probability is not higher because: (1) most exploratory efforts don't convert to announcements within 5-6 weeks, (2) no additional information suggests imminent announcement (fundraising reports, campaign staff hiring, etc.), and (3) the default should be inaction. The probability is not lower because: (1) the exploration is recent and apparently serious, (2) 39 days provides sufficient time for a motivated candidate, and (3) early announcements for midterms do occur. I would update higher with evidence of campaign infrastructure building, donor meetings, or more definitive statements. I would update lower with reports of him declining to run or pursuing other opportunities.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill Dan Osborn announce his candidacy for US Senator from Nebraska before June 1, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nNebraska Examiner: [Nebraska’s Dan Osborn exploring midterm bid against U.S. Sen Pete Ricketts](https://nebraskaexaminer.com/2025/04/03/nebraskas-dan-osborn-exploring-midterm-bid-against-u-s-sen-pete-ricketts/)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if Dan Osborn announces his candidacy for US Senator from Nebraska before June 1, 2025. If no such announcement has been made before that date, the question resolves as **No**.\n\n\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nNo additional information available.\n\nToday is 2025-04-23.\n\nBefore answering you think:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n(e) You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
