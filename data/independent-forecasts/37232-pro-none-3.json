    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Approximately one month. The outcome will be determined on June 1, 2025, based on posts made during May 2025.",
    "status_quo_outcome": "Yes. The company has not posted any news for the last three months. A continuation of this trend would result in no new posts in May.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Virgin Galactic releases its Q1 2025 financial results in early May, consistent with its typical reporting schedule for a publicly traded company. This announcement is published as a press release on its News page.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "The current three-month period of communications silence continues through May. This would occur if the company delays its Q1 earnings announcement until June or breaks from standard practice and does not publish the earnings press release on its corporate news page.",
    "rationale": "This forecast is primarily driven by the expected release of Virgin Galactic's Q1 2025 financial results. As a publicly traded company (NYSE: SPCE), Virgin Galactic has a regulatory obligation and a consistent historical pattern of reporting quarterly earnings. Their Q1 results are typically announced in early May (e.g., Q1 2024 results were announced on May 7, 2024). Such a significant corporate announcement is almost invariably posted to the company's official News page for investor and public awareness. This creates a very strong expectation for a 'No' outcome.\n\nThe main factor supporting a 'Yes' outcome is the existing status quo: a three-month gap in news posts, which is unusually long and reflects an operational pause as the company develops its next-generation Delta-class ships. While this trend of silence is notable, the non-discretionary, cyclical nature of financial reporting is a much stronger predictive factor than the recent lack of discretionary operational updates.\n\nMy probability is not lower (i.e., closer to 0%) because the anomolous three-month silence introduces a small but real uncertainty. There is a possibility, however slim, that the earnings report could be delayed into June or that the company alters its communications strategy. My probability is not higher because failing to post an earnings release on the company news page would be a highly unusual departure from standard corporate practice, making it an unlikely event.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill Virgin Galactic fail to make any new posts on its News page in May 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nAs of April 19, 2025, Virgin Galactic's most recent post was timestamped January 30, 2025. The most recent one before then was December 12, 2024.\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if no new posts appear at Virgin Galactic's News page, which can be accessed at [this address](https://www.virgingalactic.com/news), timestamped after April 30, 2025 and before June 1, 2025. If there is a new post, then this question resolves as **No**.\n\n\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nNo additional information available.\n\nToday is 2025-04-29.\n\nBefore answering you think:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n(e) You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
