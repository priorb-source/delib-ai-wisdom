    "review": "All three forecasts converged remarkably closely (65-72%), indicating strong agreement on the fundamental dynamics. We all identified the same key factors: Carney's honeymoon period, the short 6-week timeframe, Trump's historically constrained approval ratings, and Canadian anti-Trump sentiment. Forecaster 3 raised valid concerns I hadn't sufficiently emphasized: (1) we lack current Morning Consult baseline data and are extrapolating from March polling, (2) the $62.3B deficit could become politically salient faster than anticipated, and (3) methodological uncertainty about how Morning Consult's specific tracking aligns with general polling trends. Forecaster 2's emphasis on the separate tracking methodology (Carney among Canadians vs Trump among Americans) is important - this isn't a head-to-head comparison but rather two independent domestic approval ratings. The narrow forecast range (7 percentage points) suggests we've captured the probability space well, though the uncertainties warrant modest caution about being at the high end.",
    "rationale": "After deliberation, I'm adjusting my forecast slightly downward while maintaining that the base case strongly favors a Yes outcome. The honeymoon effect remains the dominant factor - newly elected leaders historically enjoy elevated approval for 3-6 months, and July 1 falls well within this window at just 9 weeks post-election. Carney's March pre-election approval of 48% should have received a post-victory boost, and six weeks is insufficient time for this to fully erode absent major crises. Trump's approval consistently runs in the 40-45% range with limited upside. However, I'm incorporating more uncertainty due to: (1) lack of current Morning Consult data creating extrapolation risk, (2) potential for deficit concerns to materialize quickly, and (3) the ongoing trade dispute's economic impacts. The 77% Canadian disapproval of Trump provides structural support for Carney's relative position. Balancing the strong honeymoon fundamentals against legitimate uncertainty factors, I'm settling on 69% - slightly below my initial 72% but still reflecting high confidence in a Yes outcome.",
