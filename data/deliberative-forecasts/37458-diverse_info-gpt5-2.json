    "review": "Forecaster 2 adds a specific catalyst I hadn’t considered: reporting about a possible mid‑June “birthday summit.” If true, that could create a natural pre‑summit leader call within the window and, importantly, a reason for both sides to acknowledge it. However, I’m cautious: Beijing typically avoids publicizing Xi’s birthday, making a “birthday” framing unlikely from the PRC side, and the analysis concedes the talks are early/uncertain. So it’s a plausible but weakly evidenced driver. Forecaster 3 highlights imminent Geneva talks and the economic severity of the tariff standoff as catalysts. That’s a solid mechanism: productive (or failing) talks often precipitate leader‑level calls. The mutual‑acknowledgment requirement remains the key constraint, and current PRC denials suggest reluctance to confirm calls publicly unless they serve a clear diplomatic purpose. Overall, both raise credible pathways to Yes, but neither overcomes the acknowledgment hurdle and short window enough to justify mid‑30s+ odds, in my view.",
    "rationale": "Baseline from my prior was 24%, reflecting: short window (about five weeks), public PRC denials, and the mutual‑acknowledgment bar. New inputs introduce two potential catalysts: (1) Geneva talks (if they occur as scheduled) can create momentum or crisis management needs that sometimes trigger leader calls; (2) a rumored mid‑June summit concept could entail a preparatory call that both sides would acknowledge. These increase the chance above my prior, but I discount the “birthday” angle given PRC messaging norms and the description as early/uncertain. I also note that if an in‑person meeting were truly imminent, they might opt to avoid a pre‑call, especially amid contested narratives. Net: I modestly raise my forecast to reflect plausible catalysts, while keeping No as the modal outcome due to PRC’s current communications posture and the acknowledgment requirement.",
