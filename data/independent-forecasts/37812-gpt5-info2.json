  "information": "According to airport statistics, Beirut International Airport handled 1,254,550 passengers in the first quarter of 2025, a 1.42% decrease from the same period in 2024. While passenger arrivals increased by 9.33%, departures fell by 11.60%, and the number of transit passengers dropped by over 92%. The Lebanese government has also implemented new security measures at the airport to combat smuggling, including banning certain Iranian flights and increasing security checks.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "About 41 days (until July 1, 2025)",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No — the current network likely sits around the high 40s to ~50 unique destinations, below the >51 threshold, and large changes are unlikely in the short time remaining.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Cross‑border tensions persist or worsen, prompting cautious European/Gulf carriers to keep suspensions in place and/or trim seasonal adds; Lebanese security measures continue to limit a few Iranian routes; seasonal Mediterranean adds are fewer than usual. The flightsfrom.com/BEY list on/after July 1 shows ≤51 destinations.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Summer peak brings a cluster of seasonal additions (Greek islands, Turkish resorts, Egyptian resorts) plus one or two resumptions by risk‑tolerant European/Gulf carriers or extra Saudi/Iraqi secondaries, nudging the flightsfrom.com/BEY list to 52+ unique destinations by July 1.",
    "rationale": "Anchor and status quo: With ~6 weeks left, airline schedules for early July are largely set. Beirut’s network has been recovering but remains constrained by security risk since late 2023. A threshold of >51 is near the plausible upper bound for BEY in the current environment, suggesting the default is slightly below that mark.\n\nEvidence and context:\n- Q1 2025 traffic at BEY was down 1.42% YoY overall, with arrivals up 9.33% but departures down 11.60%, and transit plunging >92%. That profile implies the airport is functioning but not expanding robustly; it does not signal a wave of new routes before July.\n- New airport security measures reportedly include bans on certain Iranian flights and tighter checks. That likely removes 1–3 potential destinations and makes near‑term additions less likely.\n- Reporting on Lebanon’s summer tourism outlook stresses the downside risk from Israeli strikes and regional tensions, which tends to make European network carriers especially cautious. Seasonal adds (Greek/Turkish/Egyptian leisure) are the most likely upside, but these are precisely the flights most prone to last‑minute cancellation in a jittery security environment.\n\nWhy not higher: To beat 51, BEY likely needs several seasonal destinations plus at least one or two resumptions/adds from conservative carriers. Given the short runway to July 1 and ongoing security risk, net additions of that magnitude are unlikely. The Iranian flight curbs slightly reduce the ceiling.\n\nWhy not lower: Summer seasonality should still bring some incremental leisure destinations (e.g., Greek islands, Turkish/Egyptian resorts), diaspora demand is resilient, and MEA usually runs a broad regional network. Absent a severe security deterioration, the count should hover near the high 40s/around 50 rather than collapsing.\n\nWhat would move me up: Confirmed schedule resumptions by major European/Gulf carriers (e.g., Lufthansa/Swiss/Austrian, Saudia/Flynas adding MED, more Turkish resort routes) appearing on flightsfrom.com for early July; evidence that seasonal Greek/Turkish/Egyptian routes are loaded and ticketed.\n\nWhat would move me down: Fresh escalations leading to NOTAMs, insurer withdrawals, or airline suspensions affecting Gulf or Turkish/European services; further restrictions on Iranian/Iraqi routes; evidence on flightsfrom.com that seasonal adds were pulled.\n\nBottom line: The balance of evidence favors a total at or just below the threshold by early July, with upside from seasonal adds but meaningful downside from security-driven caution.",
