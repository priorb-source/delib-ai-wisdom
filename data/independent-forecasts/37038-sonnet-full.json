  "information": "A 17% 'reciprocal' tariff on Israeli goods was announced by the US on April 2, 2025, and codified under heading 9903.01.48 of the Harmonized Tariff Schedule (HTS) with an effective date of April 9. Subsequently, the implementation of this tariff was suspended for 90 days, deferring the collection of duties until July 9, 2025. Reports state that the official HTS website has been updated to list a '+17%' duty for Israel, which is currently marked as 'suspended'.\n\nThe US is Israel's largest trading partner, with bilateral trade valued at $34 billion in 2024. The two countries have a 40-year-old free trade agreement. On April 1, 2025, the Israeli government announced the immediate cancellation of all its remaining tariffs on U.S. imports. Following the US tariff announcement, Israeli Economy Minister Nir Barkat stated that officials from both countries are optimistic about reaching a new trade agreement before the suspension period expires on July 9, 2025. Ongoing discussions also aim to address the trade deficit between the nations.\n\nThe United States recently implemented a general 10% tariff on imports from most trading partners. Concurrently, the administration has pursued other trade actions, including imposing a 25% tariff on imported automobiles and certain auto parts, and increasing tariffs on Chinese goods to over 100% in response to retaliatory measures. Additionally, new tariffs ranging from 41% to over 3,500% have been announced on solar imports from several Southeast Asian countries, pending a final decision in June 2025.",

    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "38 days until June 1, 2025",
    "status_quo_outcome": "YES - The harmonized tariff schedule currently lists Israel as +17% (marked as suspended), and if this listing remains unchanged, the question resolves as YES regardless of suspension status",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "A NO outcome would require the +17% tariff listing to be completely removed from the HTS or changed to a different percentage before June 1. This could occur if the US and Israel rapidly finalize a comprehensive trade agreement that eliminates the tariff entry entirely, or if the administration unilaterally removes the tariff from the schedule",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "A YES outcome occurs if the +17% listing remains in the harmonized tariff schedule on June 1, 2025. Critically, the resolution criteria explicitly state that suspension status does not affect resolution - the question only asks whether the tariff is LISTED as 17%, not whether it is actively being collected",
    "rationale": "The status quo strongly favors a YES outcome. According to the research assistant, the HTS currently lists Israel with a '+17%' duty under heading 9903.01.48, marked as suspended until July 9, 2025. The crucial detail is that the resolution criteria explicitly state 'Whether the provision is listed as suspended will not affect resolution.' This means the question resolves YES as long as +17% appears in the schedule, regardless of collection status. For a NO outcome, the tariff would need to be completely removed or modified in the next 38 days. While Israeli and US officials express optimism about a new trade agreement, the timeline works against major changes before June 1. The suspension period extends to July 9, suggesting that date is the actual target for negotiations. Trade agreements typically require weeks or months to finalize, and 38 days is quite short. Even if negotiations progress rapidly, any deal might maintain the listing while extending the suspension rather than removing it entirely. The most likely scenario is that the current tariff listing remains in place through June 1, with the suspension continuing while negotiations proceed toward the July 9 deadline. My forecast is not higher (closer to 100%) because there remains a realistic possibility of a breakthrough trade deal that removes the tariff entirely, particularly given both countries' stated commitment to negotiations and Israel's proactive elimination of its own US tariffs. My forecast is not lower because the status quo already satisfies the resolution criteria, the timeframe is short, and the suspension mechanism suggests the parties expect the listing to persist through at least early July while they negotiate.",
