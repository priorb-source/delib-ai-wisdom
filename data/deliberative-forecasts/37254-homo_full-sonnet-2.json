    "review": "All three forecasts converge remarkably at 4-5%, suggesting strong analytical consensus. The other forecasters reinforced my core reasoning: extremely short 2-month timeframe, Russia's military commitment in Ukraine, lack of Western intelligence corroboration, and the significant US policy shift away from publicly confronting Russia. Forecaster 3 raised the most important point I underweighted: NATO Article 5 implications. If Russia invaded Lithuania or Poland (the specific countries in Zelensky's warnings), this would trigger collective defense obligations - a fundamentally different calculation than invading Ukraine. This makes those scenarios even less likely than I initially considered. Forecaster 2's point about Ukrainian incentives to maintain Western threat focus is also valuable context for evaluating Zelensky's warnings. However, no forecaster identified entirely new evidence or arguments that would warrant a significant revision. The consensus validates the analytical framework: status quo heavily favors No, with only tail risks from potential invasions of non-NATO targets (Moldova, Georgia) or miscalculation scenarios.",
    "rationale": "My original 4% forecast appears well-calibrated given the deliberation. The NATO Article 5 consideration actually strengthens the case for a low probability, as it removes the most frequently discussed targets (Lithuania, Poland) from realistic scenarios - any invasion there would be catastrophically costly for Russia. The remaining scenarios are: (1) invasion of non-NATO former Soviet states like Moldova or escalation in Georgia, (2) limited military incursions that might be characterized as invasion, or (3) miscalculation. Against these possibilities: Russia's forces remain committed in Ukraine, no credible Western intelligence indicates preparation for operations elsewhere, only 2 months remain, and the US administration has demonstrated reluctance to publicly accuse Russia of aggression based on its UN voting record. The West-2025 exercises in Belarus remain a wildcard but lack independent verification. The strong consensus at 4-5% across all three forecasters, combined with reinforcing arguments during deliberation, suggests this probability range accurately reflects both the low base rate and the small but non-zero tail risks.",
