  "information": "In January 2025, Databricks completed a major funding round, raising over $15.25 billion. This included a $10 billion Series J equity financing round, which valued the company at $62 billion, and an additional $5.25 billion in debt financing provided by several major banks. New investors in the equity round included Meta as a strategic partner. The funding is intended to accelerate the development of new AI products, expand market reach, and finance acquisitions. A portion of the funds was also designated to offer liquidity to current and former employees.\n\nDatabricks has an upcoming Data + AI Summit scheduled for June 9-12, 2025. Keynote speakers announced for the event include the CEOs of JPMorgan Chase, Anthropic, and Microsoft. Previously, Databricks CEO Ali Ghodsi had described 2024 as a \"dumb\" year for IPOs and has made statements suggesting flexibility on the timing of a public offering, mentioning both 2025 and 2026 as possibilities. A January 2025 report noted that a public offering within a year \"wouldn't be a huge surprise.\"\n\nAs of late May 2025, there have been no public reports of Databricks selecting underwriters for an IPO or of the company making a confidential S-1 filing with the SEC. Market sentiment has been described as uncertain, with some IPO advisors noting that while planning is occurring, macroeconomic concerns might cause delays. Other major tech startups, such as Stripe, have also remained private despite IPO expectations. In contrast, companies like Klarna and eToro have reportedly filed confidential IPO paperwork.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Approximately 40 days, from May 22, 2025 to July 1, 2025",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No announcement. Databricks continues operating as a private company without announcing IPO plans.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Databricks remains private through July 1, 2025, leveraging its recent $15.25 billion funding round to continue operations. The company uses its June Data + AI Summit to showcase products and partnerships but makes no IPO announcement, instead waiting for more favorable market conditions or pushing the timeline into late 2025 or 2026.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Databricks announces IPO plans at its June 9-12, 2025 Data + AI Summit, using the high-profile event with major CEOs as speakers to make the announcement. Alternatively, they file a preliminary S-1 with the SEC in early-to-mid June, signaling their intent to go public.",
    "rationale": "The status quo strongly favors No for several reasons. First, Databricks just completed a massive $15.25 billion funding round in January 2025, which typically extends runway for 2-3 years and reduces immediate IPO pressure. The funding specifically included employee liquidity provisions, addressing one key driver for going public. Second, as of late May 2025, there are no reported signs of IPO preparation—no underwriters selected, no confidential S-1 filing mentioned. Third, only 40 days remain until the resolution date, which is an extremely short window for IPO announcement preparation, even if the announcement itself is just stating intent rather than executing the offering. However, there are some factors suggesting non-zero probability. The upcoming Data + AI Summit (June 9-12) with high-profile CEO speakers could serve as a strategic announcement venue. The CEO has mentioned 2025 as a possibility, and a January report suggested an IPO within a year 'wouldn't be a huge surprise.' At a $62 billion valuation, Databricks is certainly mature enough for public markets. But the lack of visible preparation signals is decisive. If they planned to announce at the June summit, we would likely see preparatory signals by now. Market uncertainty and the strategic value of remaining private with ample funding further support waiting. My forecast is not higher because of the absence of preparation signals, the very short timeframe, and the recent massive funding that reduces urgency. It's not lower because the June summit presents a plausible announcement opportunity, and announcing plans (rather than executing an IPO) is a lower bar that could theoretically happen with less lead time. To update higher, I would need: evidence of underwriter selection, reports of confidential filings, or explicit CEO statements about near-term IPO plans. To update lower: the June summit passing without announcement would effectively reduce probability to near-zero for the remaining weeks.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nBefore July 1, 2025, will Databricks announce that it is planning an IPO?\n\nQuestion background:\nTechCrunch: ['It's dumb to IPO this year': Databricks CEO explains why he's waiting to go public](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/dumb-ipo-databricks-ceo-explains-064957000.html)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question will resolve as **Yes** if Databricks, Inc., announces before July 1, 2025, that it is planning an initial public offering. In order to streamline the resolution of this question, there are two resolution sources for the IPO announcement: 1) Databricks filing an [SEC Form S-1](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/sec-form-s-1.asp) or 2) An announcement at the [news](https://www.databricks.com/blog) section of its website. If there is no such announcement before that date, this question resolves as **No**.\n\n\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nIn January 2025, Databricks completed a major funding round, raising over $15.25 billion.

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
