    "review": "Both forecasters largely mirror my take: real momentum with House passage and executive backing, but meaningful timing/process risk. Forecaster 3 usefully highlights the constitutional 30‑day presidential assent window as a hard timing constraint if Senate passage slips to late June. Forecaster 2 underscores Senate–executive alignment and the relative political palatability of the VAT exemption—points I agree with. Neither adds concrete new reporting (e.g., Senate scheduling), so the evidentiary base is unchanged. The idea of carving out the VAT exemption for fast‑track passage is plausible but speculative absent signals from leadership.",
    "rationale": "Key facts remain: House has reportedly passed the omnibus tax bill that includes a VAT exemption for real estate; Senate action and presidential assent are pending; implementation was targeted for July 1, but the Q1 passage goal slipped. The path to Yes is clear if the Senate prioritizes this in May/early June and the President assents promptly. Risks: (1) Senate amendments forcing harmonization could eat weeks; (2) labor‑driven controversy around other provisions could slow the entire package; (3) the 30‑day assent window becomes binding if passage occurs in late June; (4) Nigeria’s history of slippage on reform timelines. Counterpoints: APC control and executive priority can compress timelines; the VAT exemption itself is unlikely to be the sticking point; House passage is a major hurdle cleared with roughly eight weeks left. Netting these, I still see slightly‑better‑than‑even odds but not as high as mid‑60s without concrete signs of expedited Senate calendaring or a commitment to immediate assent. I would move up on credible reports of Senate second/third readings scheduled in May, minimal amendments, or explicit signals of immediate presidential assent; I would move down on signs of extended committee work, major amendments requiring harmonization, calendar congestion, or escalating labor action affecting sittings. Given no new hard signals since my prior assessment, I’m holding my estimate.",
