    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "About 60 days (until June 30, 2025)",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No — Mozambique does not currently have a US State Department Level 4 (“Do Not Travel”) advisory.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "The State Department maintains Mozambique’s overall advisory below Level 4 (with possible area-specific Level 4 warnings for parts of Cabo Delgado). Security incidents remain geographically limited; protests are sporadic and contained; no nationwide destabilizing event occurs; cyclone/health risks remain manageable.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "A rapid, nationwide deterioration prompts an upgrade to Level 4: e.g., a major insurgent offensive spreads beyond Cabo Delgado or triggers large-scale attacks in Maputo or key transport corridors; widespread violent unrest or a coup; a catastrophic disaster (e.g., a severe cyclone striking population centers) overwhelms capacity; or a specific, credible threat to US citizens leads to a countrywide “Do Not Travel.”",
    "rationale": "Time window is short and the State Department rarely escalates countries to Level 4 absent severe, broad-based risk. Mozambique has faced an Islamist insurgency concentrated in Cabo Delgado, with periodic surges. Historically, the US has addressed this with area-specific “Do Not Travel” guidance, while keeping the national level lower. The linked ATTA advisory reflects sector caution amid protests but does not imply an imminent US Level 4 shift. Base rates: Only a small number of countries move to Level 4 in any given quarter, typically due to war, state collapse, or acute nationwide crises. Mozambique’s risks (insurgency in the north, occasional protests, crime, seasonal cyclones) are material but typically localized/seasonal and have not recently produced nationwide breakdowns. Why not higher: No current signal of nationwide destabilization; cyclone season is largely past; past US practice favors regional restrictions over countrywide Level 4. Why not lower: The insurgency could flare; SADC/Rwandan posture shifts could change dynamics; a high-impact attack in Maputo/tourist hubs, severe unrest, or a major disaster could prompt a rapid change. Update triggers upward: credible reports of expanding insurgent operations into central/southern provinces; sustained mass unrest or security force crackdowns nationwide; significant terrorist incidents in Maputo/Beira/Nampula; catastrophic storm or public health emergency; US Embassy security posture escalating (e.g., drawdowns, authorized/ordered departures). Update triggers downward: continued containment of violence to the far north; absence of major unrest; no severe disasters; stable embassy posture. Research assistant provided no additional info; this forecast leans heavily on status quo patterns and base rates.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill Mozambique receive a \"Level 4 – Do Not Travel\" travel advisory from the US State Department before July 1, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nMSN: [ATTA issues travel advisory for Mozambique amid protests](https://www.msn.com/en-za/travel/travel-preparation/atta-issues-travel-advisory-for-mozambique-amid-protests/ar-AA1wHavB?ocid=BingNewsVerp)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if the country of Mozambique has received a Level 4 [travel advisory](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/International-Travel-Country-Information-Pages/Mozambique.html) from the US Department of State before July 1, 2025.\n\n\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nNo additional information available.\n\nToday is 2025-05-02.\n\nBefore answering you think:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n(e) You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
