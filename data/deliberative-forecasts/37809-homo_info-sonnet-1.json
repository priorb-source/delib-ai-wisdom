    "review": "The other forecasters raise critical points I underweighted. Most importantly, Forecaster 3's evidence that NO player has achieved .400+ on July 1 in the last 25+ seasons is devastating historical precedent I didn't fully account for. The Arraez example is particularly instructive - declining from .401 to .392 in just 8 days shows how quickly these averages can collapse even for elite contact hitters. Forecaster 2's analysis of Freeman needing to bat .425 over his next 160 at-bats illustrates the mathematical difficulty involved. However, there's an apparent informational gap: my research assistant indicates Judge is currently at .401 (as of today, May 20), while Forecaster 2 cites Freeman at .375 as the highest. If Judge truly is at .401 today, that fundamentally changes the probability calculation - we're asking whether he can MAINTAIN .400, not whether someone can REACH it. This is a crucial distinction the other forecasters may have missed.",
    "rationale": "I'm updating significantly downward from 35% to 20%, but not as low as the other forecasters' 5-7%. Here's my reasoning: (1) The 25-year historical drought is compelling evidence this is extremely rare, even vanishingly rare. (2) Judge's statistical indicators (BABIP .481 vs .344 career, xBA .362 vs actual .401) strongly suggest regression is coming. (3) The Arraez precedent shows these averages can collapse rapidly. However, I'm staying higher than 5-7% because: (1) Judge appears to currently BE at .401, meaning he needs only to maintain rather than improve, (2) The time window is relatively short at ~42 days/35 games, which limits regression opportunity, (3) Judge is an elite, MVP-caliber player, not a typical hitter, (4) He only needs .400, not sustain .423. The tension is between the current reality (he's there now) versus all evidence suggesting it won't last. Given the 25-year drought, I should weight history very heavily, but starting from .401 with limited time remaining justifies staying above 5-7%. My 20% forecast reflects: strong skepticism based on history and statistics, but acknowledgment that the starting position and short timeframe create non-trivial probability.",
