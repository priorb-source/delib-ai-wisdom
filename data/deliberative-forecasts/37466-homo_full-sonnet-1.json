    "review": "All three forecasts cluster tightly between 23-30%, suggesting strong convergence on the key evidence. The most compelling shared insight is that WorldAtlas updated their article title to include 'Gulf of America' but has NOT updated their main North America map despite 3.5 months passing. This split approach - acknowledging the controversy in articles while maintaining traditional naming on maps - appears to be their deliberate editorial position rather than simple delay. Forecaster 2's emphasis on this as 'deliberate editorial caution' resonates strongly. Forecaster 3 correctly notes that web changes are technically quick, so time isn't the constraint - editorial policy is. The key question all three analyses implicitly ask: if WorldAtlas was going to change their primary map display, why wouldn't they have done so when they updated the article title? The lack of change from major competitors (National Geographic, Apple) combined with WorldAtlas's Canadian/international perspective reinforces the status quo bias. No new evidence was raised that I hadn't considered, but the collective emphasis on the 3.5 month delay as the single strongest signal is persuasive.",
    "rationale": "The consensus analysis strengthens my confidence that the 3.5 month delay despite article-level acknowledgment is the most important indicator. WorldAtlas appears to have established a stable middle position: acknowledging the controversy in content while maintaining traditional cartographic standards. For them to change their map now would require either: (1) major international mapping services making the change first, (2) International Hydrographic Organization recognition, or (3) a significant shift in editorial policy. None of these seem likely in the remaining 54 days. The fact that three independent forecasters, using the same evidence, converged on 23-30% validates this range. The tight clustering suggests we've appropriately weighted the evidence. I'm adjusting slightly downward from 25% to 24% to reflect the consensus emphasis on the delay timeline being the strongest negative signal, but the adjustment is minimal because my original reasoning already incorporated this factor.",
