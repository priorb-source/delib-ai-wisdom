    "review": "Both forecasters frame the 67–68 day window as roughly median for allergen/misbranding recalls, which I agree implies a near 50% base rate. F2’s emphasis on volume, long production span, and frozen product is reasonable, but I think the “frozen” factor mainly matters for product still in commerce (retail/distribution), not in consumers’ freezers; consumer possession typically doesn’t prevent closure. F3 appropriately weights the single-state footprint, voluntary nature, and lack of illnesses, which do ease verification. Neither explicitly mentioned that the FSIS Active→Closed status can lag the operational completion of effectiveness checks—an administrative timing risk that slightly tilts toward No. Net, I find F2 a bit too bearish if they’re counting consumer-held frozen product against closure, and F3 slightly optimistic given the potential for verification/administrative lag and the long production window increasing consignee complexity.",
    "rationale": "Baseline remains near 50% because the 67-day window is close to historical medians for allergen/misbranding recalls. Factors for Yes: single-state (NY) retail distribution, misbranding/undeclared allergen rather than pathogen, voluntary/cooperative firm, and no illnesses reported. Factors for No: sizable volume (~65k lbs), long production window (dating to Nov 2023) implying more lots/consignees to verify, potential for recall scope adjustments, and a nontrivial chance of FSIS status-change lag even if retrieval is largely complete by late June. The “frozen” attribute is a modest negative mainly if significant inventory remains at retail/distribution; consumer-held product usually doesn’t block closure. Considering peers’ points, I make a small downward tweak to reflect consignee complexity and status-update lag risk. Change: 48% → 47%.",
