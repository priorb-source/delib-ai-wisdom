  "information": "According to reports from sources including The New York Times, Bloomberg, and Ars Technica in March 2025, Discord is planning an initial public offering (IPO) for 2025. The company is reportedly in discussions with investment banks Goldman Sachs and JP Morgan Chase to prepare for a potential listing. While some sources describe the talks as exploratory, others mention the hiring of a new CEO with IPO experience as a signal of late-stage readiness. Discord's valuation was estimated at approximately $15 billion in 2021, and it has over 200 million monthly active users.\n\nDiscord had previously considered going public in 2021 but postponed those plans due to market volatility. That same year, Microsoft offered to acquire Discord for $10 billion, but the company's leadership rejected the offer and a potential IPO was considered as an alternative. Responding to the recent 2025 IPO reports, a Discord spokesperson stated that the company does not comment on rumors or speculation. Discord's revenue is generated through a 'freemium' model, selling subscriptions for premium features.\n\nThe environment for technology IPOs in 2025 is described with mixed signals. Some reports mention a favorable IPO window, noting that other tech firms like CoreWeave, Klarna, and Figma have recently filed to go public. Other reports highlight market volatility, pointing to a recent 7-8.7% drop in the tech-heavy Nasdaq index and uncertainty surrounding Fed rate and trade policies as potential headwinds for companies considering a public launch.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "About 38 days (until July 1, 2025)",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Discord continues prepping privately (possibly via a confidential draft submission) and waits to publicly file until after the July 4 holiday period or into late summer/early fall; no specific IPO-plan post appears on Discord’s news blog.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Discord publicly files a Form S-1 on EDGAR in June to target a late-July or autumn IPO, or posts a specific news item on its blog stating it plans to go public (e.g., announcing an S-1 filing).",
    "rationale": "- Evidence and signals: Multiple reputable outlets (NYT, Bloomberg, Ars Technica) reported in March 2025 that Discord is preparing a 2025 IPO and has engaged JPMorgan and Goldman Sachs. Leadership moves and operational tightening are consistent with late-stage readiness. These are meaningful signals that the company wants the option to list in 2025.\n- Resolution mechanics: This question resolves Yes only if there’s a publicly filed S-1 or a specific announcement on Discord’s news blog before July 1. Companies rarely pre-announce IPO plans on a blog due to quiet-period considerations; the standard path is an SEC filing. Many issuers also first submit confidentially, which would not satisfy the question unless and until a public S-1 appears.\n- Timing and market context: The window to July 1 is short (~5.5 weeks). Public S-1s typically precede an IPO by several weeks to a couple of months. If Discord targets a fall listing, a public S-1 might appear after the July 4 holiday, not before it. Bankers often avoid the July 4 week for major milestones. Mixed market signals (recent Nasdaq volatility, policy uncertainty) reduce the incentive to rush a June filing unless conditions improve.\n- Status quo weighting: As of today, there has been no public S-1 or specific blog announcement. The most likely path is continued preparation with a later public filing. That keeps the base case at No before July 1.\n- Why not higher: Short runway to the cutoff; seasonal considerations around early July; blog-announcement path is unlikely; companies may prefer to keep optionality with confidential submissions until later summer.\n- Why not lower: Credible reporting of active 2025 IPO prep and top-tier bank mandates; if Discord wants a late-July or early-August execution, a June S-1 is plausible. A “surprise” June filing remains within normal practice.\n- What would move the forecast up: Reliable reports that Discord has confidentially submitted a draft S-1; visible strengthening of the tech IPO tape and risk appetite; comparable consumer/social IPOs trading well; regulatory clarity or strong financials leaked.\n- What would move it down: Renewed market drawdown or volatility spike; reports of delayed timelines, a large private funding round instead of IPO, key executive departures, or operational setbacks.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nBefore July 1, 2025, will Discord announce that it is planning an IPO?\n\nQuestion background:\nArs Technica: [Discord is planning an IPO this year, and big changes could be on the horizon](https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2025/03/report-discord-partners-with-jp-morgan-chase-goldman-sachs-for-a-2025-ipo/)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question will resolve as **Yes** if Discord, Inc., announces before July 1, 2025, that it is planning an initial public offering. In order to streamline the resolution of this question, there are two resolution sources for the IPO announcement: 1) The company filing an [SEC Form S-1](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/sec-form-s-1.asp) or 2) An announcement at the [news](https://discord.com/blog) section of its website. If there is no such announcement before that date, this question resolves as **No**.\n\nPlease note that for an announcement on the news section of the company's website to resolve the question as Yes, the announcement must be specific. Vague statements such as \"someday becoming a public company\" will not count. If there is any doubt, then greater weight will be placed on whether an S-1 has been filed.\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nAccording to reports from sources including The New York Times, Bloomberg, and Ars Technica in March 2025, Discord is planning an initial public offering (IPO) for 2025.

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
