  "information": "The last mutually acknowledged phone call between Donald Trump and Xi Jinping took place on January 17, 2025. Since then, Trump has claimed to have spoken with Xi on multiple occasions, but China's Foreign Ministry has repeatedly and publicly denied that any leader-to-leader calls have occurred. On May 5, 2025, President Trump stated he had 'no immediate plans to speak with Chinese President Xi Jinping.' Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Guo Jiakum reiterated that 'the two heads of state have not called each other recently' and that no negotiations on tariffs are underway.",

    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "39 days",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "The current diplomatic dynamic persists. Both the US and Chinese governments see no strategic benefit in a high-level presidential call within this short timeframe. Any necessary diplomatic communications are handled by lower-level officials, and the June 15 deadline passes without a mutually acknowledged phone call.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "A significant and acute international crisis emerges, for example, a major military escalation in the Taiwan Strait or a sudden global financial shock tied to US-China trade. This event necessitates immediate, direct de-escalation and coordination between the two leaders, prompting an emergency phone call that both sides find it in their strategic interest to publicly acknowledge.",
    "rationale": "The current evidence strongly suggests a 'No' outcome. The status quo, which should be heavily weighted, is a lack of high-level communication. My research assistant's report indicates the last acknowledged call was nearly four months ago, and more recently, both sides have publicly stated there are no immediate plans for a call. China's Foreign Ministry has explicitly denied President Trump's claims of recent conversations, highlighting a significant level of public friction. The resolution criteria are strict, requiring not just a call, but mutual public acknowledgement, which is a high bar given the current diplomatic climate. The time frame is very short (just over five weeks), which is typically insufficient for a major reversal of diplomatic posture without a powerful catalyst. \n\nMy forecast is not lower than 10% because geopolitics are inherently volatile. An unforeseen crisis could force a call as a de-escalation measure. Furthermore, President Trump's diplomatic approach can be unpredictable, and a sudden perceived opportunity for a 'deal' could lead him to initiate contact. \n\nMy forecast is not higher because the official statements from both the White House ('no immediate plans') and the Chinese Foreign Ministry ('have not called each other recently') create a strong presumption against a call. The established pattern of Chinese denials makes the 'mutual acknowledgement' clause particularly difficult to meet. \n\nI would increase my forecast if there were credible reports of high-level diplomatic visits being scheduled (e.g., Secretary of State to Beijing) or a sudden, major crisis involving both nations' core interests. I would decrease my forecast if both leaders make further public statements ruling out a near-term meeting as the deadline approaches.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill Donald Trump and Xi Jinping speak on the phone with each other before June 15, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nCBS News: [Trump says he's talked with Xi about tariffs. China has denied talks are taking place](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/trump-xi-china-tariffs/)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if, after May 12, 2025 and before June 15, 2025, Donald Trump and Xi Jinping speak on the phone with each other, according to [credible sources](https://www.metaculus.com/faq/#definitions).\n\nBoth sides must acknowledge the phone call took place for it to count. \"Speak on the phone with each other\" is defined as both individuals, from different physical spaces, orally uttering words intended for the other individual into a telephone or equivalent device, those words being converted into electrical or digital signals in real time, and then transferred to the other individual via telecommunications links, where they are reconverted into sound waves at the other individual's listening device.\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nThe last mutually acknowledged phone call between Donald Trump and Xi Jinping took place on January 17, 2025.

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
