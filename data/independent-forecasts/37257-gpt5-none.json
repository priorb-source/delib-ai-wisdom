    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "About 60 days (until July 1, 2025)",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No: no official date is announced or scheduled by an RS authority.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "RS leadership continues escalatory rhetoric and symbolic acts but stops short of formally scheduling an independence referendum due to strong external pressure (EU/US, Serbia’s caution), economic/sanctions risks, and a long-standing pattern of brinkmanship without crossing the formal scheduling threshold.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "The RS National Assembly or President Dodik officially sets a specific referendum date—potentially tied to a symbolic day (e.g., Vidovdan, June 28) or for a later date in 2025/2026—announced before July 1 as leverage against decisions by Bosnia’s Constitutional Court/OHR or as a domestic rallying move amid a political flashpoint.",
    "rationale": "Baseline: RS leaders, especially Milorad Dodik, have repeatedly threatened a secession/independence referendum over many years but have not officially scheduled one. When they have held referendums, they were on narrower issues (e.g., RS Day in 2016), not outright independence. The base rate for moving from rhetoric to formally setting a date for independence is very low.\nConstraints and incentives: Officially scheduling an independence referendum would be a major escalation likely to trigger immediate and broad international pushback (sanctions, financial pressure) and could strain ties with Belgrade, which generally counsels caution to avoid destabilization. RS also has economic dependencies that make a high-cost provocation less attractive. These factors bias toward continued brinkmanship without setting a binding date.\nTime window and mechanics: There are only ~60 days left. While NSRS can act quickly, scheduling a specific date (not just vague intent) is a higher bar than issuing threats; the short window and high diplomatic costs make a sudden formal scheduling less likely. A plausible path to Yes would be a sharp trigger—e.g., a new OHR imposition, an adverse court ruling, or a geopolitical cue (Moscow’s encouragement)—that RS leadership answers by announcing a date (possibly symbolic like June 28) even if the vote would occur later in 2025/2026. That scenario is credible but still a minority likelihood.\nStatus quo weight: Given the long pattern of talk without a formal date, high external constraints, and the short remaining time, the status quo (No) remains the most probable outcome.\nWhy not higher: If mere rhetoric counted, odds would be higher. But the criterion requires an official announcement of a specific date by an authorized RS actor. Historically, Dodik often stops short of that line on independence specifically. The costs and Serbia/EU pressure further suppress the odds.\nWhy not lower: Dodik has demonstrated willingness to defy Sarajevo and the international community (e.g., 2016 referendum) and uses last‑minute escalations. A flashpoint in the next two months could prompt him/NSRS to schedule a date as a bargaining tactic, even if the referendum is later and immediately condemned.\nWhat would move me up: • NSRS convenes a special session on self-determination/independence • Dodik or senior RS officials publicly promise a date soon • A new OHR decision or court ruling that RS frames as crossing a red line • Visible encouragement from Moscow/Belgrade (less likely from Belgrade) • RS media leaking draft referendum decisions with specific dates.\nWhat would move me down: • Clear, credible signals from Belgrade discouraging any referendum • New EU financial incentives or sanctions threats that RS reacts to by de‑escalating • RS leadership prioritizing economic stabilization or legal battles over headline political moves.\nResearch assistant summary: No additional information available; forecast relies on structural incentives, historical behavior, and timing considerations.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nBefore July 1, 2025, will the government of Republika Srpska officially announce a date for an independence referendum?\n\nQuestion background:\nFair Observer: [Balkan Tinderbox: How Russia’s Moves Could Reignite Bosnia](https://www.fairobserver.com/politics/balkan-tinderbox-how-russias-moves-could-reignite-bosnia/)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if, before July 1, 2025, a referendum on the independence of Republika Srpska from Bosnia and Herzegovina is officially scheduled. If this does not occur before that date, this question resolves as **No**.\n\nFor purposes of this question, the referendum will be considered \"officially scheduled\" when it is announced by a person or entity with the authority to do so within Republika Srpska. Please note that broader legality, such as within Bosnia and Herzegovina, will be considered irrelevant for this question, so if the Bosnian government declared the referendum illegal, the question would still resolve as Yes.\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nNo additional information available.\n\nToday is 2025-05-02.\n\nBefore answering you think:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n(e) You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
