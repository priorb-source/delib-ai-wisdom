    "review": "All three forecasters reached very similar conclusions (85-87%) using nearly identical reasoning. The strongest new arguments I noted were: (1) Forecaster 3's point that making permanent policy changes mid-negotiation could undermine the US negotiating position - this is compelling because removing the tariff listing would eliminate leverage, and (2) the emphasis that the suspension runs through July 9, suggesting the administration specifically planned for no changes during this entire period. Both forecasters also correctly noted that only 2 weeks have passed since the suspension announcement on April 10, making rapid policy changes even more unlikely. However, I think both forecasters may be slightly underweighting tail risks: this administration has demonstrated patterns of rapid, unexpected policy shifts, and there's a non-zero probability of administrative changes or political pressures that could affect the HTS listing independently of negotiation outcomes.",
    "rationale": "After reviewing the other analyses, I find strong convergence on the key points. The most persuasive argument I hadn't fully weighted is that modifying the HTS listing mid-negotiation would undermine US negotiating leverage - governments typically maintain enforcement mechanisms (even if suspended) during negotiations to preserve bargaining power. The fact that the suspension extends to July 9, well beyond June 1, suggests deliberate planning to maintain the status quo through this period. The recency of the April 10 announcement (only 2 weeks ago) also reinforces that rapid changes are unlikely. However, I maintain some caution about tail risks: the current political environment has shown capacity for rapid policy reversals, and the 38-day timeframe, while short, is not impossibly short for administrative action if political priorities shift. The resolution criteria's explicit statement that suspension status doesn't matter strongly favors YES since the listing already exists. Balancing the strong structural arguments for maintenance of the status quo against modest tail risks of unexpected policy shifts, I'm updating slightly upward to reflect the compelling mid-negotiation leverage argument, but maintaining that 85-88% is the appropriate range rather than 90%+.",
