    "review": "The other forecasters present a critical challenge to my analysis: they both state that none of the five specified candidates have been disqualified yet, while my research assistant's report explicitly indicates Laurent Gbagbo 'remains struck from the electoral list' as of late May 2025 according to multiple credible sources. This is a fundamental factual disagreement. Either (1) my research assistant has information they lack about Gbagbo's current disqualified status, or (2) there's ambiguity about what constitutes an official disqualification. Both forecasters make reasonable points about status quo bias, the short timeframe, and lack of reported pending challenges. However, they seem to lack the specific information I have about Gbagbo's situation. Their analyses focus on future disqualifications that might occur, while my report suggests one has already occurred. That said, their skepticism is valuable - the language 'considered disqualified' and the party's planned June actions suggest possible ambiguity about the finality of Gbagbo's status.",
    "rationale": "After reviewing the other forecasters' analyses, I maintain high confidence but acknowledge important uncertainties they've highlighted. My research assistant's report from multiple credible sources (Le Point, tunisienumerique.com, Abidjan.net) explicitly states Laurent Gbagbo 'remains struck from the electoral list' due to a 2018 conviction. This appears to satisfy the resolution criteria - a candidate removed from the electoral list before July 1, 2025. The BBC background article about a 'main opposition leader removed' likely refers to this. However, the other forecasters raise valid concerns about: (1) whether this disqualification is legally final and official, (2) potential ambiguity in the administrative status, and (3) whether appeals could reverse it. The party's statement about evaluating the situation in June and considering 'a new level in the fight' suggests they view the situation as potentially changeable, though this could also mean fighting an already-enacted disqualification. I'm moderating from 90% to 78% to account for uncertainty about the finality and official status of what appears to be an existing disqualification, while maintaining relatively high confidence given the specific, multi-source reporting about Gbagbo's current status.",
