  "information": "For the 2025 election, the Liberal Democrat party has launched a significant fundraising effort, including a £100,000 fund, and is fielding a near-full slate of candidates. An Electoral Calculus MRP poll has been cited in analyses of the election. On the Conservative side, several high-profile councillors announced their retirement, including the council leader Linda Taylor.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Approximately 10 days. The 2025 Cornwall Council election is scheduled for May 1, 2025, which is the traditional first Thursday in May date for UK local elections.",
    "status_quo_outcome": "The status quo would be the continuation of no overall control from the 2021 election, with seat distribution remaining relatively similar to the current composition. However, significant changes appear likely given the reported developments.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "The Liberal Democrats fail to win the most seats if Cornwall's strong independent tradition prevails and independents win a plurality, or if Conservatives perform better than expected despite leadership changes. A fragmented opposition could also allow another party to edge ahead despite Lib Dem gains.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "The Liberal Democrats capitalize on their organizational strength (£100,000 fundraising, near-full candidate slate), Conservative weakness (retiring leader and councillors), favorable polling data from Electoral Calculus MRP, and their historical strength in Cornwall to win the most seats on the council.",
    "rationale": "Several factors strongly favor a Liberal Democrat victory in winning the most seats. The party demonstrates exceptional organizational capacity through their £100,000 fundraising effort and near-complete candidate slate. The Conservative opposition shows significant weakness with council leader Linda Taylor retiring alongside multiple high-profile councillors, suggesting internal problems or electoral pessimism. The mention of Electoral Calculus MRP polling in election analyses suggests Lib Dems are polling competitively. Historically, Cornwall has been favorable Lib Dem territory at local level. The national political environment in April 2025 would typically favor opposition parties over Conservatives. However, I'm not assigning an even higher probability because: (1) exact polling figures weren't provided, (2) Cornwall has a strong independent tradition that could fragment the vote, (3) I lack precise current seat distributions, and (4) MRP polls can be unreliable for local elections. I'm not going lower because the confluence of evidence - fundraising, candidate recruitment, opponent weakness, and historical precedent - all point in the same direction. To revise upward, I'd need to see actual MRP numbers showing a clear Lib Dem lead or confirmation they currently hold plurality. To revise downward, I'd need evidence of a strong unified independent slate or late Conservative organizational recovery.",
