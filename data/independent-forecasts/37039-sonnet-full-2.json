  "information": "On April 2-3, 2025, the U.S. President announced comprehensive tariffs. The policy included a 10% base tariff on goods from almost all countries, effective April 5, and additional country-specific tariffs to take effect on April 9. For Switzerland, the total tariff was set at 31%. The stated justifications included that Switzerland had been 'taking advantage' of the US and as a response to alleged 61% tariffs imposed by Switzerland on American products.\n\nThe Swiss government, including President Karin Keller-Sutter, expressed 'incomprehension' regarding the tariff calculation. Swiss officials stated that the country imposes a 0% tariff on US imports, and that Swiss companies have created 500,000 jobs in the US. Switzerland's trade surplus with the US was $38.5 billion in 2024. The Swiss watch industry was noted as being particularly affected, with share prices for major exporters like Richemont and Swatch falling after the announcement.\n\nThe 31% additional ad valorem duty for Swiss products was officially listed under subheading 9903.01.60 of the U.S. Harmonized Tariff Schedule (HTS). On April 10, 2025, the U.S. administration announced that the country-specific tariffs, including the one for Switzerland, would be suspended for 90 days to allow for negotiations. This suspension period is scheduled to run until July 9, 2025, covering the June 1 resolution date. The HTS listing for Switzerland under subheading 9903.01.60 reflects the 31% rate but is marked as 'suspended'.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "38 days (from April 24, 2025 to June 1, 2025)",
    "status_quo_outcome": "Yes - the 31% tariff is currently listed in the Harmonized Tariff Schedule under subheading 9903.01.60 for Switzerland, though marked as suspended",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "The US government formally modifies the HTS listing before June 1 to show a different tariff rate for Switzerland, or removes the subheading entirely, possibly as a result of successful negotiations during the 90-day suspension period",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "The HTS listing remains unchanged at 31% through June 1. Since the question explicitly states that suspension status does not affect resolution, the tariff stays listed as 31% (whether suspended or active) when checked on June 1",
    "rationale": "The critical detail is that the question asks whether the tariff will be LISTED as 31%, and explicitly states that suspension status does not affect resolution. Currently, the 31% tariff IS listed in the HTS under subheading 9903.01.60 for Switzerland - it's just marked as suspended until July 9, 2025. Since June 1 falls within this suspension period, the status quo strongly favors a Yes outcome. For a No outcome, the US government would need to actively modify the HTS listing itself (changing the rate or removing the entry) rather than just managing suspension status. This is unlikely because: (1) The 90-day suspension period was specifically designed to allow negotiations while keeping the tariff listing in place, (2) Governments typically modify suspension status rather than the underlying HTS entries during negotiation periods, (3) Only 38 days remain until June 1, which is a short timeframe for formal HTS modifications, and (4) Swiss-US negotiations are unlikely to conclude and result in formal tariff rate changes before early June. My forecast is not higher (95%+) because there's a small possibility of rapid negotiations leading to a formal rate change, or an administrative decision to modify the listing. It's not lower (70% or below) because the status quo already satisfies the Yes criteria, and there's no indication the administration plans to change the actual HTS listing rather than just managing suspension timing. I would update higher if evidence emerges that the suspension will definitely continue unchanged through June 1, or lower if negotiations show signs of reaching a deal that would formally change the HTS listing before June 1.",

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any).
