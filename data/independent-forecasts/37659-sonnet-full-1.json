  "information": "According to multiple independent news sources from April 2025, the Project 2025 Tracker showed significant progress. A Blick.ch report from April 8 stated that 100 out of 302 objectives were completed. A week later, on April 16, a Medium.com article reported the number had risen to 105 completed objectives, with an additional 44 listed as \"in progress\". An earlier report from The Daily Dot on February 25 noted that over 36% of its monitored objectives were implemented. One analysis contained in the reports calculated the historical completion rate at approximately 2.2 objectives per day.\n\nProject 2025 is a 922-page strategic document authored by the Heritage Foundation. Its stated aims include restructuring the US government and shrinking the federal bureaucracy. Specific objectives mentioned in news reports include dismantling the United States Agency for International Development (USAID), removing funding for the United Nations Human Rights Council and the W.H.O., allowing political appointees to personally authorize appropriated funding, reducing education programs, and imposing higher tariffs on imports from various countries.\n\nThe Project 2025 Tracker is a public website created by Redditors from the r/Keep_Track subreddit, with Adrienne Cobb identified as its creator. The site monitors and visually demonstrates the progress of the administration's initiatives based on the Project 2025 plan, breaking down the status of objectives by government agency. According to an April 2025 report, the tracker website was attracting between 50,000 and 100,000 visitors daily, with approximately 10% of the traffic originating from outside the United States.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Approximately 46 days from May 16, 2025 to July 1, 2025",
    "status_quo_outcome": "Yes - the question would resolve as Yes if current trends continue",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "The completion rate would need to slow dramatically from the historical 2.2 objectives per day to effectively zero. This could occur if there is major political upheaval, the tracker methodology changes significantly, legal challenges halt implementation of objectives, or the administration shifts priorities away from Project 2025 objectives.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "The completion rate continues at any reasonable pace. Even if the rate slows to 25% of its historical pace (from 2.2 to 0.5 objectives per day), the tracker would still reach approximately 143 completed objectives by July 1, well above the 120 threshold.",
    "rationale": "The mathematical case for Yes is strong. Starting from the April 16 baseline of 105 completed objectives, there are 76 days until July 1. At the historical rate of 2.2 objectives per day, we would expect approximately 272 completed objectives by the resolution date - more than double the required threshold. To miss the 120 threshold, the completion rate would need to fall to approximately 0.2 objectives per day, representing an 11-fold slowdown with no evidence of such deceleration in the data. The progression from 100 objectives on April 8 to 105 on April 16 (about 0.6 per day over that 8-day period) suggests the rate may already be slowing from the 2.2 historical average, but even this reduced pace would easily clear 120 by July 1. The February report noting 36% completion (approximately 109 objectives out of 302) also aligns with steady progress. However, I'm not assigning 95%+ probability because: (1) the most recent data is 30 days old, creating uncertainty about current status, (2) easier objectives may have been completed first, potentially slowing future progress, (3) unforeseen political or methodological changes could occur, and (4) small sample statistical noise. I'm not going lower than 85% because the required slowdown to miss the threshold is extreme and unprecedented in the available data. For me to update significantly downward, I would need evidence of: a major policy shift, legal injunctions halting implementation, or actual data showing completion rates have fallen below 0.3 per day. To update upward toward 95%+, I would want confirmation that current completed objectives already exceed 120, or clear evidence the pace is accelerating rather than slowing.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill the Project 2025 Tracker classify at least 120 objectives as \"Done\" on July 1, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nThe 2025 Tracker is a project of the Keep_Track subreddit and is explained [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/Keep_Track/comments/1ii7tbr/project_2025_tracker_is_now_live/).\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if the [Project 2025 Tracker](https://www.project2025.observer/) has ≥120 Objectives classified as Done when accessed by Metaculus on or after July 1, 2025.

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower.
