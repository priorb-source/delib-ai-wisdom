  "information": "The 2026 Florida gubernatorial race involves several candidates. For the Republican nomination, Congressman Byron Donalds has launched his campaign and received an endorsement from former President Trump. Other potential Republican candidates include Florida First Lady Casey DeSantis, former U.S. Rep. Matt Gaetz, and Lt. Governor Jeanette Nuñez. On the Democratic side, former U.S. Representative David Jolly has announced his candidacy. State senator Jason Pizzo also announced he will run as an independent. Florida's primary election is scheduled for August 18, 2026, with the general election on November 3, 2026.\n\nAs of early June 2025, Miami Mayor Francis Suarez has publicly stated he is considering a run for governor. A poll conducted by The James Madison Institute in May 2025 showed Suarez with 5% support in the Republican primary field. In local politics, the Miami City Commission was set to vote on a proposal to move the city's November election to 2026, which would extend the terms of current commissioners and Mayor Suarez by one year.\n\nHistorically, in the last two open Florida gubernatorial cycles (2018 and 2022), major candidates typically announced their campaigns 12 to 18 months before the primary election. For the 2026 cycle, some contenders, such as Republican Byron Donalds and Democrat David Jolly, had already announced their candidacies by early June 2025. Reports note that as of early June, there have been no leaks of a launch date, no exploratory committee paperwork filed by Suarez, and no scheduled kickoff events for a gubernatorial campaign.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "About 26 days (until July 1, 2025)",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Suarez continues to signal interest but does not schedule or hold a launch event and makes no explicit public statement of candidacy before July 1, opting to wait for more clarity on the GOP field (e.g., Casey DeSantis, Gaetz) or to build infrastructure, or ultimately decides against running.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Within June, Suarez announces in a media interview or at a Miami-area event that he’s running for governor, positions himself as a pro-growth, Hispanic Republican alternative, and begins fundraising immediately.",
    "rationale": "- Timing: We’re 14 months from the Aug 18, 2026 primary, which sits inside the historical 12–18 month announcement window. That makes a June 2025 launch plausible in principle but not necessary. With roughly one month left, the window is narrow. \n- Current signals: Per the assistant’s report as of early June, there are no leaks of a launch date, no exploratory committee paperwork, and no kickoff events scheduled. Serious statewide campaigns usually telegraph a launch at least days to weeks in advance (staff hires, venue holds, domain/branding, donor calls). The absence of these cues lowers the near-term hazard rate. \n- Competitive landscape: Rep. Byron Donalds is already in and has Trump’s endorsement—dampening Suarez’s incentive to rush out an announcement and suggesting he may wait to assess the field (including potential entries by Casey DeSantis or Matt Gaetz). Suarez’s early polling at ~5% underscores that he lacks an obvious base at the moment. \n- Countervailing factors: June still fits the traditional window, and Suarez is media-savvy; a quick, interview-based announcement (which would satisfy the resolution criteria even without filings) is possible. He could also want to plant a flag before others firm up. \n- Status quo bias: With no preparatory indicators and only ~3.5 weeks left, the default is no announcement before July 1. \nWhy not higher? Lack of telltale pre-launch activity, Trump’s endorsement of a rival, short time remaining, and tepid polling. \nWhy not lower? June is still a reasonable entry point historically; he has publicly said he’s considering it; a surprise media announcement would count. \nUpdates I’d watch: \n- Upward: Reports of filing an exploratory or candidate committee, staff hiring, venue reservations, coordinated donor outreach, or credible reporting of an imminent launch window. \n- Downward: Clear signals Casey DeSantis is entering soon, additional consolidation behind Donalds, negative legal/political developments for Suarez, or explicit statements that he’s delaying a decision beyond July.",
