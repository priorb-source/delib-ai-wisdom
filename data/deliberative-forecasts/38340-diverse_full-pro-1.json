    "review": "All three forecasters are in strong agreement on the primary factors making a 'Yes' outcome highly improbable: the ongoing civil war, the absence of a functioning legislature, Sudan's suspension from the African Union (AU), and the extremely short timeline of less than a month. Our forecasts of 1%, 2%, and 4% reflect minor differences in how we weigh the possibility of a very low-probability 'Yes' scenario.\n\nForecaster 2's analysis closely mirrors my own but adds the important consideration that Sudan's AU suspension might lead the AU to reject a ratification instrument even if one were submitted. This is a compelling point that strengthens the case for 'No'.\n\nForecaster 3 provided the most valuable new argument by articulating a specific, albeit narrow, pathway to 'Yes': a de facto executive could ratify by decree as a symbolic act to gain legitimacy, and the AU Commission might simply accept the deposit without adjudicating internal politics. This 'procedural shortcut' scenario is more plausible than the 'sudden peace accord' I had initially envisioned, as it doesn't require a fundamental change in the country's political situation. This argument convinced me that my initial forecast might have been slightly too low.",
    "rationale": "I am updating my forecast from 1% to 2%. The small increase is driven by Forecaster 3's well-articulated scenario of a symbolic ratification-by-decree from a de facto executive. I had not fully considered this specific pathway, which is more plausible than my original 'black swan' event of a full peace treaty. It represents a narrow but conceivable route to a 'Yes' outcome.\n\nHowever, I am not moving higher toward Forecaster 3's 4% because I believe that analysis underweights two critical barriers. First, the sheer logistical chaos and lack of bureaucratic focus caused by the intense civil war make executing even a symbolic international act extremely difficult. Second, as highlighted by Forecaster 2, Sudan's suspension from the AU is a major political obstacle. It is highly questionable whether the AU would accept a ratification instrument from a suspended and contested government, as doing so could be seen as legitimizing one faction in an ongoing conflict. \n\nTherefore, while I acknowledge a slightly wider path to 'Yes' than before, the combination of internal incapacity and external political barriers keeps the probability exceptionally low. My updated forecast of 2% aligns with Forecaster 2, reflecting a shared view of the overwhelming obstacles while conceding a sliver of possibility for a surprising procedural or political maneuver.",
