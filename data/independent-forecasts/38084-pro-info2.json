  "information": "In late May 2025, the National Weather Service issued extreme heat watches and advisories for several inland regions of California, with temperatures forecasted to exceed 100 degrees Fahrenheit. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's (NOAA) Climate Prediction Center also forecasted higher-than-usual temperatures across much of the state for the summer of 2025. NOAA's outlook indicated that the ongoing drought would likely persist through the end of August, with an above-normal risk for significant wildfires from June through August.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "30 days",
    "status_quo_outcome": "Based on the current reporting of a significant, ongoing drought at the end of May, coupled with the onset of California's typically hot and dry summer season, the status quo points to a 'Yes' outcome. Drought conditions are highly likely to persist or worsen over the next month, keeping the affected population count elevated.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "A series of anomalous, unseasonal, and widespread precipitation events occur across California in June. These 'Miracle June' storms significantly replenish soil moisture and reservoir levels, leading the U.S. Drought Monitor to rapidly downgrade drought classifications across populated areas, causing the number of residents in drought to fall below 20 million by the resolution date.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "The current drought conditions persist, as forecasted by NOAA. The onset of summer brings the expected high temperatures and lack of precipitation, further stressing water resources. The number of residents classified as living in drought, which is already at or near the threshold, remains above 20.0 million on June 28.",
    "rationale": "My forecast is heavily influenced by the short, 30-day timeframe and the overwhelming weight of climatological and meteorological evidence. Today is May 29, and the resolution date is June 28, placing the forecast period at the very beginning of California's hot, dry summer. Significant drought alleviation during this month is historically rare.\n\nThe research assistant's report provides critical, timely information: NOAA's Climate Prediction Center forecasts higher-than-usual temperatures and the persistence of the ongoing drought through summer. This official forecast directly supports the 'Yes' outcome. The extreme heat advisories mentioned will increase evapotranspiration, likely worsening drought conditions, not improving them.\n\nGiven that the SF Gate article describes the current drought as 'already bad', it is highly probable that the number of affected residents is already near or above the 20 million threshold. The path of least resistance, and the one supported by all available data, is for this situation to continue for the next 30 days.\n\nMy forecast is not higher than 90% to account for the small but non-zero possibility of a major, pattern-breaking weather event, such as an exceptionally strong atmospheric river, which would be highly anomalous for June but is not physically impossible. It also allows for the possibility that the current number of people in drought is slightly below the 20 million threshold and that conditions do not worsen sufficiently to cross it.\n\nMy forecast is not lower because doing so would require ignoring both the seasonal climate norms for California and the specific, explicit forecasts from NOAA for this period. The evidence overwhelmingly points in one direction.\n\nI would update my forecast toward 'No' if multiple medium-range weather models began to consistently predict significant, widespread rainfall for California in June. I would update toward 'Yes' if the Drought Monitor released an updated map prior to the resolution date showing the affected population was already well above 25 million.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill California have 20.0 million or more residents living in drought on June 28, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nSF Gate: [California's drought has returned — and it's already bad](https://www.sfgate.com/bayarea/article/california-drought-problem-20271547.php)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if Drought Monitor at [this link](https://www.drought.gov/states/california) lists greater than or equal to 20.0 million California residents in areas of drought, when the link is accessed by Metaculus on or after June 28, 2025. If the number is below that, this question resolves as **No**.\n\nThe question will resolve as soon as the page is accessed by Metaculus Admins on the resolution date. However, if there are issues accessing the page, then resolution will wait up until the end of the tournament's scoring at which point if Metaculus has still not been able to access the resolution source, this question will be **annulled**.\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nIn late May 2025, the National Weather Service issued extreme heat watches and advisories for several inland regions of California, with temperatures forecasted to exceed 100 degrees Fahrenheit.

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
