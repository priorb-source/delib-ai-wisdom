    "no_outcome_scenario": "The player(s) currently hitting at or near .400 experience a normal statistical regression over the final 13 days of May. A few games with 0 or 1 hit out of 4 or 5 at-bats is all it takes to pull their average below the .400 threshold by June 1.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "A player currently enjoying a hot streak, such as Aaron Judge, manages to sustain their high performance for another 13 days. A combination of skill and luck (a high batting average on balls in play) allows them to keep their average at or above .400 through the end of May.",
    "rationale": "My forecast is based on the significant tension between a player's current reported performance and the strong statistical principle of regression to the mean. The timeframe is very short—only 13 days until the outcome is known on June 1, 2025. The key piece of information is that a major player, Aaron Judge, is reportedly at or near a .400 average as of today, May 19. This means we are not starting from zero; there is an active candidate.\n\nHistorically, several players have been at or above .400 on June 1st (e.g., Chipper Jones in 2008, Luis Arraez in 2023), so there is precedent for a 'Yes' outcome. The question's condition of 'any major league baseball player' also increases the probability compared to a question about a specific player. \n\nHowever, the status quo in baseball statistics is regression. Maintaining a .400 average is exceptionally difficult, as even a single hitless game can significantly lower the figure. It is statistically more likely than not that any player currently at .400 will see their average dip over the next two weeks of games. This is the primary reason the forecast is below 50%.\n\nMy forecast is not lower than 40% because a player has already reached the threshold with very little time remaining. This is no longer a low-probability event; it is an active, ongoing possibility. If no player were currently near .400, my forecast would be substantially lower, likely in the 10-15% range based on historical base rates.\n\nMy forecast is not higher than 40% because the statistical pull towards a player's career-average performance is relentless. To stay at .400, a player essentially needs to continue their hot streak, likely hitting over .400 for the next 13 days, which is a difficult feat. I would increase my forecast if, for example, the leading candidate's average increased over the next week or if a second player also crossed the .400 threshold. Conversely, I would lower it if the leading candidate had a few poor games and dropped significantly below the mark.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill any major league baseball player have a .400 batting average on June 1, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\ntheScore: [How long can Judge's .400 batting average last?](https://www.thescore.com/mlb/news/3284701/how-long-can-judges-400-batting-average-last)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if on June 1, 2025, any Major League Baseball player in the 2025 regular season has a batting average of greater than or equal to .400 according to the [ESPN baseball stats page](https://www.espn.com/mlb/stats)\n\n\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nNo additional information available.\n\nToday is 2025-05-19.\n\nBefore answering you think:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n(e) You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
