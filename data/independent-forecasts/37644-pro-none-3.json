    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Approximately 1.5 months.",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No. Anthropic will not announce that it is planning an IPO before July 1, 2025, and will remain a private company for the time being.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Anthropic's leadership and major investors, such as Google and Amazon, decide that the company's capital needs are sufficiently met by private funding rounds. They choose to avoid the regulatory burdens, public scrutiny, and quarterly pressures of being a public company to focus on long-term AI safety research and model development. The July 1, 2025 deadline passes without any IPO announcement.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "In a bid to capitalize on the fervent market interest in AI and to raise a massive new round of capital for compute and expansion, Anthropic's board fast-tracks its IPO process. Having secretly prepared for months, the company makes a surprise announcement before the deadline, either by filing a Form S-1 with the SEC or by publishing a statement in the news section of its website.",
    "rationale": "My forecast is heavily weighted towards the status quo. The primary factor influencing my low probability estimate is the extremely short timeframe. The question deadline is less than two months away, while a typical IPO preparation process, from selecting underwriters to filing the S-1, takes a minimum of six months, and often longer. There have been no public signals, such as appointing IPO-focused bankers or executives, that would suggest an announcement is imminent. While Anthropic's capital needs are immense, it has successfully raised billions from strategic private investors like Amazon and Google, reducing the immediate urgency for a public offering. The status quo of being a well-funded private company is stable and allows management to focus on its long-term mission without the quarterly pressures of public markets. \n\nMy probability is not lower than 5% because the AI industry is exceptionally dynamic and operates on accelerated timelines. A surprise move to capitalize on the current market enthusiasm for AI stocks, or to pre-empt a competitor, cannot be entirely ruled out. The high valuation floated in previous funding talks indicates that an IPO is certainly a long-term goal.\n\nMy probability is not higher than 5% due to the aforementioned logistical and temporal constraints. The lack of any preparatory signals makes an announcement in the next ~45 days highly improbable. \n\nI would increase my forecast if credible news emerges that Anthropic has confidentially filed an S-1 or has formally engaged investment banks to lead an offering. I would decrease my forecast further if Anthropic executives make public statements emphasizing the benefits of remaining private for the foreseeable future.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nBefore July 1, 2025, will Anthropic announce that it is planning an IPO?\n\nQuestion background:\nIn its most recent funding talks, Anthropic [floated](https://www.theinformation.com/articles/openai-rival-anthropic-has-floated-40-billion-valuation-in-early-talks-about-new-funding) a valuation of $40 billion. Although there has been speculation that the company could IPO, nothing concrete has been announced yet.\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question will resolve as **Yes** if Anthropic, Inc., announces before July 1, 2025, that it is planning an initial public offering. In order to streamline the resolution of this question, there are two resolution sources for the IPO announcement: 1) The company filing an [SEC Form S-1](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/sec-form-s-1.asp) or 2) An announcement at the [News](https://www.anthropic.com/news) section of its website. If there is no such announcement before that date, this question resolves as **No**.\n\n\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nNo additional information available.\n\nToday is 2025-05-15.\n\nBefore answering you think:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n(e) You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
