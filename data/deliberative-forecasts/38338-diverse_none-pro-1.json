    "review": "The other two forecasters presented compelling arguments that I had not sufficiently weighted. Forecaster 2 correctly emphasized the power of the status quo; three weeks have already passed since the Politico article with no announcement, and this inaction is a meaningful negative signal. Forecaster 3's analysis was particularly persuasive by introducing two critical pieces of context: 1) John Morgan's personal history of publicly exploring high-profile runs and ultimately declining, which significantly discounts the signal of the Politico article, and 2) the lack of any compelling strategic reason for him to announce by the specific, arbitrary deadline of July 1, 2025. This argument about the absence of a forcing function is a major flaw in my initial reasoning.",
    "rationale": "I am significantly decreasing my forecast. My initial 65% was an overreaction to a single, strong piece of evidence—the Politico article—without considering the broader context that my peers provided. The arguments from the other forecasters have convinced me that my initial assessment was flawed.\n\nThe most important new considerations are John Morgan's past behavior of publicly mulling candidacies before backing out, and the lack of a strategic imperative to announce before July 1. For a 2026 race, an announcement in late summer or fall of 2025 is perfectly viable and may even be strategically preferable. The Politico piece is better interpreted as a serious trial balloon to gauge support, rather than as an immediate precursor to a launch. While such a launch within the next 25 days is certainly possible, the combination of his history and the non-binding nature of the deadline makes it less likely than not. The status quo of 'not announced' is the stronger position. Therefore, I have revised my forecast downward from 65% to align with the more cautious and context-rich analyses of my peers.",
