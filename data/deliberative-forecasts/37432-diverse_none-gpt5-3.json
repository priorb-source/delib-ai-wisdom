    "review": "Both analyses center the right tradeoff: strong partisan alignment versus a very tight calendar. Forecaster 2 adds a useful reminder about recent Ohio willingness to pass contentious election policy (photo ID) and the GOP’s ability to fast‑track, though the point about veto overrides is less relevant here because the resolution defines enactment as bicameral passage of identical language (governor’s action immaterial). Forecaster 3’s base‑rate and process cautions are solid, but they underweight the budget‑rider path that often enables late‑June policy additions in Ohio. Neither analysis introduces concrete signs of movement (hearings, calendars, leadership statements), so the main update is a modest appreciation for the fast‑track potential through either a standalone sprint or the budget conference report.",
    "rationale": "Time left: ~8 weeks. Status quo favors No. A No outcome occurs if SB 153 or similar language doesn’t clear committees quickly, House–Senate frictions slow coordination, or leadership keeps the budget relatively clean of non‑fiscal riders. A Yes outcome plausibly occurs if Senate leadership fast‑tracks SB 153 in May, the House concurs in June, or if identical language is folded into the biennial budget’s conference report and both chambers pass it before June 30.\n\nKey considerations unchanged: GOP control and recent history make passage feasible; litigation risk is immaterial to resolution but can affect prioritization; the calendar is the main headwind. The budget is a double‑edged factor—floor time is scarce, but it also provides a realistic vehicle for adding election‑policy language late. Because enactment here requires only bicameral passage, the bar is lower than typical, further sustaining a non‑trivial chance.\n\nUpdate: I slightly raise my estimate to reflect Forecaster 2’s emphasis on leadership tools and Ohio’s demonstrated capacity to move election laws quickly when prioritized, plus the budget‑vehicle path. However, absent concrete movement signals (hearings scheduled, leadership publicly prioritizing, inclusion in budget drafts), the short window still dominates.\n\nI would move up meaningfully on: committee action in May; announced floor dates; leadership signaling budget inclusion; Senate passage. I would move down if there’s no committee movement by early June or leadership indicates a ‘cleaner’ budget approach.",
