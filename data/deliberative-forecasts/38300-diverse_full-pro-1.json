    "review": "The deliberation reveals a strong consensus among all three forecasters. We all identify the same core tension: the powerful positive momentum and high year-over-year (YoY) starting point from April (+1.49%) versus a collection of concerning leading indicators (falling LEI, declining core PPI) and underlying sectoral weakness. Forecaster 2's analysis closely mirrored my own, reinforcing the initial assessment. Forecaster 3's analysis provided a crucial quantitative layer by estimating the month-over-month (m/m) decline needed to turn the YoY figure negative (~0.5% to ~0.9%) and astutely noting that such a swing, while not the base case, is \"not rare\" for this volatile series. This was the most compelling new argument, as it grounds the downside risk in historical precedent.",
    "rationale": "I am slightly increasing my forecast from 80% to 82%. While my initial analysis captured the main points, Forecaster 3's reasoning persuaded me to place slightly more weight on the near-term positive evidence for May. Forecaster 3's point that a -0.5% to -1.0% m/m swing is \"not rare\" was an excellent argument for caution. However, their ultimate conclusion of 82% rightly implies that the combination of positive near-term indicators—such as the expansionary PMIs, the rebound in auto assemblies, and stable real-time proxies like electricity output—makes such a large negative swing less likely in this specific month than its historical frequency might suggest. I initially weighted the medium-term negative signals from the LEI and PPI quite heavily. After deliberation, I believe the more contemporaneous evidence pointing to stability in May warrants a small upward adjustment, acknowledging that the high YoY buffer is unlikely to be fully eroded without a more significant, observable shock.",
