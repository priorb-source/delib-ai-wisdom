    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Approximately 35 days remain in the resolution window (from May 26, 2025 to June 30, 2025)",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No - tariffs continue appearing on at least one newspaper's front page every day",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Tariffs remain such a dominant and ongoing political-economic story that on every single day through June 30, at least one of the two newspapers features the word 'tariff' or 'tariffs' on their front page. Given Trump's documented focus on tariffs and their significant economic implications, the story maintains daily front-page prominence at either NYT or WSJ (or both).",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "On at least one day before July 1, other major news stories dominate both newspapers' front pages simultaneously. This could occur due to a major international crisis, natural disaster, significant domestic political development, or simply a convergence where both papers prioritize different aspects of news coverage that day, using alternative language for trade policy discussions or focusing on non-tariff economic stories.",
    "rationale": "The question indicates that criteria have not yet been satisfied as of May 26, meaning tariffs have appeared on at least one front page every day for the past 6-7 days since the window opened on May 19. This establishes a pattern of consistent coverage, suggesting tariffs are indeed a major sustained story as the background describes.\n\nHowever, I have approximately 35 remaining days in the resolution window, and the question only requires ONE day where both papers omit the word 'tariff/tariffs' for a Yes resolution. This is significant - we don't need the story to fade away, just one day of alternative coverage priorities.\n\nKey considerations favoring Yes: (1) 35 days provides multiple opportunities for displacement by breaking news; (2) even major ongoing stories don't literally appear in every edition; (3) papers may use alternative terminology like 'trade war,' 'duties,' or 'trade policy'; (4) major unexpected events are likely over 5+ weeks; (5) weekend editions sometimes prioritize different content.\n\nKey considerations favoring No: (1) 100% coverage rate in the first week suggests exceptional prominence; (2) Trump's active tariff policy is described as currently dominant in media; (3) both papers heavily cover economic/business news relevant to their audiences; (4) the story has sustained political and economic implications affecting daily news cycles.\n\nMy forecast would be higher if: we had a longer window (90+ days would make Yes very likely), or if we'd already seen tariff-free days early in the window. My forecast would be lower if: the window were shorter (say 2 weeks), or if either paper needed to omit it (not both simultaneously), or if we entered a period of major tariff policy announcements.\n\nBalancing the demonstrated consistency of coverage against the reasonable 35-day window for at least one day of displacement, I estimate a slightly below even-odds probability.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill the word \"tariff\" disappear from the front pages of The New York Times and Wall Street Journal before July 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nWhether reading the newspaper or social media or watching the news, it is highly likely you are going to see something about tariffs - mainly due to US President Donald Trump's [renewed love](https://www.france24.com/en/live-news/20250401-tariff-man-trump-s-long-history-with-trade-wars) for this somewhat antiquated form of taxation.\r\n\r\nThe New York Times and the Wall Street Journal are two of the largest print newspapers in the US. Before July, will we see tariffs wiped from the front pages of both papers?\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question will resolve as **Yes** if, on any single day after May 19, 2025 and before July 1, 2025, the words \"tariff\" or \"tariffs\" appear on neither the digital version of the front page of The New York Times nor the Wall Street Journal. The following URLs will be used to resolve the question:\r\n\r\n* The New York Times: [https://www.nytimes.com/section/todayspaper](https://www.nytimes.com/section/todayspaper)\r\n* Wall Street Journal: [https://www.wsj.com/print-edition/20250515/frontpage](https://www.wsj.com/print-edition/20250515/frontpage)\r\n\r\n***\r\n\r\n<sup>Note: WSJ front page URL for May 15, 2025. Format is: yyyy-mm-dd.</sup>\n\n* Grammar or spelling will not prevent a **No** resolution.\r\n* \"Tariff(s)\" must be omitted from both papers' front pages on the same day.\r\n* \"Tariff(s)\" can appear anywhere on the page, including \"Pages A2-A3 and Corrections\", \"What's News: Business & Finance\" not just the initial section at the top. The only sections that do not qualify are those that do not change between different front pages such as the \"Most Popular News\" or \"Recommended Videos\" sections on WSJ.\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nNo additional information available.\n\nToday is 2025-05-26.\n\nBefore answering you think:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n(e) You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
