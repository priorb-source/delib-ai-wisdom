    "review": "Forecaster 2 adds useful pre-election indicators (Carney ~48% approval in late March, preferred PM edge, 77% negative Canadian views of Trump) that support a strong starting point for a honeymoon. However, they still treat the election outcome as uncertain; given the prompt’s framing and Forecaster 3’s assertion that Carney won on Apr 28, that concern seems largely moot for this question. Forecaster 3 contributes plausible detail about early goodwill-maximizing moves (tax cut, smaller cabinet, budget delayed) and emphasizes the short horizon and Trump’s historically inelastic approval—both points I find convincing. Where I diverge from Forecaster 3’s 85% is on resolution/tie risk (Morning Consult displays whole numbers; a tie resolves No) and the possibility that Trump’s early second-term approval hovers a bit higher than his first-term band. I also see some downside risk for Carney from trade/tariff tensions or a first-month stumble. Overall, their arguments push me modestly upward from my prior, but not to the mid-80s.",
    "rationale": "Time remaining is short (~6 weeks), favoring persistence of current dynamics. The base case remains a honeymooned Canadian PM versus a polarized U.S. president. New information from the other forecasters is consistent with Carney having secured office and taken steps that typically preserve early goodwill into early summer, while Trump’s approval is likely in the low-to-mid 40s absent a unifying shock. The Canadian public’s negative views of Trump also make Carney’s stance on tariffs/sovereignty domestically resonant, at least in the near term.\n\nKey risks that cap the forecast: (1) tie/rounding risk on Morning Consult’s whole-number display; (2) upside tail for Trump if economic or security news breaks favorably; (3) modest downside for Carney if trade frictions or an early misstep dents the honeymoon; (4) smaller-sample volatility for Canada. These keep me below ~80. Relative to my prior 70%, I’m nudging up to 74% on the weight of evidence that Carney did win and is pursuing an early-term strategy likely to sustain approval into July, while Trump’s approval is unlikely to surge enough to overtake him.",
