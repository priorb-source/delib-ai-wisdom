  "information": "Several large-scale protests have occurred in South Korea in the first half of 2025. On January 4, an estimated 35,000 people protested. On February 2, reports on participant numbers in an anti-Yoon protest ranged from 38,000 to 100,000. On February 15, a rally in Seoul demanding impeachment reportedly involved 300,000 people. On March 29, a protest demanding the president's resignation was estimated at 12,000 participants. On May 1, a Labor Day rally in Seoul organized by the Korean Confederation of Trade Unions (KCTU) had over 8,000 participants, with police estimating attendance as high as 13,000.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "2 months",
    "status_quo_outcome": "Yes. The current political climate in South Korea has led to a consistent pattern of large-scale monthly protests in 2025, and this trend is likely to continue.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Political tensions unexpectedly de-escalate following government concessions or successful opposition negotiations. Alternatively, protest fatigue sets in, and organizers fail to mobilize over 10,000 participants for any single event before the deadline.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Continuing the trend from the first four months of 2025, civic groups or labor unions organize another major rally in Seoul in response to the ongoing political situation, drawing a crowd well over 10,000, which is then recorded by the Global Protest Tracker.",
    "rationale": "My forecast is based on the strong precedent set in early 2025. The research shows a high frequency of large-scale protests, with at least four separate events clearly exceeding the 10,000-participant threshold between January and April 2025. The protest on May 1, the first day of the forecast period, also likely qualifies with police estimates up to 13,000 attendees. This pattern is driven by a deep and ongoing political crisis stemming from the late 2024 martial law declaration, an issue unlikely to be resolved within the short two-month forecast window. The status quo is one of sustained public mobilization. My probability is not higher than 90% to account for the small possibility of a sudden political resolution, protest fatigue, or a reporting lag/omission by the Global Protest Tracker itself. It is not lower because ignoring the established monthly frequency of qualifying protests would be to underweight a very strong and recent trend. I would raise my forecast upon news of a new government scandal or a confirmed date for a mass rally. I would lower it if there were credible reports of successful government-opposition negotiations or key protest organizers calling for a halt to demonstrations.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill the Global Protest Tracker report any protests in South Korea with 10,000+ participants, before July 1, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nACLED December 2024: [South Korea: Anti-government protests surge following martial law declaration](https://acleddata.com/2025/01/15/asia-pacific-overview-january-2025/#keytrends6)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if the [Global Protest Tracker](https://carnegieendowment.org/features/global-protest-tracker?lang=en) reports a protest in South Korea with 10,000 or more participants with a start date after the launch of this question and before July 1, 2025.\n\n\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nSeveral large-scale protests have occurred in South Korea in the first half of 2025.

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
