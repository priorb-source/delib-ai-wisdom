    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Approximately 41 days. The question concerns events in June 2025 (starting in 10 days) and will resolve on or after July 1, 2025.",
    "status_quo_outcome": "Yes - pilot UFO reports from South America to NUFORC do occur with some regularity",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "No pilot from any South American country witnesses and reports a UFO to NUFORC during June 2025, either because no notable sightings occur that month, pilots choose not to report their observations, or reports are directed to local aviation authorities rather than NUFORC.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "A commercial or private pilot operating in Brazil, Argentina, Chile, Colombia, or another South American country observes an unexplained aerial phenomenon during June 2025 and submits a report to NUFORC, which posts it on their website by the time Metaculus checks on or after July 1, 2025.",
    "rationale": "The question background provides crucial evidence: a pilot report from Brazil was logged in December 2024, establishing that South American pilot reports do reach NUFORC. This precedent is important for establishing a base rate. South America encompasses 12-13 countries with significant aviation activity, including major aviation hubs in Brazil, Argentina, Chile, and Colombia. The one-month window (June 2025) is specific but not unreasonably narrow. However, several factors constrain the probability: (1) The report must come specifically from a pilot, not the general public, which limits the pool of potential reporters, (2) It must be submitted to NUFORC specifically rather than local aviation authorities or other UFO reporting databases, (3) The timing must fall precisely within June 2025, and (4) Pilots may be professionally reluctant to report UFO sightings due to reputational concerns. Without data on the typical frequency of South American pilot reports to NUFORC, I'm estimating based on the existence of at least one recent precedent. If such reports occur roughly every 2-4 months from this region, the probability of one falling in June is moderate. My forecast is not higher because the conjunction of specific requirements (pilot + South America + June specifically + NUFORC specifically) significantly narrows the probability space. It's not lower because we have documented precedent, a large geographic area, and active aviation sectors. I would update higher if I learned that pilot reports from South America to NUFORC occur monthly or more frequently. I would update lower if such reports are actually quite rare (annually or less).",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill a pilot report of UFOs come from a country in South America in June 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nFor example, the resolution source [reports](https://nuforc.org/subndx/?id=x) a sighting in Brazil in December 2024.\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if The National UFO Reporting Center posts a pilot report of a UFO/UAP having occurred in a country on the South American continent, during the month of June 2025 at [this link](https://nuforc.org/subndx/?id=x) when accessed by Metaculus on or after July 1, 2025.\n\n\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nNo additional information available.\n\nToday is 2025-05-21.\n\nBefore answering you think:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n(e) You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
