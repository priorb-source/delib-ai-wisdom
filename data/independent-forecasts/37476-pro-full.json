  "information": "GoPro's financial results for 2024 showed a full-year revenue of $801 million, a 20% decline year-over-year, with a net loss of $432 million, or $2.82 per share. As of December 31, 2024, the company held $283 million in cash reserves against $131 million in debt. The company's current ratio was reported at 0.5, and its market capitalization was approximately $90.68 million as of May 1, 2025, with a stock price of $0.58.\n\nFor its upcoming first quarter 2025 earnings report, scheduled for May 12, 2025, analysts expect GoPro to report a quarterly loss of approximately $0.13 per share on revenues of around $124.9 million, which would represent a year-over-year revenue decline of about 19.6%. The company itself has stated it expects unit sales and revenue in 2025 to be lower than in 2024, citing macroeconomic headwinds and competition. In response, the company has initiated plans to reduce operating expenses by nearly 30% during 2025.\n\nIn early 2025, GoPro announced it was named the official camera of the 2025 Freeride World Tour for the 12th consecutive year. The company also released a minor upgrade to its GoPro Max panoramic camera in February 2025. Reports in May 2025 also noted the release of a new GoPro Hero13 camera featuring an anamorphic lens. The company's most significant debt maturity is a convertible note due in November 2025.",

    "status_quo_outcome": "No",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "GoPro uses its significant cash reserves to fund its operations and R&D through the short forecast period. The upcoming Q1 2025 earnings report, while likely poor, does not reveal a liquidity crisis so severe as to force an immediate bankruptcy filing. The company continues to operate, manage its expenses, and prepares to address its November 2025 debt maturity, all without filing for bankruptcy before July 1, 2025.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "The Q1 2025 earnings report on May 12 reveals a catastrophic and unexpected acceleration in cash burn, depleting reserves far faster than anticipated. This triggers a crisis of confidence among creditors and suppliers, who may demand immediate payment or cut off credit, forcing GoPro's management to seek Chapter 11 protection to stabilize the business and halt creditor actions before the July 1 deadline.",
    "rationale": "My forecast is based on the mismatch between GoPro's immediate liquidity and the question's very short timeframe. While GoPro is in significant financial distress—evidenced by a 20% revenue decline in 2024, a $432 million net loss, and a concerning current ratio of 0.5—it still possessed a substantial cash reserve of $283 million as of December 31, 2024. This cash position appears sufficient to cover operational losses for the less than two months remaining until the July 1, 2025 deadline, making an imminent bankruptcy filing unlikely. The status quo is for the company to continue burning cash but survive this brief period. The most significant known financial threat, a convertible note maturity, is not until November 2025, which falls outside the resolution window. My probability is not lower than 8% because the company's financial health is precarious. The low current ratio suggests that even with a large cash balance, short-term liabilities exceed short-term assets, creating a potential liquidity trap. A surprisingly negative earnings report on May 12 could accelerate a crisis. My probability is not higher because companies with over a quarter-billion dollars in cash rarely file for bankruptcy without a clear, immediate catalyst like a major debt payment, which is absent here. I would increase my forecast if the upcoming earnings report shows cash reserves have cratered below $150 million or if news emerges of a major creditor demanding immediate repayment. I would decrease it if the report shows the company's cost-cutting measures have successfully stanched the cash burn.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill GoPro file for bankruptcy before July 1, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\n[GoPro Announces Fourth Quarter and 2024 Results](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1500435/000150043525000003/gpro2024-12x31exh991xer.htm)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question will resolve as **Yes** if GoPro, Inc., files any petition for bankruptcy protection in the United States, under any chapter of the United States Bankruptcy Code, before July 1, 2025. The question will resolves on the filing of such a petition, not on whether any bankruptcy protection is granted by a court. If no such petition is filed by that date, this question will resolve as **No**.\n\n\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nGoPro's financial results for 2024 showed a full-year revenue of $801 million, a 20% decline year-over-year, with a net loss of $432 million, or $2.82 per share.

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
