    "review": "Both forecasters converge on the same core points I used: the exact-phrase constraint, a very short window, and NYT style norms that favor either “reverse consumption” for the Chinese trend or “reverse repurchase” in finance—neither of which would match the required search terms. They add one useful explicit check: that NYT appears to have no historical use of these exact strings, reinforcing the low base rate. They also note a small tail via quotation of Chinese terminology for authenticity, which I had considered. Neither offers evidence of adoption by other major English-language outlets (Bloomberg, Economist), which would be the strongest catalyst. One nuance I’d emphasize that wasn’t highlighted: the search will not capture the very common “reverse repurchase” phrasing, so even Fed/markets coverage in this window is unlikely to register a match.\n",
    "rationale": "The decisive factors remain: (1) the requirement for the exact strings “reverse purchasing” or “reverse purchase” in NYT content, (2) NYT’s strong tendency to use “reverse repurchase” (repo) in finance and “reverse consumption” (or a paraphrase) for China trends, and (3) the tight 21-day window. The April 30 People’s Daily piece is not a strong catalyst for mid/late-June NYT usage, and there’s no sign of the term gaining traction in Western media. The only plausible Yes path is a piece explicitly translating or quoting Chinese state-media jargon; that’s possible but rare. Forecasters 2 and 3 slightly higher at 5–7% reflect that tail, but without new evidence I still see the base rate as closer to my prior. I’m keeping my forecast essentially unchanged.\n",
