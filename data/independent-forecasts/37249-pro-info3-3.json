  "information": "Recent reports indicate a significant shift in the British political landscape. Patrick English, director of political analytics at YouGov, described the emergence of 'five party politics,' observing that both Labour and Conservative support levels are declining while support for Reform UK, the Liberal Democrats, and the Green Party is rising. A poll by More In Common found that 41% of voters lack faith in any of the main party leaders, and an Ipsos poll from March 2025 found that 36% of British adults were considering voting for Reform UK. Public sentiment is reportedly characterized by disillusionment with the traditional parties, with key voter issues including immigration, local infrastructure like potholes, and economic concerns. Polling data shows only 60% of those who voted for Labour in the July 2024 election would do so again.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "2 months",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Reform UK's support continues to grow, potentially overtaking the Conservatives to become the second most popular party in the polls. However, their rise stalls before they can establish a clear lead over the Labour Party. The Labour government weathers its early unpopularity, and its polling numbers stabilize. The fragmentation of the political landscape into five main parties means that no single party can build a commanding lead. By July 1, 2025, the Politico Poll of Polls shows a tight race, but with Reform UK not achieving a 4-point lead.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "A significant political or economic crisis engulfs the new Labour government between May and June 2025, causing a catastrophic collapse in its public support. This could be a major scandal involving senior ministers or a severe, mishandled economic event. The Conservative Party fails to capitalize on this, remaining deeply unpopular. Nigel Farage's Reform UK successfully positions itself as the only credible anti-establishment voice, rapidly absorbing disillusioned voters from both Labour and the Conservatives. This surge is reflected across multiple polls, pushing the Politico poll of polls to show Reform UK with a lead of 4 points or more over all other parties before the deadline.",
    "rationale": "My forecast is based on the high bar for the 'Yes' outcome and the historical stability of UK party politics, even in volatile times. The status quo is that the Labour party, having won the 2024 election, remains the highest polling party. For Reform UK to not only become the highest polling party but to do so with a 4-point lead in a poll-of-polls aggregator within two months would require an unprecedented political realignment. The research assistant's report indicates significant voter disillusionment and a rise in Reform's potential support (36% considering them), which creates the conditions for a potential surge. However, the move to 'five party politics' could also fragment the opposition vote, making it harder for any one party to achieve a dominant lead. The 4-point margin in an *average* of polls is a particularly difficult threshold to meet, as it requires a consistent and significant lead across multiple polling houses, not just a single outlier result. My probability is not lower because the political environment is clearly unstable, Labour's voter coalition is soft (only 60% loyalty), and Nigel Farage is a uniquely effective populist campaigner. A major government crisis could plausibly trigger a rapid shift. It is not higher because such a dramatic collapse of a new government and a simultaneous surge of a third party to a commanding lead is historically rare. I would increase my forecast if a major scandal broke for the Labour government or if polls in early May show Reform has already decisively leapfrogged the Conservatives. I would decrease it if the government's ratings stabilize or improve.",

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower.
