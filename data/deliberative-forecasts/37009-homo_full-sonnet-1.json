    "review": "Both forecasters arrived at 72%, forming a strong consensus 12 percentage points above my initial 60%. They raised several compelling points I should weigh more heavily: (1) The competitive pressure from McMorrow and El-Sayed already being in the race creates urgency for Stevens to announce soon or risk being late to a crowded field. (2) They characterize the Politico reporting as 'specific and credible' - this is fair given it's from a major outlet with precise timing ('as early as next week'). (3) They emphasize that FEC paperwork, while not filed, isn't required before an announcement. However, I notice we're now on April 21, meaning we're already within the 'next week' window that Politico referenced on April 19. Day 1 of that window passing without announcement isn't dispositive, but it's a data point. The forecasters and I agree on the core evidence and uncertainty factors - our difference is mainly in how much weight to assign to the Politico reporting versus base rates of political announcement delays.",
    "rationale": "Reconsidering my forecast in light of the consensus: The other forecasters make valid points about competitive pressure and the credibility of recent, specific Politico reporting. The preparation indicators (fundraising, staff expansion, House seat replacement outreach) are indeed concrete and support imminent action. Their 72% reflects appropriate confidence while acknowledging real uncertainty from ambiguous 'coming weeks' language and lack of FEC filings. However, I maintain some additional skepticism because: (1) we're already in the 'next week' window from the April 19 Politico report, and it's now April 21 with no announcement yet, (2) political announcements frequently slip even when expected, and (3) the absence of FEC paperwork suggests nothing is immediately ready. That said, I was likely overweighting base rate delays and underweighting the specific, credible reporting and preparation signals. The competitive dynamics do create real pressure to announce soon. I'm updating upward from 60% to split the difference with the consensus, landing at 68%. This reflects increased confidence from the specific Politico reporting and preparation signals, while maintaining slightly more caution than the consensus based on the timeline already beginning to slip and lack of formal filing activity.",
