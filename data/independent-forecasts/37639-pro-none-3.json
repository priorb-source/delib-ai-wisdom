    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Approximately 1.5 months, until July 1, 2025.",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No. Mahmoud Khalil remains in the United States, likely in detention, while his legal challenges proceed.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Mr. Khalil's legal challenge to his detention, or subsequent appeals, continue past the July 1, 2025 deadline. The judicial and administrative processes required to finalize and execute a deportation order take longer than the available time.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "The courts swiftly and definitively rule against Mr. Khalil's challenge, any final appeals are immediately denied, and ICE prioritizes and executes his physical removal from the United States before July 1, 2025.",
    "rationale": "My forecast is based primarily on the extremely short timeframe of approximately 1.5 months. The status quo is that Mahmoud Khalil is in the US, actively challenging his detention in court. Such legal processes, especially in federal courts, are notoriously slow and deliberative. It is highly improbable that his case would be finally adjudicated, all potential appeals exhausted, and the logistical arrangements for deportation completed before July 1, 2025. The research assistant found no additional information, which signals a lack of news regarding any expedited process. Legal and bureaucratic systems have significant inertia, making the status quo the most likely outcome.\n\nMy probability is not lower because a swift and final court ruling, while unlikely, is not impossible. A court could refuse to hear his case or issue a summary judgment, and the government could act with unusual speed.\n\nMy probability is not higher because a 'Yes' outcome requires a rapid sequence of events—a final judicial loss for Khalil and an unusually fast execution of removal by ICE—which runs counter to the typical pacing of such cases.\n\nI would increase my forecast if news emerged of a final court ruling against Khalil or an official statement indicating an expedited removal. I would decrease my forecast if a court scheduled hearings for after July 1, 2025, or granted a stay of removal.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill Mahmoud Khalil be deported before July 1, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\n[Mahmoud Khalil's challenge to his detention moves forward]()\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if the United States deports Mahmoud Khalil before July 1, 2025. For purposes of this question, \"deported\" means Khalil being transported out of the territory of the United States against his will.\n\n\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nNo additional information available.\n\nToday is 2025-05-14.\n\nBefore answering you think:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n(e) You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
