    "review": "Both forecasters largely align with my prior view: the second-term regime is fundamentally different from the first term, the operational pipeline is active, and the threshold (3+) is very low. Forecaster 2 adds useful emphasis on unpredictability and potential clustering right after a late-May blitz, plus the risk of an unforeseen diversion or personnel change. Forecaster 3 highlights the first-term June drought and a possible summer slowdown, while still weighting the new regime more heavily. The main incremental considerations for me are (1) the plausibility of a short pause after the May spree and (2) the risk that the next batch is timed to a symbolic date (e.g., early July), which could depress June counts. I find their moderation arguments reasonable, but I view the first-term June pattern as weak evidence under the new, higher-volume approach with dedicated staff.",
    "rationale": "I continue to see the base case as Yes: the administration has demonstrated high throughput, explicit intent to continue, and only needs to clear a very low bar in June (3+). Public disclosure is standard for clemencies, and case-by-case actions or a small themed batch would suffice. That said, the immediate post-spree lull and potential timing toward early July introduce real month-end risk that could yield 0–2 in June despite a loaded pipeline. Net effect: I trim my probability slightly to reflect batching/timing risk, without changing the core view that Yes remains more likely than not. I would move up if early-June reporting or signals of another list emerge; down if credible reporting suggests a pause or July 4 timing, or if we reach mid-June with no actions.",
