    "review": "Forecaster 2’s base-rate framing is useful, but their 18% leans on an implicit U.S.-venue assumption that’s contradicted by the Montreal signals; given an international site, especially Canada, their number looks too high. Forecaster 3 adds concrete details (Bell Centre, May 10) and highlights the lack of precedent, logistics/optics, and the short planning runway. That aligns with the research assistant’s Montreal cue via Rogan and is more persuasive in this context. The emphasis on the absence of credible travel signaling with ~12 days to go is a strong downward factor.",
    "rationale": "Key updates: Multiple signals point to UFC 315 being in Montreal on May 10 (Rogan’s comment plus Forecaster 3’s specifics). If Trump is the sitting president, a discretionary foreign trip for a sports cameo involves heavy security/diplomatic coordination and poor optics, making it atypical. Even if he’s not president, Canadian entry/logistics and the rarity of Trump attending non-U.S. UFC cards keep the odds low. The short time horizon (≈12 days) with no credible reporting of a Montreal trip further depresses the likelihood. While his relationship with Dana White and recent attendance at a Miami event show ongoing interest in UFC, those are mainly relevant to domestic cards. I previously had 6%; incorporating the now-credible Montreal venue/date and the short runway without signals, I lower to 4%. I’d move up only on credible reports of a planned Canada trip (especially Montreal) or direct teases from Trump/Dana White; I’d move down further on announced conflicting engagements or confirmation he’ll be stateside that weekend.",
