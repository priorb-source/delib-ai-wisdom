    "review": "Both forecasters make compelling arguments that I underweighted the strength of bureaucratic inertia over such a short timeframe. Forecaster 2 correctly emphasizes that the DV program is established by statute (Immigration Act of 1990), not just regulation, which provides stronger legal protection than I initially considered. Forecaster 3 raises an important technical point I hadn't fully explored: the question's strict wording about the page being 'at this location' means even a website reorganization that changes the URL slug could resolve as No, even with redirects. However, both forecasters convincingly argue this is unlikely within 6 weeks. Forecaster 3's observation that the page is 'evergreen' and remains available year-round strengthens the case for continuity. The fact that we're already in late May 2025 with no announced changes is significant - if major policy or technical changes were planned, we'd likely have indicators by now. Their reasoning about the path of least resistance being maintaining the status quo is persuasive.",
    "rationale": "After reviewing the other analyses, I'm updating upward from 85% to 91%. The key factors driving this update are: (1) The statutory basis of the program provides stronger protection than I initially weighted - it would require congressional action to eliminate, not just executive action; (2) The 6-week timeframe is extremely short for any significant change, and we're already in late May with no signals of imminent changes; (3) The 'evergreen' nature of the instructions page means it's maintained year-round, increasing stability; (4) Even if there were political will to suspend the program, the administrative and legal processes would likely extend beyond July 1. I'm not going as high as 96% because the URL specificity concern is real - a website reorganization could technically resolve this as No if the exact URL changes, and while unlikely in 6 weeks, it's not impossible. I'm also maintaining some buffer for unforeseen technical issues or rapid political developments, though these are low probability given the timeframe.",
