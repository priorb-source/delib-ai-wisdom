    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "About 57 days (until July 1, 2025)",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No enactment before July 1, 2025",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "The Tax Reforms Bill (or any standalone VAT amendment) remains in committee or passes only one chamber; the National Assembly takes a Sallah recess in June and prioritizes other agenda items; concerns about revenue loss lead to deferral of VAT changes to a broader end‑year finance bill; or the government issues guidance/circulars but no Act is signed into law before July 1.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "The Presidency designates the measure as urgent; both chambers fast‑track the VAT exemption for real estate—either within the broader Tax Reforms Bill or as a short standalone amendment—completing second/third readings in May, harmonizing in early June, transmitting to the President, and securing assent by mid‑to‑late June, with credible media/government confirmation.",
    "rationale": "- Timeline: Fewer than two months remain, and Nigerian legislation must clear both chambers and receive presidential assent to count as “enacted.” That is doable but tight, especially given likely Sallah recess days in June and typical committee/ harmonization steps.\n- Status quo bias: Nigeria often enacts tax changes via comprehensive Finance/Tax bills toward year‑end. Mid‑year passage is possible but not the norm, so the status quo favors a No by July 1 absent clear fast‑tracking.\n- Signals for Yes: The linked reporting (late April) indicates the executive is pushing a Tax Reforms Bill that includes exempting real estate transactions from VAT. The administration has previously fast‑tracked priority bills (showing capacity to compress timelines). A narrowly scoped VAT amendment could be even faster if leadership prioritizes it.\n- Headwinds: Revenue pressures may trigger resistance to expanding VAT exemptions. Even with executive support, bicameral passage plus harmonization and assent often take longer than 6–8 weeks unless leadership explicitly accelerates the bill. Any delay into mid‑June materially risks missing the July 1 cutoff.\n- Why not higher: Tight timeline, potential recess, and fiscal pushback make a quick enactment uncertain without clear legislative movement already underway in both chambers.\n- Why not lower: The measure is on the government’s agenda, and Nigeria can pass executive‑priority bills quickly when aligned. A targeted amendment could be moved rapidly if prioritized.\n- What would move me up: Evidence of second readings completed in both chambers by mid‑May; committee reports scheduled this month; one chamber passing third reading by late May; public statements from Senate/House leadership or the Presidency committing to June passage; reports of harmonization completed; or news that the bill has been transmitted to the President.\n- What would move me down: Reports of committee delays, opposition over revenue impacts, indication the item is deferred to a later finance bill, an extended June recess, or lack of progress (e.g., no chamber passes the bill by early June).\n- Research assistant: No additional information beyond the background links; forecast relies on process knowledge and timing constraints.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill Nigeria enact legislation exempting real estate transactions from VAT before July 1, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\n[FG: Tax reform bill to exempt real estate transactions from VAT, boost housing affordability in Nigeria](https://nairametrics.com/2025/04/25/fg-tax-reform-bill-to-exempt-real-estate-transactions-from-vat-boost-housing-affordability-in-nigeria/)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if, before July 1, 2025, the government of Nigeria enacts legislation exempting real estate transactions from the Value Added Tax (VAT) according to [credible sources](https://www.metaculus.com/help/faq/#definitions).\n\nFor example, the current iteration of the Tax Reforms Bill that is [being considered](https://brtnews.ng/tax-reforms-bill-to-exempt-real-estate-transactions-from-vat/) by the National Assembly, if it should be enacted, would count for purposes of this question.\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nNo additional information available.\n\nToday is 2025-05-05.\n\nBefore answering you think:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n(e) You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
