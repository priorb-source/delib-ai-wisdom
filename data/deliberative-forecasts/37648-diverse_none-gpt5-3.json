    "review": "Both forecasters correctly stress the compressed timeline and structural barriers. Forecaster 3’s point that an “announcement” (e.g., a framework or agreement-in-principle) could satisfy resolution is a useful reframing that slightly lowers the bar. However, my prior concern remains: Washington and Tehran often avoid the word “agreement,” opting for “understandings” to sidestep INARA and domestic costs, which may not meet the resolver’s criterion. The Israeli media report is the main pro-Yes signal; weighting it via presumed Israeli intel access is reasonable, but it’s still a single-source claim and could be signaling/pressure rather than a hard readout. I agree with their triggers for updates (public confirmation of talks, IAEA-linked choreography, mediator activity), and with the risk factors that would push the probability down (regional escalation, IAEA censure without an off-ramp).",
    "rationale": "I maintain that the base rate and political/sequencing hurdles dominate, but I give modest extra weight to: (1) the possibility that a limited, explicitly labeled framework could be announced (not fully implemented) and still count; (2) the Israeli report as a nontrivial, if uncorroborated, indicator of behind-the-scenes movement. I still discount the likelihood because: (a) parties’ incentive to avoid calling it an “agreement” to evade INARA; (b) the need for synchronized steps with the IAEA and sanctions relief, which typically leaks or leaves a trail—absent here; (c) high domestic political costs on both sides in a very short window. Net: a slight upward revision from my initial 11% to reflect the lower bar for an “announcement” and the Israeli signal, but still well below the 20–25% range without corroboration. Indicators that would move me up quickly: credible multi-source reports of a draft text or framework; mediator-facilitated meetings (Oman/Qatar) tied to IAEA visits; US notices suggestive of INARA-related consultation; coordinated statements hinting at caps/freezes plus monitoring in exchange for limited waivers. Downward: IAEA censure with no remedial plan, fresh proxy escalations, or categorical denials by principals.",
