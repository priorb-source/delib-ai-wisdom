    "review": "Forecaster 2’s reasoning is solid on Trump’s general UFC attendance pattern, but their 18% looks too high once the confirmed Montreal location is incorporated; by their own conditional logic, an international venue should push this into the very low single digits. Forecaster 3 adds useful Canada-specific frictions (admissibility optics, security, protests) and the conditional on being a sitting president. I agree most of those pressures push down. I’d caution that formal inadmissibility is unlikely to be a binding constraint for a sitting U.S. president if an official visit were planned, but the fact this would need to be an official foreign trip for what is essentially leisure makes it atypical. The Joe Rogan point is weakly probative for Trump specifically. Overall, their analyses reinforce a low base rate and the added Canada/international travel friction within a short lead time, which aligns with my prior low estimate.",
    "rationale": "Key inputs: (1) UFC 315 is in Montreal on May 10. (2) It is ~12 days away with no credible signals of a Canadian trip on or around that date. (3) Trump’s pattern is frequent U.S. UFC attendance; there is no precedent for him attending outside the U.S., and the logistics/optics of a sitting president making a discretionary foreign trip for a sports event are unusually burdensome. (4) He reportedly just attended a Miami UFC in April 2025; two high-profile appearances in different countries within four weeks is atypical. (5) While Canada could accommodate a presidential visit, doing so purely to attend UFC is unlikely without an official program anchoring the trip.\n\nWhy not higher: foreign venue, lack of precedent, short lead time without signals, and presidential travel constraints dominate. Why not lower: Trump’s unpredictability and strong ties to Dana White keep a small tail risk if an official Canadian engagement materializes and the UFC stop is tacked on.\n\nNet: The deliberation largely confirms my prior. I keep the forecast at the low end of single digits.",
