  "information": "The final University of Michigan Consumer Sentiment index for May 2025 was 52.2, an improvement from the preliminary reading of 50.8, but a decline from 57.0 in March and 64.7 in February. The index has fallen nearly 30% since January 2025. Within the May report, the Current Economic Conditions Index decreased to 58.9 points from 59.8 in April, while the Economic Expectations Index increased to 47.9 points from 47.3. In a separate survey, the Conference Board's consumer confidence index rose to 98 in May from a revised 85.7 in the prior month. Other economic indicators showed soft growth signals, with the ISM services index at 49.9 and the manufacturing index at 48.5.\n\nInflation expectations remain a significant concern for consumers. The May University of Michigan survey showed consumer expectations for inflation over the next year increased to 7.3% from 6.5% in April, while long-term inflation expectations rose to 4.6% from 4.4%. Trade policy is also a major factor; according to the survey's director, Joanne Hsu, nearly three-quarters of consumers mentioned tariffs and trade policies as a source of uncertainty. Recent policy actions include the doubling of US steel tariffs. Federal Reserve governor Christopher Waller has outlined a potential path to interest rate cuts later in the year but noted this depends on how trade negotiations unfold and on progress toward the Fed's 2% inflation goal.\n\nAmerican consumers are exhibiting cautious behavior. Personal spending rose by only 0.2% in the last reported month, while the savings rate surged to 4.9% in March, the highest level in almost a year. Consumers are reportedly focusing more on essential goods and services. This caution is reflected in the performance of discount retailers like Dollar General, which recently hiked its sales forecast. Household finances are also under pressure from debt; following the end of the pandemic-era payment pause, student loan delinquencies jumped to 7.74% from 1%.",

    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "About 23 days (final Friday, June 27, 2025)",
    "status_quo_outcome": "Yes — May’s final index was 52.2, already below 54.0; absent a notable rebound, June would likely remain <54.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "A mid-June rebound in sentiment lifts the index to 54.0 or higher, helped by a cooler-than-expected May CPI print, calm tariff/newsflow, equity market strength, stable-to-lower gasoline prices, and solid labor data.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Sentiment remains depressed or softens further on persistent inflation worries, tariff uncertainty, and weak diffusion indices (ISM manufacturing/services), keeping June’s final in the 50–53 range.",
    "rationale": "Time horizon is short, so large structural shifts are unlikely. The latest anchor is May’s University of Michigan final at 52.2, which is 1.8 points below the 54.0 threshold. Month-to-month changes in this series are common, but a move large enough to push the final decisively above 54 is not the base case without supportive macro news. The research assistant’s summary points to: (1) a marked decline since February (64.7 in Feb, 57.0 in Mar, 52.2 in May), (2) lingering inflation concerns, and (3) tariff/trade uncertainty cited by many respondents; plus softer activity signals (ISM services 49.9, manufacturing 48.5). These support a below-54 status quo. Counterpoints that cap my probability: the Conference Board’s confidence index reportedly rebounded in May, and sentiment series can mean-revert after sharp drops; macro surprises (especially a benign May CPI on June 12) could quickly lift expectations and equities, nudging Michigan sentiment to 54+. Given typical monthly volatility of a few points, a cross above 54 is a live risk. Why not higher than my forecast: month-to-month noise and potential rebound dynamics, plus divergence with Conference Board. Why not lower: the threshold is close to the latest reading, and a modest positive macro surprise could push the index above 54. What I would watch to update: June preliminary Michigan reading (mid-June), the May CPI (June 12), gasoline price trends, weekly jobless claims/payroll tone, equity market direction, and any notable tariff/trade developments. A strong CPI downside surprise and risk-on markets would lower my Yes probability; renewed inflation/tariff worries or weak macro prints would raise it.",
