  "information": "By the end of 2024, Ukraine's total state debt had reached approximately 7 trillion UAH, equivalent to about 92% of the country's GDP. The state budget for 2024 operated with a significant deficit, and the Accounting Chamber of Ukraine reported a 29% increase in tax debt during that year. During March 2025, the Ukrainian hryvnia weakened from 41.1 to 41.4 UAH/USD. This 0.7% depreciation increased the UAH valuation of Ukraine's foreign-currency denominated debt by an estimated 9-11 billion UAH.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "About 2–4 weeks (Trading Economics typically posts the March print by late April or May 2025)",
    "status_quo_outcome": "Yes — government debt has been trending upward and March’s mild UAH depreciation mechanically lifts the UAH value of FX debt",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Trading Economics’ series reflects a narrower concept (e.g., only domestic UAH debt) that was still in the high-1.8T range in Feb 2025, and March saw net redemptions/low issuance so it remained under 1.90T",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "The TE series covers total central government debt; ongoing wartime deficits, external disbursements, continued domestic issuance, and a 0.7% UAH depreciation in March push the stock to ≥1.90T UAH",
    "rationale": "Baseline: Ukraine’s debt stock has been rising steadily through 2024–2025 due to large deficits financed by external support and domestic issuance. The research assistant notes total state debt around 7T UAH by end-2024 (well above the 1.90T threshold) and that the hryvnia weakened from 41.1 to 41.4 per USD in March 2025, adding an estimated 9–11B UAH to the UAH valuation of FX debt. This supports an upward March print, not a decline.\n\nKey uncertainty is definitional: Trading Economics sometimes labels the monthly series as “UAH Thousand” and may track a subset (e.g., domestic government debt) rather than total state and state‑guaranteed debt. If the TE series already sat near 1.85–1.89T in late 2024, typical monthly increases (domestic issuance + FX revaluation) of ~10–30B UAH would likely tip March ≥1.90T. Conversely, if the series was materially below 1.85T in Feb 2025 and reflects only domestic debt, a quiet issuance month could leave it below 1.90T.\n\nWhy not higher: I’m discounting for the possibility that TE’s measure is narrower than total debt and was still under 1.90T before March. Why not lower: The wartime trend is firmly up, March’s UAH depreciation gives an extra nudge, and there is no clear catalyst for a sizable month‑over‑month drop.\n\nWhat would move me up: Confirmation that TE’s February 2025 reading was already ≥1.90T, or that TE’s series is total government debt (not just domestic). What would move me down: Evidence that TE’s series excludes FX debt and that February stood well below 1.88T, coupled with reports of net redemptions/minimal issuance in March.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill Ukraine's government debt be at least 1.90 trillion UAH in March 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\n[Ukraine is one step away from stagflation. And here's why](https://en.iz.ru/en/1868046/2025-04-10/ukraine-one-step-away-stagflation-and-heres-why)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if Ukraine's government debt is greater than or equal to 1.90 billion UAH Thousand (in other words, 1.90 trillion Ukrainian hryvnia for the month of March 2025, according to the number presented by [Trading Economics](https://tradingeconomics.com/ukraine/government-debt). Under 1.90 billion UAH Thousand resolves as **No**.\n\n\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nBy the end of 2024, Ukraine's total state debt had reached approximately 7 trillion UAH, equivalent to about 92% of the country's GDP. The state budget for 2024 operated with a significant deficit, and the Accounting Chamber of Ukraine reported a 29% increase in tax debt during that year.

This 0.7% depreciation increased the UAH valuation of Ukraine's foreign-currency denominated debt by an estimated 9-11 billion UAH.\n\nToday is 2025-04-22.\n\nBefore answering you think:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n(e) You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
