    "review": "Forecasters 2 and 3 both converge on 40%, significantly higher than my 18%. They make important points: (1) Forecaster 2 correctly emphasizes the 14-day lag since the executive order as revealing the maintainers' standards - I noted this but perhaps didn't weight it enough; (2) Forecaster 3 raises the crucial definitional question about what 'stopping funding' means when federal funds are only 5% of NPR's budget. However, I believe both forecasters underweight the strength of the Congressional appropriation barrier. The research assistant's report is explicit: CPB has $535 million allocated through September 30, 2027 via Congressional appropriation. This isn't just a policy preference - it's already-appropriated funds that would require Congressional action to rescind. With divided government and some Republican senators (like Murkowski) supporting public media, rescinding appropriations in 46 days seems extremely unlikely. Additionally, the CPB lawsuit asserting it's a private nonprofit not subject to executive control creates a significant legal barrier. If the maintainers were going to mark this complete based on executive action alone, the 14-day lag suggests they would have already done so.",
    "rationale": "I'm updating modestly upward from 18% to 25% for two reasons: (1) Uncertainty about maintainer criteria - while the 14-day lag suggests they need implementation not just announcements, there's some chance they could change their standard or accept partial implementation; (2) The consensus view at 40% suggests I may be missing something about political dynamics or maintainer behavior. However, I'm not moving to 40% because the legal and Congressional barriers remain compelling. The CPB has pre-appropriated funding through 2027 that cannot be unilaterally stopped by executive order. The lawsuit adds another barrier. Actual cessation of federal funding in 46 days would require: (1) winning the lawsuit or getting CPB to concede, (2) Congressional action to rescind appropriations, or (3) finding some administrative mechanism to halt disbursement despite the lawsuit. All of these seem unlikely in the timeframe. The 'in progress' status after 14 days suggests maintainers are indeed waiting for concrete implementation, not just policy announcements.",
