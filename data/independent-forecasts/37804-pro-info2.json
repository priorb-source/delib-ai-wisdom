  "information": "Florida has become the second U.S. state, after Utah, to ban the addition of fluoride to public water supplies. Governor Ron DeSantis signed a law in May 2025 that prohibits additives not meeting a new definition of 'water quality additive,' effectively banning fluoride. The decision was supported by the state's surgeon general, who cited potential health risks. This legislative action reflects a broader debate, with some recent studies raising concerns about potential links between fluoride exposure and neurodevelopmental issues in children, while organizations like the American Dental Association continue to support water fluoridation as a key public health measure.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Roughly six weeks.",
    "status_quo_outcome": "Yes, the current recommendation of 0.7 mg/L would remain in place.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Responding to political pressure from states like Florida and Utah and citing new studies, the HHS review is fast-tracked. The administration directs the CDC to issue an interim guidance lowering the recommended level or to remove the page entirely pending the full review's completion.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "The HHS review of the fluoride guidance proceeds at a typical bureaucratic pace. This process, involving literature reviews, expert panels, and public comment periods, takes many months or even years. As a result, the existing 2015 recommendation of 0.7 mg/L is still the official guidance on the CDC's website on July 1, 2025.",
    "rationale": "My forecast is heavily weighted towards the status quo due to institutional inertia and the very short timeline. The CDC's recommendation of 0.7 mg/L has been a cornerstone of public health policy since 2015. While the political landscape is shifting, as evidenced by the HHS review announced in April and Florida's ban on fluoridation in May, changing such a long-standing federal guideline is a slow and deliberate process. The period between now and the resolution date of July 1, 2025, is less than two months. This is an exceptionally short amount of time for a federal agency to conduct a thorough scientific review, build consensus, and issue new formal recommendations. The HHS review is likely the beginning of a long process, not something that will conclude within weeks. The most probable outcome is that the current guidance remains unchanged while the review is ongoing.\n\nMy forecast is not higher than 95% because there is a non-trivial chance of a politically motivated, rapid change. The actions in Florida and Utah demonstrate a growing political will to challenge fluoridation, and the administration could potentially direct the CDC to issue an interim change or take down the recommendation page to appease critics, bypassing the standard scientific review process.\n\nMy forecast is not lower because the default for government agencies is to maintain existing guidance until a formal replacement is issued. The scientific and public health establishments, like the American Dental Association, continue to strongly endorse fluoridation, creating a powerful counterweight to political pressure.\n\nI would lower my probability if there were official statements indicating an accelerated review timeline or a leaked draft of a new, lower recommendation. Conversely, I would raise my probability if HHS or the CDC released a statement outlining a typical, lengthy timeline for the review process.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill the CDC still recommend 0.7 mg/L fluoride as the optimal level in community water supplies on July 1, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nNPR: [HHS will review guidance on the addition of fluoride to drinking water](https://www.npr.org/2025/04/10/g-s1-59452/hhs-rfk-fluoride-drinking-water-epa)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if the CDC's [Community Water Fluoridation Recommendations](https://www.cdc.gov/fluoridation/about/community-water-fluoridation-recommendations.html) recommends greater than or equal to 0.7 mg/L as the concentration that maximizes fluoride's oral health benefits while minimizing potential harms. If a lesser amount is recommended or if there is no longer any recommendation at all, then the question resolves as **No**.\n\nIf the page is pulled offline with no replacement, this question also resolves as **No**.\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nFlorida has become the second U.S. state, after Utah, to ban the addition of fluoride to public water supplies.

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
