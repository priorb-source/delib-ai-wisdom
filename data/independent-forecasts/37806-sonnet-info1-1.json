  "information": "A legislative proposal, the SAFE for America Act of 2025, introduced by Representative Mike Collins, seeks to eliminate the Diversity Visa Lottery program. The act would also prevent visa lottery winners from sponsoring family members for permanent residence. The proposal has received support from conservative organizations such as Heritage Action and NumbersUSA, which argue that the program undermines national security and lacks a merit-based selection process. President Trump previously called on Congress to terminate the program in 2017, following a terrorist attack in New York committed by an individual who had entered the U.S. through the visa lottery.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Approximately 42 days (from May 20, 2025 to July 1, 2025)",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No - no presidential action mentioning the Diversity Visa has been issued",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Trump focuses his executive actions on other immigration priorities like border security and enforcement, while allowing the congressional legislative process with the SAFE for America Act to proceed. Any statements he makes about the Diversity Visa come through press conferences or social media rather than formal presidential actions.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Trump issues an executive order or presidential memorandum on immigration reform that includes provisions related to the Diversity Visa program, using that exact terminology. This could be part of a broader immigration package or a standalone action responding to conservative pressure and aligning with the pending legislation in Congress.",
    "rationale": "The status quo strongly favors a No outcome, as presidential actions are formal, deliberate documents that require specific circumstances to be issued. While Trump has demonstrated clear opposition to the Diversity Visa program (calling for its termination in 2017) and willingness to use executive actions on immigration, several factors decrease the likelihood: First, there's already active legislation (SAFE for America Act) addressing this issue, which may be the preferred route. Second, the 42-day timeframe is relatively short for a non-urgent policy matter. Third, the requirement for exact wording ('Diversity Visa') is restrictive - many executive actions might reference visa programs more generally. Fourth, Trump's historical immigration executive actions focused more on border security, travel restrictions, and asylum rather than specific visa lottery programs. The research assistant's information confirms opposition exists but doesn't indicate imminent executive action. Factors that would increase my forecast: evidence of Trump preparing immigration-related executive actions, the legislation stalling in Congress, or a triggering event related to the program. Factors that would decrease it: Trump explicitly stating preference for the legislative route, or focus shifting to other immigration priorities. The probability reflects that while Trump has motive and means, the specific requirements and short timeframe with existing legislative alternatives make this outcome unlikely but not implausible.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill President Trump issue a new presidential action mentioning the Diversity Visa before July 1, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\n[Federal judge’s order leaves many visa lottery winners out of luck](https://www.siliconvalley.com/2020/10/01/judges-order-leaves-many-visa-lottery-winners-out-of-luck/) | The American Conservative: [Trump Should Cancel the Diversity Visa Program](https://www.theamericanconservative.com/trump-should-cancel-the-diversity-visa-program/) | Mint: [US Green Card Diversity Visa 2026 Lottery results released: What you need to know](https://www.livemint.com/news/us-news/us-green-card-diversity-visa-2026-lottery-results-released-what-you-need-to-know-11746381683106.html)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if, before July 1, 2025, President Donald J. Trump issues a [presidential action](https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/) mentioning the \"Diversity Visa\" (using exactly those words). If this does not occur before that date, this resolves as **No**.\n\nTo count, the presidential action must be published and publicly accessible (appearing on the presidential actions section of the White House website) before the specified time. A verbal statement or other written announcement besides a presidential action (for example a post on social media), is not sufficient.\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nA legislative proposal, the SAFE for America Act of 2025, introduced by Representative Mike Collins, seeks to eliminate the Diversity Visa Lottery program.

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
