    "review": "Both forecasters make a compelling case that I significantly underweighted the Easter timing effect. Forecaster 2 correctly identifies this as a 'powerful and predictable structural factor' - Easter 2024 on March 31 meant most holiday traffic was recorded in March 2024, while Easter 2025 on April 20 places the entire lucrative Easter travel period squarely within April 2025. Forecaster 3 reinforces this point and calls it the 'most important calendar effect.' This is not a subtle shift but a complete calendar realignment that should strongly favor April 2025 showing year-over-year growth. Both forecasters also correctly note that US policy concerns are minimal given the European market dominance, and both reference the February 2025 growth data as supporting ongoing positive momentum. The convergence of their forecasts (10% and 15%) suggests I was too conservative at 25%. Their reasoning is sound and well-supported.",
    "rationale": "Upon reflection, I underestimated the magnitude of the Easter calendar effect in my initial analysis. The shift from Easter falling on March 31 in 2024 to April 20 in 2025 is indeed a dominant structural factor. This means April 2024 likely captured only the tail end of Easter travel, while April 2025 captures the full Easter peak period - a substantial advantage for April 2025 figures. Combined with the February 2025 data showing continued growth momentum (2,248,198 vs 2,199,255), the baseline expectation should strongly favor April 2025 exceeding April 2024. The concerns about US tourism policy are appropriately dismissed as the Canary Islands draw predominantly from European markets. However, I maintain slightly more caution than Forecaster 2's 10% because: (1) we lack actual preliminary data for April, (2) unexpected disruptions (strikes, weather, operational issues) remain possible tail risks, and (3) the metric includes all passenger types where segment-specific weaknesses could matter. Nevertheless, the Easter timing effect is sufficiently powerful that I should update significantly downward from my initial 25%.",
