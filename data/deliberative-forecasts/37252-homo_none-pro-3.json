    "review": "All three forecasters correctly identified the December 2024 martial law declaration as the primary driver of political instability and potential for protests. My initial analysis was aligned with Forecaster 3's, focusing on the general aftershocks of such a major political crisis. However, Forecaster 2's analysis introduced a key argument I had not explicitly considered: the high probability of an ongoing 'impeachment process' against the president. This is a very compelling point. Such a process would serve as a powerful and continuous focal point for public outrage and organized mobilization, extending well beyond the initial event in December. It provides a specific mechanism for sustained protest activity into the forecast window (May-June 2025). The reasoning from Forecaster 2, which frames the short two-month period as 'political inertia' where the crisis is unlikely to have been resolved, is also more robust than my initial view.",
    "rationale": "My original forecast of 75% was based on the severe political instability caused by the late 2024 martial law declaration. I reasoned that such a profound crisis would likely continue to generate large protests. After reviewing the other forecasters' analyses, I am increasing my forecast. The key insight that persuaded me was Forecaster 2's point about the near-certainty of an ongoing impeachment process. A political crisis of this magnitude would not simply fade away; it would almost inevitably trigger formal legal and political challenges like impeachment. This process provides a sustained, high-profile focus for civic and opposition groups to organize demonstrations. It transforms the situation from one of lingering anger to one with an active, ongoing conflict that would be publicly contested in the streets. This specific mechanism makes it significantly more likely that at least one protest will cross the 10,000-participant threshold during the two-month window. Therefore, I am updating my forecast upward to reflect this increased confidence in a 'Yes' outcome.",
