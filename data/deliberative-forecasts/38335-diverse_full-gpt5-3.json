    "review": "Both forecasters emphasize the short window (≈26 days), lack of visible campaign build, Trump’s endorsement of Donalds, and the Hope Florida probe as reasons the status quo (No) should prevail. They also correctly identify the June 30 fundraising deadline as the only near-term catalyst that could justify a quick launch. I largely agree. New angles: none materially new beyond what I had; both stress the base-rate need for pre-launch signals, which I already weighed. Minor nit: Forecaster 2 cites FEC filings, but this race is governed by Florida state filings; the broader point (no formal prep visible) stands. Their update triggers match mine (staff hires, committee moves, event holds, definitive statements). Overall, their reasoning is consistent and supports a low, non-zero probability.",
    "rationale": "Time remaining is short, and there are no credible signs of an imminent launch (staffing leaks, committee/filing activity, venue holds, donor summits, or coordinated media). Strategic incentives cut against a June launch: Trump’s endorsement of Donalds complicates her path; announcing amid the Hope Florida probe risks defining her candidacy under negative scrutiny; and she retains ample time to announce later in 2025 while leveraging name ID. While the June 30 deadline could be used to report a strong Q2, she can raise via allied committees without a formal candidacy and can still enter post–July 1 without meaningful disadvantage given the August 2026 primary. Given the absence of preparatory signals and the political headwinds, a surprise announcement remains possible but unlikely in the next few weeks. I would move higher on credible reports of staff/consultant hires, Florida committee maneuvers, venue/media advisories, or supportive cues from the Governor; lower if the probe intensifies or she signals a later timetable.",
