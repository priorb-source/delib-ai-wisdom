  "information": "Saipan has become a popular destination for Korean tourists, who constituted 70% of the island's visitors in 2024. The Governor of Saipan, Arnold Palacios, has identified the Korean tourist market as a primary focus for growth and sustainability. In line with this, the Mariana Visitors Authority launched a marketing campaign titled 'This is the Marianas' for the Korean market. The 2025 Saipan Marathon attracted over 200 Korean participants out of 612 runners from 19 countries. Additionally, KB Kookmin Card initiated a promotional event for its Visa cardholders traveling to destinations including Saipan, offering discounts on flights, hotels, dining, and shopping starting from July 18.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Approximately 6 weeks until July 1, 2025",
    "status_quo_outcome": "The current number of direct flight destinations from Saipan likely remains stable through July 1, 2025. Given the short timeframe and typical airline planning cycles, significant changes to route networks are unlikely.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Saipan maintains its current route structure with 4 or fewer direct flight destinations. No new international routes are established in the 6-week window, as airlines typically require several months for route planning, regulatory approvals, and marketing. Any existing marginal routes may even be suspended due to insufficient demand or operational challenges.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Saipan's route network expands or already exceeds 4 destinations. Strong Korean tourism (70% of visitors) supports multiple Korean city connections beyond just Seoul/Incheon. Additional routes from Japanese cities, Chinese hubs, or other Asian destinations are active or newly established. The promotional activities and growing tourism interest translates into stable or expanded air connectivity.",
    "rationale": "The critical factor is the extremely short timeframe of 6 weeks. International flight routes typically require 3-6 months of advance planning for regulatory approvals, aircraft scheduling, crew arrangements, and marketing. This strongly favors the status quo outcome.\n\nHowever, the research reveals positive momentum: Korean tourists comprise 70% of visitors, the government is actively targeting the Korean market, and promotional campaigns are underway. The Saipan Marathon drew international participants from 19 countries, suggesting diverse connectivity.\n\nThe key uncertainty is the CURRENT state: How many destinations does Saipan serve today? Common routes likely include Seoul/Incheon (given Korean dominance), possibly other Korean cities, Tokyo or other Japanese destinations, and potentially Chinese cities or regional hubs like Guam or Manila. Historically, Saipan has struggled with flight suspensions and limited connectivity.\n\nThe threshold of 'greater than 4' (meaning 5+) suggests this is a meaningful boundary, likely near the current state. If Saipan currently has 5+ destinations, status quo maintains a YES. If at 4 or fewer, new routes in 6 weeks are unlikely.\n\nI weight this toward NO because: (1) 6 weeks is extremely short for route additions, (2) historical struggles suggest limited connectivity, (3) remote island locations typically have fewer routes. However, I don't go below 40% because: (1) strong Korean tourism might already support multiple Korean cities, (2) the promotional activities suggest confidence in connectivity, (3) some uncertainty about exact current state.\n\nFor my forecast to increase: evidence of current routes already at 5+, announcements of new routes starting by July, or data showing rapid expansion. To decrease: confirmation of only 3-4 current routes, airline announcements of suspensions, or lack of new route news by mid-June.",

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
