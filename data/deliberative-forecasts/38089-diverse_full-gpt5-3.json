    "review": "Both forecasters center the short horizon and the current 3-point Sánchez lead, which I agree are the dominant factors. Forecaster 2 adds the specific consumer confidence uptick in Turkey as a plausible tailwind for Erdoğan, and both emphasize approval entrenchment and the likelihood that major moves require catalysts. I find that plausible but would caution that consumer confidence doesn’t always translate 1:1 to leader approval within a month. Neither explicitly discusses resolution mechanics risk: (a) a tie counts as No and Morning Consult rounds to whole numbers, and (b) Metaculus can check “on or after” July 1, potentially allowing a later update to flip the ordering. Those are meaningful downside considerations given a narrow gap. I also think Morning Consult’s series can show 1–2 point weekly moves, so a 3-point reversal is not out of the question, even absent a big shock.",
    "rationale": "Anchoring on May figures (Sánchez 35%, Erdoğan 32%) with roughly one month to go, the base case favors Yes. Short-run approval dynamics are typically sticky, and both leaders’ ratings appear bounded in the low-to-mid 30s. Spain’s macro backdrop is comparatively benign, and Sánchez’s recent positioning likely firmed his base; Turkey’s gradual macro stabilization could aid Erdoğan, but translation to approval may be slow and is offset by potential controversy around constitutional reform. \n\nHowever, I retain some caution versus the higher peer forecasts because: \n- The margin is small and within the range of normal week-to-week variation. \n- A tie resolves No, and rounding could matter. \n- The resolution wording (“on or after July 1”) introduces timing risk if a later July update is used. \n\nNetting these, I slightly raise my probability in light of peers’ emphasis on entrenchment and the short window, but not by much given the structural downside risks from tie/rounding/timing. I’d move higher if a mid/late-June Morning Consult snapshot still shows a ≥2-point Sánchez lead; lower if we see convergence or a data point with Erdoğan back in the mid-30s or Sánchez slipping to low 30s.",
