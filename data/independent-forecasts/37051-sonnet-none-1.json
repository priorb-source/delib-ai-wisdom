    "status_quo_outcome": "No - Harvard maintains its 501(c)(3) tax-exempt status",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Harvard continues with its current tax-exempt status through July 1, 2025. Any IRS proceedings to revoke status either don't begin, move too slowly to complete by the deadline, or are successfully challenged and delayed through legal appeals. The administrative process and legal protections prevent any change within the tight timeframe.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "The IRS initiates and completes expedited revocation proceedings against Harvard, successfully stripping its 501(c)(3) status before July 1, 2025. Harvard either doesn't challenge the action or loses any emergency legal challenges quickly enough that revocation becomes effective within two months.",
    "rationale": "This forecast heavily favors the status quo for several compelling reasons. First, the timeframe is extremely short - only about 2 months. Revoking 501(c)(3) status from a major institution like Harvard requires formal administrative procedures including notice, opportunity to respond, and typically lengthy review processes. The IRS cannot simply revoke tax-exempt status by fiat. Second, any revocation attempt would almost certainly face immediate legal challenges from Harvard, which has substantial legal resources. Emergency injunctions would likely freeze any revocation pending full legal review, which takes far longer than 2 months. Third, there is no indication from available information that formal proceedings have even begun. The New York Times article mentions Trump 'threatening' the tax status, but threats and actual administrative action are vastly different. Political pressure does not automatically translate to administrative outcomes, especially on such compressed timelines. Historical precedent strongly supports the status quo: major universities rarely lose tax-exempt status, and when they do, it follows years of proceedings, not weeks. For this to occur, we would need: (1) immediate formal IRS action already underway, (2) unprecedented expedited procedures, (3) Harvard to either not challenge or lose challenges extraordinarily quickly, and (4) no procedural delays. All four conditions are individually unlikely and collectively extremely improbable. My forecast isn't lower (near 0%) only because political pressure at the highest levels could theoretically produce some unprecedented action, though this remains highly speculative. It's not higher because the bureaucratic, legal, and temporal barriers are simply too significant to overcome in 2 months.",

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any).
