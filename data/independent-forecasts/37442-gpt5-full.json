  "information": "In late 2024 and early 2025, Berkshire Hathaway was a net seller of stocks, increasing its cash position to $348 billion by May 2025. The company reduced its holdings in Apple by 50% and also sold shares in Bank of America and Citigroup. New positions were initiated in Constellation Brands, while existing stakes in Occidental Petroleum, SiriusXM Holdings, Pool Corp, and Verisign were increased. During the first quarter of 2025, Berkshire's purchases included additions to Verisign, Sirius XM, and Occidental Petroleum, as well as an estimated $2.7 billion investment in five Japanese trading houses.\n\nBerkshire Hathaway first purchased 1.27 million shares of Domino's Pizza in the third quarter of 2024. In the fourth quarter of 2024, it increased this stake to a total of 2,382,000 shares, with the investment's value growing from $549 million to $1 billion. Multiple news articles from early May 2025, published after Berkshire's annual meeting, reported that the company had further increased its stake in Domino's Pizza to 7%.\n\nFor its first fiscal quarter of 2025, Domino's Pizza reported a 0.5% decline in U.S. same-store sales and missed revenue forecasts, but it exceeded earnings per share expectations. During that same quarter, the company repurchased 115,000 of its own shares. The company's 'Hungry for More' strategy aims to open over 1,000 new stores annually until 2028 and achieve 7% annual sales growth. As part of this strategy, Domino's is set to begin a collaboration with DoorDash in 2025, following a previous partnership with Uber Eats in 2023.",

    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "About 9 days (until the May 15, 2025 13F filing deadline)",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No — the 13F shows the Domino’s (DPZ) position unchanged at 2,382,000 shares or lower.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Berkshire leaves the DPZ stake exactly at 2,382,000 shares (or trims slightly), or any additional buying is kept confidential and not reflected as >2,382,000 in the Q1 13F.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Berkshire continued building the DPZ position during Q1 2025, so the 13F filed for period ending 2025-03-31 reports more than 2,382,000 DPZ shares (even a small increase would qualify).",
    "rationale": "What I know/assume: Berkshire disclosed 2,382,000 DPZ shares as of Q4 2024. The question resolves Yes only if the Q1 2025 13F shows a share count strictly above that. Berkshire often builds new positions across multiple quarters (they raised the DPZ stake from Q3 to Q4 2024), but they were broadly net sellers in Q1 2025 and focused their US buying on a few names (e.g., Verisign, Sirius XM, Occidental). Domino’s itself repurchased ~115k shares in Q1, but that only nudges Berkshire’s ownership percentage; it does not increase Berkshire’s share count, which is what determines resolution here. The research assistant notes early May articles stating Berkshire ‘increased its stake to 7%.’ That could be loose rounding based on the earlier 2.382m-share stake (already near ~6.8–7% depending on shares outstanding) or reflect modest additional buys. However, the 115k company buyback alone is far too small to take 6.8% to 7% without Berkshire purchasing more shares. Key considerations: - Status quo bias: Berkshire was a net seller overall and did not prominently signal DPZ additions; unchanged is the default. - Accumulation pattern: They built in Q3 and Q4 2024, so a third quarter of incremental buying is plausible, especially for a Weschler/Combs pick. - Valuation/timing: DPZ traded at rich multiples through much of Q1; Berkshire tends to be price-sensitive, which tempers the odds of further buying. - Disclosure mechanics: Since DPZ was already public in 13F, further confidential treatment is less likely, so any Q1 increase would likely appear in the 13F. Why not higher? Because the clearest macro signal is Berkshire reducing equity exposure in Q1 and prioritizing other adds (OXY/VRSN/SIRI). Why not lower? Because Berkshire often scales into new positions over multiple quarters, and the ‘~7%’ press chatter (even if rounded) keeps alive the chance of at least a small Q1 add. What would move me up: A 13G/A or credible report indicating Berkshire’s updated DPZ share count above 2.382m as of late Q1/early Q2; indications of significant Q1 DPZ accumulation (price/volume footprints tied to Berkshire). What would move me down: Credible commentary that DPZ was unchanged in Q1; signs Berkshire concentrated Q1 purchases solely elsewhere; or evidence they sought confidentiality that would keep DPZ unchanged in the 13F.",
