    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "2 months",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No. The Labour Party holds a commanding lead in Politico's poll of polls. While Reform UK has surged to become the second or third party, they remain approximately 15-20 percentage points behind Labour. Maintaining this status quo would result in a 'No' outcome.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "The new Labour government avoids any major scandals or crises, and their polling lead over other parties remains in the double digits. Reform UK's support, having captured much of the disaffected right-wing vote, plateaus in the low 20s, insufficient to challenge Labour's top position.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "A catastrophic scandal engulfs the Labour government, causing a sudden and dramatic collapse in their support. Concurrently, the Conservative party effectively disintegrates, with a wave of defections to Reform UK, which consolidates the entire right-of-center vote. This perfect storm propels Reform UK not just to first place, but to a lead of 4 points or more over the beleaguered Labour party.",
    "rationale": "My forecast is based primarily on the principle of political inertia. Polling averages, especially for a governing party just under a year into its term, tend to be stable. The current Labour lead is substantial, likely around 15-20 points. For Reform UK to not only close this gap but establish a 4-point lead requires a polling swing of over 20 points in just two months. Such a dramatic shift is historically rare and would necessitate a political event of seismic proportions.\n\nThe 'No' outcome is heavily favored because it represents the continuation of the current political trajectory. The Labour government will likely focus on steady governance, and while they may face challenges, a full-scale collapse in public trust is improbable in this short timeframe. Reform UK, while successful in displacing the Conservatives in many polls, may find its support has a natural ceiling as it struggles to broaden its appeal beyond its core anti-establishment, right-wing base.\n\nMy probability is not lower than 8% because UK politics has demonstrated extreme volatility in recent years. The rapid rise of Reform UK and the collapse of the Conservative vote are testament to this. A 'perfect storm' scenario—a major Labour scandal combined with a final Conservative implosion—is not impossible, merely improbable. Nigel Farage is also a uniquely effective media campaigner who can capitalize on unforeseen events.\n\nMy probability is not higher because the double condition of the question (becoming #1 AND leading by 4+ points) sets an extremely high bar. Overcoming a major party's established lead is one thing; building a significant lead of your own in such a short period is another challenge entirely. It requires both a catastrophic failure for the incumbent and a monumental success for the challenger to happen simultaneously.\n\nI would increase my forecast if we saw a series of polls showing the Labour lead rapidly shrinking to single digits, or if a major, verifiable scandal involving the Prime Minister or Chancellor emerged. Conversely, I would decrease my forecast if Labour's polling lead remains stable or widens throughout May.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nBefore July 1, 2025, will Reform UK be the highest polling party in the UK by at least 4 points, according to Politico?\n\nQuestion background:\nThe Hill: [Nigel Farage’s Reform UK is upending British politics](https://thehill.com/opinion/international/5163853-how-nigel-farages-reform-uk-is-upending-british-politics/) | Wikipedia: [Reform UK](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reform_UK)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below.

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
