    "review": "Forecaster 2 and 3 both provide strong arguments emphasizing the extremely short timeframe and the pattern of authoritarian consolidation. Forecaster 2's analysis of the junta's track record of defying international pressure is compelling, and their 5% forecast reflects appropriate skepticism about rapid policy reversals. However, Forecaster 3 raises an important point I initially underweighted: the possibility of a 'face-saving partial retreat.' The resolution criteria explicitly allow for partial reversals where parties can 'generally' be formed again. This creates a plausible scenario where the junta could rescind the blanket dissolution while implementing a restrictive but technically compliant registration regime. This would allow them to claim reform while maintaining control, and it would still satisfy the resolution criteria. Forecaster 3's 12% appropriately accounts for this pathway. Both forecasters correctly emphasize the deliberate nature of the decision (evidenced by the 130-2 CNT vote and stated intent to draft new frameworks), making a reversal even less likely. The key tension is between the very low base rate for such quick authoritarian reversals (supporting lower forecasts) and the multiple technical pathways to resolution, including partial reversals (supporting slightly higher forecasts).",
    "rationale": "After reviewing both analyses, I believe the 'face-saving partial retreat' scenario deserves more weight than I initially gave it. The resolution criteria are permissive enough that the junta could technically reverse the decree while still maintaining significant control through restrictive registration requirements. This pathway is more plausible than a full reversal to the pre-decree status quo. However, even this scenario requires: (1) sufficient pressure to motivate action within 40 days, (2) administrative capacity to draft new legislation quickly, and (3) political will to appear to back down, even if face-saving. The current pressure—domestic legal challenges, intellectual opposition, and international condemnation—exists but lacks the severity that typically forces rapid authoritarian reversals. Mali's withdrawal from ECOWAS demonstrates immunity to regional pressure, and arrests show confidence in repression. The CNT's 130-2 vote and stated intent to draft new frameworks indicate this was a carefully planned long-term strategy, not an impulsive decision. The extremely short timeframe (40 days) is the most decisive factor against reversal. I'm updating slightly upward from 8% to 10% to account for the partial reversal pathway, while maintaining that the base rate for such quick reversals remains very low.",
