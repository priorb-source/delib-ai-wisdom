    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Approximately 30 days until June 28, 2025",
    "status_quo_outcome": "Yes - if drought conditions are already 'bad' as indicated in the background article, it is likely that 20 million or more residents are currently affected or will be by late June",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Fewer than 20 million residents are in drought areas, which could occur if the drought is geographically concentrated in less populated regions of California, or if the current drought severity is being overstated in media coverage, or if unexpected late-season precipitation provides relief",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "20 million or more residents are in drought areas, which is likely if the drought affects major population centers like Los Angeles, the San Francisco Bay Area, or San Diego, or if drought conditions expand over the next month during California's peak dry season",
    "rationale": "This forecast heavily weighs the status quo given the 30-day timeframe. The SF Gate article indicates California's drought has 'returned and it's already bad,' suggesting significant current impacts. Key factors supporting a Yes outcome: (1) We are entering California's driest period (late June), when drought conditions typically persist or intensify rather than improve, (2) The short 30-day window means dramatic changes are unlikely, (3) California's population is approximately 39-40 million, so 20 million represents roughly 50% - a substantial but achievable threshold if drought affects major urban areas. Factors creating uncertainty: (1) My research assistant provided no specific current drought data, so I cannot confirm whether we're already at or near the 20 million threshold, (2) The geographic distribution of drought matters greatly - if concentrated in sparsely populated regions, the threshold might not be met, (3) Unexpected weather events, while rare in June, could theoretically alter conditions. The forecast would be higher (75-80%) if I had confirmation that current affected populations are already near or above 20 million. It would be lower (40-50%) if specific data showed current affected populations well below 15 million, as significant expansion in 30 days would be less likely. The 65% probability reflects moderate confidence that drought conditions affecting major population centers will persist through late June.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill California have 20.0 million or more residents living in drought on June 28, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nSF Gate: [California's drought has returned — and it's already bad](https://www.sfgate.com/bayarea/article/california-drought-problem-20271547.php)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if Drought Monitor at [this link](https://www.drought.gov/states/california) lists greater than or equal to 20.0 million California residents in areas of drought, when the link is accessed by Metaculus on or after June 28, 2025. If the number is below that, this question resolves as **No**.\n\nThe question will resolve as soon as the page is accessed by Metaculus Admins on the resolution date. However, if there are issues accessing the page, then resolution will wait up until the end of the tournament's scoring at which point if Metaculus has still not been able to access the resolution source, this question will be **annulled**.\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nNo additional information available.\n\nToday is 2025-05-29.\n\nBefore answering you think:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n(e) You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
