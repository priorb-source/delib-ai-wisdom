    "review": "Both forecasters reinforce the same low base rate I used and emphasize structural frictions (US-based, English-language system; professional disincentives) and the narrow one-month window. I find Forecaster 2’s framing broadly consistent with my own. Forecaster 3’s attempt to downweight the base rate by suggesting the 1–2 South American reports may not be pilots conflicts with the assistant’s summary, which appears to refer to South American pilot reports specifically (and cites concrete pilot examples). Their added assumption that South America is only 20–30% of non-US pilot reports is plausible but not evidenced here. A useful reminder from both is the lack of any catalyst that would raise June odds. I also give a bit more weight to posting/visibility risk around the early-July check, which neither fully unpacked but effectively pushes toward the low end of the base-rate range.",
    "rationale": "I model South American pilot reports as a Poisson process with λ ≈ 1–2 per year. That implies a monthly P(≥1) of about 8–15%, with a midpoint near 12%. Adjusting for two risks nudges me down: (1) classification/geo-tagging must clearly show “Pilot” and a South American country (not offshore), and (2) posting/visibility timing—Metaculus checks on/after July 1, and NUFORC entries can lag. These considerations move me from 12% to the low end of the range. I do not adopt Forecaster 3’s further reduction premised on South American reports not being pilots, because the provided examples and wording support that 1–2/year refers to pilot reports. Net: modest downward update to reflect tagging and timing frictions without discarding the documented base rate.",
