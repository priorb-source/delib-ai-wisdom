  "information": "The U.S. State Department's travel advisory for Mozambique is currently 'Level 3: Reconsider Travel,' as of the last update on December 19, 2023. Specific northern regions of the country are under higher-level warnings. Recent security developments include suspected jihadist attacks in late April and early May 2025 in Niassa province, an area previously less impacted by the insurgency centered in Cabo Delgado. In response, the U.S. Embassy in Maputo issued specific warnings. The UK and Canada have also warned against travel to parts of Niassa and Cabo Delgado. Concurrently, ongoing post-election protests have led the African Travel & Tourism Association (ATTA) to issue its own travel advisory.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "About 60 days (until July 1, 2025)",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No — Mozambique remains at Level 3: Reconsider Travel, with region-specific higher warnings.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Insurgent activity remains concentrated in Cabo Delgado and parts of Niassa/Nampula without sustained spread to southern/central population centers; the U.S. Embassy issues localized security alerts and the State Department updates the page to refine area-specific “Do Not Travel” guidance but keeps the national advisory at Level 3.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "A marked deterioration occurs before July 1: a series of high-casualty or high-profile attacks (including against foreigners), insurgent operations expand across multiple provinces or threaten major cities/transport corridors, kidnappings increase, or the U.S. orders departure of embassy family members—prompting the State Department to raise the national advisory to Level 4: Do Not Travel.",
    "rationale": "Baseline and inertia: Mozambique has been at Level 3 for a long period, with “Do Not Travel” applied to specific northern areas. The State Department generally reserves Level 4 for nationwide conflict, widespread collapse of security/governance, or persistent, acute targeting of foreigners; when threats are geographically bounded, it typically uses region-specific Level 4 alongside a national Level 3. With only ~60 days left, advisory inertia favors the status quo.\n\nRecent developments: The research assistant notes suspected jihadist attacks in late April/early May 2025 in Niassa (a newer area of concern) and a related U.S. Embassy warning, along with UK/Canada cautioning against travel to parts of Niassa and Cabo Delgado. There are also post-election protests and an industry (ATTA) advisory. These raise risk but still point to localized instability rather than nationwide breakdown. Comparable peer advisories have not shifted to whole-of-country “do not travel,” which lowers odds of a U.S. nationwide Level 4 in the near term.\n\nWhy not higher: A countrywide Level 4 within two months would usually require escalation beyond the north—e.g., sustained multi-province attacks, credible threats in Maputo/Beira/Nampula, increased kidnappings targeting foreigners, or a visible U.S. posture change (e.g., ordered departure). None are evident at that scale yet. Cyclone season is ending, reducing the chance of a compound disaster by July 1.\n\nWhy not lower: The insurgency’s apparent spread into Niassa, recent embassy alerts, and periodic political unrest raise tail risks. If violence accelerates or targets foreigners/tourism or LNG infrastructure, the State Department could reassess quickly.\n\nWhat would move me up: Multiple significant incidents outside Cabo Delgado (and deep into Niassa/Nampula/Zambezia), attacks or kidnappings of foreigners, credible threats in major cities, ordered departure from the U.S. Embassy, or peer governments (UK/Canada/Australia) escalating to broad “do not travel.”\n\nWhat would move me down: Several quiet weeks with contained incidents, peer advisories steady at current levels, and U.S. updates refining regional cautions without changing the national level.\n\nSummary of assistant inputs affecting forecast: Current U.S. level is 3 (last noted Dec 19, 2023); new jihadist activity in Niassa triggered embassy warnings; UK/Canada have tightened regional cautions; ATTA issued an industry advisory amid protests. These suggest elevated but localized risk rather than nationwide conditions consistent with Level 4.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill Mozambique receive a \"Level 4 – Do Not Travel\" travel advisory from the US State Department before July 1, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nMSN: [ATTA issues travel advisory for Mozambique amid protests](https://www.msn.com/en-za/travel/travel-preparation/atta-issues-travel-advisory-for-mozambique-amid-protests/ar-AA1wHavB?ocid=BingNewsVerp)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below.

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
