    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "The outcome will be known within approximately one week. The 13F filing for the first quarter of 2025 (ending March 31, 2025) is due by May 15, 2025.",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No. Berkshire Hathaway has held exactly 10,000,000 shares of Amazon since the second quarter of 2019. If this position remains unchanged, it will not be greater than 10,000,000 shares, resulting in a 'No' outcome.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Berkshire Hathaway's investment managers, likely Todd Combs or Ted Weschler, continue to see the current 10,000,000-share position as appropriate for the portfolio. They do not add to the stake during Q1 2025, and the filing reports a holding of 10,000,000 shares or fewer.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Driven by a perceived attractive valuation or a strengthened conviction in Amazon's long-term prospects (e.g., in AI or AWS), one of Berkshire's managers decides to increase the company's stake in Q1 2025. They purchase additional shares, causing the reported total in the 13F filing to exceed 10,000,000.",
    "rationale": "My forecast is heavily weighted by the status quo. The primary evidence is Berkshire Hathaway's own trading history with Amazon stock; the company has held its position at exactly 10,000,000 shares for over five years, from Q2 2019 through the most recently available filings. This demonstrates significant inertia and suggests a 'buy and hold' approach to this specific investment. Berkshire's general investment philosophy favors long-term holds over frequent trading, further supporting the likelihood of an unchanged position. The research assistant's report of no additional information means there are no known catalysts, such as a dramatic price drop in Q1 2025 or positive commentary from management, to suggest a change in this long-standing pattern. \n\nThe probability is not lower because the managers who control this position (Todd Combs and Ted Weschler) do make adjustments to the portfolio, and adding to an existing position is a plausible action in any given quarter if conditions are favorable. The threshold for a 'Yes' is also very low—only one share needs to be added. \n\nThe probability is not higher because of the powerful base rate established by more than 20 consecutive quarters of holding the exact same number of shares. A change would be a meaningful deviation from a very consistent, long-term pattern. \n\nI would increase my forecast if information emerged about a significant price dip in AMZN during Q1 2025 or if Berkshire management had made bullish public statements on the company's valuation during that period.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill Berkshire Hathaway reveal a purchase of more Amazon stock in its Q1 2025 13F filing?\n\nQuestion background:\nStockCircle: [Berkshire Hathaway's Amazon Stake](https://stockcircle.com/portfolio/warren-buffett/amzn/transactions)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if the 13F filing for Berkshire Hathaway, Inc., filed for the period ending 2025-03-31, reports the company holding greater than 10,000,000 shares of Amazon.com, Inc.\n\n\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nNo additional information available.\n\nToday is 2025-05-08.\n\nBefore answering you think:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n(e) You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
