  "information": "According to a visual analysis of a Morning Consult snapshot from May 8, 2025, Pedro Sánchez's approval rating was 35%, while Recep Tayyip Erdoğan's was 32%. A separate survey from January 21-27, 2025 by the same source, reported by El Economista, listed both leaders as having high disapproval rates. Regarding economic indicators, reports noted that Turkey's consumer confidence gained 5% in April, contrasted with a slump in Europe, and that Spain was experiencing an economic recovery.\n\nSpanish Prime Minister Pedro Sánchez has taken a vocal stance on the conflict in Gaza, describing the situation as a 'genocide' and vowing to raise Spain's voice to end the 'massacre.' In May 2024, his government officially recognized the State of Palestine, and Spain is expected to impose sanctions on Israel. Sánchez is also pushing for stronger EU action, including a review of the EU-Israel Association Agreement. Domestically, his activities include efforts for Catalan language recognition and social policies such as early retirement reforms.\n\nTurkish President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan has initiated work on a new constitution, appointing a team of legal experts to draft it. Erdoğan stated the current constitution is outdated, while critics raised concerns the move could be intended to extend his presidency beyond 2028, a claim he has denied. Erdoğan also ruled out early elections. In foreign affairs, he publicly criticized Pedro Sánchez for showing support for the detained Istanbul Mayor, Ekrem İmamoğlu. The two leaders met in Istanbul in May 2025 to discuss bilateral relations, including trade, security, and the situation in Gaza.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Approximately 1 month.",
    "status_quo_outcome": "Yes. Based on the latest available data from Morning Consult for May 8, 2025, Pedro Sánchez's approval rating of 35% is higher than Recep Tayyip Erdoğan's rating of 32%.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Turkey's improving consumer confidence continues through June, translating into a tangible boost for Erdoğan's approval rating. Concurrently, Sánchez faces domestic backlash over his government's deals with Catalan separatist parties or his stance on Israel, causing a slight dip in his own approval. This combination results in Erdoğan's approval rating being equal to or higher than Sánchez's by July 1, 2025.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "The current 3-point gap in approval ratings is maintained or widens. Spain's continued economic recovery sustains Sánchez's approval rating. Erdoğan's push for a new constitution proves controversial and alienates swing voters, offsetting any potential gains from positive economic indicators. As a result, Sánchez's approval rating remains higher than Erdoğan's on the resolution date.",
    "rationale": "My forecast is anchored on the current data from Morning Consult (May 8, 2025), which shows Pedro Sánchez with a 3-point lead over Recep Tayyip Erdoğan (35% to 32%). With only a month until the resolution date, this status quo is the single most important factor. The world changes slowly, and a reversal of this lead, while possible, is not the most likely outcome.\n\nSeveral factors support the 'Yes' outcome. Sánchez is presiding over an economic recovery in Spain, which typically provides a tailwind for an incumbent's approval. His high-profile foreign policy, particularly his vocal support for Palestine, may shore up support within his left-leaning base, even if it is divisive overall.\n\nHowever, there are compelling reasons why this forecast is not higher. The 3-point margin is narrow and could easily be erased by normal polling fluctuations or short-term events. The primary factor favoring a 'No' outcome is the report of a 5% gain in Turkey's consumer confidence in April. If this trend continues, it could significantly boost Erdoğan's approval. Erdoğan is a resilient political figure with a solid base, and positive economic sentiment is a powerful force. Conversely, Sánchez's government is built on a narrow and contentious coalition, leaving him vulnerable to domestic political crises that could quickly erode his approval.\n\nMy forecast is not lower because, while Turkey's economic indicators are improving, Erdoğan is simultaneously pursuing a controversial new constitution which could suppress his approval ratings by creating political opposition. The existing lead for Sánchez, though small, is a factual starting point that requires a net positive shift for Erdoğan to overcome.\n\nI would increase my probability for 'Yes' if new polling data shows Sánchez's lead widening, or if Erdoğan's constitutional project sparks significant public protests. I would decrease my probability if new data shows the gap closing, or if further reports confirm a strong link between Turkey's economic confidence and Erdoğan's personal approval rating.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill Spanish Prime Minister Pedro Sánchez have a higher approval rating than Turkey's President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan on July 1, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nResolution source updates monthly. According to Morning Consult for January 2025: \"The latest approval ratings are based on data collected from Jan. 21-27, 2025. Ratings reflect a trailing seven-day simple moving average of views among adults in each country surveyed.\"\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below.
