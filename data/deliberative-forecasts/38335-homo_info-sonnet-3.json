    "review": "Both forecasters raise compelling arguments I hadn't fully weighted. Forecaster 3's emphasis on the absence of visible campaign infrastructure (no staff hires, no fundraising filings, no organized groundwork) is particularly strong evidence. Political campaigns rarely announce without weeks of preparation and visible signals. Forecaster 2's point about Ron DeSantis not endorsing anyone is an interesting signal of possible family hesitance I hadn't considered. Both correctly note that while 26 days is theoretically sufficient for an announcement, campaigns don't typically materialize from nothing. I may have overweighted the June 30 fundraising deadline as a catalyst - it's less relevant without existing campaign infrastructure. The consensus clustering around 18-20% suggests I was slightly high at 22%.",
    "rationale": "Upon reflection, I'm updating downward to account for the strong evidence of no visible campaign preparation. The key insight from the other forecasters is that modern political campaigns require infrastructure building before formal announcements - staff hires, fundraising operations, vendor relationships, and strategic positioning. None of these have been reported for Casey DeSantis. While I correctly identified the status quo favoring No and the Hope Florida probe as a disincentive, I underweighted the significance of zero campaign infrastructure with only 26 days remaining. The June 30 fundraising deadline I mentioned is a weaker catalyst than I initially thought without pre-existing campaign operations. However, I'm not going as low as 18% because the DeSantis name carries exceptional weight in Florida, and a rapid announcement remains theoretically possible, even if increasingly unlikely. My updated forecast of 19% reflects stronger emphasis on the campaign infrastructure gap while maintaining modest probability for the increasingly narrow announcement window.",
