  "information": "On May 14, 2025, the Nigerian House of Representatives passed a resolution urging the Federal Government to engage in dialogue with the Republic of Benin to resolve the blockade. The motion highlighted the strain on bilateral relations and the disruption to seasonal trade critical to the livelihood of border communities. As of late May 2025, neither the Nigerian nor the Beninese government had issued any public statements suggesting an imminent reopening. On May 30, an AFRICOM briefing noted a deteriorating security threat environment along the Benin-Nigeria frontier.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Approximately 1 month (31 days from May 31 to July 1, 2025)",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No - the borders remain closed",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "The border crossings remain closed through July 1 due to unresolved security concerns about the Mahmuda terror group, ongoing arms smuggling issues, and lack of diplomatic progress. Both governments prioritize security over trade facilitation, and the deteriorating threat environment noted by AFRICOM persists or worsens.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Intense diplomatic pressure, particularly from Nigeria's Federal Government following the House resolution, leads to rapid bilateral negotiations. Benin agrees to reopen the borders with enhanced security measures in place, possibly including joint patrols or increased monitoring. Economic pressure from disrupted trade accelerates the timeline for resolution.",
    "rationale": "The borders were closed very recently in May 2025, giving this situation strong status quo momentum toward remaining closed. Multiple serious factors drove the closure: smuggling of goods, arms trafficking, and threats from a new terror group (Mahmuda). Most concerning is the May 30 AFRICOM briefing noting a 'deteriorating security threat environment' - this suggests the situation is worsening rather than improving. While Nigeria's House of Representatives passed a resolution on May 14 urging dialogue, there has been no public evidence of progress in negotiations, and neither government has signaled an imminent reopening as of late May. Border closures motivated by security concerns typically require substantial time to resolve - addressing terrorism, smuggling, and bilateral trust issues cannot be accomplished quickly. The one-month timeframe is extremely compressed for meaningful diplomatic resolution. Historical precedent suggests border disputes of this nature take months or longer to resolve. My forecast is not lower (say 5%) because economic pressure from disrupted trade could motivate faster action than typical, and behind-the-scenes diplomatic efforts may be underway that aren't publicly visible. The Nigerian House resolution indicates domestic pressure for resolution. My forecast is not higher (say 35%) because the deteriorating security situation, multiple complex drivers of the closure, very recent timing, and complete absence of positive signals make rapid resolution unlikely. I would revise upward if credible reports emerge of active negotiations, security improvements, or official statements suggesting progress. I would revise downward if the security situation worsens further or if either government makes statements indicating the closure will be prolonged.",

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
