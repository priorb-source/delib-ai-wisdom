    "review": "Forecaster 3 provides crucial legislative details I did not have: the House voted 118-16 to EXPAND cannabis access through HB 46, and when the House committee received Senate Bill 3 (the ban), they adopted a substitute version that explicitly does NOT ban THC, instead creating a regulatory framework. This is concrete evidence of active House opposition to a full ban, not just theoretical resistance. Forecaster 2's 45% appears too optimistic given this divergence - while the Senate passage is real, it doesn't overcome the clear House position demonstrated through actual votes and committee actions. The $8 billion hemp industry represents substantial economic opposition I underweighted. The timeline constraint (12 days in regular session) combined with demonstrated House opposition makes passage highly unlikely without extraordinary political intervention that Abbott has not signaled.",
    "rationale": "My initial 10% underweighted the significance of concrete legislative actions showing House opposition. The House's 118-16 vote for expansion and the committee's gutting of the ban bill are much stronger indicators than I initially considered. These are not hypothetical obstacles but demonstrated positions. The divergence between chambers (Senate wants prohibition, House wants expansion) is stark and typically difficult to reconcile in 12 remaining days. My original concerns about Abbott's lack of prioritization remain valid and are reinforced by his silence despite Patrick's advocacy. However, the probability is not near zero because: special sessions remain technically possible before July 1, legislative dynamics can shift rapidly under political pressure, and we may lack complete information about behind-the-scenes negotiations. But the concrete evidence of House opposition through actual votes is decisive. I'm updating downward from 10% to 8% to align with the stronger evidence of legislative resistance.",
