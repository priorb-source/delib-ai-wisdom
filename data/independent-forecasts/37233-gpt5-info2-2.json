  "information": "President Ouattara's party, the RHDP, has referred to him as its 'natural candidate' and has been calling for him to run since 2024. In late December 2024, Minister of State Anne Désirée Ouloto announced Ouattara would be the candidate. Similarly, in early January 2025, Minister of Transport Amadou KONÉ stated that Ouattara 'will be the candidate of the RHDP in October 2025.' In late April 2025, a supporter group, the Jeunesse pour la Renaissance du Grand Nord (JRGN), held a press conference publicly calling on Ouattara to run.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "About 32 days (until June 1, 2025)",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No — Ouattara continues to let party surrogates speak while he withholds a personal declaration until after June 1",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "RHDP keeps signaling he’s the “natural candidate,” ministers continue stating he’ll run, but Ouattara himself defers any explicit personal declaration to a later RHDP congress or a summer speech; no direct quote or formal statement from him before June 1",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "RHDP stages a May rally or council meeting where Ouattara publicly says “I am a candidate,” or he gives a televised address or issues a signed statement/interview declaring his candidacy that is reported by credible outlets before June 1",
    "rationale": "- Evidence and signals: The research assistant notes that since late 2024 senior officials have repeatedly said Ouattara will be the RHDP candidate (e.g., Anne Ouloto in December, Amadou Koné in January). A youth group publicly urged him to run in late April. These are strong elite signals that the decision to run is favored within the ruling party.\n- Resolution hinge: The question requires Ouattara himself to declare. Third‑party assertions don’t resolve the market. As of April 29, there’s no personal declaration.\n- Status quo and timing norms: In 2020 he declared relatively late (early August) and incumbents in the region often time declarations closer to formal nomination windows or party congresses. There is no legal need to announce in May, and maintaining optionality can be advantageous. Given that pattern, the default is continued ambiguity until later, making “No by June 1” the status quo outcome.\n- Why not higher: Despite heavy signaling, there’s no clear, publicized RHDP event in May that would force a declaration, and past behavior suggests he prefers late moves. Declaring early could galvanize opposition and international attention sooner than necessary.\n- Why not lower: The chorus from senior ministers strongly implies the decision is largely made, reducing the chance he won’t run. The party may want to lock in unity and end speculation; a May rally or National Council could be organized quickly, producing a personal declaration.\n- What would move me up: Credible reporting of an RHDP congress or major rally scheduled in May with an agenda to designate/endorse him; leaks that he will address the nation to announce; teaser language from Ouattara hinting at an imminent decision.\n- What would move me down: Announcements that the RHDP nomination congress or formal endorsement will occur in June/July; continued silence from Ouattara paired with a May travel schedule that makes a rally unlikely; signs he’s still weighing alternatives or floating successor names.",

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
