  "information": "Following his election win on April 28, 2025, Prime Minister Mark Carney presented a new, smaller cabinet of 29 ministers, down from 39 in the previous administration. Key figures such as François-Philippe Champagne (Finance) and Dominic LeBlanc (US Trade) were retained. Carney's government announced it would not table a full federal budget before the summer, opting for a fall economic statement instead. The new administration's immediate promises include a tax cut and the elimination of all inter-provincial trade barriers by July 1. Carney signed a symbolic decree to lower the first taxable income bracket from 15% to 14%, a measure requiring parliamentary approval. The Liberal party's platform includes additional spending that projects the national deficit for 2025-26 to be $62.3 billion Canadian dollars, an increase from the $42.2 billion forecast in December.\n\nThe relationship with the United States under President Donald Trump was a central theme of the recent Canadian election. Trump had made public remarks about absorbing Canada into the U.S. and imposed tariffs on Canadian goods. In response, Prime Minister Carney stated his government would 'relentlessly' protect Canadian sovereignty and work to define a new economic and security relationship with Washington. After the election, Carney met with Trump but did not secure a removal of the U.S. tariffs. Carney has stated he will maintain Canadian tariffs on U.S. products as long as American tariffs remain in place. The new Canadian cabinet has been explicitly tasked with focusing on Canada-U.S. relations and resolving trade disputes.\n\nPolling data from the period leading up to the April 28, 2025, snap election showed a significant shift in public opinion. After trailing by more than 20 points at the start of the year, the Liberal party under Mark Carney experienced a major comeback. A March 23 Ipsos poll reported Carney's approval rating at 48% with 30% disapproval, while Conservative leader Pierre Poilievre had 35% approval and 52% disapproval. Some outlets cited the same poll as showing Carney with a 71% approval rating. An Abacus Data poll from March 24 found the Conservatives with a national lead of 39% to 36% over the Liberals, but found Carney was the preferred choice for Prime Minister over Poilievre, 38% to 34%. The same poll reported that 77% of Canadians held a negative view of U.S. President Donald Trump.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Approximately 6.5 weeks from May 15, 2025 to July 1, 2025",
    "status_quo_outcome": "Yes - Carney likely has a higher approval rating than Trump",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Carney's post-election honeymoon period ends abruptly due to early governing challenges, implementation problems with his promised tax cut, or worsening Canada-US trade disputes. Meanwhile, Trump's approval rating rises or remains stable in the mid-40s. Alternatively, their approval ratings are exactly tied, which also resolves as No.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Carney maintains his honeymoon period through early July, benefiting from his recent electoral victory and positioning as a defender of Canadian sovereignty against Trump's tariffs. His approval remains in the high 40s to mid-50s range typical of new Prime Ministers, while Trump's approval stays in the low-to-mid 40s consistent with his historical pattern.",
    "rationale": "Several factors strongly favor a Yes outcome. First, Carney just became Prime Minister on April 28, 2025, meaning he'll have been in office only about 2 months by July 1. New leaders typically experience a 'honeymoon period' with elevated approval ratings during their first few months. Pre-election polling showed Carney at 48% approval in March, and new PMs often see their ratings rise initially upon taking office. Second, Trump has historically maintained approval ratings in the low-to-mid 40s range, and the ongoing Canada-US trade dispute likely keeps him unpopular. The research shows 77% of Canadians held negative views of Trump in March 2025. Third, Carney has successfully positioned himself as defending Canadian sovereignty against Trump's tariffs, which likely bolsters his domestic support. The structural factors - a new PM in the honeymoon phase versus Trump's established approval pattern - strongly favor Carney having higher approval. However, I'm not forecasting higher probability because 6.5 weeks is enough time for significant changes: Carney could face early governing challenges, scandals, or policy failures, while Trump could experience an approval boost. We also lack current approval data for either leader as of mid-May. The main uncertainty is whether Carney's honeymoon will remain strong through July 1 or begin fading, and whether any major events shift the dynamic. I'm not going lower because the honeymoon effect is well-documented and robust, and it's unlikely to completely dissipate in just 2 months. For me to update upward, I'd need to see current polling showing Carney with strong approval (55%+) and Trump in the low 40s. For me to update downward, I'd need evidence of Carney's approval already dropping significantly or major scandals/crises affecting his government.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney have a higher approval rating than US President Donald Trump on July 1, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nResolution source updates monthly.
