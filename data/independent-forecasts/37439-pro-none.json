    "status_quo_outcome": "No",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Donald Trump, as a private citizen and presidential candidate, does not hold a direct, publicly acknowledged phone call with Vladimir Putin. Campaign advisors and the significant political risks associated with such a call, especially during an election year, prevent it from being seriously pursued or executed. The relatively short one-month window passes without incident.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "A specific event, such as a major international crisis or a development concerning US prisoners in Russia, prompts Donald Trump to seek or accept a phone call with Vladimir Putin. Trump would frame the call as a demonstration of his unique ability to deal with world leaders and solve problems, using it for political advantage. The Kremlin would agree and acknowledge the call to sow discord in US politics and signal a potential shift in relations.",
    "rationale": "My forecast is heavily weighted on the status quo. Direct, publicly acknowledged phone calls between a US presidential candidate (who is a private citizen) and a foreign head of state like Vladimir Putin are exceptionally rare due to diplomatic protocols and immense political risks. Such a call would open Donald Trump to severe criticism for undermining the current administration's foreign policy and could be politically damaging with moderate voters, even if it appeals to his base. The Logan Act, while seldom enforced, provides a legal framework for criticism.\n\nThe requirement for both sides to publicly acknowledge the call significantly raises the stakes and thus lowers the probability. It moves the event from the realm of back-channel communication to a major public statement.\n\nMy probability is not lower than 10% because of Donald Trump's well-established history of unconventional actions and his stated confidence in his personal relationships with world leaders, including Putin. It is plausible that he would see a unique opportunity (e.g., a prisoner swap, a peace overture) as a chance to create a high-impact media event to his political benefit, believing he could weather the subsequent criticism.\n\nMy probability is not higher than 10% because the political calculus for Trump's campaign appears unfavorable. The potential backlash is predictable and severe, while the tangible benefits are less certain. For the call to happen, a very specific and compelling set of circumstances would need to arise that would make both Trump and Putin believe a public, acknowledged call is in their immediate best interests, which is a high bar.\n\nI would increase my forecast upon credible reporting that such a call is being planned or actively considered by either side. I would decrease my forecast if the Trump campaign issued a strong statement ruling out any such contact or if a new event made contact with Putin even more politically toxic.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill Donald Trump and Vladimir Putin speak on the phone with each other before June 15, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nWikipedia: [February 2025 Putin–Trump call](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/February_2025_Putin%E2%80%93Trump_call)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if, after May 12, 2025 and before June 15, 2025, Donald Trump and Vladimir Putin speak on the phone with each other, according to [credible sources](https://www.metaculus.com/faq/#definitions).\n\nBoth sides must acknowledge the phone call took place for it to count. \"Speak on the phone with each other\" is defined as both Trump and Putin, from different physical spaces, orally uttering words intended for the other individual into a telephone or equivalent device, those words being converted into electrical or digital signals in real time, and then transferred to the other individual via telecommunications links, where they are reconverted into sound waves at the other individual's listening device.\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nNo additional information available.\n\nToday is 2025-05-06.\n\nBefore answering you think:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n(e) You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
