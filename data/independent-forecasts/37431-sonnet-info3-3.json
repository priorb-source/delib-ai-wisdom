  "information": "Several factors specific to this recall may influence its duration. Factors that could lead to a longer resolution time include the substantial volume of the product, the long production window, and the product's frozen nature, which means it may remain in consumer freezers for longer periods. Conversely, factors that could shorten the timeline include the recall's limited geographical scope (only New York), the reason being a misbranding/allergen issue rather than pathogen contamination (which typically involves a more complex investigation), and the company's proactive and voluntary initiation of the recall.",

    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "57 days from today (May 5, 2025) until July 1, 2025",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No - the recall remains Active past July 1, 2025",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "The recall remains Active through July 1, 2025. This could occur if the product recovery process takes longer than expected due to the frozen nature of products sitting in consumer freezers, the large volume (64,816 pounds), or the long production window (February 3 to April 22). The FSIS may require more time to verify adequate product recovery or consumer notification before closing the recall.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "The recall is closed before July 1, 2025. This could occur if the limited geographic scope (New York only), voluntary nature of the recall, and allergen-based issue (rather than pathogen contamination) enable faster resolution. The company successfully recovers or accounts for the product, and FSIS determines the recall objectives have been met within 67 days of the initial April 24 issuance.",
    "rationale": "The recall has been active for 11 days as of today. For a YES resolution, it must close within 67 total days from issuance (April 24 to July 1). Historical USDA recall data suggests most recalls take 60-120 days to close, with a typical range of 75-90 days even for allergen recalls. \n\nFavorable factors for faster closure include: (1) the limited geographic scope to New York only, which simplifies recovery efforts; (2) the misbranding/allergen issue rather than pathogen contamination, which typically involves less complex investigations; and (3) the voluntary, proactive nature of the recall suggesting company cooperation.\n\nUnfavorable factors include: (1) the substantial volume of 64,816 pounds; (2) the long production window of 2.5 months increasing distribution complexity; and (3) the frozen nature of the product, meaning it could remain in consumer freezers for extended periods, making recovery verification more difficult.\n\nGiven that we're only 11 days in and need closure in 57 more days, and considering that most recalls of this type take 75-90+ days, the base rate suggests this is somewhat unlikely. The 67-day total window is shorter than typical closure times. However, the favorable factors provide some upside. My forecast is not higher because the base rate for recall closures strongly suggests longer timeframes, and frozen products particularly tend to extend recall durations. My forecast is not lower because the limited scope and allergen nature provide meaningful positive signals. I would update higher if I learned the company had already recovered a significant portion of the product or if FSIS provided indications of expedited review. I would update lower if I learned of complications in the recovery process or if the geographic distribution was actually wider than stated.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill the USDA-posted recall by ACC Central Kitchen LLC of pork bun products issued April 24, 2025 be closed before July 1, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nConsumerAffairs: [Nearly 65,000 pounds of pork buns recalled for undeclared allergen](https://www.consumeraffairs.com/news/nearly-65000-pounds-of-pork-buns-recalled-for-undeclared-allergen-042525.html)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if the status of the recall posted by the U.S. Department of Agriculture’s Food Safety and Inspection Service (FSIS) is changed from Active to Closed on [this page](https://www.fsis.usda.gov/recalls-alerts/acc-central-kitchen-llc-recalls-pork-bun-products-due-misbranding-and-undeclared) before July 1, 2025. If the recall is still shown as Active when the link is accessed by Metaculus on or after July 1, 2025, this question resolves as **No**.\n\n\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nSeveral factors specific to this recall may influence its duration. Factors that could lead to a longer resolution time include the substantial volume of the product, the long production window, and the product's frozen nature, which means it may remain in consumer freezers for longer periods.

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
