  "information": "Dan Osborn, an independent from Nebraska, is exploring a potential run for the U.S. Senate in 2026 against incumbent Republican Pete Ricketts. In early April 2025, Osborn formed an exploratory committee. He previously ran for the Senate in 2024 against Deb Fischer, losing by approximately six percentage points in a race that attracted $14 million in fundraising. Osborn has also launched a political action committee, the Working Class Heroes Fund, aimed at training and supporting working-class candidates for office. In public statements regarding a potential 2026 run, Osborn has framed the race as a choice to \"replace a billionaire with a mechanic.\"\n\nThe incumbent Senator, Pete Ricketts, is expected to seek re-election in 2026. Former President Donald Trump endorsed Ricketts for his reelection bid on April 11, 2025, calling Osborn a \"Radical Left Open Border Extremist\" while praising Ricketts. Ricketts is the seventh richest member of Congress and has a significant political and financial operation in Nebraska. Osborn runs as an independent but received support from the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee during his 2024 campaign.\n\nHistorical data shows that Senate exploratory committees often last three to six months before a formal campaign launch. Many candidates for the 2026 cycle in other states, such as Andy Barr in Kentucky and Haley Stevens in Michigan, announced their candidacies in April 2025. In his previous 2024 Senate run, Osborn formally announced his candidacy in July 2023, approximately 16 months before the election. A similar timeline for the 2026 race would place his announcement in June or July of 2025. Osborn himself has publicly stated that he will \"decide by early summer.\"",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Approximately five weeks, as the deadline is June 1, 2025.",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No. As of today, Dan Osborn has formed an exploratory committee but has not formally announced his candidacy for the US Senate.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Dan Osborn follows a timeline similar to his 2024 campaign or the typical duration of an exploratory committee (3-6 months), and officially announces his candidacy in June or July 2025, after the resolution date for this question.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Pressured by the need for early fundraising against a wealthy incumbent and aiming to capitalize on current media attention, Osborn decides to formally launch his campaign in May 2025, following the trend of other early 2026 announcements.",
    "rationale": "My forecast of 40% leans towards a 'No' outcome, as several key indicators point to an announcement after the June 1, 2025 deadline. The status quo is that Osborn has not yet announced. The strongest evidence is precedent from Osborn's own 2024 Senate run, where he announced in July 2023, approximately 16 months before the election. A similar timeline for the 2026 race would place his announcement in July 2025. Furthermore, his own public statement that he will 'decide by early summer' is a significant factor. While 'early summer' is ambiguous, the season doesn't officially begin until the solstice in late June, suggesting a decision date after the question's deadline. Finally, his exploratory committee, formed in early April, would have a relatively short two-month run if he were to announce in May, whereas such committees often last three to six months to fully assess viability. The 'No' outcome represents the more conventional and patient political strategy.\n\nHowever, the probability is not lower because there are compelling strategic reasons for an early announcement. The incumbent, Pete Ricketts, is extremely wealthy and has already secured a key endorsement from Donald Trump. To be competitive, Osborn needs to start fundraising as early as possible. Announcing before June 1 would allow him to capitalize on the current news cycle and begin building financial momentum. The fact that other 2026 candidates in other states have already announced in April 2025 sets a precedent for an accelerated timeline. Therefore, a 40% probability reflects the significant chance that strategic necessity will override Osborn's past behavior and conventional timelines.\n\nMy forecast would increase if Osborn scheduled a major press event for May or if there were credible reports of a planned May announcement. It would decrease if his campaign publicly emphasized taking a 'deliberate' approach or if May passed with no signaling of an imminent launch.",
