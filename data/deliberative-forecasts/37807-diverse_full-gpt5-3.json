    "review": "Both forecasters emphasize bureaucratic inertia, cross-office/legal review to avoid misrepresenting current law, and the short 6-week window—points broadly consistent with my prior thinking. Forecaster 2 adds a useful operational detail: even ‘simple’ website edits usually touch multiple USDA teams, which dampens the likelihood of a quick, cosmetic change. Forecaster 3 underscores the base-rate and legal oddity of removing an item that remains eligible nationally. I still see the main downside risk as an optics-driven, editorial tweak that omits the exact phrase “snack foods” without asserting a prohibition. Their arguments shift me slightly upward on the inertia/oversight side, but they don’t eliminate the messaging-risk channel I flagged.",
    "rationale": "Baseline: The law and national policy haven’t changed; state waivers are future-dated. Historically, the page language has been stable and includes “snack foods.” Changing it now would risk confusion and scrutiny if it implies restrictions that don’t yet exist. The reorg in late May could catalyze web edits, but those typically undergo review to ensure legal accuracy. Importantly for resolution, a ‘No’ only requires the exact phrase to disappear, even if the page remains legally accurate—so a cosmetic wording change is the primary threat. Weighing: • For Yes—status quo law, cross-office review, reputational risk of confusion, short timeline. • For No—political signaling incentive, technical ease of web edits, possible site refresh during reorg. Net: I moderately increase my probability toward the others’ range, reflecting added weight on bureaucratic checks vs. the six-week horizon. I would move higher if we pass early/mid-June without any SNAP webpage refresh or if USDA communications explicitly reaffirm current national eligibility pending formal rulemaking. I would move lower on signs of a SNAP web redesign or a coordinated comms push framing ‘junk food’ changes as imminent, even without legal effect.",
