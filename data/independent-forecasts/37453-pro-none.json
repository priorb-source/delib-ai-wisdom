  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Less than 2 months.",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No. The Alberta government continues its current strategy of asserting provincial autonomy within Canada and does not announce an independence referendum.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "The Government of Alberta continues to focus on its 'Sovereignty Act' and other political conflicts with the federal government, but stops short of calling a referendum on independence. The government decides the political and economic risks are too high, and public support is insufficient. The July 1, 2025 deadline passes without an announcement.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "A severe and unexpected political crisis erupts between Alberta and the federal government, such as Ottawa using its disallowance power on a key piece of provincial legislation. In response to a massive public outcry and pressure from her base, Premier Danielle Smith makes a surprise announcement, scheduling an independence referendum as a high-stakes negotiating tactic or a genuine move toward separation.",
    "rationale": "My forecast is very low. The primary reasons are the extremely short timeframe, the current political strategy of the Alberta government, and the lack of a sufficient catalyst. With less than two months until the deadline, there is very little time to lay the political groundwork for such a momentous decision. Premier Danielle Smith's United Conservative Party government has pursued a strategy of 'sovereignty within a united Canada,' aiming to increase provincial autonomy without the immense risks of a separation campaign. This approach satisfies the party's base without alienating moderate voters or causing economic instability. Calling a referendum would be a radical departure from this established path. Furthermore, polling has consistently shown that support for independence is a minority position, making a referendum a high-risk gamble for the government. My forecast is not zero because the political climate is volatile and a severe, unforeseen conflict with Ottawa—a 'black swan' event—could theoretically trigger this outcome. It is not higher because the political, economic, and practical barriers to announcing a referendum in the next seven weeks are immense. I would increase my forecast if polling showed a sudden surge in separatist support to over 50% or if the federal government took an unprecedentedly hostile action against Alberta's core interests.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nBefore July 1, 2025, will the government of Alberta officially announce a date for an independence referendum?\n\nQuestion background:\nPolitico: [The quiet threat to Canadian unity isn’t Quebec — it’s Alberta](https://www.politico.com/news/2025/04/27/the-quiet-threat-to-canadian-unity-isnt-quebec-its-alberta-00311719)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if, before July 1, 2025, a referendum on the independence of Alberta from Canada is officially scheduled. If this does not occur before that date, this question resolves as **No**.\n\nFor purposes of this question, the referendum will be considered \"officially scheduled\" when it is announced by a person or entity with the authority to do so within Alberta. Please note that broader legality, such as within Canada, will be considered irrelevant for this question, so if the federal government declared the referendum illegal, the question would still resolve as Yes.\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nNo additional information available.\n\nToday is 2025-05-07.\n\nBefore answering you think:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n(e) You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
