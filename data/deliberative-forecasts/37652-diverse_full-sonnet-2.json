    "review": "Both forecasters make compelling arguments centered on the honeymoon effect for new leaders. Forecaster 2's emphasis on the exceptionally short 6-week timeframe is particularly persuasive - honeymoon effects very rarely dissipate within the first two months. Forecaster 3 provides valuable balance by noting risks like the lack of concrete policy wins and potential economic impacts from tariffs, plus the important detail that ties resolve as No. However, I find Forecaster 2's point about the short timeframe more decisive - economic pain from tariffs and the absence of delivered promises typically erode approval after 3-4 months, not 6 weeks. The combination of a brand-new PM in honeymoon phase versus Trump's historically hard ceiling in the low-to-mid 40s creates a strong baseline favoring Yes.",
    "rationale": "After reviewing both analyses, I'm updating my forecast modestly upward. The key insight I'm weighing more heavily is the exceptionally short timeframe to July 1 - just 6-7 weeks from Carney's election victory. Research on honeymoon effects shows they're remarkably robust in the first 60 days, and the risks Forecaster 3 identifies (tariff economic impacts, lack of concrete wins) typically manifest over 3-4 months, not 6 weeks. Trump's historical approval pattern - stable in the low 40s with a hard ceiling around 45% - combined with 77% negative Canadian views of him, provides a strong baseline. The main downside risks remain: ties resolve as No, we lack current May polling data, and an unexpected crisis could shift dynamics quickly. However, the short timeframe and strong honeymoon base rates tilt the probabilities more toward Yes than my initial 72% captured. I'm not going as high as 85% because genuine uncertainties remain around current approval levels and the possibility of a tied/rounded result.",
