  "information": "The SPÖ is the incumbent party governing Vienna and is noted to have a well-established and entrenched local party organization.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Approximately 6 months. The 2025 Viennese state election is expected to occur in October 2025, based on the typical 5-year electoral cycle (the previous election was in October 2020).",
    "status_quo_outcome": "The SPÖ continues to win the most seats in Vienna, maintaining its decades-long dominance of Vienna city politics. The SPÖ has governed Vienna continuously since 1945, making it one of the longest-running party dominances in any major European city.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "The FPÖ (Freedom Party) or ÖVP (People's Party) capitalizes on national political trends and wins a plurality of seats. This could occur through: a major SPÖ scandal emerging before the election; the FPÖ successfully mobilizing voters on migration and cost-of-living issues as they have nationally; or consolidation of opposition votes around a single challenger that fragments the SPÖ's traditional coalition.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "The SPÖ leverages its well-established local organization and incumbent advantage to maintain plurality support. The party successfully addresses local concerns around housing and public services, while the opposition remains fragmented across multiple parties. The SPÖ's deep roots in Vienna's working-class districts and public sector employment base provide a stable voting foundation.",
    "rationale": "Vienna has been a SPÖ stronghold for 80 years, representing one of the most stable political environments in Europe. My research assistant confirms the SPÖ has a well-established and entrenched local party organization, which is crucial for electoral success. The March 2025 polling data suggests the race dynamics are established with 6 months remaining.\n\nFactors supporting a high probability: The incumbency advantage is substantial in Vienna; the SPÖ's organizational infrastructure is unmatched; Vienna's electorate skews urban and left-leaning; historical precedent strongly favors continuity.\n\nFactors preventing a higher forecast: Six months is sufficient time for significant movement; national political trends in Austria have shown rising FPÖ support; local governance challenges around housing affordability and integration could erode support; the polling reference doesn't provide specific numbers to confirm a commanding lead.\n\nFactors preventing a lower forecast: Breaking 80 years of SPÖ dominance would require extraordinary circumstances; no evidence of such a dramatic shift is indicated; the 'entrenched' characterization suggests structural advantages that transcend temporary political winds.\n\nTo update higher (toward 85%+): Recent polls showing SPÖ with a 10+ point lead; strong SPÖ performance in municipal by-elections; evidence of opposition fragmentation. To update lower (toward 55%): Polls showing a tight race or SPÖ trailing; emergence of a major scandal; evidence of successful opposition consolidation; dramatic shifts in voter priorities that disadvantage the SPÖ.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill the Social Democratic Party of Austria win the most seats in the 2025 Viennese state election?\n\nQuestion background:\nSee for example election polls at [Vienna: Poll by IFDD from 24.03.2025](https://politpro.eu/en/austria/polls/63413/ifdd/2025-03-24)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if the Social Democratic Party of Austria wins a plurality of seats in the [2025 Viennese state election](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2025_Viennese_state_election).\n\n\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nThe SPÖ is the incumbent party governing Vienna and is noted to have a well-established and entrenched local party organization.\n\nToday is 2025-04-21.\n\nBefore answering you think:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n(e) You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
