    "review": "Forecaster 2 provides the most compelling new evidence: actual empirical analysis of NUFORC's database for the past 12 months, finding only ONE South American pilot report (Argentina, June 2024). This directly contradicts my assumption of reports occurring every 2-4 months. I initially misinterpreted the question background - the Brazil December 2024 sighting was likely not from a pilot specifically, just a general sighting. Forecaster 3's reasoning aligns with Forecaster 2's data, estimating 1-2 reports annually. Both correctly emphasize NUFORC's US-centric nature and the language/reporting-channel barriers for South American pilots. The key insight I missed was doing the empirical work - I relied on speculation rather than checking the actual historical frequency. Forecaster 2's base rate of ~8.3% (1/12 months) is grounded in data, while my 35% was speculative and clearly too high.",
    "rationale": "The empirical evidence from Forecaster 2 is decisive. With only one South American pilot report in the past 12 months, the base rate is approximately 8.3% per month. My original 35% forecast was based on unfounded assumptions about frequency. However, I'm adjusting slightly above the pure base rate (8%) to account for: (1) limited sample size uncertainty - one year of data might not capture the true rate, (2) the June 2024 Argentina report creates weak evidence that June might not be disadvantageous, and (3) marginally increasing global UAP awareness. But these factors only warrant a modest increase above 8%. The conjunction of requirements (pilot + South America + NUFORC specifically + June timing + posted by July 1) remains constraining. I'm settling on 11% - higher than the strict base rate to account for uncertainty, but dramatically lower than my initial forecast given the empirical evidence.",
