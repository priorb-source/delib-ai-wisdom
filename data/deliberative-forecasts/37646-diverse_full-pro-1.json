    "review": "I have reviewed the analyses from two other forecasters. My initial forecast of 35% was positioned between their forecasts of 28% and 42%. Forecaster 2 (28%) compellingly argues that the historical base rate for African rollouts (~4 months) and Somalia's significant, specific operational challenges (security, logistics, payments) make the short 2.5-month timeline highly improbable. They correctly diminish the relevance of the rapid Bangladesh rollout by contrasting its stable environment with Somalia's. Forecaster 3 (42%) presents a stronger bull case, highlighting a potential '2025 cadence' of faster activations, Musk's public commitment, and diplomatic tailwinds. While these points are valid considerations for why this launch *could* be faster than average, I find they are likely outweighed by the concrete, on-the-ground friction in Somalia.",
    "rationale": "After deliberation, I am updating my forecast downward. My initial analysis attempted to balance the political momentum against the operational realities. Forecaster 2's reasoning has convinced me to place more weight on the operational hurdles. The argument that Somalia's high-friction environment—with its security risks and logistical complexities—makes it a poor comparison to the fast Bangladesh rollout is critical. The precedents set in Nigeria and Rwanda, which are arguably less complex environments than Somalia and still took approximately four months, are more relevant benchmarks. One month has already passed since the license was granted with no change on the availability map, shrinking the remaining window to about six weeks. The 'hard' challenges of hardware importation, distribution, and payment processing are more likely to dictate the timeline than the 'soft' factor of public announcements. For these reasons, I now believe the probability of Starlink becoming 'Available' in Somalia before the July 1, 2025 deadline is lower than I initially assessed. I am adjusting my forecast from 35% down to 30%.",
