  "information": "On May 2, 2025, President Trump signed an executive order to stop all federal funding for National Public Radio (NPR) and the Public Broadcasting Service (PBS). The order directs the Corporation for Public Broadcasting (CPB) Board of Directors and all executive departments and agencies to cease federal financial support. The order requires the CPB Board to ensure its licensees and permittees do not use Federal funds for NPR and PBS. The White House stated the action was taken because the networks allegedly spread 'radical propaganda.' As of May 16, 2025, the Project 2025 Tracker still listed the objective as 'in progress.'\n\nThe Corporation for Public Broadcasting (CPB) has filed a lawsuit challenging the executive order, asserting that it is a private nonprofit corporation independent of federal executive control and not subject to the President's authority. The CPB's funding is allocated by Congress two years in advance; it has received $535 million for the current fiscal year, which provides funding through September 30, 2027. Following the executive order, the CPB notified affiliated stations that funding could be halted but simultaneously announced its legal challenge.\n\nThe executive action has prompted debate in Congress. Some Republican senators, including Lisa Murkowski of Alaska, have expressed support for public media, citing the importance of local programming and emergency alerts in rural communities. Federal funding is considered crucial for many local stations, with some receiving up to 25% of their annual revenues from the federal government. According to their respective CEOs, about 15% of the public network's budget comes from public funds for PBS, while NPR receives less than 5% of its budget from the CPB.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Approximately 6 weeks remain until July 1, 2025",
    "status_quo_outcome": "The objective remains marked as 'in progress' on the Project 2025 Tracker spreadsheet through July 1, 2025, resulting in a No resolution",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "The tracker maintainers continue viewing this objective as incomplete because the executive order faces an active legal challenge from the CPB, federal funding continues to flow to public broadcasting through the existing Congressional appropriation (which extends through September 2027), and the actual cessation of funding remains uncertain. They await concrete implementation before marking it complete.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "The tracker maintainers decide that signing the executive order on May 2, 2025, constitutes completion of the policy objective from the administration's perspective, regardless of legal challenges or implementation status. They update the spreadsheet to mark this objective as 'complete' based on the President having taken definitive executive action to stop funding.",
    "rationale": "The most telling evidence is temporal: President Trump signed the executive order to stop NPR/PBS funding on May 2, 2025, yet as of May 16, 2025 (14 days later), the tracker still marks this objective as 'in progress.' This delay strongly suggests the tracker maintainers are applying a standard that requires more than just signing an executive order - they likely want to see actual implementation or at least clear inevitability of the policy outcome. Several factors support maintaining 'in progress' status: (1) CPB has filed a legal challenge asserting presidential authority doesn't extend to their independent corporation, (2) funding is Congressionally appropriated through September 2027 and continues flowing, (3) some Republican senators oppose the action, and (4) the legal and political outcome remains highly uncertain. The tracker operators appear to be waiting for definitive evidence that funding has actually stopped or will inevitably stop. With only 6 weeks remaining and legal challenges typically taking months or years to resolve, it's unlikely the situation will reach the clarity needed for a 'complete' designation. However, there's a non-trivial chance (perhaps 25%) that the maintainers could decide the executive order itself satisfies the objective, focusing on what the administration attempted rather than successful implementation. My forecast is not higher because the 14-day delay after the executive order strongly indicates they want more evidence of implementation. It's not lower because there's reasonable probability they could reinterpret their criteria to emphasize executive action taken rather than outcome achieved, especially if they view their role as tracking administration attempts rather than successful policy changes.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill the Project 2025 Tracker spreadsheet have the objective of stopping funding for NPR and PBS marked as complete before July 1, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nAt the time of this question, the objective was marked as \"in progress.\" The 2025 Tracker is a project of the Keep_Track subreddit and is explained [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/Keep_Track/comments/1ii7tbr/project_2025_tracker_is_now_live/).\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if the Project 2025 objective to \"stop funding for NPR and PBS\" is marked as complete according to [this spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1QGG6wNHna-1tt91yXNkOauAJJ7snobFjfEnmxlmzhl4/edit?gid=0#gid=0) before July 1, 2025.

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower.
