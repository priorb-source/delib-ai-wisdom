    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "16 days",
    "status_quo_outcome": "Yes",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Despite receiving five nominations, Chris Stapleton is shut out at the awards ceremony. In each category, another artist with a particularly strong album, single, or overall year's performance edges him out. This could be due to a 'sweep' by another major artist like Luke Combs or Lainey Wilson, or voters choosing to spread the awards among different artists, coincidentally leaving Stapleton without a win.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "With five nominations in major categories, Chris Stapleton wins at least one award. His album 'Higher' and his consistent touring success and critical acclaim resonate with Academy voters, leading him to win in a category he has historically performed well in, such as Male Artist of the Year or Album of the Year.",
    "rationale": "My forecast is based primarily on Chris Stapleton's consistent history of winning at the ACM Awards and the statistical advantage of having multiple nominations. Stapleton is a perennial favorite among both critics and industry voters, as evidenced by his multiple wins at the 59th ACM Awards in 2024, including Album of the Year and Male Artist of the Year. The status quo is that an artist of his stature and critical acclaim consistently translates nominations into wins.\n\nHaving five nominations significantly increases the probability of winning at least one award. While he may not be the frontrunner in every single category, he only needs to win one for the question to resolve as 'Yes'. This is a much lower bar than winning a specific, competitive category like Entertainer of the Year. The probability of losing all five distinct categories is substantially lower than the probability of losing any single one.\n\nMy forecast is not higher because the country music field is highly competitive with other popular and critically acclaimed artists who are also likely nominated and could have a 'sweep' year. Voter fatigue, where voters opt to reward newer or different artists, is a real possibility that prevents this from being a certainty.\n\nMy forecast is not lower because Stapleton's track record is exceptionally strong, and it is rare for an artist with five nominations and his level of industry respect to be completely shut out. His vocal talent and songwriting are consistently lauded, making him a safe and respected choice for voters. For me to lower the forecast, I would need to see significant momentum and industry buzz coalescing around a single competitor in all the major categories Stapleton is nominated in. Conversely, I would raise the probability if key competitors were to face negative press or if precursor awards overwhelmingly favored Stapleton.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill Chris Stapleton win an award at the 60th Academy of Country Music Awards?\n\nQuestion background:\nThe awards are scheduled to be held on May 8, 2025. Stapleton has 5 nominations.\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if Chris Stapleton wins an award at the [60th Academy of Country Music Awards](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/60th_Academy_of_Country_Music_Awards).\n\n\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nNo additional information available.\n\nToday is 2025-04-22.\n\nBefore answering you think:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n(e) You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
