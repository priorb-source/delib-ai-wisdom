    "review": "Forecaster 2 raises an important point I underweighted: Osborn's existing infrastructure and name recognition from his 2024 race could significantly accelerate the exploratory timeline compared to a first-time candidate. The 6-8 week exploratory period argument has merit for someone who already knows the landscape. However, I find Forecaster 2's 65% too optimistic - if the exploratory committee formed in early April and we're only 20 days in, reaching a decision in the next 38 days (total ~58 days) would still be on the very fast end of the typical 3-6 month range. Forecaster 3's status quo bias argument is compelling and something I should have emphasized more strongly. The Trump endorsement of Ricketts on April 11 is relevant new information that clarifies race dynamics. However, Forecaster 3's 40% seems slightly high given that Osborn explicitly said 'early summer' - which naturally means June-July, AFTER the June 1 cutoff. Both forecasters acknowledge it's extremely early (18-19 months before November 2026), which reinforces that there's no urgency to announce before June 1.",
    "rationale": "After deliberation, I'm making a modest upward adjustment from 30% to 35%. The infrastructure advantage from Osborn's 2024 campaign is more significant than I initially weighted - he doesn't need to build everything from scratch, which could shorten the typical exploratory timeline. The 38 remaining days provides meaningful decision-making time. However, several factors prevent me from moving higher: (1) Osborn's own 'early summer' language most naturally refers to June-July, after the resolution date; (2) His 2024 race announcement came in July 2023, suggesting a preference for summer announcements; (3) Only ~20 days have elapsed since forming the exploratory committee - a 58-day total timeline would be unusually compressed even with existing infrastructure; (4) Strong status quo bias - he hasn't announced yet and most exploratory phases extend 3-6 months; (5) At 18 months before the election, there's no compelling reason to rush. The most likely scenario remains a June-July announcement, just after the June 1 deadline.",
