  "information": "Ramzan Kadyrov met with Russian President Vladimir Putin on May 7, 2025. Following the meeting, Kadyrov stated he received \"full understanding and support,\" and Russian state media reported that Putin praised the Chechen Republic's achievements. This is not the first time Kadyrov has publicly discussed stepping down; similar statements were made in 2016, 2020, and 2022, none of which resulted in his departure. The authority to appoint or dismiss the Head of the Chechen Republic rests exclusively with the President of Russia. Kadyrov has held the position since April 2007.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Less than one month. The question resolves on June 1, 2025.",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No. Ramzan Kadyrov remains the head of the Chechen Republic.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Ramzan Kadyrov's statement about wanting to step down proves to be political maneuvering, similar to his previous statements in 2016, 2020, and 2022. Following his recent meeting with and endorsement from Vladimir Putin, he remains in his position past the June 1, 2025 deadline.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "A sudden, acute health crisis incapacitates or kills Ramzan Kadyrov, forcing his removal from the post. Alternatively, in a much less likely scenario, Vladimir Putin abruptly reverses his recent endorsement and removes Kadyrov from power.",
    "rationale": "My forecast is based on the strong precedent for the status quo. Ramzan Kadyrov has served as Head of the Chechen Republic since 2007, and powerful incumbents in such political systems rarely leave office unexpectedly. The research provided indicates a clear pattern: Kadyrov has publicly floated the idea of stepping down on at least three prior occasions (2016, 2020, 2022) without ever doing so. These statements are best interpreted as political theater to gauge loyalty, project humility, or extract concessions from the Kremlin, rather than genuine declarations of intent. The most critical piece of recent evidence is his May 7, 2025, meeting with Vladimir Putin, which resulted in a public endorsement from the Russian President. As Putin holds the sole authority to dismiss Kadyrov, this explicit support makes a politically motivated departure in the next three weeks exceptionally unlikely. The primary driver for a 'Yes' outcome is a non-political, unpredictable event, namely a severe health crisis, given persistent but unconfirmed rumors about his health. My probability is not lower than 3% to account for this small but non-zero chance of a sudden health event. My probability is not higher because the timeline is extremely short, and all political indicators, especially the recent Kremlin endorsement and Kadyrov's own history of similar statements, overwhelmingly point towards him remaining in power. I would increase my forecast upon receiving credible, multi-sourced reports of his sudden hospitalization or a public statement from the Kremlin indicating a change in his status. Conversely, I would lower my forecast if he makes further public appearances appearing to be in good health.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill Ramzan Kadyrov cease to be head of the Chechen Republic before June 1, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nThe Moscow Times: [Kadyrov Says He Wants to Step Down as Chechen Leader](https://www.themoscowtimes.com/2025/05/06/kadyrov-says-he-wants-to-step-down-as-chechen-leader-a88991)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below.

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
