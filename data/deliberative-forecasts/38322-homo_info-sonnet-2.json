    "review": "Forecaster 2 provides the critical piece of information I was missing: the May 2025 final reading was 52.2, which is already 1.8 points below the 54.0 threshold. This completely changes the question from 'will sentiment fall to extreme lows?' to 'will sentiment remain depressed or recover modestly?' This is a much different analytical frame. Forecaster 2's observation about the Conference Board confidence jumping significantly (85.7 to 98) and the intra-month improvement in May (50.8 preliminary to 52.2 final) are important countervailing signals. Forecaster 3's historical context is helpful but seems to miss the key fact that we're already below 54.0. Both forecasters appropriately emphasize that only a 3.4% increase is needed to cross the threshold, which normal monthly volatility could easily produce. Forecaster 2's 68% for Yes seems well-reasoned given status quo persistence, though the Conference Board data and small gap size suggest some risk of recovery.",
    "rationale": "I significantly underestimated the probability because I didn't realize we already have May's final reading of 52.2, which is below the 54.0 threshold. The question is not whether sentiment will crater, but whether it will stay depressed or recover modestly. Key factors supporting a Yes outcome (staying below 54.0): (1) Status quo is 52.2, and good forecasters weight continuity heavily; (2) Downward trend through early 2025; (3) Persistent structural concerns about tariffs affecting 75% of consumers; (4) Economic expectations at 47.9 are very weak. Key factors supporting a No outcome (recovery above 54.0): (1) Only needs 1.8 point increase - well within normal monthly volatility; (2) May showed resilience with intra-month improvement from 50.8 to 52.2; (3) Conference Board confidence jumped dramatically, suggesting consumer psychology may be stabilizing; (4) Sentiment at such depressed levels historically tends to mean-revert. The small gap to the threshold creates meaningful uncertainty despite the status quo being below it. I'm settling on 58% for Yes, weighing status quo persistence against the ease of modest recovery and mixed signals from other indicators.",
