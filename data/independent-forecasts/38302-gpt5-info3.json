  "information": "Specific components influencing China's inflation data include energy and food prices. Brent crude oil averaged $84 in May 2025, a 4% increase from a year earlier. However, the year-on-year change in domestic energy prices remained negative. Pork prices, a key component of the food basket, also remained lower than a year ago due to high inventories. On the policy front, the People's Bank of China implemented a 10 basis point reserve requirement ratio (RRR) cut in mid-May.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Roughly 1–2 weeks (NBS May CPI typically releases around June 10–12; FRED updates shortly after).",
    "status_quo_outcome": "Yes — China’s May 2025 CPI YoY remains negative, extending the deflation streak.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Services and travel prices spike during the May Day holiday, core inflation firms, and energy turns less negative or slightly positive year-on-year; combined with favorable base effects, headline CPI prints at or above 0.0% YoY.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Food deflation (especially pork) persists, domestic energy prices stay negative YoY despite higher Brent, and core remains tepid; headline CPI comes in below 0.0% YoY again.",
    "rationale": "- Baseline/status quo: China has posted several consecutive months of negative YoY CPI into April, and the news backdrop (weak domestic demand, ongoing goods price weakness) supports continuity. In forecasting, I overweight persistence unless there’s strong evidence of a regime change.\n- Components: The research assistant notes that pork prices remain below year-ago levels due to high inventories, and domestic energy prices are still negative YoY. These are key drags on headline CPI. While Brent averaged about 4% higher YoY in May, China’s consumer energy categories are partially regulated and often adjust with lags and caps, so the direct pass-through can be muted and slow.\n- Core vs headline: Core inflation has been modestly positive in recent months, but not strong enough to offset food and energy deflation. The May Day holiday could lift services prices, but similar holiday effects existed last year, tempering net YoY impact.\n- Policy: The mid-May 10 bps RRR cut is supportive for credit but is unlikely to meaningfully affect May consumer prices on such a short timeline.\n- Base effects: May 2024 CPI was low, which slightly raises the bar for a negative print in May 2025. That said, with pork and domestic energy still negative YoY and core subdued, a small negative remains more likely than a clean move back to positive.\nWhy not higher: Holiday-driven services strength and slightly higher oil prices could push the headline to flat or marginally positive, especially given low bases.\nWhy not lower: The persistence of food and energy deflation and recent negative prints point to another sub-0 reading, but improving external conditions and any rebound in services limit confidence in a deeply negative outcome.\nWhat would move me: I would raise the probability if high-frequency data show continued declines in pork and fuel prices into late May/early June, or if PPI remains deeply negative, signaling weak pass-through. I would lower it if transport, accommodation, and dining prices show strong YoY gains around the holiday, or if domestic fuel price adjustments turned clearly positive YoY.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill China experience a 4th month in a row of deflation in its May CPI report?\n\nQuestion background:\nSCMP: [China’s consumer prices fall in April, fuelling fears of deflation](https://www.scmp.com/economy/economic-indicators/article/3309834/chinas-consumer-prices-fall-april-fuelling-fears-deflation)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if the \"Percent Change from Year Ago, Not Seasonally Adjusted\" data presented at [FRED Consumer Price Indices (CPIs, HICPs), COICOP 1999: Consumer Price Index: Total for China (CHNCPIALLMINMEI)](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/CHNCPIALLMINMEI#) is negative for May 2025.\n\n\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nSpecific components influencing China's inflation data include energy and food prices. Brent crude oil averaged $84 in May 2025, a 4% increase from a year earlier. However, the year-on-year change in domestic energy prices remained negative. Pork prices, a key component of the food basket, also remained lower than a year ago due to high inventories.

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
