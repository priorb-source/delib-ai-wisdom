    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Approximately two weeks. The election is scheduled for April 28, 2025, and official results are typically confirmed within a few days of the polls closing.",
    "status_quo_outcome": "The People's National Movement (PNM) is the current governing party, having won a narrow majority of 22 out of 41 seats in the 2020 general election. The status quo is a PNM-led government.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "The opposition party, the United National Congress (UNC), successfully capitalizes on public discontent over high crime rates and economic pressures, flipping several key marginal constituencies to win a plurality of seats.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "The incumbent PNM leverages the advantages of incumbency, including targeted government spending and a campaign focused on stability, to defend its hold on crucial marginal seats and secure a plurality, continuing as the governing party.",
    "rationale": "My forecast is based on an analysis of the fundamentals of Trinidad and Tobago's political system, heavily favoring the status quo while acknowledging the competitive nature of the election. The PNM, as the incumbent party, holds a significant advantage. They control the narrative and state resources, which can be crucial in a close election. The political landscape is a deeply entrenched two-party system dominated by the PNM and the UNC, with electoral outcomes often decided by narrow margins in a handful of swing constituencies. The 2020 election result of 22-19 underscores this volatility. Key voter concerns, such as crime and the cost of living, represent significant vulnerabilities for the incumbent government, creating a clear path to victory for the UNC if they can effectively mobilize voters on these issues. As the research assistant's report provided no specific polling data or late-breaking information, I must weigh the strong advantage of incumbency against the documented closeness of past elections. I place the probability slightly above 50% to reflect the PNM's incumbent edge. My forecast is not higher because the narrow margin of the previous election and persistent national challenges make a UNC victory highly plausible. It is not lower because overcoming an incumbent party in a stable two-party system is a difficult task that requires a significant shift in voter sentiment, for which there is currently no specific evidence. I would increase the probability for the PNM with reliable polling showing them with a clear lead in marginal seats. Conversely, I would decrease the probability if late polls showed a surge for the UNC or if a major scandal impacting the PNM government were to emerge before election day.",
