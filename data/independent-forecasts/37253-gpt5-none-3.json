    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "About 61 days (until July 1, 2025)",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No test occurs (status quo persists).",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "North Korea continues missile launches, rhetoric, and satellite/engine tests but refrains from an underground nuclear detonation at Punggye‑ri; China quietly discourages a test; no clear pre-test site activity (e.g., portal sealing, cable-laying) is observed by reputable monitors; the IMS detects no event.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "North Korea conducts a 7th nuclear test at Punggye‑ri (likely Tunnel 3), detected by the IMS and confirmed by governments/CTBTO; pre-test indicators appear in commercial satellite imagery (vehicle convoys, construction completion, site closure), and DPRK frames it as validating a tactical/miniaturized warhead or new physics package.",
    "rationale": "- Baseline and recent behavior: The last DPRK nuclear test was in Sept 2017. Despite years of speculation and apparent site restoration since 2022, no test has occurred. The base rate over the last 7+ years is effectively zero. With only ~2 months left, the time window is short, which pushes the probability down absent strong fresh indicators.\n- Incentives and constraints: Reasons for a test exist (validate tactical/compact warheads, signal resolve, leverage in diplomacy, closer ties with Russia reducing costs). But countervailing pressures remain: China’s consistent opposition to tests near its border, risk of tighter sanctions or regional military responses, and the fact that DPRK has demonstrated nuclear capability already; it can signal through frequent missile launches instead.\n- Seasonal/timing considerations: DPRK has tested in various months (including May 2009), so timing is possible, but there is no consistent seasonal pattern strong enough to materially raise odds within the next 61 days.\n- Signals as of now: No additional information from the assistant suggests there are no widely reported imminent-test indicators (e.g., 38 North/CSIS reporting of tunnel sealing and instrumentation, KCNA hints of a major ‘event,’ or allied warnings). In the absence of such cues, the status quo (no test) deserves extra weight.\n- Why not higher? Long stretch without testing, short remaining window, and lack of specific pre-test signals keep the odds modest.\n- Why not lower? The site has reportedly been maintained in recent years; DPRK leadership is unpredictable and may see value in demonstrating new warhead designs. A sudden political or technical trigger could prompt a rapid test.\n- What would move me up materially: Credible satellite imagery of Punggye‑ri showing final test preparations (portal sealing, cable runs, increased vehicle traffic/earth-moving), state-media foreshadowing a ‘decisive’ strategic step, allied public warnings of imminent test, or CTBTO/IMS detecting unusual precursors.\n- What would move me down: Clear indications of Chinese pressure or inducements against testing, renewed DPRK statements signaling a testing pause, or credible analytic reporting that key tunnels are not test-ready.\nGiven the short horizon and lack of imminent-test indicators, I put extra weight on the status quo and assign a low but non-negligible probability.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill North Korea test a nuclear weapon before July 1, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nAccording to Wikipedia, \"North Korea has conducted six nuclear tests, in 2006, 2009, 2013, twice in 2016, and in 2017.\"\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if before July 1, 2025, North Korea tests a nuclear weapon, according to [credible source](https://www.metaculus.com/help/faq/#definitions) reporting such as the [International Monitoring System’s ](https://www.ctbto.org/our-work/detecting-nuclear-tests) and the sources cited at Wikipedia's [List of nuclear weapons tests of North Korea](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_nuclear_weapons_tests_of_North_Korea).\n\n\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nNo additional information available.\n\nToday is 2025-05-01.\n\nBefore answering you think:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n(e) You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
