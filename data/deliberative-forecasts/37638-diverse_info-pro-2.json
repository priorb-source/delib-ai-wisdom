    "review": "The other forecasters provided excellent points that clarified the key variables. Forecaster 2's analysis aligns closely with my initial assessment, adding crucial details about the compressed timeline (12 days), Governor Abbott's priorities, and strong public/veteran opposition. These points strengthen the case for a 'No' outcome. Forecaster 3 makes a compelling, albeit much more bullish, case for 'Yes' by focusing on the power of Lieutenant Governor Dan Patrick and the possibility of a special session. While I find their 32% forecast to be an overestimation of Patrick's ability to force this specific issue against the will of the House and without the governor's explicit backing, their focus on the special session as a viable secondary path is an important consideration I had undervalued.",
    "rationale": "I am slightly increasing my forecast from 5% to 7%. My core reasoning remains unchanged: a full THC ban faces formidable opposition in the Texas House, which has demonstrated a clear preference for expanding, not restricting, cannabis access. The additional arguments from Forecaster 2—the extremely short legislative timeline, strong public and interest group opposition, and Governor Abbott's lack of stated interest—solidify the view that passage during the regular session is highly improbable. However, Forecaster 3's emphasis on Lt. Governor Patrick's political will and the potential for a special session is a valid point. While Governor Abbott alone controls the calling and agenda of a special session, Patrick's pressure is a significant factor in Texas politics. A scenario where Abbott trades a THC ban in a special session for one of his own priorities is not impossible, even if it is unlikely. My updated forecast of 7% reflects a better accounting of this small but non-zero probability of a special session leading to a ban, while still maintaining that the combined legislative, political, and economic headwinds make 'No' the overwhelmingly likely outcome.",
