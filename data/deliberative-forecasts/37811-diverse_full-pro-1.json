    "review": "The deliberation was very helpful. All three forecasters correctly identified the core tension between the operational status quo and direct NOAA assurances versus the significant political risk posed by the administration's stated goals and prior actions. Forecaster 2's reasoning for an 85% forecast was sound, emphasizing the pattern of cuts and an internal memo suggesting a takedown was at least considered. However, Forecaster 3's analysis at 94% was more convincing and introduced several crucial points I had undervalued. Specifically, F3's distinction between content removal (which is happening) and a full domain takedown (which is rare and what the question resolves on) is a critical insight. Furthermore, F3's points on the high base rate stability of government websites and the historical precedent from 2017-2020, where similar sites remained online despite content alterations, provide strong evidence that the most likely path, even under political pressure, is not a complete shutdown.",
    "rationale": "After reviewing the other forecasts, I am updating my probability upward. My initial 90% forecast was anchored on the explicit NOAA statement from April 4th, counter-balanced by the clear political risks. Forecaster 3's analysis provided compelling arguments that I had not fully weighted. The most important of these were the distinction between altering content and taking a domain completely offline, and the historical precedent from the first Trump administration (2017-2020) where high-profile NOAA sites remained online even as their content was changed. The evidence we have (decommissioning the 'Billion-Dollar Disasters' database) points to content reduction, not infrastructure removal. Taking down Climate.gov entirely is a more drastic, visible, and technically distinct action. Given this precedent and the high base rate of stability for major government websites over a short 41-day period, the risk of a deliberate takedown before July 1st seems lower than I initially estimated. The NOAA spokesperson's public statement serves as a powerful, recent bulwark against this possibility. A small risk of a politically-motivated reversal or an operational failure due to staff cuts remains, but it is not significant enough to keep the forecast at 90%. I am therefore moving my forecast from 90% to 94%, aligning with Forecaster 3.",
