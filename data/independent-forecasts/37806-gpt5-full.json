  "information": "A legislative proposal, the SAFE for America Act of 2025, introduced by Representative Mike Collins, seeks to eliminate the Diversity Visa Lottery program. The act would also prevent visa lottery winners from sponsoring family members for permanent residence. The proposal has received support from conservative organizations such as Heritage Action and NumbersUSA, which argue that the program undermines national security and lacks a merit-based selection process. President Trump previously called on Congress to terminate the program in 2017, following a terrorist attack in New York committed by an individual who had entered the U.S. through the visa lottery.\n\nSince taking office in January 2025, the Trump administration has taken numerous actions on immigration. As of February 17, 2025, the administration had issued 62 executive orders, including ones to end Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion (DEI) mandates, an order to end birthright citizenship for children of unauthorized immigrants, and a declaration of a national emergency at the southern border. Other relevant policies implemented include a new rule requiring non-citizens to carry proof of legal status at all times, visa restrictions on Indian travel agencies accused of facilitating illegal immigration, and a policy to limit visas for foreign officials who facilitate irregular migration.\n\nThe Diversity Visa program, which grants up to 55,000 visas annually, has continued to operate. The results for the 2025 lottery were scheduled for release on May 3, 2025, with the application period for the 2027 lottery set to open in October 2025. Of the more than 40 presidential actions issued since January 2025, none have contained the exact phrase 'Diversity Visa.' The U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) website has not posted any official notice of the program's cancellation. Legal analyses mentioned in reports suggest that since the program is established by statute, substantial changes would typically require new legislation passed by Congress.",

    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "About 6 weeks (~41 days) until July 1, 2025",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "The White House continues issuing immigration-related actions that avoid the exact phrase “Diversity Visa” (e.g., using “visa lottery” or “Diversity Immigrant Visa”), and no presidential action mentioning “Diversity Visa” is posted on the Presidential Actions page before July 1.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "The President issues and the White House posts a presidential action (e.g., Executive Order, Proclamation, Memorandum, or Message to Congress) that explicitly includes the words “Diversity Visa,” perhaps to support repeal, suspend entries under 212(f), direct a review of the program, or urge Congress to pass related legislation.",
    "rationale": "- Status quo and base rates: The program is statutory and still operating. Despite many immigration actions since January, none reportedly mention the exact phrase “Diversity Visa.” With only ~6 weeks left, the default is No unless a document specifically uses that wording. The world changes slowly; most actions will not target this exact phrase.\n- Incentives and pathways: Trump opposes the DV program and has previously urged Congress to end it. He could plausibly issue a presidential action that references it—especially a message to Congress or an EO/proclamation directing review or suspension. However, because elimination requires legislation, the administration may focus on congressional messaging, agency policy within existing law, or use the colloquial “visa lottery” rather than the exact phrase. The requirement that the action both be posted under White House “Presidential Actions” and include the exact words “Diversity Visa” lowers the odds.\n- Timing: DV-2026 results were released in early May, which would have been a natural moment for a statement; that window has passed. Another potential trigger could be a push around the SAFE for America Act or a broader immigration EO. Still, the specific phrase requirement is a hurdle: official language often uses “Diversity Immigrant Visa (DV) Program,” which may or may not contain the exact two-word substring.\n- Why not higher: Short timeline, no current drafts/leaks suggesting an imminent action, and historical tendency to say “visa lottery” or “Diversity Immigrant Visa” rather than exactly “Diversity Visa.” Website posting requirement introduces minor risk of delays.\n- Why not lower: Immigration is a top priority; the administration is prolific with presidential actions. Trump has a clear policy preference against the DV program, and a formal message to Congress or EO could easily include the exact words for clarity.\n- What would change my view: Upward—credible reporting or a leaked draft of an immigration EO/proclamation or a White House message to Congress that explicitly references “Diversity Visa,” or the administration previewing action targeting the program. Downward—continued issuance of immigration actions that systematically avoid the phrase and/or signals that the White House will rely solely on legislative vehicles without presidential actions mentioning DV.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill President Trump issue a new presidential action mentioning the Diversity Visa before July 1, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\n[Federal judge’s order leaves many visa lottery winners out of luck](https://www.siliconvalley.com/2020/10/01/judges-order-leaves-many-visa-lottery-winners-out-of-luck/) | The American Conservative: [Trump Should Cancel the Diversity Visa Program](https://www.theamericanconservative.com/trump-should-cancel-the-diversity-visa-program/) | Mint: [US Green Card Diversity Visa 2026 Lottery results released: What you need to know](https://www.livemint.com/news/us-news/us-green-card-diversity-visa-2026-lottery-results-released-what-you-need-to-know-11746381683106.html)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if, before July 1, 2025, President Donald J. Trump issues a [presidential action](https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/) mentioning the \"Diversity Visa\" (using exactly those words). If this does not occur before that date, this resolves as **No**.\n\nTo count, the presidential action must be published and publicly accessible (appearing on the presidential actions section of the White House website) before the specified time. A verbal statement or other written announcement besides a presidential action (for example a post on social media), is not sufficient.\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nA legislative proposal, the SAFE for America Act of 2025, introduced by Representative Mike Collins, seeks to eliminate the Diversity Visa Lottery program.

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
