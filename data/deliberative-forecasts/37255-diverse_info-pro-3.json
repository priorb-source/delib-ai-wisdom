    "review": "Forecaster 2's analysis strongly aligns with my own, emphasizing the overwhelming force of the status quo, Libya's internal political fragmentation, and the extremely short two-month timeline. Their reasoning reinforces my conviction in a low probability. Forecaster 3 introduces a valuable counter-argument: the growing momentum of AfCFTA across the continent could create reputational pressure on Libya to ratify to avoid being left behind. This is a plausible motivation for a 'Yes' outcome that I had not explicitly weighed. However, I find this argument unconvincing in this specific case. Libya's political actors have historically been more responsive to powerful external patrons (like Turkey, as mentioned in my initial evidence) than to institutional pressure from the African Union. Furthermore, the tangible benefits of the proposed Turkish free trade zone appear to far outweigh the more abstract reputational gains from ratifying AfCFTA at this moment. While the continental pressure argument is a valid consideration, I believe its influence is marginal compared to the severe domestic constraints and Libya's demonstrated alternative economic priorities.",
    "rationale": "After reviewing the other forecasts, I am maintaining my initial forecast of 5%. My reasoning remains anchored in three core points that were reinforced by the deliberation. First, the two-month timeline is exceptionally tight for any country to complete a treaty ratification process, and it is a near-insurmountable barrier for a state with Libya's well-documented legislative and political gridlock. Second, the status quo is one of inaction, and significant inertia must be overcome. Third, and most crucially, the evidence from my research assistant concerning the active pursuit of a deep bilateral free trade agreement with Turkey provides a strong, specific indicator of where the Libyan government's limited political and administrative capital is being allocated. This isn't just a case of inaction on AfCFTA; it's a case of action on a competing priority. While Forecaster 3's point about continental pressure is valid as a general principle, in Libya's specific context, the focus on a major non-African partner (Turkey) suggests this pressure is not a primary driver of policy. The Turkish deal serves a similar strategic goal (positioning Libya as a trade hub) but through a framework that likely offers more immediate and tangible political and economic benefits to the current authorities. Therefore, a sudden pivot to prioritize and fast-track AfCFTA ratification in the next 60 days remains a highly improbable event.",
