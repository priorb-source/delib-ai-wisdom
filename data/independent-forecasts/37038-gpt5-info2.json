  "information": "The US is Israel's largest trading partner, with bilateral trade valued at $34 billion in 2024. The two countries have a 40-year-old free trade agreement. On April 1, 2025, the Israeli government announced the immediate cancellation of all its remaining tariffs on U.S. imports. Following the US tariff announcement, Israeli Economy Minister Nir Barkat stated that officials from both countries are optimistic about reaching a new trade agreement before the suspension period expires on July 9, 2025. Ongoing discussions also aim to address the trade deficit between the nations.",

    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "~38 days",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "The US and Israel reach a quick agreement in May that leads USTR/USITC to withdraw or not post any +17% Israel-specific entry in the HTS before June 1; or the US keeps the measure only as an intention without publishing a Chapter 99/HTS change until the actual effective date in July, so the HTS viewed on June 1 does not show +17% for Israel.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "A Presidential/USTR action that has already been announced is formally codified in the HTS as an additional 17% duty on products of Israel (likely via a Chapter 99 subheading and notes), and USITC posts it to hts.usitc.gov before June 1. Even if shown as “suspended” until July 9, the listing still counts, so Metaculus finds a +17% duty for Israel on or after June 1.",
    "rationale": "- Timeframe: We have a bit over five weeks until June 1. HTS updates often lag official proclamations by days to a few weeks, but can precede the effective date if a tariff is announced with a delayed start and shown as suspended. \n- Status quo: Today, Israel’s HTS treatment under the 1985 FTA generally shows “Free” in the special column; there is no +17% country-specific duty visible. Inertia favors No. \n- New information: The assistant’s report indicates the US has announced a tariff affecting Israeli exports, with a suspension window expiring July 9, 2025. Israel responded by immediately canceling remaining tariffs on US imports and both sides signaled optimism about a deal before the suspension expires. This implies a formal action may exist already (or imminently) that could be reflected in the HTS as an additional duty line for Israel with a note indicating suspension until July 9. The question explicitly states that being listed as “suspended” still resolves Yes. \n- Mechanics uncertainty: Whether USITC will display a +17% Israel-specific duty before its effective date is uncertain. Sometimes Chapter 99 entries and notes are posted in advance with suspension language (which would yield Yes). Other times, the HTS is only updated on or just before the effective date (which would yield No on June 1). \n- Negotiation risk: If a new agreement is reached in May, the US might withdraw the measure before USITC ever posts it, pushing the probability down. Conversely, if talks stall or the administration wants leverage, they may ensure the HTS reflects the planned duty (even as suspended), pushing the probability up. \nWhy not higher: There’s real risk that USITC waits until closer to the July 9 date to publish, or that a May deal removes the need to post it at all. \nWhy not lower: The reported US announcement and a defined suspension end date suggest a concrete, codified measure rather than a vague threat, increasing the odds that a Chapter 99 +17% Israel entry appears on the HTS by June 1. \nWhat would move me up: A Federal Register notice or Presidential Proclamation with specific HTS modifications (e.g., a new 9903 subheading and U.S. Notes) already published, or confirmation on usitc.gov that the entry is posted (even if suspended). \nWhat would move me down: Credible reporting that negotiations yielded a deal in May leading USTR to rescind the planned tariff before any HTS posting, or official guidance that USITC will not update the HTS until the tariff’s effective date in July.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill the US government's harmonized tarifff schedule list the tariff on Israel as 17% on June 1, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nTimes of Israel: [Israeli exports to US will take annual $2.3B hit under tariffs, industrial org warns](https://www.timesofisrael.com/israeli-exports-to-us-will-take-2-3-billion-hit-under-tariffs-industrialist-org-warns/)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if the duty provided in the applicable subheading is + 17% for Israel at the American government's [harmonized tariff schedule](https://hts.usitc.gov/search?query=israel) when accessed by Metaculus on or after June 1, 2025.\n\nWhether the provision is listed as suspended will not affect resolution.\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nThe US is Israel's largest trading partner, with bilateral trade valued at $34 billion in 2024.

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
