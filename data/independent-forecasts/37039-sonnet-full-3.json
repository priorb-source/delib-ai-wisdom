  "information": "On April 2-3, 2025, the U.S. President announced comprehensive tariffs. The policy included a 10% base tariff on goods from almost all countries, effective April 5, and additional country-specific tariffs to take effect on April 9. For Switzerland, the total tariff was set at 31%. The stated justifications included that Switzerland had been 'taking advantage' of the US and as a response to alleged 61% tariffs imposed by Switzerland on American products.\n\nThe Swiss government, including President Karin Keller-Sutter, expressed 'incomprehension' regarding the tariff calculation. Swiss officials stated that the country imposes a 0% tariff on US imports, and that Swiss companies have created 500,000 jobs in the US. Switzerland's trade surplus with the US was $38.5 billion in 2024. The Swiss watch industry was noted as being particularly affected, with share prices for major exporters like Richemont and Swatch falling after the announcement.\n\nThe 31% additional ad valorem duty for Swiss products was officially listed under subheading 9903.01.60 of the U.S. Harmonized Tariff Schedule (HTS). On April 10, 2025, the U.S. administration announced that the country-specific tariffs, including the one for Switzerland, would be suspended for 90 days to allow for negotiations. This suspension period is scheduled to run until July 9, 2025, covering the June 1 resolution date. The HTS listing for Switzerland under subheading 9903.01.60 reflects the 31% rate but is marked as 'suspended'.",

    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "38 days (question resolves on June 1, 2025, and today is April 24, 2025)",
    "status_quo_outcome": "YES - The 31% tariff is currently listed under subheading 9903.01.60 for Switzerland in the HTS, marked as suspended until July 9, 2025. Since the resolution criteria explicitly state that suspension status does not affect resolution, the status quo is that the 31% rate will still be listed on June 1.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "The US government permanently removes or modifies the 31% tariff listing from subheading 9903.01.60 before June 1, 2025, possibly as a result of successful negotiations during the 90-day suspension period. This would require an unusually rapid diplomatic resolution and administrative action before the suspension period ends on July 9.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "The status quo continues - the 31% tariff remains listed in the HTS under subheading 9903.01.60 on June 1, 2025, regardless of whether it remains suspended. This is the most likely outcome given that the suspension period explicitly runs until July 9, 2025, and the administration would typically wait until the negotiation period concludes before making permanent changes.",
    "rationale": "The critical factor here is that the resolution criteria explicitly state suspension status does not affect resolution - only whether the 31% rate is listed matters. Currently, the tariff is listed at 31% but suspended until July 9, 2025. June 1 falls squarely within this suspension period. The strong status quo bias suggests the listing will remain unchanged through June 1 because: (1) The 90-day suspension period was specifically designed to allow for negotiations, implying the administration expects to maintain the status quo during this time; (2) Making permanent policy changes mid-negotiation would be unusual and could undermine the negotiating position; (3) There's no evidence of unusually rapid progress in negotiations that would necessitate early changes. The main risk to this forecast would be if Switzerland and the US reached a deal very quickly and the administration decided to remove the tariff listing immediately rather than waiting until after July 9. However, given Swiss officials' 'incomprehension' about the tariff calculation and the significant trade issues at stake ($38.5 billion trade surplus), rapid resolution seems unlikely. I'm not forecasting higher (e.g., 95%+) because there's a non-trivial chance of accelerated negotiations or political pressure leading to early removal. I'm not forecasting lower because the suspension timeline strongly suggests no changes before July 9, and the resolution criteria make suspension status irrelevant.",
