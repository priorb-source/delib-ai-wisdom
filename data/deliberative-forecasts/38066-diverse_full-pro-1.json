    "review": "My initial forecast of 25% was based heavily on the narrative potential of a public reconciliation, driven by Sam Altman's recent olive branch and YC's unique position as a potential mediator. The other two forecasters provided crucial grounding arguments that I had underweighted. Forecaster 2's point about the base rate for rival executives sharing a stage being extremely low is well-taken. More importantly, their argument that a blockbuster joint session would almost certainly have been announced by now for promotional purposes is a strong piece of negative evidence. Forecaster 3 introduced a quantitative decomposition that I found particularly compelling, especially by explicitly factoring in Elon Musk's attendance variability—a key risk I had overlooked. Both analyses convincingly argue that the practical barriers and lack of positive signals currently outweigh the narrative possibility.",
    "rationale": "After reviewing the other forecasts, I am significantly lowering my probability from 25% to 16%. My initial analysis was too optimistic, focusing on the possibility of a dramatic reconciliation while neglecting key practical constraints. Forecaster 3's decomposition method provides a more structured and realistic approach. Re-evaluating with this framework: 1) The probability of Elon Musk attending in person is not certain; given his track record, a 65% chance seems reasonable. 2) The probability of Sam Altman attending is high, around 95%. This means there is only about a 62% chance that both men are even physically present at the event. 3) Conditional on both attending, the probability of them sharing a stage remains the core question. I still believe there is a non-trivial chance (around 25%) of a surprise joint Q&A or a brokered appearance, given Altman's outreach and YC's influence. However, multiplying these probabilities (0.62 * 0.25) yields a final forecast of approximately 15.5%. I am updating to 16% to reflect this more rigorous breakdown. The lack of a promotional announcement, as highlighted by Forecaster 2, further supports the conclusion that a planned joint session is unlikely, thus any 'Yes' outcome would probably have to be a last-minute, less-probable event.",
