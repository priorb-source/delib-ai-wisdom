    "review": "I have reviewed the analyses from two other forecasters. We all agree on the core tension: the severe security and economic reasons for the border closure (a new terror group, smuggling) versus the short one-month timeframe for resolution. Forecaster 2, predicting 8%, emphasizes the status quo's inertia, arguing that such complex issues are almost never resolved in such a short time. Their reasoning is sound, though they seem to have misinterpreted the deadline as being less than a day away rather than a month, which may have led to an overly low forecast. Forecaster 3, predicting 25%, presents the most balanced analysis, explicitly weighing the drivers for closure against countervailing pressures like the ECOWAS framework, local economic pain, and Nigeria's regional influence. Forecaster 3 also introduced two excellent points I had not fully considered: 1) The 'credible reporting' requirement, which could mean a last-minute reopening isn't counted in time, slightly lowering the probability. 2) The potential for the closure to be a tactical or symbolic move, which could be reversed quickly, raising the probability. Overall, I find Forecaster 3's reasoning most convincing as it provides a comprehensive view of the competing factors.",
    "rationale": "After deliberation, I am maintaining my forecast of 20%. My initial reasoning was that the one-month timeline is too short to resolve the stated security threats (a new terror group and arms smuggling), making the status quo of a closed border the most likely outcome. The other forecasters' analyses helped refine this view. Forecaster 3's point about countervailing pressures (e.g., from ECOWAS and Nigeria's regional power) is a strong argument for a potential rapid, politically-motivated reopening. However, this is balanced by the severity of the security threat—a named terror group is not a trivial matter—and their other excellent point about the credible reporting requirement, which adds a practical hurdle to a 'Yes' resolution. The arguments for moving my forecast up (political pressure) and down (reporting hurdles, gravity of the threat) effectively cancel each other out, reinforcing my initial assessment. My 20% forecast remains situated between my peers' forecasts of 8% and 25%, reflecting my belief that while a swift resolution is unlikely due to the security realities, it is not impossible given the political and economic dynamics of the region.",
