    "no_outcome_scenario": "The Trump administration makes some moves toward breaking up NOAA but the process is incomplete by July 1, 2025. The spreadsheet maintainers either don't update the status or keep it as 'in progress' because full implementation hasn't occurred. This is the most likely scenario given the short timeframe and complexity of reorganizing a major federal agency.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Within the next 47 days, the Trump administration issues executive orders or implements actions that the Keep_Track moderators deem sufficient to mark the objective as 'complete.' This could include announcing a concrete reorganization plan, signing orders transferring NOAA functions to other agencies, or initiating the formal breakup process - even if not fully implemented by July 1.",
    "rationale": "Breaking up NOAA is an extraordinarily complex undertaking that typically requires extensive legislative action, regulatory changes, employee reorganization, and budget reallocations. With only 47 days remaining and the objective currently marked as 'in progress,' the status quo strongly favors a 'No' resolution. Major structural changes to federal agencies historically take months to years to implement, not weeks. The key uncertainty is the standard the spreadsheet maintainers use for marking something 'complete.' They might mark it complete based on announced plans or executive orders rather than full implementation. However, even issuing comprehensive executive orders would be ambitious given the remaining timeframe. The current 'in progress' status suggests significant work remains. For this to resolve 'Yes,' we would need to see rapid, decisive action from the administration and a relatively permissive interpretation of 'complete' by the spreadsheet maintainers. I would update higher if we saw imminent executive action or legislation, or evidence the maintainers have a low completion bar. I would update lower if we saw legal challenges, congressional opposition, or stalled progress. Given the complexity, short timeframe, and current status, I estimate this at 18%.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill the Project 2025 Tracker spreadsheet have the objective of breaking up NOAA marked as complete before July 1, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nAt the time of this question, the objective was marked as \"in progress.\" The 2025 Tracker is a project of the Keep_Track subreddit and is explained [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/Keep_Track/comments/1ii7tbr/project_2025_tracker_is_now_live/).\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if the Project 2025 objective to \"break up the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration\" is marked as complete according to [this spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1QGG6wNHna-1tt91yXNkOauAJJ7snobFjfEnmxlmzhl4/edit?gid=0#gid=0) before July 1, 2025. If it is anything other than complete (such as \"in progress\") when accessed by Metaculus on or after July 1, 2025, then the question resolves as **No**.\n\n\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nNo additional information available.\n\nToday is 2025-05-15.\n\nBefore answering you think:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n(e) You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
