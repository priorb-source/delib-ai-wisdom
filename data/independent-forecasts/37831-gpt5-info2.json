  "information": "In response to the dissolution decree, Malian political parties have initiated legal challenges, filing lawsuits in six courts in Bamako and a separate appeal to the administrative section of the Supreme Court. They argue the decree infringes on their rights to association, assembly, and participation in public life. On May 3, 2025, prior to the decree, hundreds of people attended a protest in Bamako organized by the parties. Following the decree, Malian intellectuals, including writers and lawyers, signed a statement denouncing the regime's actions. Reports indicate at least three opposition members have been arrested.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "About 39 days (until July 1, 2025)",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No — the May 13 decree remains in force and political parties stay dissolved; new parties cannot form.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Courts either decline to hear or reject the lawsuits, the junta detains additional opposition figures, and there is no conciliatory gesture. International pressure remains limited and the regime stays the course through July 1.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Facing mounting pressure (e.g., a credible court ruling from the administrative section of the Supreme Court, broad sustained protests, or significant diplomatic/economic costs), the junta issues a new decree rescinding the May 13 order and explicitly allows parties to resume activities and new parties to form.",
    "rationale": "- Time horizon is short (≈39 days). The status quo strongly favors no reversal: Mali’s junta has centralized power, repeatedly delayed transitions, and shown low responsiveness to domestic and international criticism.\n- Incentives: Keeping parties dissolved disrupts opposition coordination. The regime’s security-first stance and reduced dependence on Western partners lower the cost of repression. Prior patterns in the Sahel (Burkina Faso, Niger) suggest limited tolerance for party politics under military rule.\n- Legal challenges: While multiple lawsuits and an appeal to the Supreme Court create a pathway to reversal, judicial independence is doubtful. Even if a court ruled against the decree, the question requires a government announcement reversing it; compliance is uncertain.\n- Domestic pressure: A pre-decree protest drew hundreds; intellectuals have denounced the move; some opposition arrests reported. These signals show opposition energy but, to date, not at a scale that typically forces rapid concessions from entrenched juntas.\n- Why not higher: Formal reversal within weeks would be unusual without a sharp increase in costs to the regime (mass protests, elite splits, targeted economic pressure). The requirement of an explicit government reversal further lowers odds.\n- Why not lower: Multiple legal filings, public dissent from respected figures, and potential for international/donor pressure leave a non-trivial chance of a tactical climbdown or court-driven reversal that the government announces.\n- Updaters toward Yes: (1) Credible indications the Supreme Court will hear and rule promptly against the decree; (2) large, sustained protests with cross-elite support (religious, business, civil society); (3) concrete signals of sanctions/aid conditionality that the junta seeks to avoid; (4) signs of factional cracks within the junta.\n- Updaters toward No: (1) Courts dismiss cases or judges face intimidation; (2) broader crackdown on opposition and media; (3) rhetoric hardening around a long timeline for party bans; (4) new legal steps entrenching the ban beyond a single decree.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nBefore July 1, 2025, will the government of Mali reverse its decision to dissolve all political parties?\n\nQuestion background:\n[Mali's Military Government Shuts Down All Political Parties](https://www.legit.ng/world/africa/1654992-malis-military-government-shuts-political-parties/)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if the government of Mali announces a reversal of its May 13, 2025 presidential decree dissolving all political parties in the country.\n\nA partial reversal, such as allowing the reinstatement of a limited number of parties, will only count as long as new parties are generally allowed to be formed again.\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nIn response to the dissolution decree, Malian political parties have initiated legal challenges, filing lawsuits in six courts in Bamako and a separate appeal to the administrative section of the Supreme Court. They argue the decree infringes on their rights to association, assembly, and participation in public life.

Reports indicate at least three opposition members have been arrested.\n\nToday is 2025-05-22.\n\nBefore answering you think:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n(e) You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
