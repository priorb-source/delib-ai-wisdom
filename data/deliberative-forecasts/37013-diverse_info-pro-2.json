    "review": "My initial forecast of 60% was an outlier, and the other two forecasters have convincingly demonstrated why. My analysis was too heavily weighted on national political trends and failed to account for two critical, Cornwall-specific factors that both other analysts highlighted: 1) the historical and ongoing strength of Independent councillors, which fragments the anti-Conservative vote and creates a high barrier for any single party to become the largest, and 2) the sheer scale of the seat deficit the Liberal Democrats must overcome from the 2021 results. Forecaster 2's emphasis on the historical precedent and seat arithmetic was particularly effective in grounding the forecast in local reality, while Forecaster 3 provided a well-balanced view that correctly incorporated recent Lib Dem general election successes without letting them overshadow the local structural challenges. Their reasoning has persuaded me that my initial forecast was overconfident.",
    "rationale": "I am significantly revising my forecast downwards from 60% to 35%. My initial confidence was driven by the strong national anti-Conservative sentiment, evidence of a well-funded local Lib Dem campaign, and Conservative weakness through retirements. However, the deliberation has made it clear that Cornwall's political landscape is not a simple microcosm of the national picture. The arguments from my fellow forecasters about the substantial role of Independents are decisive. This dynamic means that a collapse in the Conservative vote does not automatically translate into a plurality for the Liberal Democrats; those votes could just as easily go to strong local Independents, Mebyon Kernow, or Labour, resulting in a highly fragmented council where no single party holds the most seats. Forecaster 2's point that the Lib Dems have never been the largest party on the unitary council is a powerful piece of base rate information that I initially ignored. While the path to a Lib Dem victory exists, bolstered by their 2024 General Election wins in Cornwall and the Conservative/Reform split mentioned by Forecaster 3, the structural barriers are much higher than I first appreciated. A 'No' outcome, either from the Conservatives holding on or from a fragmented council, is now my base case, but the probability of a Lib Dem plurality remains significant enough to warrant a 35% forecast.",
