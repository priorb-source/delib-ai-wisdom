    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Approximately 26 days until July 1, 2025",
    "status_quo_outcome": "Yes - Wikipedia continues to list all seven countries as currently blocking X",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "At least one of the seven countries (China, Iran, Myanmar, North Korea, Russia, Turkmenistan, or Venezuela) unblocks X/Twitter before July 1, 2025, and Wikipedia is updated to reflect this change before the resolution date",

    "rationale": "This question has an extremely short resolution timeframe of approximately 26 days. The status quo strongly favors a Yes outcome because:\n\n1. **Established blocks**: All seven countries listed have long-standing, well-documented internet censorship regimes. China blocked Twitter as part of its Great Firewall; Iran blocked it in 2009; Russia blocked it in 2022 following the Ukraine invasion; North Korea has severely restricted internet access; Turkmenistan maintains one of the world's most restrictive internet environments; Myanmar and Venezuela have histories of social media restrictions.\n\n2. **Time constraints**: Major policy changes in authoritarian regimes typically require significant political events or shifts. With only 26 days remaining, there's insufficient time for most plausible unblocking scenarios to occur and be reflected in Wikipedia.\n\n3. **Multiple countries requirement**: For the question to resolve No, only ONE of the seven countries needs to unblock X. However, this still requires both (a) a policy reversal and (b) Wikipedia being updated to reflect it.\n\n4. **No signals of change**: The research assistant provided no information suggesting imminent policy changes in any of these countries.\n\nWhy not higher (>95%)?: There are small risks including Wikipedia editing controversies, vandalism during the brief window, unexpected rapid policy changes (though unlikely), or technical issues accessing the resolution source.\n\nWhy not lower (<85%)?: The timeframe is too short for normal policy evolution, and these are entrenched censorship regimes with no apparent motivation to change course on X/Twitter specifically.\n\nWhat would change my forecast: Evidence of diplomatic negotiations, policy announcements, or preliminary unblocking steps in any of these countries would lower my probability significantly.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nAt the end of June 2025, will Wikipedia still list all these countries as \"currently\" blocking access to X (formerly Twitter)?\n\nQuestion background:\nAccording to the resolution source, \"Censorship of Twitter refers to Internet censorship by governments that block access to Twitter (officially known as X since July 2023). Twitter censorship also includes governmental notice and take down requests to Twitter, which it enforces in accordance with its Terms of Service when a government or authority submits a valid removal request to Twitter indicating that specific content published on the platform is illegal in their jurisdiction.\"\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if Wikipedia still lists X (formerly known as Twitter) as currently blocked in China, Iran, Myanmar, North Korea, Russia, Turkmenistan and Venezuela at [this link](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Censorship_of_Twitter#Current) when accessed by Metaculus on or after July 1, 2025. If the Wikipedia article does not list X as currently being blocked in any of those countries, this question resolves as **No**.\n\nThe question will resolve as soon as the page is accessed by Metaculus Admins on the resolution date. However, if there are issues accessing the page, then resolution will wait up to July 7, 2025, at which point if Metaculus has still not been able to access the resolution source, this question will be **annulled**. Admins will also use their discretion if there appears to be an [edit war](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Edit_warring) or lack of Wikipedia [consensus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Consensus) and may annul the question in such a case; however, Admins will also strive to resolve the question as definitively Yes or No, and such an edge case should be considered a rare outcome.\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nNo additional information available.\n\nToday is 2025-06-05.\n\nBefore answering you think:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n(e) You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
