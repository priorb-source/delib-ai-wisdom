    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Approximately 5 weeks.",
    "status_quo_outcome": "Yes. The prevailing trend of a slow decline in active rig counts, driven primarily by low natural gas prices and capital discipline among oil producers, is expected to continue. This would likely cause the count to fall from its current level to below the 583 threshold over the next five weeks.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "A significant and sustained rally in energy prices, particularly WTI crude oil moving well above $90/bbl, could halt the decline. This might be triggered by a major geopolitical supply disruption, causing producers to maintain or even slightly add rigs, keeping the count at or above 583.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Persistently weak natural gas prices continue to pressure producers to drop gas-directed rigs, while oil producers maintain strict capital discipline despite stable prices. This continuation of the existing trend results in a net reduction of rigs over the next five weeks, pushing the total count below 583.",
    "rationale": "My forecast is based on the strong prevailing trend of a declining US rig count observed over the past year. As of late April 2025, the rig count is estimated to be around 600, down from the low 620s in early 2024. The primary driver for this decline has been persistently low Henry Hub natural gas prices, which has disincentivized drilling in gas-focused basins. This pressure is unlikely to abate significantly within the short 5-week forecast window. On the oil side, while WTI prices have been relatively stable, exploration and production (E&P) companies have remained committed to capital discipline, prioritizing shareholder returns over aggressive production growth. This has kept the oil rig count flat or slightly down. For the outcome to be 'Yes', the count needs to drop by at least 17 rigs from the estimated 600 baseline, an average of about 3-4 rigs per week. This is a plausible rate of decline consistent with recent trends. My research assistant provided no new information.  The probability is not higher because the rig count can be volatile week-to-week, and a short-term price spike could easily cause the count to stabilize just above the 583 threshold. The probability is not lower because the fundamental drivers (low gas prices, producer discipline) are well-established and favor a continued, albeit slow, decline. Inertia is a strong factor over a short time frame, making a sharp reversal unlikely. I would increase my probability if weekly reports in May show an accelerated decline or if natural gas prices fall further. I would decrease my probability if there is a major oil price rally or if E&P companies signal a shift in capital strategy.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill the number of active US drilling rigs be less than 583 for the week ending May 30, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nSeekingAlpha: [U.S. rig count falls for third straight week, Baker Hughes says](https://seekingalpha.com/news/4430543-u-s-rig-count-falls-for-third-straight-week-baker-hughes-says)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if the last count of active US drilling rigs for the week ending May 30, 2025, according to the [Baker Hughes North America Rig Count](https://rigcount.bakerhughes.com/na-rig-count), is less than 583. Specifically, it will resolve based on the number listed as the United States Total for the most recent week in the May 30, 2025 North America Rig Count Report. This is the number of active drilling rigs and includes the total of those classified as gas, oil and miscellaneous, in every US location including inland waters, land and offshore.\n\nIf no report dated May 30, 2025, is released before June 1, 2025, Eastern Time, Metaculus may resolve this question using the most recent report available dated between May 23, 2025, and June 1, 2025, inclusive. If no such report exists, this question will be annulled.\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nNo additional information available.\n\nToday is 2025-04-23.\n\nBefore answering you think:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n(e) You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
