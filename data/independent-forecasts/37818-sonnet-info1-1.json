  "information": "The US government documented 757 UFO sightings between May 2023 and June 2024. A notable concentration of these incidents occurred in Arizona, which has become a hotspot for sightings, particularly involving military aircraft. On January 19, 2023, a US Air Force F-16 fighter jet was hit by an object described as an 'orange-white uncrewed aerial system' over Arizona, damaging the plane's canopy. This was one of 22 UFO sightings reported by Air Force pilots between October 2022 and June 2023. Some US officials have suggested that the mysterious objects could be advanced drones used by foreign drug cartels for surveillance and smuggling operations.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Approximately 41 days. The question will be resolved on or after July 1, 2025, when data for June 2025 pilot sightings becomes available on the National UFO Reporting Center website.",
    "status_quo_outcome": "Florida does NOT have the most pilot sightings. Based on recent reporting patterns and the lack of mention of Florida as a UFO hotspot in available intelligence, other states (particularly Arizona) appear more likely to lead in pilot sightings.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Other states with high military aviation activity report more pilot sightings than Florida in June 2025. Arizona, which has been documented as a hotspot with 22 Air Force pilot sightings between October 2022 and June 2023, continues its pattern. Alternatively, other states with significant military installations like California, Texas, Nevada, or Virginia report more incidents.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Florida experiences an unusual cluster of pilot-reported UFO sightings in June 2025, potentially due to increased activity near its multiple military installations (Eglin AFB, MacDill AFB, Naval Station Mayport, etc.), commercial aviation routes, or random monthly variation. Florida pilots are particularly diligent in reporting to NUFORC, or there's a specific incident that generates multiple pilot reports.",
    "rationale": "This forecast requires considering several factors: First, the research assistant's report specifically identifies Arizona as a recent hotspot for pilot sightings, with 22 Air Force pilot reports over an 8-month period. Florida was not mentioned despite having substantial military and commercial aviation activity. Second, pilot sightings are a specific subset of UFO reports - likely much smaller numbers than general public reports, making monthly variations more volatile. Third, while Florida has significant aviation infrastructure (major military bases, busy commercial airports, NASA operations), so do several other states. Fourth, with 50 states competing, base rate probability for any single state is around 2%, though states with more aviation naturally have higher probabilities. Fifth, I have no historical data specifically showing Florida typically leads in pilot sightings at NUFORC. The forecast is not higher because Arizona was specifically cited as the recent hotspot, and there's no evidence of Florida being a consistent leader in this specific category. The forecast is not lower because Florida does have substantial aviation activity that makes it a plausible contender, and monthly data can be quite variable with small sample sizes. I would update higher if I learned Florida has historically been strong in pilot reports, or if there were reports of unusual activity in Florida airspace leading into June. I would update lower if I had access to historical monthly data showing Florida rarely leads.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill Florida have the most pilot sightings of UFOs of any US state in March 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nAccording to the [National UFO Reporting Center](https://nuforc.org/about-us/): \"The National UFO Reporting Center was founded in 1974 by noted UFO investigator Robert J. Gribble. The Center’s primary function over the past five decades has been to receive, record, and to the greatest degree possible, corroborate and document reports from individuals who have been witness to unusual, possibly UFO-related events. Throughout its history, the Center has processed over 180,000 reports, and has distributed its information to thousands of individuals.\"\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if The National UFO Reporting Center posts more pilot reports of a UFO/UAP having occurred in the state of Florida than any other state, for the month of June 2025 at [this link](https://nuforc.org/subndx/?id=x) when accessed by Metaculus on or after July 1, 2025.\n\nIf Florida is tied with another state, resolves as No.\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nThe US government documented 757 UFO sightings between May 2023 and June 2024. A notable concentration of these incidents occurred in Arizona, which has become a hotspot for sightings, particularly involving military aircraft.

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
