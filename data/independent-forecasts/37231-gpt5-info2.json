  "information": "The International Monetary Fund (IMF) projects a 0.3% economic contraction for Mexico in 2025, citing the effects of tariffs imposed by the United States on key Mexican products. The IMF also predicts Mexico's unemployment rate will increase from 2.8% to 3.8% during 2025. Separately, the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) forecasts Mexico's economy will grow by 1.3% in 2025 and 0.6% in 2026, though these projections are conditional on the tariff situation. The U.S. has imposed tariffs of 25% on key Mexican products like autos, steel, and plastics.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Approximately 3–5 weeks (INEGI/Trading Economics typically publish April data in late May).",
    "status_quo_outcome": "Yes (Mexico’s unemployment rate has generally been below 3% in recent quarters and tends to move gradually).",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Tariff shock hits manufacturing quickly in April (autos/steel/plastics), prompting noticeable layoffs and pushing the reported jobless rate to 3.0% or higher on Trading Economics.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Labor market inertia and informality absorb early tariff impacts; manufacturing adjusts via hours, shifts, or informal employment rather than layoffs, keeping April’s rate at 2.9% or lower.",
    "rationale": "- Baseline and inertia: Mexico’s unemployment rate has been unusually low in recent years and fairly sticky month to month, in part due to a large informal sector that dampens measured unemployment. Given how slowly labor markets typically adjust, the status quo favors a sub‑3% print for April unless there is a sharp, contemporaneous shock.\n- Tariffs and headwinds: The research assistant notes new US tariffs (25% on autos, steel, plastics) and cites IMF expectations of a 2025 unemployment rise from 2.8% to 3.8%, with a possible GDP contraction. OECD is less negative (projects +1.3% in 2025) but also flags tariff risks. These raise the medium‑term risk of higher unemployment, especially in manufacturing-heavy regions. However, translating these macro projections into a jump above 3% specifically in April may be premature; such effects often phase in over months as orders, production schedules, and workforce adjustments propagate.\n- Threshold risk: The question requires strictly below 3.0%. Even a modest drift up to 3.0% would resolve as No. This rounding/threshold risk keeps my probability from being higher.\n- Why not higher: The IMF’s 2025 unemployment projection and the immediacy/severity of tariffs create plausible early‑year pressure. If firms front‑loaded layoffs or if April saw a sharp production pullback, a 3.0%+ print is possible.\n- Why not lower: Recent sub‑3% readings, labor market momentum, and informality suggest resilience and gradual adjustment, making an immediate jump above 3% less likely in April.\n- What would move me upward: Evidence that March stayed clearly below 3.0% and high-frequency indicators (manufacturing PMIs, auto production/exports, job postings) showing stability in April; reports of firms cutting hours rather than headcount.\n- What would move me downward: News of sizable April layoffs in auto/steel/plastics, a sharp drop in manufacturing output/exports, or an INEGI/TE preliminary print or leak at 3.0%+; any methodological note implying TE will show a rounded 3.0% for April.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill Mexico's unemployment rate be under 3% in April 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nAP: [US tariffs ripple through auto supply chains into Mexico](https://apnews.com/article/mexico-stellantis-trump-tariffs-sheinbaum-569ae29d203b1997d50a3a9655c928a8)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if Mexico's unemployment rate is less than 3.0% for April 2025 according to data presented by [Trading Economics](https://tradingeconomics.com/mexico/unemployment-rate).\n\n\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nThe International Monetary Fund (IMF) projects a 0.3% economic contraction for Mexico in 2025, citing the effects of tariffs imposed by the United States on key Mexican products.

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
