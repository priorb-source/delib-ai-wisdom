  "information": "In late May 2025, President Trump granted clemency to a large group of individuals. News outlets including The Hill and Politomix reported on May 28-29 that over two dozen people received pardons or commutations in what was described as a 'clemency spree' or 'blitz'. According to Office of the Pardon Attorney data, there were approximately 25 clemency actions in May. The recipients included political allies like former Congressman Michael Grimm and former Connecticut governor John G. Rowland, reality TV stars Todd and Julie Chrisley, and musicians such as NBA YoungBoy.\n\nSince taking office in January 2025, President Trump has granted approximately 1,600 pardons or commutations, a figure more than six times the total from his entire first term. A large portion of this number stems from a mass clemency order issued on his first day in office, which pardoned roughly 1,500 individuals convicted of offenses related to the January 6, 2021, Capitol attack. The administration has installed key personnel to manage the process, including Ed Martin as the new pardon attorney at the Justice Department and Alice Marie Johnson as a White House pardon czar.\n\nDuring his first presidential term, Donald Trump did not grant any clemencies during the month of June in any of the four years. For his second term, a May 28, 2025, report from the Washington Times indicated that Trump has signaled more pardons could be forthcoming, including for two men convicted in the plot to kidnap Michigan Governor Gretchen Whitmer. A White House official was also quoted stating the President has come to the aid of political supporters and donors and has expressed sympathy for allies caught in the judicial system.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "About 32 days (outcome clear by July 1, 2025, once June actions are known/publicly reported).",
    "status_quo_outcome": "Yes — Trump continues his current clemency cadence and publicly grants clemency to more than 2 people in June.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Following the late-May clemency blitz, the White House deliberately pauses and issues 0–2 clemencies in June, saving a larger tranche for a July 4 rollout or slowing due to backlash, logistics, or internal process bottlenecks.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "The administration announces another batch in June (or a blanket order) covering several allies or policy-targeted groups, easily pushing the month’s count above 2.",
    "rationale": "I put extra weight on the status quo: the administration has been issuing clemencies at an unusually high pace and has built infrastructure to sustain it. Your research assistant reports roughly 1,600 clemencies since January 2025, including a mass January 6 action (~1,500) and about two dozen in late May. Personnel changes (Ed Martin as pardon attorney; Alice Marie Johnson as a White House pardon czar) suggest a deliberate, ongoing pipeline rather than a one-off. Media reporting near May 28–29 framed this as a clemency “spree,” and there are signals more could be forthcoming (e.g., discussion of additional high-profile cases). Public disclosure is required for counting, and this White House has generally publicized these actions, reducing the risk that grants occur but remain uncounted. Historically, in Trump’s first term there were no June clemencies, but current-term behavior is very different: the base rate for 2025 is well above two per month, and the late-May batch indicates the pipeline is active. That makes “no more than two in June” the less likely path. Why not higher than my forecast? There are plausible reasons for a June lull: the optics after a May blitz, a strategic choice to bunch grants for a July 4 announcement, or temporary process slowdowns. Also, month-by-month timing is lumpy; a surge at end-May could be followed by a gap until early July. Why not lower? The demonstrated high tempo, institutional setup, and explicit signaling of more clemencies all point toward continued activity. What would move me up: credible reporting of pending June clemency lists, hints of a June-themed policy tranche, or on-record statements from the White House indicating imminent actions in June. What would move me down: reliable indications that the next major batch is deliberately slated for early July, internal guidance to pause, or evidence of significant backlash causing a tactical delay in announcements.",
