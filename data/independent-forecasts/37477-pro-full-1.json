  "information": "Executives from major publishers, including The New York Times and News Corp, stated confidence in their businesses' ability to grow despite economic uncertainties from tariffs. In Q1 2025, The New York Times reported a 12% growth in digital advertising revenue, while most other publishers saw flat revenue. New York Times executives described the impact of tariffs as 'immaterial.' This contrasts with a survey indicating 54% of marketers plan to reduce their 2025 budgets due to tariff concerns. Following a Federal Reserve statement that it would wait for the full impact of tariffs before making decisions, communications-services stocks declined, though The New York Times and Walt Disney posted positive results.\n\nThe Wall Street Journal's editorial board described a trade deal with the United Kingdom as a step towards unwinding the trade war, writing that the economic damage from tariffs was proving politically risky. The board also has stated that the tariff policy has shaken global confidence in U.S. reliability and called it a 'true gift' to Chinese President Xi Jinping. In April 2025, President Trump suggested tariffs could replace income taxes, a claim that a Wall Street Journal reporter noted reasons to be skeptical of. Following the implementation of tariffs, the Treasury Department raised its borrowing projection for the April-June 2025 quarter to an estimated net marketable borrowing of $514 billion.\n\nAn executive order signed on April 2, 2025, imposes a 10% 'minimum benchmark tariff' on all trade partners, with higher tariffs on certain partners. Reports since the order indicate a 'precautionary consumption' trend in the US, with consumers stockpiling goods. The arrival of container ships from China, which supplies 77% of toys sold in the US, has reportedly fallen by 50%. In March 2025, the Cortland Standard, a 147-year-old newspaper in New York, ceased publication, citing rising costs, including a 25% tariff on newsprint from Canada, as a contributing factor.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "23 days (from May 9, 2025 to May 31, 2025).",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No. Given the recent and significant policy changes, the word 'tariff(s)' is a dominant news topic and is expected to continue appearing on the front page of at least one of the major newspapers each day.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "For this outcome to occur, at least one of the two newspapers (The New York Times or the Wall Street Journal) must print the word 'tariff' or 'tariffs' on its front page every single day between May 9, 2025, and May 31, 2025. This would likely be driven by continuous developments, political commentary, and economic reports related to the new tariff policies.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "For this outcome to occur, there only needs to be a single day between May 9, 2025, and May 31, 2025, where the front pages of *both* The New York Times and the Wall Street Journal do not contain the word 'tariff' or 'tariffs'. This could happen if another major news event (e.g., a natural disaster, an international crisis, or a different domestic political scandal) dominates the news cycle for a day, pushing tariff-related stories off both front pages.",
    "rationale": "My forecast is primarily driven by the specific resolution criteria of the question, weighed against the current prominence of tariffs in the news. The status quo strongly suggests that tariffs will remain a front-page topic. The research indicates a major executive order imposing a 10% 'minimum benchmark tariff' was signed on April 2, 2025. The consequences of this policy—such as 'precautionary consumption', falling container ship arrivals from China, and President Trump's suggestion of replacing income taxes with tariffs—are generating significant, ongoing news stories that are of core interest to both The New York Times and the Wall Street Journal. This makes the daily probability of the word 'tariff(s)' appearing on at least one of the front pages very high. However, the question will resolve to 'Yes' if there is just one single day in the 23-day period where both papers are clear of the word. A 'No' outcome requires the word to appear on at least one of the front pages for 23 consecutive days, which is a high bar. The news cycle is volatile and can be easily diverted by unforeseen major events. It is plausible that over a three-week period, which includes three weekends when news can be lighter, at least one day's news cycle will be so dominated by another topic that 'tariff(s)' is crowded out from both front pages simultaneously. My forecast is not higher because the tariff story is a multi-faceted and significant policy issue with daily potential for new developments, making its persistent presence very likely. My forecast is not lower because the 'single-day' success condition for a 'Yes' outcome makes it statistically probable that a gap will occur over a 23-day window, even for a dominant news story. To increase my forecast, I would need to see evidence of a new, all-consuming news event emerging. To decrease it, I would need to see reporting that both papers have committed to a daily front-page segment on the impact of tariffs.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill the word \"tariff(s)\" disappear from the front print pages of The New York Times and Wall Street Journal by June 1, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nWhether reading the newspaper or social media or watching the news, it is highly likely you are going to see something about tariffs - mainly due to US President Donald Trump's renewed love for this somewhat antiquated form of taxation.\n\nThe New York Times and the Wall Street Journal are two of the largest print newspapers in the US. When, if ever, will we seen tariffs wiped from the front pages of both papers?\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question will resolve to \"Yes\" if, after \\[OPEN DATE] and before June 1, 2025, the words, \"tariff\" or \"tariffs\", do not appear on the print front page of The New York Times and the Wall Street Journal.

Format is: yyyy-mm-dd.</sup>\n\nGrammar is not relevant (e.g. \"TARIFF\" will suffice to prevent a \"No\" resolution).\n\n\"Tariff(s)\" must be omitted from both papers' front pages on the same day.\n\n\"Tariff(s)\" can appear anywhere on the page, it does not have to be in a title.\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nExecutives from major publishers, including The New York Times and News Corp, stated confidence in their businesses' ability to grow despite economic uncertainties from tariffs.

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any).
