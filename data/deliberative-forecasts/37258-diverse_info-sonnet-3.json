    "review": "Both forecasters provide valuable additional context that strengthens the case for a low probability. Forecaster 2 raises three particularly important new points: (1) Scottish Government guidance discourages significant announcements May 15-June 5 due to a by-election, further constraining the already short window; (2) the 2022 precedent confirms the Scottish Government can announce dates amid legal uncertainty; and (3) mixed polling environment beyond the single 11-point Yes lead. Forecaster 3 adds critical recent context: explicit statements from Nicola Sturgeon that a referendum is 'off the radar' for the short term, and confirmed government focus on economy, child poverty, and public services as of April 2025. These are strong signals against an imminent announcement. Both forecasters also note the post-2022 strategic shift toward emphasizing electoral mandates rather than unilateral referendum announcements. The convergence on 4-5% across all three analyses suggests this range is well-calibrated. The new information—especially Sturgeon's explicit statement, the documented policy priorities, and the by-election moratorium—slightly strengthens the case for the lower end of this range.",
    "rationale": "After reviewing the other forecasters' analyses, I find their evidence compelling and it slightly lowers my confidence in a Yes outcome. The most significant new information is: (1) Sturgeon's explicit statement that a referendum is 'off the radar'; (2) confirmed April 2025 government focus on economy and public services rather than constitutional issues; and (3) the by-election moratorium May 15-June 5 that further reduces the practical window from 60 days to perhaps 40 usable days. These concrete, recent signals strongly indicate no announcement is being prepared. The mixed polling environment (not uniformly strong Yes support) also weakens the political case for action. However, I'm not going lower than 4% because: the 2022 precedent proves symbolic announcements can occur amid legal uncertainty; 40-60 days still allows for unexpected political developments; and the resolution criteria only require an announcement, not implementation. The convergence of all three forecasts at 4-5% suggests this is the appropriate range given available evidence.",
