    "review": "Forecaster 3 raises a critical point I initially underweighted: the threshold for 'Yes' is extraordinarily low - any increase whatsoever above $262,578 million resolves as Yes. With 2-3% annual inflation, nominal exports would naturally reach approximately $268-270 billion even with flat real volumes. For exports to NOT exceed April 2024 levels would require real export volumes to decline by more than the inflationary lift - a significant drop that historically occurs only during recessions or severe trade disruptions. Forecaster 2's point about front-loading is also valuable - if tariffs were announced for implementation after April, exporters might rush shipments before the deadline, temporarily boosting April numbers. Both forecasters correctly emphasize that timing is crucial: April may be too early for full retaliatory effects to materialize, even if tariffs were announced in early 2025. However, Forecaster 3 may be slightly too optimistic given the trade war context - while the threshold is low, meaningful retaliation and uncertainty effects could still suppress exports enough to offset inflation. Forecaster 2's middle position acknowledges both the low bar and the real headwinds.",
    "rationale": "Upon reflection, my initial 35% forecast was too pessimistic because I focused on whether exports would show robust growth rather than simply exceed the baseline by any amount. The resolution criteria creates an asymmetric outcome: inflation alone provides a 2-3% baseline lift ($5-8 billion), while trade war effects would need to cause real volume declines exceeding this inflationary cushion to trigger a 'No' outcome. Historical precedent shows year-over-year nominal export declines are relatively rare absent major recessions. Even during the 2018-2019 trade tensions, US exports remained relatively stable in nominal terms. The key uncertainties remain: (1) timing of tariff implementation and retaliation, (2) magnitude of retaliatory measures, (3) whether April captures front-loading behavior, and (4) dollar movements. While trade policy headwinds are real and significant, the combination of the very low threshold, natural inflationary lift, and potential timing lags suggests probability should be notably higher than my initial forecast. However, I remain more cautious than Forecaster 3's 60% given the explicitly mentioned 'liberation day' tariffs signal serious trade disruption potential.",
