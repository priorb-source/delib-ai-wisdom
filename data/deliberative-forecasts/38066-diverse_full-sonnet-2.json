    "review": "Forecaster 3's decomposition approach is methodologically superior to my original analysis. Breaking down P(Musk attends) × P(Altman attends) × P(share stage | both attend) properly accounts for Musk's well-documented scheduling unpredictability, which I under-weighted. Forecaster 2 makes compelling points about YC's unique brokering position and incentive for a 'landmark moment' that I didn't fully credit. However, 25% seems too optimistic given: (1) no agenda announcement 20 days out is increasingly informative, (2) Musk's 60-70% in-person attendance probability caps the upper bound, and (3) one unreciprocated olive branch doesn't overcome active litigation. Forecaster 2's 'high-drama reconciliation' scenario is plausible but relies on speculation without supporting evidence. Forecaster 3's concern about reputational risk of on-stage confrontation at a student-focused event is valid and something I missed. The lack of any credible reporting about a planned joint session this close to the event is a strong negative signal that all three of us noted but Forecaster 3 weighted most appropriately.",
    "rationale": "After reviewing both analyses, I'm updating upward from 8% but remaining well below 25%. Forecaster 3's structured decomposition reveals I under-weighted YC's brokering potential and the olive branch significance, but Forecaster 2 over-weights the dramatic reconciliation narrative without evidence. Key updates to my thinking: (1) Musk's attendance uncertainty (60-70%) is a hard constraint I didn't explicitly model, (2) YC's unique relationship with both parties and desire for a historic inaugural event provides more upside than I credited, (3) the 20-day absence of any joint session announcement is increasingly informative against this outcome. Using a rough decomposition: P(Musk attends physically) ~65%, P(Altman attends) ~93%, P(joint stage | both present) ~22% yields approximately 13%. This accounts for YC's positioning while respecting base rates, Musk's unpredictability, active litigation barriers, and the informative lack of announcements. I would update higher if: YC announces a joint session, credible reporting emerges of planning, or Musk reciprocates publicly. I would update lower if: an agenda shows separate slots, either cancels/goes virtual, or legal hostilities escalate.",
