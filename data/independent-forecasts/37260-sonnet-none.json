    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Approximately 2 months until July 1, 2025",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No ban occurs - the AfD continues to operate as a legal political party in Germany",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "The Bundestag debates the motion but the formal application to the Federal Constitutional Court is either not submitted by July 1st, or if submitted, the Court follows its standard multi-year deliberation process and has not issued a ruling by the deadline",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "The Bundestag rapidly votes to proceed, the Federal Constitutional Court accepts the case on an emergency basis, and issues an unprecedented quick ruling to ban the AfD within the next 2 months",
    "rationale": "This forecast heavily favors the status quo because German constitutional law makes party bans extremely difficult and time-consuming by design. Historical precedent is crucial here: Germany has only banned two parties since WWII (SRP in 1952, KPD in 1956), and the most recent attempt to ban the far-right NPD took 4 years (2013-2017) before ultimately failing. The Federal Constitutional Court treats party ban cases with extreme caution as they involve fundamental democratic rights. Even if the motion from the 124 MPs has progressed since January 31st, the timeline is prohibitively short. Constitutional court proceedings require extensive evidence gathering, legal arguments, hearings, and deliberation. An accelerated process would be completely unprecedented and would risk appearing politically motivated rather than judicially sound. The research assistant provided no additional information suggesting any acceleration of this process. My forecast is not higher because there is no indication of emergency proceedings or any deviation from normal constitutional processes. It's not lower (not zero) only because we cannot entirely rule out some extraordinary development we're unaware of, though this would require a complete break from established German legal procedures. To update upward, I would need evidence of: (1) formal submission to the Constitutional Court, (2) the Court accepting the case on an emergency basis, and (3) credible signals of an imminent ruling. To update downward to near-zero, I would need confirmation that no formal proceedings have been initiated.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill Germany ban the AfD before July 1, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nLe Monde: [Germany's Bundestag debates banning far-right AfD party](https://www.lemonde.fr/en/international/article/2025/01/31/germany-s-bundestag-debates-banning-far-right-afd-party_6737637_4.html) \"A cross-party group of 124 MPs put a motion on the agenda to bring proceedings before the Federal Constitutional Court to ban the party, whose unprecedented alliance with the CDU caused a shock.\"\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if there is an official announcement of a ban on the Alternative for Germany (AfD) by a German government entity with the authority to make such an announcement (e.g., the Federal Constitutional Court).\n\n\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nNo additional information available.\n\nToday is 2025-05-02.\n\nBefore answering you think:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n(e) You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
