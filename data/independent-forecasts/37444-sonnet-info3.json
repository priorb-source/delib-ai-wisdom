  "information": "The European Union has expressed a lack of interest in restoring the pipeline's operation, and is reportedly preparing new sanctions against Russia. Nord Stream 2 AG has also faced legal and financial setbacks in Europe. In April 2025, a German court upheld a bank's decision to terminate the company's accounts due to U.S. sanctions risks. The company is operating under a moratorium on bankruptcy in Switzerland and has been making payments to small creditors to facilitate a larger financial settlement. One of the two pipeline strings was severely damaged in an attack in September 2022.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Approximately 56 days (from May 6, 2025 to July 1, 2025)",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No - Nord Stream 2 AG remains on the OFAC sanctions list",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "The US maintains its current sanctions policy on Nord Stream 2 AG through the resolution date. Despite White House debates mentioned in the Politico article, no policy change is implemented due to political opposition, EU resistance, ongoing Russia-Ukraine tensions, or simply insufficient time to complete the administrative process of removing the entity from the sanctions list.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "The US administration decides to lift sanctions on Nord Stream 2 AG as part of a broader diplomatic initiative, energy policy shift, or negotiation strategy with Russia. This would require formal removal from the OFAC SDN list through an administrative process completed before July 1, 2025.",
    "rationale": "The status quo strongly favors a No outcome. Nord Stream 2 AG is currently sanctioned and has been since the Russia-Ukraine conflict escalated. While the Politico article indicates White House debates about lifting sanctions, several factors work against this happening in the next 56 days: (1) The EU has expressed no interest in restoring the pipeline and is preparing new sanctions against Russia, making US sanctions relief politically difficult; (2) One pipeline string is physically damaged from the 2022 attack; (3) The company faces severe financial troubles, operating under bankruptcy moratorium in Switzerland with German banks refusing service due to sanctions risks; (4) The very short timeframe makes a significant policy reversal unlikely; (5) Domestic political costs of appearing soft on Russia remain high. The debate mentioned in the article prevents an extremely low probability (suggesting some non-zero chance of policy change), but the numerous obstacles, strong status quo bias, and lack of clear indicators of imminent change suggest the probability should remain quite low. I would update higher if there were explicit statements from senior officials about imminent sanctions relief or a major breakthrough in Russia-Ukraine negotiations. I would update lower if the administration explicitly ruled out sanctions relief or if tensions escalated further.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill the US lift its sanctions on Nord Stream 2 before July 1, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\n[White House debates lifting sanctions on Russian energy assets, Nord Stream](https://www.politico.com/news/2025/04/23/white-house-debating-lifting-sanctions-on-russian-energy-assets-00306486)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if NORD STREAM 2 AG does not appear at Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) [Sanctions List Search tool](https://sanctionssearch.ofac.treas.gov/) when checked by Metaculus on or after July 1, 2025. If it does appear on the Specially Designated Nationals and Blocked Persons (SDN) List at that time, then this question resolves as **No**.\n\nAt the time of this question, the current listing of Nord Stream 2 by OFAC can be found [here](https://sanctionssearch.ofac.treas.gov/Details.aspx?id=31926).\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nThe European Union has expressed a lack of interest in restoring the pipeline's operation, and is reportedly preparing new sanctions against Russia. Nord Stream 2 AG has also faced legal and financial setbacks in Europe. In April 2025, a German court upheld a bank's decision to terminate the company's accounts due to U.S. sanctions risks.

One of the two pipeline strings was severely damaged in an attack in September 2022.\n\nToday is 2025-05-06.\n\nBefore answering you think:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n(e) You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
