  "information": "French President Emmanuel Macron has stated that recognizing a Palestinian state is a \"moral and political obligation\" and has indicated that France may officially grant recognition during the June UN conference, although he has also tied the move to certain conditions. In May 2025, the UK announced it had joined France's initiative for the recognition of a Palestinian state. According to a report by Axios, Malta is also preparing to declare Palestine's independence at the summit on June 20. Five Arab countries—Egypt, Jordan, Qatar, the UAE, and Saudi Arabia—have announced their active participation in organizing the conference.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Approximately 1 month - the question covers June 1-30, 2025, and today is May 31, 2025, so the outcome will be known by July 1, 2025",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No - no UN member country announces new recognition of Palestine in June 2025",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "France and other countries delay their recognition decisions beyond June 2025 due to unfulfilled conditions or diplomatic considerations. The June 20 UN conference occurs but does not result in formal recognition announcements during the June timeframe, with countries opting to continue studying the matter or waiting for specific conditions to be met first.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "France, Malta, or the UK formally announces recognition of Palestine as a sovereign nation during or around the June 20 UN conference. This could occur through a coordinated announcement by multiple European nations, or through individual declarations. Malta's reported preparation to declare Palestine's independence at the summit materializes, satisfying the resolution criteria.",
    "rationale": "The research assistant's report provides strong indicators of potential June recognition: France has publicly stated recognition is a 'moral and political obligation' and may grant it during the June conference; the UK joined France's initiative in May 2025; and Malta is specifically reported to be preparing to declare Palestine's independence at the June 20 summit. These developments, combined with active Arab country participation in organizing the conference, suggest significant momentum. However, several factors prevent a higher forecast: Macron has tied French recognition to 'certain conditions' which may not be satisfied in June; diplomatic processes commonly experience delays; and the status quo strongly favors inaction as countries typically move slowly on controversial recognition issues. The forecast is not lower because we have multiple potential recognizers mentioned (not just one), a specific conference date that serves as a natural catalyst, and recent momentum with the UK joining. The forecast is not higher because France's conditions introduce uncertainty, and past patterns show Western nations are particularly cautious on Palestine recognition. I would update higher if any country explicitly commits to a June announcement date or if the conditions France mentioned are publicly confirmed as met. I would update lower if France or Malta publicly postpone or walk back recognition plans before mid-June.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill a UN member country newly recognize Palestine in June 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\n[UK joins France's initiative for recognition of Palestinian state](https://www.lemonde.fr/en/international/article/2025/05/20/uk-joins-france-s-initiative-for-recognition-of-palestinian-state_6741456_4.html)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if after May 31, 2025 and before July 1, 2025, a UN member country announces that it recognizes Palestine as a sovereign nation. Resolves based on Al Jazeera's [tracking page](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/4/10/mapping-which-countries-recognise-palestine-in-2025) or other credible sources should the tracking page not be timely updated.\n\n\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nFrench President Emmanuel Macron has stated that recognizing a Palestinian state is a \"moral and political obligation\" and has indicated that France may officially grant recognition during the June UN conference, although he has also tied the move to certain conditions.

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
