    "review": "Forecasters 2 and 3 raised several crucial pieces of information I had missed. Most importantly, Forecaster 3 identified NASA Acting Administrator Janet Petro's May 22 statement anticipating additional signings in 'coming weeks and months' - this is a direct, authoritative signal that significantly changes the probability landscape. Both forecasters also identified specific June venues I hadn't considered: the H2M2 Summit (end of May), UN COPUOS in Vienna, and the Paris Air Show. These diplomatic gatherings provide natural stages for announcements and increase coordination opportunities. Forecaster 3's Poisson-based base rate calculation (45% for at least one signing in a given month based on 3 signings in 5 months) is more rigorous than my intuitive assessment. However, I find Forecaster 2's 70% too optimistic given the absence of country-specific announcements. Forecaster 3's 55% is more balanced, though I weight the 'recent May 15 signing' factor slightly more heavily as a reason the next signing might slip to July.",
    "rationale": "After reviewing the other forecasters' analyses, I'm updating my forecast upward significantly. The most compelling new information is the May 22 NASA statement about signings in 'coming weeks and months' - this official guidance from a key stakeholder suggests an active pipeline and timeframe that includes June. The identification of specific June venues (UN COPUOS, Paris Air Show) provides concrete opportunities for ceremonial signings that I hadn't factored in. The base rate calculation of ~45% using Poisson distribution is more methodologically sound than my rough estimate. These factors collectively argue for a probability well above my initial 32%. However, I remain somewhat more cautious than Forecasters 2 and 3 because: (1) no specific country has been publicly identified, (2) the May 15 Norway signing was very recent (14 days ago), which could push the next signing into July to avoid clustering, and (3) diplomatic timelines frequently slip despite positive signals. I'm settling at 48% - substantially higher than my original forecast due to the NASA statement and venue opportunities, but slightly below Forecaster 3's 55% to account for the recency of the last signing and the absence of country-specific signals.",
