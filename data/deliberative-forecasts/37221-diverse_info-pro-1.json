    "review": "The deliberation provided two critical, countervailing points I had not fully considered. Forecaster 2 made an excellent case for upward pressure on the April figure due to the late Easter in 2025, which would almost certainly boost services inflation—a key driver of the headline number. This is a strong, tangible argument for increasing the probability of a 'Yes' outcome. Conversely, Forecaster 2 also raised the subtle but important technical point about rounding: given that data is typically reported to one decimal place, a 'Yes' resolution ('above 2.2%') effectively requires a print of 2.3% or higher. This raises the bar for a 'Yes' and acts as a strong counterweight. Forecaster 3 reinforced the underlying 'No' case by citing specific disinflationary evidence like weak PMIs and decelerating wage growth, confirming the broader economic context remains soft. While Forecaster 2's forecast of 64% seems too high given the rounding hurdle and economist consensus, and Forecaster 3's 18% appears to underweight the immediate, one-off impact of the Easter holiday, their combined arguments provide a much clearer picture of the competing forces at play.",
    "rationale": "My initial forecast of 30% was based on the prevailing disinflationary trend and expert consensus, balanced against the risk of sticky services inflation. The deliberation has convinced me to update my forecast. I am increasing my probability because Forecaster 2's point about the late Easter holiday is a compelling, specific, and causal factor for higher services inflation in April. This single seasonal driver could easily be strong enough to counteract the general disinflationary trend for one month and push the headline figure up from the 2.2% seen in March. However, I am not raising my forecast more significantly for two reasons. First, the rounding nuance identified by Forecaster 2 means the true inflation rate must likely reach at least 2.25% to be reported as 2.3% and resolve as 'Yes'. This is a meaningful barrier. Second, the strong evidence of broad economic weakness and slowing price pressures detailed by Forecaster 3 confirms that the underlying fundamental trend is still downwards. Therefore, while the Easter effect introduces a significant risk of a temporary spike, the base case remains that inflation will hover near the threshold. I am moving my forecast from 30% to 42%, reflecting a materially higher chance of a 'Yes' outcome due to the Easter effect, but still acknowledging that 'No' remains the more probable scenario given the combined fundamental and technical barriers.",
