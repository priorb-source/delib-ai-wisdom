    "review": "Both forecasters largely align with my take on persistence and weak demand. Forecaster 2 added two useful nuances: (1) May’s Day holiday effects are largely in the YoY base, so services uplift may not materially flip the headline; and (2) May often sees softer food prices, which supports continued mild deflation. Forecaster 3 raised an important operational point: resolution hinges on the FRED series where rounding near zero could determine the outcome, making a +0.0/+0.1 result plausible even if momentum is weak. Neither provided decisive new high-frequency data, but the rounding/base-effect caution slightly tempers my confidence versus my prior 66%.",
    "rationale": "We have three consecutive negative YoY prints into April, with macro conditions (property drag, soft domestic demand, negative/soft PPI) still arguing for persistence. Energy’s YoY impulse is roughly neutral, and food—especially pork and fresh produce—likely remained soft in May, which leans toward another small negative. The early-May holiday can lift services prices, but that effect was present last year too, limiting the YoY push. Net: a close call around zero with a tilt to negative. I’m nudging my probability down modestly (66% -> 64%) to reflect the base-versus-May-2024 not being especially favorable and the heightened sensitivity to rounding near zero in the FRED series.",
