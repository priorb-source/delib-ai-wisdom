    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Approximately 2 months, from May 1, 2025 to July 1, 2025",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No - no agreement is announced",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Negotiations continue but encounter delays due to bureaucratic approval processes, technical specifications disagreements, or financial terms. The deal may be progressing but the formal announcement is delayed beyond July 1 as both governments work through the complexities of what would be South Korea's first defense arms sale to Vietnam. Alternative scenarios include Vietnam deciding to pursue other suppliers or the deal requiring more extensive legislative or political review than anticipated.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "The ongoing negotiations successfully conclude within the next two months. Both governments finalize the agreement terms and make a public announcement before July 1. Given the strategic significance of this being South Korea's first defense sale to Vietnam, both parties prioritize completing and announcing the deal. The announcement covers an agreement for at least 2 self-propelled howitzers, even if the full 20-unit deal or delivery timelines extend beyond the announcement date.",
    "rationale": "The question has both encouraging and concerning elements. On the positive side: (1) negotiations are already actively underway according to the Korea Herald report, suggesting this isn't starting from scratch; (2) the question only requires an announcement of agreement for 2+ howitzers, not actual delivery, which is a much lower bar; (3) the strategic importance of being South Korea's first defense sale to Vietnam may motivate both sides to conclude and announce it. On the negative side: (1) the timeline is very tight at only 2 months; (2) defense agreements typically involve complex negotiations over specifications, financing, training, and maintenance; (3) the research assistant found no additional updates, suggesting no recent progress reports; (4) as a first-time defense sale between these countries, it may face additional scrutiny and approval hurdles. The lack of recent reporting is particularly concerning - if the deal were imminent, we might expect more media coverage. Defense agreements can take 6-12 months or longer from initial negotiations to announcement. However, the fact that the $300 million, 20-unit deal is already being discussed publicly suggests substantive progress. For my forecast to move higher, I would need: evidence of accelerated negotiations, statements from officials indicating imminent conclusion, or reports of final approval stages. For it to move lower, I would need: reports of stalled negotiations, competing bids from other suppliers, or political complications. Applying appropriate status quo bias - the world changes slowly and most things that haven't happened yet don't happen in short windows - I estimate a 40% probability.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill Vietnam and South Korea announce an agreement for South Korea to export self-propelled howitzers to Vietnam?\n\nQuestion background:\nThe Korea Herald: [South Korea-Vietnam ties enter new strategic terrain, but need more detailed road map: Seoul envoy](https://www.koreaherald.com/article/10464718) \"Vietnam is reportedly in negotiations to import 20 units of K9 self-propelled howitzers from Korea in a deal valued at $300 million. If finalized, it would mark Korea’s first defense arms sale to the country.\"\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if, before July 1, 2025, the governments of Vietnam and/or South Korea announce an agreement for South Korea to export 2 or more self-propelled howitzers to Vietnam. If no such agreement is announced after the launch of this question and before July 1, 2025, this question resolves as **No**.\n\n\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nNo additional information available.\n\nToday is 2025-05-01.\n\nBefore answering you think:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n(e) You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
