    "review": "Both forecasters emphasize the very high rhetorical/legal threshold for the U.S. to use “blockade,” strong historical restraint (including 1995–96), ongoing diplomacy, and the short window—points I largely shared. Forecaster 2’s 15% feels high given the need for unambiguous, sustained interdiction and the U.S.’s strong incentive to avoid language implying an act of war. Forecaster 3’s base-rate argument and focus on sticky diplomatic norms are persuasive. Importantly, I previously overweighted a near-term “inauguration” trigger that doesn’t exist in this window—removing that reduces near-term escalation risk. Neither forecaster added fundamentally new evidence, but their framing reinforces the low-probability baseline and highlights the necessity of clear, sustained port denial for U.S. officials to break from established language discipline.",
    "rationale": "The outcome requires the U.S. government to publicly accuse China of blockading at least one Taiwanese seaport. That implies China actively and verifiably preventing merchant access, not just exercises or temporary exclusion zones. The U.S. has consistently avoided the term even during highly coercive drills, because calling something a blockade carries serious legal and escalatory implications. China’s pattern favors gray-zone coercion and time-bounded drills that stop short of enforceable closures. With roughly eight weeks left, there is no current indicator of sustained interdiction at a specific port, and U.S.-China diplomatic channels remain open. I slightly lower my estimate after correcting my own earlier (incorrect) assumption about a near-term inauguration trigger. I would move up if we saw China implement and enforce maritime control measures that physically turn away commercial traffic at a named port, or if senior U.S. officials began using “de facto blockade” language. I would move down with continued drills that allow commercial access, plus ongoing U.S. linguistic restraint and active diplomacy.",
