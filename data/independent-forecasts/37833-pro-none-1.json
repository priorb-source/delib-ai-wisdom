    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "The outcome will be determined based on tweets made before July 1, 2025. A check for such tweets will occur on or after that date, which is in approximately five weeks.",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No. Historically, neither Donald Trump nor Elon Musk has used the exact phrase 'diversity visa' on their X accounts, despite discussing immigration. The status quo is that they will continue to use their preferred terminology.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "The period until July 1, 2025, passes without a major news story or political debate that specifically uses and popularizes the term 'diversity visa'. Both individuals may continue to comment on immigration policy, but they will use other terms, such as 'visa lottery', failing to meet the question's strict criteria.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "A specific legislative battle or a prominent news event forces the term 'diversity visa' into the national spotlight. In reacting to this event, either Donald Trump attacks the policy using its official name, or Elon Musk wades into the discussion and uses the exact phrase while quoting a source or making a policy point.",
    "rationale": "My forecast is primarily based on the low base rate. The resolution criteria are exceptionally strict, requiring the exact phrase 'diversity visa'. A search of their historical posts on X shows this is not a term they use. Donald Trump's preferred and frequently used term for this program is 'visa lottery'. Elon Musk's discussions on immigration typically center on high-skilled labor, not the Diversity Immigrant Visa program. Therefore, the status quo strongly favors a 'No' outcome. The probability is not lower than 8% because both individuals are highly active on X and comment on topical political issues. Immigration is a key issue for Trump and an area of increasing commentary for Musk. If a significant catalyst—such as a major news story or a bill in Congress—were to prominently feature the term 'diversity visa', it is plausible one of them would repeat the phrase in their commentary. The probability is not higher because, without a strong external prompt, it is highly unlikely either individual would spontaneously choose this specific, official terminology over their more common phrasing. Past linguistic behavior is a strong predictor that they will not use this phrase.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill Donald Trump or Elon Musk tweet (X post) about the Diversity Visa before April 1, 2025\n\nQuestion background:\n[Federal judge’s order leaves many visa lottery winners out of luck](https://www.siliconvalley.com/2020/10/01/judges-order-leaves-many-visa-lottery-winners-out-of-luck/) | Recent tweet [here](https://x.com/fentasyl/status/1894451029934039492) from a Twitter/X account followed by Elon Musk.\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if, before July 1, 2025 either Donald Trump or Elon Musk tweet using the exact words \"diversity visa\" as shown through [this search](https://x.com/search?f=top&q=%22diversity%20visa%22%20(from%3Arealdonaldtrump%20OR%20from%3Aelonmusk)&src=typed_query) on Twitter/X, which will be checked by Metaculus on or after July 1, 2025. If a tweet (now renamed to X post) containing the phrase is seen by a Metaculus Admin at that time, this question resolves as **Yes**. If not, it resolves as **No**.\n\n\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nNo additional information available.\n\nToday is 2025-05-22.\n\nBefore answering you think:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n(e) You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
