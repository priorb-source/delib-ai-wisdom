  "information": "The University of Michigan's final Index of Consumer Sentiment (ICS) for May 2025 was 52.2, the same as the final reading for April. This followed a decline from 64.7 in February and 57.0 in March, marking a nearly 30% drop since January. The index's components also declined in April, with the Current Economic Conditions Index falling to 59.8 and the Economic Expectations Index dropping to 47.3. Consumers' short-term (one-year) inflation expectations reported in the survey rose to 6.5% in April, the highest since November 1981, while long-term inflation expectations increased to 4.4%. Historically, from 2010 to 2019, index increases of 8 points or more in a single month occurred less than 3% of the time.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Approximately 3 weeks",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Persistent concerns about high inflation and future economic conditions, coupled with a lack of significant positive economic news, cause the sentiment index to stagnate or decline further from its current low level, remaining well below the 60.0 threshold.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "A combination of surprisingly good economic data, such as a lower-than-expected inflation report and a strong jobs report released in early June, causes a sharp reversal in consumer outlook, driving the index up by the required 8+ points to exceed 60.0.",
    "rationale": "My forecast is based on the significant gap between the current sentiment level and the question's threshold, the recent negative trend, and historical data on the index's volatility. The May 2025 final reading was 52.2, which would require a substantial increase of nearly 8 points in a single month to resolve as 'Yes'. The research assistant's report highlights that such an increase is historically rare, occurring less than 3% of the time in the 2010-2019 period. The underlying components of the index, particularly the forward-looking Index of Consumer Expectations (47.3), are very weak, and consumer inflation expectations remain elevated, which are significant headwinds against a rapid sentiment recovery. The status quo is firmly in the 'No' territory. My forecast is not lower because sentiment has stabilized between April and May, suggesting the rapid decline may have paused, and there is always a non-zero chance of a significant positive economic surprise. My forecast is not higher because the required jump is historically improbable, and the current macroeconomic environment, dominated by inflation concerns, provides no clear catalyst for such a sharp rebound. I would increase my probability forecast upon seeing a much lower-than-expected CPI report for May or a surprisingly strong June jobs report. Conversely, I would lower it if energy prices spike or initial jobless claims rise unexpectedly.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill the June 2025 University of Michigan Consumer Sentiment Final Report number be greater than 60.0?\n\nQuestion background:\nAxios: [Why the consumer sentiment plunge is different now](https://www.axios.com/2025/05/19/tariffs-consumer-economy-sentiment)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if the University of Michigan's reported June Final Results of the Index of Consumer Sentiment, expected to be posted [here](https://data.sca.isr.umich.edu/reports.php) on the final Friday of June 2025, is greater than 60.0 for June 2025. Less than or equal to that amount resolves the question as **No**.\n\n\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nThe University of Michigan's final Index of Consumer Sentiment (ICS) for May 2025 was 52.2, the same as the final reading for April.

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
