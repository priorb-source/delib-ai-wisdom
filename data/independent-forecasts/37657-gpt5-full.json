  "information": "A novel bat coronavirus, HKU5-CoV-2, has been identified and is part of the Merbecovirus family, which includes the MERS virus. Research published in the journal 'Cell' confirms that the virus can bind to human ACE2 receptors and infect human airway and organoid cultures in laboratory settings. However, studies also indicate that its cell-entry efficiency is significantly lower than that of SARS-CoV-2.\n\nAs of May 16, 2025, no human cases of HKU5-CoV-2 have been reported by any major global health organizations, including the WHO, US CDC, ProMED, or GISAID. Post-COVID surveillance systems are in place in several countries, including China, Korea, and the U.S., which involve routine metagenomic sequencing of severe acute respiratory infection (SARI) cases. To date, these surveillance efforts have not detected any signals of HKU5-CoV-2 in human populations.\n\nHistorically, of the approximately 50 novel bat coronaviruses described in scientific literature since 2000, only SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 have produced confirmed human cases within a year of their first description. The rate of publicly reported accidental laboratory infections for such viruses is also low, estimated at approximately one per decade worldwide.",

    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "~45 days (until July 1, 2025)",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No human cases reported by WHO/CDC (or similar credible sources).",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "HKU5-CoV-2 remains confined to bats or other animals, with no spillover to humans detected by routine SARI/metagenomic surveillance; no laboratory-associated infections occur; consequently, no WHO/CDC communication acknowledging a human case appears before July 1.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "A single spillover is detected via hospital-based metagenomic sequencing (e.g., in China, Korea, or the U.S.) and publicly confirmed; or a laboratory-associated infection is identified and reported; WHO/CDC (or another credible source) issues a notice acknowledging at least one confirmed human case before July 1.",
    "rationale": "Baseline and timing: With only ~45 days left, the base rate for a brand-new bat coronavirus producing a confirmed, publicly reported human case in this short window is very low. Historically, among ~50 novel bat CoVs described since 2000, only SARS-CoV and SARS‑CoV‑2 yielded confirmed human cases within a year of description (≈4%/year), and both were extraordinary outliers. Scaling that to 1.5 months implies a sub‑1% base rate before considering other evidence.\nVirology and surveillance: The research assistant notes that HKU5‑CoV‑2 (a Merbecovirus) can bind human ACE2 and infect human airway/organoid cultures but with substantially lower entry efficiency than SARS‑CoV‑2. That raises biological plausibility of spillover but still points to limited immediate transmissibility. Importantly, as of May 16, 2025, no signals have appeared in WHO, US CDC, ProMED, or GISAID. Multiple countries (China, Korea, U.S.) run ongoing metagenomic/SARI surveillance that would likely flag an unusual coronavirus, yet none have. This supports the status quo “No” outcome.\nPathways to a Yes: The main avenues are (1) a detected zoonotic spillover identified by sequencing in a hospitalized SARI case, or (2) a lab‑associated infection. The RA’s estimate for publicly reported accidental lab infections for such viruses is ~1 per decade worldwide; over 45 days that is tiny, and only a fraction of that risk would pertain to this specific virus. Zoonotic spillover in the next 1–2 months is possible but unlikely given the short horizon and lack of any precursor signals (animal outbreaks, serology hints, or clusters in cavers/miners).\nReporting threshold: The question resolves on credible public reporting (especially WHO/CDC). Even if a sporadic case occurs, it must be recognized, sequenced, and linked to HKU5‑CoV‑2 specifically; naming ambiguity could further reduce the chance of a qualifying report in time.\nWhy not higher: Short time window, no current signals, lower in vitro entry efficiency, and historically low rates of new bat CoVs producing promptly detected human cases all argue for a small probability.\nWhy not lower: The virus can infect human cells; surveillance is reasonably sensitive and could catch a single spillover; and only one confirmed and publicly reported human case is needed. Active research work introduces a small but nonzero lab‑associated risk.\nUpdates that would raise my forecast: credible reports of animal infections near humans with high viral loads; a confirmed cluster of unusual pneumonia with a novel merbecovirus sequence; preprints or official notices indicating suspected human infection; evidence of efficient transmission in animal models. Updates that would lower it: weeks of continued global silence from surveillance feeds; new data showing poor replication in human airway cells or strong receptor incompatibility; clarification that HKU5‑CoV‑2 reports were misclassification or not under active study.",

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any).
