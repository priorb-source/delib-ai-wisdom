    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "About 57 days (until July 1, 2025)",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "SB 153 or similar bills receive hearings but stall in committee, or only one chamber passes a version before June-end as the General Assembly prioritizes the biennial budget; no identical bill clears both chambers by July 1.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Senate leadership fast-tracks SB 153 (or similar language) to a floor vote in May/June and the House passes the identical text, or the provision is folded into the late-June budget omnibus and both chambers approve it before June 30 (governor action is not needed for resolution).",
    "rationale": "- Context and bar for resolution: The bar is passage of identical language by both chambers before July 1; gubernatorial action is explicitly not required for this question. That makes enactment easier than typical. Any subset of voters newly required to provide documentary proof of citizenship would count, but the bill must impose a proof requirement on voters, not just back-end data checks.\n- Partisan/control factors: Ohio is a Republican trifecta, and Senate sponsors (Gavarone, Brenner) indicate leadership interest. Ohio voters also approved a 2022 constitutional amendment barring non-citizen voting, suggesting GOP appetite for related policy.\n- Timing and process headwinds: The remaining window is short (≈8 weeks) and coincides with high-intensity budget negotiations (Ohio’s biennial operating budget must pass by June 30 in odd-numbered years). Historically, non-budget policy often slows during this period unless designated a leadership priority or folded into the omnibus. The House, under Speaker Stephens, has at times been more cautious on contentious policy, and Senate–House frictions could impede quick bicameral agreement on identical language.\n- Legal/policy friction: Proof-of-citizenship measures have faced federal preemption issues under the NVRA for federal elections (e.g., Kansas/Arizona litigation). While legal viability is immaterial for resolution, that controversy can make leadership less likely to prioritize or include the provision in the must-pass budget.\n- Paths to Yes still exist: The Senate could move quickly, and the House could concur or accept its inclusion in the budget. Because only bicameral passage is needed, even a late-June push could satisfy the criterion.\n- Why not higher: Limited calendar, budget dominance of floor time, and House dynamics reduce the odds of bicameral passage of identical language by July 1.\n- Why not lower: Active sponsorship, GOP control of both chambers, and the ability to attach to the budget keep a non-trivial chance alive.\n- What would move me up: Scheduled and completed committee hearings with swift favorable reports in both chambers; public statements from Senate/House leadership signaling priority or intent to include in the budget; an actual Senate floor date or passage; House companion moving in parallel; budget drafts containing the provision.\n- What would move me down: Indications that leadership is limiting policy riders in the budget; lack of committee movement by early June; reports of intra-GOP opposition or trade-offs pushing the item to post-budget timing.\n- Research assistant: Provided no additional information beyond the cited press link; thus the estimate leans on institutional timing, partisan control, and typical Ohio legislative workflow in budget season.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nBefore July 1, 2025, will Ohio enact legislation expanding its verification requirements of a voter's citizenship?\n\nQuestion background:\nThe Ohio Senate: [Gavarone, Brenner Introduce Bill to Require Proof of Citizenship to Vote](https://ohiosenate.gov/members/theresa-gavarone/news/gavarone-brenner-introduce-bill-to-require-proof-of-citizenship-to-vote)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if, before July 1, 2025, the state of Ohio enacts legislation requiring voters to provide proof of US citizenship beyond the requirements at the time of this question, according to [credible sources](https://www.metaculus.com/faq/#definitions).\n\nAny subset of voters being required to provide such proof would count (for example if it only applied to first-time voter registrants or creating a new requirement for mail-in voters). An example of a bill that would count is [Senate Bill 153](https://www.legislature.ohio.gov/legislation/136/sb153). This question resolves upon enactment; therefore other questions such as when the legislation takes effect or whether it survives court challenges and is implemented is immaterial to this question's resolution. Please note that under Ohio law, a bill is considered enacted \"after both houses have passed and agreed on identical bills.\" ([Source](https://www.lsc.ohio.gov/assets/organizations/legislative-service-commission/files/chapter-5-enacting-legislation-10021971.pdf))\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nNo additional information available.\n\nToday is 2025-05-05.\n\nBefore answering you think:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n(e) You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
