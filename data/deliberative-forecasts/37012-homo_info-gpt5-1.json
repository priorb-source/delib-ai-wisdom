    "review": "Both forecasters’ priors and structure match mine: geography and 2021 baseline favor Conservatives as largest, but national headwinds, Reform vote-splitting, and boundary changes raise the risk they’re overtaken. New/useful angles: the interplay of multi‑member wards with fragmented opposition; the possibility of a coordinated Lib Dem push in rural/market‑town wards; and candidate‑coverage dynamics (full slates vs patchy). I’m cautious about Forecaster 2’s specific national VI numbers (Reform ahead of both main parties seems unlikely for locals), but the core point—right‑of‑centre fragmentation risk—is valid. I also weigh that Lib Dems have no current seats here, implying a high bar for sudden rural breakthroughs, though boundary changes increase variance. The Wellingborough signal (Forecaster 3) is regionally relevant but weak for this authority specifically.",
    "rationale": "Baseline: Conservatives start from a dominant 2021 result and a structurally favorable map outside Northampton. Opposition remains fragmented (Labour/Lib Dem/Green/Reform), which typically preserves a Conservative plurality even amid sizeable losses. \n\nHeadwinds: National environment is poor for Conservatives; leader not re‑standing removes some incumbency; new boundaries and a likely higher Northampton seat share aid Labour; Reform’s presence can split the right and cost Tories seats. If Labour sweeps most Northampton wards and either Lib Dems or Independents pick up a handful in peri‑urban/rural areas while Reform depresses Tory tallies, Labour could edge ahead in total seats.\n\nTailwinds: Lib Dem base looks weak locally (0 seats pre‑election), limiting their ability to capitalize broadly in rural wards; Reform historically fields incomplete slates and often underperforms its headline vote share; multi‑member wards can still return 1–2 Conservatives on reduced votes. These factors make “Conservatives largest but likely short of a majority” the modal outcome.\n\nUpdate: I modestly trim my probability to reflect (a) increased uncertainty from boundary changes that may shift weight toward Northampton, and (b) the plausible combination of Labour dominance in the town plus right‑of‑centre fragmentation elsewhere. I don’t move as far down as others because local Lib Dem weakness and typical Reform underperformance still argue for a Conservative plurality.\n",
