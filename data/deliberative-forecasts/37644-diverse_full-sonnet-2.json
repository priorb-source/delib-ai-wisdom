    "review": "All three forecasters reach very similar conclusions with strong agreement on the fundamental factors: extremely short timeframe (46 days), recent major funding round (March 2025), absence of preparatory signals, low base rates, and deep private capital relationships. Forecaster 2 and I converge at 3%, while Forecaster 3 goes to 8%. The key difference is how much weight to assign to 'surprise announcement' scenarios. Forecaster 3 makes a valid point that companies can quietly prepare and announce a confidential S-1 submission, and that the resolution criteria only require announcing PLANS rather than executing an IPO. However, I believe this scenario is already adequately captured in my 3% forecast. Even confidential S-1 announcements typically follow months of preparation involving banks, lawyers, and auditors - work that generates detectable signals in financial media. The complete absence of any such signals, combined with the March 2025 funding round occurring just two months ago, makes even a 'surprise' announcement highly unlikely. Forecaster 3's higher probability seems to overweight the 'anything can happen in AI' factor while underweighting how informative the absence of evidence really is for a company of Anthropic's size and visibility. Companies valued at $60B+ don't make capital markets decisions on compressed timelines without extensive preparation.",
    "rationale": "After reviewing the other forecasts, I find strong consensus on the core analysis but disagree with moving higher than 3%. The evidence remains overwhelmingly against an announcement: (1) Only 46 days remain - insufficient time even for streamlined processes; (2) March 2025 funding was extremely recent, and companies virtually never announce IPO plans 2-3 months after a major private round; (3) Zero preparatory signals exist - for a company of this profile, bank mandates, confidential filing leaks, or executive moves would typically surface weeks before any announcement; (4) Strategic investors Amazon and Google provide ongoing capital access, eliminating funding pressure; (5) Base rates for decacorn IPOs are 1-2 per year, and condensing this to a 46-day window makes it far less likely. My 3% already accounts for the scenarios Forecaster 3 describes: the loose resolution criteria (just announcing plans), the possibility of confidential S-1 announcements, and corporate surprises in dynamic sectors. I explicitly noted these factors in my original forecast. The case for 8% would require believing surprise announcements are more common than the evidence suggests. In reality, even 'surprise' IPO announcements follow detectable preparation. I'm not updating lower because genuine uncertainty remains and 3% appropriately reflects tail-risk scenarios. I'm not updating higher because the cumulative evidence against an announcement is too strong.",
