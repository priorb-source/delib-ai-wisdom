  "information": "On May 2, 2025, U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio explicitly denied a Politico report that the administration was considering lifting sanctions on Nord Stream 2, calling the claim 'unequivocally false.' Both Rubio and U.S. Secretary of the Interior Doug Burgum are reported to be opponents of the idea. Furthermore, reports from May 5, 2025, indicated that President Trump is considering a bipartisan bill that would impose 500% tariffs on countries importing Russian energy and expand existing sanctions.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "~56 days (until July 1, 2025)",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No — Nord Stream 2 AG remains on OFAC’s SDN List as of July 1, 2025.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "The administration maintains current Russia sanctions amid hawkish internal views and congressional pressure; OFAC takes no delisting action, so Nord Stream 2 AG continues to appear in the SDN List search when checked on/after July 1.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "OFAC removes Nord Stream 2 AG from the SDN List before July 1 as part of a broader policy shift (e.g., a negotiated package on Russia sanctions) or a technical delisting tied to corporate dissolution/changed circumstances, and it does not reappear by July 1.",
    "rationale": "- Time horizon: Only ~8 weeks remain. Major sanctions reversals, especially on high-salience Russia targets, are uncommon over such a short period absent a clear strategic pivot.\n- Status quo: Nord Stream 2 AG has been on the SDN List since 2022 and remains so. The pipeline is physically damaged and not in use; there is little practical upside to delisting now, which reduces incentives to spend political capital.\n- Recent signals (from research assistant): On May 2, 2025, Secretary of State Rubio called reports of considering lifting sanctions on Nord Stream 2 “unequivocally false,” and Interior Secretary Burgum is reportedly opposed. On May 5, reporting indicated President Trump is weighing a bipartisan bill to impose 500% tariffs on countries importing Russian energy and to expand sanctions. These point toward tightening, not loosening, over the next two months.\n- Politics/congressional dynamics: Any delisting before a broader Russia policy shift would invite bipartisan criticism. With Congress exploring even harsher measures, Treasury/State are unlikely to delist a marquee Russian-linked entity imminently.\n- Administrative/logistical considerations: OFAC can delist quickly, but high-profile delistings typically follow a clear change in circumstances or strategy and are publicly explained. There is no visible trigger yet (e.g., a Ukraine ceasefire framework, a coordinated allied shift, or a legal requirement).\n- Why not lower: The Politico report of internal debate suggests at least some consideration inside the administration; policy reversals can happen quickly, and OFAC could also pursue a technical delisting if the entity’s legal status meaningfully changes. U.S. policy under Trump can be volatile, so a non-zero chance remains.\n- What would raise my forecast: Credible, on-record signals from the White House, State, or Treasury indicating intent to recalibrate Russia energy sanctions; leaks corroborated by multiple outlets that a delisting package is imminent; Federal Register/OFAC advance notices; or a broader diplomatic deal involving Russia sanctions relief.\n- What would lower my forecast: Public commitment by the President, State, or Treasury to expand Russia sanctions; legislative movement toward codifying or tightening energy-related sanctions; new Russia-related escalations that harden the policy stance; or OFAC adding related entities to the SDN List.\nOverall, the short timeline, hawkish signals, low policy payoff to delisting, and congressional environment favor a No resolution.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill the US lift its sanctions on Nord Stream 2 before July 1, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\n[White House debates lifting sanctions on Russian energy assets, Nord Stream](https://www.politico.com/news/2025/04/23/white-house-debating-lifting-sanctions-on-russian-energy-assets-00306486)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if NORD STREAM 2 AG does not appear at Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) [Sanctions List Search tool](https://sanctionssearch.ofac.treas.gov/) when checked by Metaculus on or after July 1, 2025. If it does appear on the Specially Designated Nationals and Blocked Persons (SDN) List at that time, then this question resolves as **No**.\n\nAt the time of this question, the current listing of Nord Stream 2 by OFAC can be found [here](https://sanctionssearch.ofac.treas.gov/Details.aspx?id=31926).\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nOn May 2, 2025, U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio explicitly denied a Politico report that the administration was considering lifting sanctions on Nord Stream 2, calling the claim 'unequivocally false.' Both Rubio and U.S. Secretary of the Interior Doug Burgum are reported to be opponents of the idea.

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
