    "review": "The other two forecasters and I are in strong agreement on the fundamental dynamics of this question. We all concur that: 1) The FATF 'black list' has extremely high inertia; 2) The removal of any of the three currently listed jurisdictions (North Korea, Iran, Myanmar) is highly improbable within this timeframe; 3) The only plausible path to a 'Yes' outcome is the addition of a new jurisdiction from the 'grey list'. The core of the deliberation, therefore, is about the likelihood of such an addition. Both forecasters provided sound reasoning that aligns closely with my own. The main point of divergence is the precise probability, which hinges on how much weight we assign to un-signaled 'tail risk' events versus the importance of the current lack of public warning signs. Forecaster 2's argument for 10% is compelling, emphasizing that escalations are typically preceded by clear public signals which are currently absent. Forecaster 3's argument, which supports my initial 15%, helpfully specified the tail risk by naming fragile states like Haiti and Yemen where a sudden collapse of governance could trigger a blacklisting, an argument I find persuasive.",
    "rationale": "After reviewing my peers' analyses, I am updating my forecast slightly downward. My initial forecast of 15% was based on the high inertia of the list balanced against the general risk of geopolitical instability. I found Forecaster 2's argument that major escalations, like the recent additions of Iran and Myanmar, are usually preceded by a period of public warnings and missed deadlines very convincing. The current lack of such signals for any of the ~20 grey-listed jurisdictions is a strong piece of evidence in favor of the status quo and suggests my initial 15% was likely too high. However, I also agree with Forecaster 3's point that several fragile states on the grey list (e.g., Haiti, Yemen, South Sudan) present a unique tail risk of sudden state failure, which might trigger a blacklisting outside of the normal escalation process. This specific, plausible risk-path prevents me from dropping my forecast as low as 10%. Therefore, I am moderating my initial forecast to account for the compelling argument regarding the lack of warning signs, while still weighting the 'fragile state collapse' scenario slightly more than Forecaster 2 appears to. I am revising my probability from 15% down to 12%.",
