    "review": "I have reviewed the analyses of two other forecasters, who predicted 20% and 8% respectively, compared to my initial 5%. I found the analysis by Forecaster 3 (8%) to be the most insightful and persuasive. Their key argument, which I had not fully appreciated, is that the nature of a 'challenge to his detention' often implies that removal is *not* reasonably foreseeable. Courts typically entertain these challenges precisely because deportation is not imminent, questioning the legality of prolonged detention. The fact this challenge is 'moving forward' is a strong piece of evidence against a 'Yes' outcome within the very short 48-day timeframe. In contrast, I found Forecaster 2's 20% probability to be too high, as it seems to place excessive weight on general uncertainty without being grounded in the specifics of immigration law or the signals from the case itself.",
    "rationale": "Forecaster 3's analysis significantly strengthens my conviction that the probability of deportation before July 1, 2025, is very low. My initial forecast was based on the general principle of bureaucratic and legal slowness. Forecaster 3 added a specific, compelling mechanism: the legal premise of a detention challenge often rests on the non-imminence of removal. This makes the status quo (continued legal proceedings and detention) even more durable than I had initially thought. However, I am making a slight upward adjustment to my forecast, from 5% to 7%. This is primarily to incorporate the nuance, also raised by Forecaster 3, that a 'Yes' outcome remains possible if the detention challenge is narrowly focused on custody and is proceeding parallel to a deportation process where all other logistical hurdles (like travel documents) have already been cleared. My initial 5% may have slightly understated this narrow possibility. This minor update brings my forecast into closer alignment with the analysis I found most compelling, while still reflecting a very low probability of the event occurring.",
