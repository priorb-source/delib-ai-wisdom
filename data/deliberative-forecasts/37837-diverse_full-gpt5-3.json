    "review": "Both forecasters largely echo the same base-rate argument I used: recent monthly counts comfortably exceed 400, with Jan–Apr 2025 averaging ~517 and each month >400. They highlight similar upside catalysts (media/government attention, Contact in the Desert) and the same key downside risk (single-point-of-failure/operational issues at NUFORC). Forecaster 2’s framing (a >20% drop needed from the 2025 average to get near 400) is a helpful way to see the cushion. Neither added concrete evidence of a methodology change or a structural reason for a sudden drop. They did not discuss the specific resolution nuance of potential early-July posting lags; otherwise their reasoning is aligned and sound. Their slightly lower probabilities (87–90%) reflect caution rather than new disconfirming information.",
    "rationale": "The threshold math and recent trend remain very favorable: June needs >400 over 30 days (~13.3/day). Jan–Apr 2025 averaged ~17/day and each month cleared 400, and post-2020 baselines suggest June is not unusually weak. Known drivers (ongoing UAP attention, seasonal outdoor activity, late-May/early-June conference) modestly support at least status-quo volumes. The main risks are operational: NUFORC site/intake outages, an unannounced methodology tightening, or an unusually slow posting cadence that depresses the displayed June count if checked very early in July. I already incorporated those risks in my initial forecast. The other forecasters’ arguments don’t introduce new evidence that would materially change the balance. Given the comfortable cushion above the threshold and absence of a specific disruption signal, I am keeping a high but not near-certain forecast. I would revise downward only if late-May/early-June daily pace looked <13/day or if NUFORC announced intake/method changes; upward if May 2025 posts at ≥500 and early June shows typical or elevated pace.",
