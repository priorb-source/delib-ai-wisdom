    "review": "Both forecasters reinforce the core logic I used: very short timeline, escalating authoritarian trajectory, and limited external leverage make a rapid reversal unlikely. Forecaster 2 usefully stresses that a quick U-turn would be a conspicuous admission of weakness for the junta, which aligns with authoritarian behavior literature. Forecaster 3 highlights how exceptionally recent the decree is (days old), which further reduces odds of a walk-back before July 1. Neither introduces new concrete signals of mounting pressure or elite fracture. One additional nuance I’d add: even tactical “partial” relaxations (e.g., permitting regime-aligned associations) would not meet this market’s bar, which requires a clear announcement restoring parties broadly. This raises the bar further for a Yes. Overall, their reasoning is convincing and nudges me slightly lower, mainly due to the emphasis on recency and reputational costs of a reversal.",
    "rationale": "The junta’s move fits a clear pattern of tightening control (from suspending to dissolving parties) and aligns with its strategic interests ahead of any future governance arrangement with allied regimes (AES). External leverage is muted after the ECOWAS break and pivot to alternative partners; donor or IFI conditionality is unlikely to bite on a sub-40-day horizon. Domestic mobilization sufficient to force a climbdown seems improbable in that window, and Mali’s institutions are unlikely to check the decree. The resolution requires an explicit reversal allowing broad party formation, a high bar that tactical concessions would not satisfy. I’m trimming my forecast from 8% to 7% to reflect the decree’s extreme recency and the reputational cost of a quick reversal underscored by the other forecasters. I would move up on credible signs of: large, sustained protests; elite splits; or near-term financial/diplomatic conditionality explicitly tied to reinstating parties. I would move down on further repressive steps or legal entrenchment of a non-party framework.",
