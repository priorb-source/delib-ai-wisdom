    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "The resolution window is June 10-30, 2025, a 21-day period starting in 5 days. The outcome will be known by July 1, 2025.",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No - no MEPs resign during the specified window. MEPs typically continue in their positions, and resignations are relatively rare events.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "All 705 current MEPs continue in their positions throughout June 10-30, 2025. The Huawei lobbying scandal either doesn't implicate specific MEPs severely enough to trigger resignations, or any resignations occur outside the narrow 21-day window (before June 10 or after June 30).",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "One or more MEPs announce resignation during June 10-30, 2025. This could result from the Huawei lobbying scandal intensifying and forcing implicated MEPs to step down, or from unrelated factors such as health issues, accepting other political positions, personal reasons, or other scandals emerging during this period.",
    "rationale": "The European Parliament has 705 members, and I need to assess the probability of at least one resignation in a specific 21-day window. Base rate analysis: MEP resignations occur but are relatively uncommon. Historically, perhaps 5-15 MEPs resign per year for various reasons (scandals, health, new positions). This translates to roughly 0.3-0.9 expected resignations in a random 21-day period (5.75% of a year). The May 21, 2025 Huawei lobbying scandal reference suggests potential pressure on certain MEPs, which could increase resignation probability above the base rate. However, several factors keep my forecast moderate: (1) The specific 21-day window is narrow - resignations could occur before June 10 or after June 30; (2) Many political scandals don't immediately result in resignations - there are often investigations, denials, and drawn-out processes; (3) We have no concrete evidence of specific MEPs planning to resign; (4) Status quo bias - most days pass without MEP resignations. My forecast is not higher because: without specific names or severity of the scandal, I can't assume resignations are imminent; the narrow window makes timing critical. My forecast is not lower because: the mentioned scandal provides some elevated risk above pure base rates; with 705 MEPs, the probability of at least one resignation in 21 days is non-trivial. I would increase my forecast if: specific MEPs are identified as implicated and facing serious consequences, calls for resignation emerge, or preliminary resignation signals appear. I would decrease my forecast if: the scandal proves minor or clears those involved, or if the time window was shorter.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill any members of the European Parliament resign before July 1, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nEuro News: [Lobbying scandal related to Huawei: What we know so far](https://www.euronews.com/my-europe/2025/05/21/lobbying-scandal-related-to-huawei-what-we-know-so-far)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if a member of the European Parliament announces their resignation after June 9, 2025 and before July 1, 2025.\n\n\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nNo additional information available.\n\nToday is 2025-06-05.\n\nBefore answering you think:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n(e) You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
