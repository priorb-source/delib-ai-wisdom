    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Approximately one month.",
    "status_quo_outcome": "Yes, BC Hydro would continue to exclude Tesla from the rebate program.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Following a swift and strong complaint from the U.S. government under the CUSMA/USMCA trade agreement, the B.C. government directs BC Hydro to quickly reverse the policy to avoid a potentially damaging trade dispute. The website is updated to remove the Tesla-specific exclusion before July 2025.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "The policy implemented in March 2025 continues without significant challenge or change. Bureaucratic and political inertia mean the exclusion remains in place, and the BC Hydro website continues to list Tesla products as ineligible for the rebate in July 2025.",
    "rationale": "My forecast is heavily weighted towards the status quo. The policy excluding Tesla products was implemented recently, on March 12, 2025, indicating a fresh and deliberate decision by the B.C. government and BC Hydro. Government policies, especially those involving crown corporations and articulated with a protectionist rationale ('preference Canadian goods'), tend to have significant inertia. The timeframe for this question is extremely short—the outcome will be known in approximately one month. This period is generally insufficient for the types of pressures that could cause a policy reversal, such as a formal trade dispute, a successful legal challenge, or a significant shift in political will. While a trade complaint from the United States is possible, the process from complaint to policy change typically takes much longer than one month. Therefore, the most likely outcome is that the policy remains unchanged by the resolution date. My forecast is not higher than 95% to account for a small but non-zero possibility of a very rapid and effective diplomatic intervention from the U.S. that forces an immediate reversal. My forecast is not lower because the sheer bureaucratic inertia and the short time frame make any change highly improbable. I would lower my forecast if there were credible reports of an official U.S. trade challenge being filed or high-level talks demanding an immediate reversal of the policy.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill BC Hydro still exclude Tesla from its EV charger rebate program for single-family homes in July 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nAccording to the resolution source, \"The Government of B.C. and BC Hydro are taking action to preference Canadian goods in our rebate programs going forward and to exclude, where practicable, U.S. produced goods. As of March 12, 2025, Tesla products (electric vehicle chargers, energy storage batteries and inverters) are not eligible for CleanBC and BC Hydro rebates. If you purchased or have received pre-approval for your Tesla product before March 12, 2025, it can still qualify for rebates and will be processed as normal.\"\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if BC Hydro at [this page](https://www.bchydro.com/powersmart/electric-vehicles/rebates-incentives/rebates-home-chargers.html) when checked by Metaculus on or after July 1, 2025, says that Tesla products are not eligible for the EV charger at home program. If it does not mention Tesla being ineligible, then this question resolves as **No**.\n\n\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nNo additional information available.\n\nToday is 2025-05-30.\n\nBefore answering you think:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n(e) You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
