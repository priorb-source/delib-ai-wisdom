    "review": "The other two forecasters provide sound reasoning on a faulty premise. Both Forecaster 2 (75%) and Forecaster 3 (88%) assume the June 12, 2025 date is the confirmed, scheduled date for the meeting. Their analyses focus almost exclusively on the probability of the meeting completing successfully without another technical failure like the one in 2024. They make a compelling case that GameStop has strong incentives to prevent a repeat failure, meaning the conditional probability of completion, given the meeting is scheduled, is high. However, they completely overlook the critical information in the research report: there is no official SEC filing confirming the date, and GameStop's own transfer agent, Computershare, lists the date as June 2, 2025, which directly contradicts the June 12 date listed by media sources. Because their forecasts do not engage with the primary uncertainty—the date of the meeting itself—their high confidence is misplaced.",
    "rationale": "My initial forecast of 20% was based on the fundamental uncertainty of the meeting's date, and the other forecasters have not presented any evidence to resolve this. The core of my analysis remains unchanged: the most reliable source available, the company's transfer agent (Computershare), points to a June 2 date, while the definitive source, an SEC DEF 14A filing, is missing. This makes the June 12 date, sourced from media terminals, less likely to be correct. The other panelists' arguments are valid on one point: if the meeting *is* scheduled for June 12, the probability of it completing successfully is indeed high, likely in the 80-90% range, due to the immense pressure to avoid a repeat of the 2024 fiasco. However, my forecast must account for both the probability of the date being correct AND the probability of the meeting being completed. The final probability is a product of P(Date is June 12) * P(Completion | Date is June 12). I assess the probability that June 12 is the correct date as low, perhaps around 30%, given the conflicting evidence. Multiplying this by the high conditional probability of completion (e.g., 85%) leads to a forecast in the low 20s. I am slightly increasing my forecast from 20% to 25% to more formally incorporate the other forecasters' valid point about the high likelihood of successful execution, but I am not making a substantial change because they failed to address the most critical factor driving my forecast: the strong evidence that the meeting may not be on June 12 at all.",
