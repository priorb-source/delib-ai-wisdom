  "information": "A recent UN Economic Commission for Africa (ECA) report highlighted the AfCFTA's potential to boost trade-led growth and increase Africa's GDP by 1.2% by 2045 with full implementation. Other regional developments include a forum in Zambia focused on digital trade integration, an emphasis on arbitration for resolving trade disputes, and the promotion of the Pan-African Payment and Settlement System (PAPSS) to facilitate transactions in local currencies. Meanwhile, Nigeria has ratified the agreement, and South Africa and Lesotho are strengthening bilateral trade ties to advance AfCFTA goals.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Less than one month.",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "The ongoing civil war between the Sudanese Armed Forces (SAF) and the Rapid Support Forces (RSF) continues through June 2025. The state's administrative and legislative functions remain paralyzed by the conflict, making the ratification of a complex international trade agreement impossible. The government's focus remains entirely on military operations and survival, not long-term economic policy.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "A comprehensive and durable peace agreement is unexpectedly signed and implemented within the next week. A functioning unity government is immediately formed, and in a symbolic act of returning to international cooperation and economic rebuilding, they make it an absolute priority to convene an emergency session to ratify the AfCFTA agreement before the July 1, 2025 deadline.",
    "rationale": "My forecast is overwhelmingly driven by the current political and security reality in Sudan. The country has been embroiled in a devastating civil war since April 2023, which has led to the collapse of state institutions, a massive humanitarian crisis, and the complete paralysis of normal legislative and bureaucratic processes. The status quo is one of intense conflict, which makes the ratification of an international trade agreement a non-priority and a practical impossibility. The background information noting a draft strategy from 2022 is now obsolete, as the context has fundamentally changed since the war began. The research assistant's report on broader AfCFTA progress in other nations like Nigeria and Zambia is irrelevant to Sudan's specific, dire situation. For Sudan to ratify the treaty before the deadline less than a month away, a miraculous and instantaneous end to the war followed by the immediate reconstitution of a functional government would be required. This is an exceptionally low-probability series of events. My forecast is not lower than 1% simply to account for any highly improbable 'black swan' event, such as a sudden political settlement. My forecast is not higher because the logistical and political hurdles created by the war are insurmountable in the given timeframe. I would only update my forecast towards 'Yes' upon seeing credible evidence of an immediate, all-encompassing peace deal being signed and implemented.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill Sudan ratify AfCFTA (the pan-African free trade agreement) before July 1, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\n[Draft National AfCFTA Implementation Strategy for Sudan Reviewed and Validated by Stakeholders](https://igad.int/draft-national-afcfta-implementation-strategy-for-sudan-reviewed-and-validated-by-stakeholders/)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if Sudan ratifies the African Continental Free Trade Area (AfCFTA) Agreement before July 1, 2025.\n\n\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nA recent UN Economic Commission for Africa (ECA) report highlighted the AfCFTA's potential to boost trade-led growth and increase Africa's GDP by 1.2% by 2045 with full implementation.

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
