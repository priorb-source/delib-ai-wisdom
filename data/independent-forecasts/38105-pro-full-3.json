  "information": "As of late May 2025, an International Monetary Fund (IMF) mission is in Beirut for formal negotiations with the Lebanese government. The first negotiating session took place on May 29-30, with a second round scheduled for June 10. According to officials, a draft 46-month Extended Fund Facility (EFF) worth approximately US$3 billion is being discussed. Lebanon's Finance Minister, Yassine Jaber, stated that there has been progress in the talks, describing them as being on a 'good track.' He also affirmed that the government's plan involves better collection of existing taxes rather than imposing new ones. The Lebanese negotiating team includes the Minister of Economy, the Governor of the Central Bank, and other experts, meeting with the IMF delegation led by Ernesto Rigo.\n\nThe IMF has conditioned an agreement on the implementation of several key reforms. While Lebanon has completed some prior actions, including passing amendments to the bank-secrecy law and establishing an electricity-tariff framework, significant obstacles remain. The passage of a bank-restructuring law and measures to control the cash economy are described as unresolved and politically contentious issues. The IMF has publicly characterized the progress in talks as 'slow' and has expressed specific concerns about provisions in the proposed banking reform law, including the composition of a 'Higher Banking Authority' and the scope of its powers.\n\nSeveral international actors are involved in Lebanon's economic recovery efforts. The European Union has announced that a 500 million euro aid payment is conditional on Lebanon restructuring its banking sector and securing an agreement with the IMF. Separately, the World Bank is in active discussions with Lebanese officials regarding a 'Lebanon Emergency Assistance Project' (LEAP) aimed at reconstruction. A meeting to present this project to donor countries and international institutions is scheduled for June 10. On the domestic front, Lebanese President Joseph Aoun has publicly emphasized the importance of reaching an agreement with the IMF before the summer of 2025.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Approximately one month, with a deadline of July 1, 2025.",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No agreement is reached. Lebanon's political factions remain deadlocked over the required economic reforms, and negotiations with the IMF continue without a final resolution, as they have for years.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "The ongoing negotiations stall over the bank-restructuring law and other unresolved issues. The IMF delegation concludes its June talks without a breakthrough, stating that more work is needed on Lebanon's side. The Lebanese political class fails to reach a consensus on the contentious reforms before the July 1 deadline, postponing any potential agreement.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Facing immense domestic pressure and the conditioning of EU aid on an IMF deal, Lebanon's key political actors make a series of rapid compromises. They pass a bank-restructuring law that largely adheres to the IMF's demands in early June. This breakthrough allows for the swift finalization and announcement of a staff-level agreement before the end of the month.",
    "rationale": "My forecast is primarily driven by the extremely short timeline and the nature of the remaining obstacles. While there are positive signs, such as active, formal negotiations in Beirut and significant international pressure, the weight of evidence points towards the status quo of no agreement. The core of my reasoning is the IMF's public characterization of progress as 'slow' and the 'politically contentious' nature of the unresolved reforms, specifically the bank-restructuring law. Such fundamental and divisive issues are rarely resolved within a one-month timeframe in any political system, let alone Lebanon's notoriously gridlocked one. The status quo for several years has been a failure to implement these very reforms.\n\nMy probability is not lower because there is genuine momentum. An IMF mission is physically in the country for formal talks, a specific US$3 billion deal is on the table, and both the Lebanese President and the EU are exerting significant pressure for a resolution before the summer. This creates a non-trivial chance that the extreme severity of the crisis could force a political breakthrough that has been elusive for years.\n\nMy probability is not higher because the barriers are structural and significant. The IMF has expressed specific concerns about the proposed banking law, indicating the two sides are not merely finalizing details but are still apart on key principles. One month is an exceptionally brief window to draft, negotiate, pass, and ratify such a complex and controversial piece of legislation to the IMF's satisfaction.\n\nI would increase my forecast if there were a credible announcement in the next two weeks that Lebanon's cabinet had approved a bank-restructuring bill that meets the IMF's stated requirements. I would decrease it if the IMF's mission concludes its June talks with a public statement highlighting a continued lack of progress on key structural reforms.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill the IMF and Lebanon announce an agreement before July 1, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\n[Lebanon finance minister confident of a new deal with IMF to help crumbling economy](https://www.newarab.com/news/lebanon-finance-minister-confident-new-deal-imf)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if Lebanon and the International Monetary Fund announce any economic agreement between the two entities signed after the launch of this question and before July 1, 2025. In order to count, it must involve the IMF agreeing to provide money to Lebanon, whether through loans, grants, or any other means.\n\n\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nAs of late May 2025, an International Monetary Fund (IMF) mission is in Beirut for formal negotiations with the Lebanese government.
