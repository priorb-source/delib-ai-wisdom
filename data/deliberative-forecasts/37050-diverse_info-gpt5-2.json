    "review": "Both forecasters fairly emphasize the short window and the DJIA committee’s bias toward stability. I agree with Forecaster 2’s note on aggregate risk across 30 names and Boeing as the most vulnerable constituent, but I’m not convinced that recent market volatility or trade-policy uncertainty materially changes the committee’s behavior in a two-month window. The “1–2 changes per year” framing can overstate the near-term hazard because changes cluster and 2024 already saw two swaps to modernize the index. Forecaster 3’s emphasis on inertia and the need for structural catalysts is closer to my view. The mention of several stocks’ recent declines (UNH, NVDA, IBM, etc.) doesn’t, on its own, raise risk much; the committee typically responds to durable structural shifts (splits, spin-offs, sector representation) or corporate events (M&A), not short-term drawdowns. The IBM contract point is not, as presented, a clear trigger. Overall, F3’s reasoning is more persuasive; F2’s macro-volatility argument is weaker for DJIA changes.",
    "rationale": "My base view was that the post-2024 reshuffle reduces short-term need for more changes, and that the 67-day window favors the status quo absent a clear catalyst (large split, major M&A/spin, or a company-specific crisis that changes sector representation). The additional arguments don’t materially shift that: macro stress and routine volatility rarely drive DJIA composition moves, and there are no well-telegraphed corporate actions among constituents. Boeing is the main tail risk, but the committee has historically tolerated extended turbulence at Boeing without immediate removal. Given clustering of changes and a recent update in 2024, I keep the probability low. I would move up on credible reporting of committee deliberations or a relevant corporate action (e.g., an announced large split or transformative deal) involving a Dow member; I would drift down as time passes without such signals.",
