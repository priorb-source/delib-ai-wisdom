    "review": "Both forecasters identified a critical error in my analysis: they state that the Liberal Democrats CURRENTLY control the most seats from the 2021 election, which directly contradicts the research assistant's report showing Conservatives with 44 seats versus Lib Dems with 13. Given that the 2021 Cornwall Council election is a known historical event where Liberal Democrats did indeed become the largest party for the first time, I believe the research assistant's report contains outdated or incorrect information. This fundamentally changes the question from 'Can Lib Dems achieve an unprecedented 31-seat swing?' to 'Can Lib Dems defend their incumbent position?' Both forecasters raised compelling evidence I missed: (1) Lib Dem success in 2024 general election winning North Cornwall and St Ives, (2) Conservative leader and multiple councillors retiring, suggesting internal problems, (3) £100,000 fundraising and near-complete candidate slate showing strong organization, (4) Reform UK at 25% nationally splitting the Conservative vote. These factors make sense only if Lib Dems are defending incumbency. However, I remain more cautious than their 68-72% forecasts because: (1) Independents hold 24 seats and Cornwall has a strong independent tradition - they could emerge as the largest bloc in a fragmented vote, (2) we lack Cornwall-specific polling data, (3) local elections can deviate significantly from national trends. The independent factor is substantial and could prevent any single party from achieving plurality.",
    "rationale": "Upon reviewing the other forecasters' analyses, I must acknowledge a fundamental error in my baseline assumption. If Liberal Democrats are indeed the incumbent largest party from 2021 (which aligns with historical records of that election), then my entire framework was wrong. The question is not about an unprecedented swing but about defending an incumbent position. With this corrected understanding, the evidence strongly favors a Yes outcome: Lib Dems have incumbency advantage, demonstrated recent electoral success in Cornwall constituencies, strong organizational capacity (fundraising, candidate recruitment), facing weakened Conservative opposition (retirements, low national polling), and likely benefit from Reform UK splitting the right-wing vote. However, I'm adjusting to 60% rather than matching their 68-72% because Cornwall's 24 independent councillors represent a significant wild card - if the vote fragments sufficiently, independents could emerge as the largest bloc even without formal coordination. This independent tradition in Cornwall local politics shouldn't be underestimated. My forecast reflects: high probability Lib Dems retain strength, but meaningful uncertainty from independent performance and lack of Cornwall-specific polling data.",
