  "information": "According to the US Census Bureau, U.S. imports reached a record high of $342.7 billion in March 2025, a 5% increase from February. This surge was attributed to businesses front-running impending tariffs. The import of consumer goods rose 55.5% year-over-year to $102.8 billion, and automotive vehicle imports also jumped. This activity led to the U.S. trade deficit for goods increasing by 9.6% to a record $162 billion in March. A similar, though smaller, surge was observed in January 2025, when imports reached $320 billion, with notable increases in shipments from China, Canada, and Mexico.\n\nNew tariffs, referred to as the 'Liberation Day' tariffs, took effect in April 2025. These included a 10% baseline tariff on most imports, with higher rates on certain categories like automobiles and specific Chinese products, where tariffs reached up to 145%. Following the implementation, early reports in April indicated a 64% collapse in new U.S. import orders. Real-time data showed significant drops in trade activity, including a 35% fall in scheduled container arrivals at the port of Los Angeles, a 30% plunge in U.S.-China imports according to Project 44, and a 40% decline in overall imports reported by Drewry. The S&P Global PMI also indicated a slowdown in U.S. business activity in April. Despite these indicators, the U.S. Treasury collected $16.5 billion in tariff revenue between April 1 and April 28.\n\nData from the shipping and logistics sector in April 2025 reflected the impact of new tariffs. Freightos and Hillebrand data showed that Asia-U.S. container rates had fallen by 5%. Shipping lines reported an increase in 'blank sailings' (cancelled voyages) and vessels from China that were only half-full. In 2024, China accounted for approximately 36% of U.S. imports, with its share being higher at key ports like Los Angeles (51%) and Long Beach (61%). Port data indicated that the number of ships scheduled to arrive in May 2025 had decreased significantly. Separately, Mexico had become the U.S.'s top trading partner in early 2025, with its exports to the U.S. growing 9.6% in January to a record $41.68 billion.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "About one month. The U.S. Census Bureau is expected to release the trade data for April 2025 in early June 2025.",
    "status_quo_outcome": "Yes. Prior to the implementation of new tariffs in April 2025, U.S. imports were on an upward trend, with March 2025 imports reaching a record high ($342.7 billion), well above the April 2024 level of $338.483 billion. Absent a major policy change, this trend would likely have continued.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "The 'Liberation Day' tariffs implemented in April 2025 cause a severe contraction in import volumes. Real-time data, such as the reported 64% collapse in new import orders and 30-40% drops in shipping activity, accurately reflects the trade flow for the month. This sharp decline in volume overwhelms any increase in import value from the tariffs themselves, causing the total April 2025 import value to fall below the $338,483 million threshold of April 2024.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "The price effect of the new tariffs, which increase the recorded value of goods at customs, combined with a spillover of shipments from the record-setting March 2025 front-loading effort, is large enough to offset the decline in import volumes. In this scenario, while the physical quantity of goods entering the country drops, the total dollar value reported by the Census Bureau remains higher than the April 2024 figure.",
    "rationale": "My forecast is based on the overwhelming evidence of a sharp, immediate contraction in import activity following the implementation of significant new tariffs in April 2025. While the status quo trend pointed towards increasing imports, this major policy shock fundamentally alters the landscape. The research provided indicates multiple high-frequency, real-time datasets all pointing in the same direction: a severe drop in imports. Specifically, the reported 64% collapse in new import orders, a 35% fall in container arrivals at a key port, and a 30-40% overall decline reported by shipping analysts like Project 44 and Drewry strongly suggest that the physical volume of imports has fallen drastically. The value of imports is a function of both volume and price (Value = Price x Volume). While the tariffs increase the price component, the magnitude of the reported volume drop (30-40%) is so substantial that it is highly unlikely to be offset by a price increase that will average around 10-15%. The spillover from March's front-loading may cushion the numbers in the first week of April, but it is unlikely to prop up the entire month's value against such a strong headwind. My probability is not lower than 10 because there is a non-trivial chance that the price effect of the tariffs on the valuation of goods, combined with inelastic demand for some products, could keep the total dollar figure surprisingly high. The official Census Bureau methodology can also differ from real-time shipping data. I would increase my forecast for a 'Yes' outcome if data emerged showing that the volume decline was much more shallow than currently reported or that imports from tariff-exempt nations like Mexico surged dramatically enough to offset declines from China and elsewhere. Conversely, I would lower my forecast if preliminary official data confirmed the large-scale contraction.",
