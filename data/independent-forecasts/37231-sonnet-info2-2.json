  "information": "The International Monetary Fund (IMF) projects a 0.3% economic contraction for Mexico in 2025, citing the effects of tariffs imposed by the United States on key Mexican products. The IMF also predicts Mexico's unemployment rate will increase from 2.8% to 3.8% during 2025. Separately, the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) forecasts Mexico's economy will grow by 1.3% in 2025 and 0.6% in 2026, though these projections are conditional on the tariff situation. The U.S. has imposed tariffs of 25% on key Mexican products like autos, steel, and plastics.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "The April 2025 unemployment data collection is complete as of April 29, 2025. The official release from Trading Economics typically occurs within 2-4 weeks after month-end, so the outcome should be known by mid-to-late May 2025, approximately 2-3 weeks from now.",
    "status_quo_outcome": "Yes - unemployment remains below 3%",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "The U.S. tariffs on Mexican products (25% on autos, steel, and plastics) cause immediate and severe disruptions to manufacturing supply chains. Companies accelerate layoffs in the auto sector and related industries in Q1 2025. The unemployment rate rises from its historical 2.8% level to 3.0% or higher by April 2025, particularly affecting border manufacturing regions.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Despite tariff announcements, the full economic impact takes several months to materialize in employment data. Mexican companies initially absorb costs or find alternative arrangements. The unemployment rate in April 2025 remains close to its baseline of 2.8%, staying below the 3.0% threshold. Employment effects lag behind the tariff implementation by several months.",
    "rationale": "The critical factors here are timing and the lag between policy implementation and labor market effects. The research assistant notes that Mexico's unemployment was historically at 2.8%, with IMF projections of an increase to 3.8% during 2025. However, this projection is for the full year, not specifically April. Economic research shows that trade policy changes typically take 3-6 months to fully manifest in unemployment statistics, as companies first adjust through reduced hours, hiring freezes, and voluntary attrition before resorting to layoffs. Since we're evaluating April 2025 data (very early in the year), and tariffs appear to have been recently imposed, the full unemployment impact projected by the IMF likely hasn't materialized yet. The key concern is the narrow margin: we need unemployment to stay below 3.0%, and the baseline was only 2.8%, leaving just 0.2 percentage points of buffer. Some early-stage impact from tariffs is quite possible, but a jump of 0.2+ percentage points within the first few months seems less likely than a more gradual increase throughout 2025. The status quo strongly favors the Yes outcome, as labor markets change slowly and April represents an early measurement point. My forecast wouldn't be higher because: (1) tariffs are confirmed and will have negative effects, (2) the margin is very thin at just 0.2 percentage points, and (3) some sectors like auto manufacturing could see rapid job losses. My forecast wouldn't be lower because: (1) we're measuring very early in the impact timeline, (2) the baseline is comfortably below 3%, and (3) Mexican labor markets have shown resilience. I would update higher if: evidence emerged that tariffs were delayed or rescinded, or if early 2025 employment data from Mexico showed unexpected strength. I would update lower if: reports showed accelerated manufacturing layoffs in Q1 2025, or if preliminary unemployment data from January-March showed sharp increases.",
