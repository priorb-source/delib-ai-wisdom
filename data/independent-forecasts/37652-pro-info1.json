  "information": "Following his election win on April 28, 2025, Prime Minister Mark Carney presented a new, smaller cabinet of 29 ministers, down from 39 in the previous administration. Key figures such as François-Philippe Champagne (Finance) and Dominic LeBlanc (US Trade) were retained. Carney's government announced it would not table a full federal budget before the summer, opting for a fall economic statement instead. The new administration's immediate promises include a tax cut and the elimination of all inter-provincial trade barriers by July 1. Carney signed a symbolic decree to lower the first taxable income bracket from 15% to 14%, a measure requiring parliamentary approval. The Liberal party's platform includes additional spending that projects the national deficit for 2025-26 to be $62.3 billion Canadian dollars, an increase from the $42.2 billion forecast in December.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "About a month and a half.",
    "status_quo_outcome": "Yes. Based on typical political dynamics, a newly elected Prime Minister like Mark Carney will be in a \"honeymoon period\" with high approval ratings, while a polarizing figure like Donald Trump in a second term will likely have his historically stable, lower approval ratings. This would result in Carney's approval being higher.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Prime Minister Carney's government commits a major unforced error or is hit by a significant scandal between now and July 1, causing his approval rating to plummet. Concurrently, a rally-around-the-flag event in the US boosts President Trump's approval rating above its typical range, leading to his rating being equal to or higher than Carney's.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Prime Minister Carney successfully leverages his recent election win into a standard 'honeymoon period' with the Canadian public, buoyed by popular initial announcements like tax cuts. His approval rating rises above 50%. Meanwhile, President Trump's approval rating remains within its historically stable and polarized range of the low-to-mid 40s, resulting in Carney having a higher rating.",
    "rationale": "My forecast is based primarily on the well-established 'honeymoon effect' for newly elected leaders and the historically stable, polarized approval ratings of Donald Trump. The timeframe for this forecast is very short (about 1.5 months), which means major shifts from the expected trends are unlikely.\n\nMark Carney, having been elected on April 28, 2025, is a new Prime Minister. The research assistant's report indicates he is making popular early moves, such as announcing a tax cut and a smaller cabinet, while delaying a potentially controversial full budget until the fall. This is a classic strategy to maximize early public goodwill. Historically, new Canadian leaders like Justin Trudeau in 2015 enjoyed approval ratings well above 50% in their first few months. I expect Carney's approval to be in a similar range by July 1.\n\nConversely, Donald Trump's approval ratings throughout his first term were remarkably inelastic, generally fluctuating within a narrow band in the low-to-mid 40s according to Morning Consult. As a second-term president, his support and opposition are deeply entrenched, making a significant surge in approval improbable without a major, unifying national event.\n\nTherefore, the most likely scenario is a honeymooning Carney with an approval rating of 50-60% versus a polarized Trump with an approval rating of 40-45%, which would resolve the question as 'Yes'.\n\nMy probability is not higher than 85 because a 'No' outcome is still possible. Carney is a new politician, and a significant gaffe or scandal could quickly erode his initial support. There is also a small chance of a rally-around-the-flag event in the US that could boost Trump's ratings unexpectedly.\n\nMy probability is not lower because that would understate the reliability of the honeymoon effect and the stability of Trump's polling numbers. A 'No' outcome would require one or both of these strong, established trends to break, which is a low-probability event over such a short period.\n\nI would increase my forecast if early polling in June confirms a strong honeymoon for Carney (>55%). I would decrease my forecast if a significant scandal emerges around Carney's new government or if a major international event significantly boosts Trump's approval ratings.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney have a higher approval rating than US President Donald Trump on July 1, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nResolution source updates monthly. According to Morning Consult for January 2025: \"The latest approval ratings are based on data collected from Jan. 21-27, 2025. Ratings reflect a trailing seven-day simple moving average of views among adults in each country surveyed.\"\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if Mark Carney has a higher approval rating than US President Donald Trump according to [Morning Consult](https://pro.morningconsult.com/trackers/global-leader-approval) when checked by Metaculus on or after July 1, 2025. If this not the case (including due to a tie), this resolves as **No**.\n\n\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nFollowing his election win on April 28, 2025, Prime Minister Mark Carney presented a new, smaller cabinet of 29 ministers, down from 39 in the previous administration.

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any).
