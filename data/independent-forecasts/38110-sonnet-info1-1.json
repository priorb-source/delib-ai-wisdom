  "information": "The government of Benin closed its land border crossings with Nigeria's Kwara state around May 6-8, 2025. The specific crossing mentioned is between Taberu village in Baruten Local Government Area, Kwara State, and the neighboring Tanu village in Benin. On May 9, 2025, Benin extended its border security operations to the Sèmè and Owode borders in Lagos State. Stated reasons for the closure include concerns over arms smuggling, the emergence of a new militant group known as 'Mahmuda', and unregulated exportation of agricultural products like soya beans and cashews. Reports mentioned intelligence regarding the illegal importation of arms and ammunition from Parakou, Benin, into Nigeria.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "31 days until July 1, 2025",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No - the borders remain closed",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "The security concerns about arms smuggling and the Mahmuda militant group persist. Diplomatic negotiations between Benin and Nigeria make insufficient progress within the 31-day timeframe. Benin maintains the border closure through July 1, 2025 prioritizing security over economic considerations.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Swift diplomatic engagement between Benin and Nigerian authorities produces a security framework that addresses Benin's concerns about arms smuggling and terrorism. Enhanced border security protocols are agreed upon and implemented, allowing Benin to reopen the crossings before July 1, 2025. Economic pressure from affected communities and trade disruptions accelerate the negotiation process.",
    "rationale": "The borders were closed only 23-25 days ago (around May 6-8), making this a very recent development. The stated reasons are serious security concerns: arms smuggling, emergence of the Mahmuda militant group, and illegal weapons importation from Parakou. These are not trivial issues that typically resolve quickly. Significantly, Benin extended the closure to Sèmè and Owode borders in Lagos State on May 9, just days after the initial closure. This extension signals escalation rather than de-escalation, suggesting Benin is committed to its security stance. Security-related border closures generally take longer to resolve than purely economic disputes, as they require substantial security arrangements, intelligence sharing, and trust-building measures between nations. With only 31 days remaining until the deadline, there is limited time for comprehensive diplomatic negotiations and implementation of security protocols. The status quo heavily favors continued closure. However, the probability is not extremely low because: (1) border closures between economically interdependent neighbors often face significant pressure for resolution; (2) one month provides some window for diplomatic intervention; (3) we lack information about ongoing negotiations that may be occurring behind the scenes. My forecast would increase if credible reports emerged of high-level diplomatic meetings or security cooperation agreements. It would decrease if additional border points were closed or if Benin made statements indicating a long-term closure strategy.",

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
