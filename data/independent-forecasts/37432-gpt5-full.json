  "information": "In Ohio, Republican lawmakers introduced Senate Bill 153 (SB 153), which would create new requirements for citizen-led ballot initiatives. The bill would compel paid signature gatherers to wear visible badges, list employers on petitions, and maintain detailed records. The bill's definition of 'paid' circulators is considered broad, and it requires petition signers to be registered voters on the exact day they sign. As of early May 2025, this bill had not completed the legislative process. In February 2025, a provision requiring Ohioans to prove citizenship to register to vote at the Bureau of Motor Vehicles was removed from the state's transportation budget by Republicans. Instead, BMV employees will be prohibited from offering registration forms to individuals identified as non-citizens. This change was prompted by a report from Secretary of State Frank LaRose indicating that non-citizens were accidentally registering to vote, partly due to language barriers.\n\nThe Ohio legislature has Republican supermajorities in both the Senate (26-7) and the House (67-32). Senators Theresa Gavarone and Andrew Brenner are key sponsors pushing for stricter election laws. In early 2023, Governor Mike DeWine signed HB 458, a voter ID law. However, Governor DeWine has also expressed some hesitation regarding the current proof-of-citizenship proposals. Organizations such as the ACLU are actively opposing the new legislation. The Ohio General Assembly has session days scheduled through late June 2025, ahead of the July 1, 2025 resolution deadline.\n\nThere is a national trend of Republican-led efforts to enact proof-of-citizenship voting requirements. At the federal level, the U.S. House of Representatives passed the Safeguard American Voter Eligibility (SAVE) Act, which would require proof of citizenship for voter registration. Several states have pursued similar legislation. Wyoming passed a law requiring proof of citizenship to vote, which will take effect on July 1, 2025. In Iowa, a state audit found 277 noncitizens were registered to vote or had voted in the 2024 election. In Tennessee, a bill to create a portal for election workers to verify voter citizenship has advanced in the state House. In Michigan, a proposed constitutional amendment that would have required proof of citizenship for voter registration failed to pass.",

    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "About 8 weeks (until July 1, 2025)",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No — no new proof-of-citizenship verification enacted before the deadline.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Proof-of-citizenship provisions remain in committee or are stripped from vehicles (e.g., budgets/omnibus election bills); leadership prioritizes other items; the General Assembly adjourns its June session days without both chambers passing identical language.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Senate leadership fast-tracks the Gavarone/Brenner bill (or similar language) and the House concurs on identical text before late June, potentially by attaching it to an omnibus elections package; enactment occurs upon bicameral passage regardless of implementation or litigation.",
    "rationale": "Time is short and the status quo tends to hold. Despite Republican supermajorities (Senate 26-7, House 67-32) and active sponsors (Sens. Gavarone, Brenner), a key recent signal cut the other way: in February, Republicans removed a proof-of-citizenship-at-BMV requirement from the transportation budget, opting instead to bar BMVs from offering forms to identified non-citizens. Governor DeWine has shown hesitation on current proof-of-citizenship proposals, and civil-liberties groups are mobilized. These cues suggest intra-party caution, likely due to legal risk (NVRA preemption issues seen in AZ/KS) and administrative complexity (dual systems), which raises the bar for swift passage. The General Assembly has session days through late June, but calendars are crowded and moving complex election policy in under two months is nontrivial. That said, there is a live vehicle (the Gavarone/Brenner bill, e.g., SB 153 as cited) and national GOP momentum (e.g., the federal SAVE Act push; other states acting; Ohio SOS highlighting noncitizen registration concerns). With supermajorities, leadership could still advance and pass identical language quickly if they decide to prioritize it, and for this market the governor’s stance may be less pivotal because resolution hinges on bicameral passage of identical text. Why not higher? Recent removal from a must-pass bill, gubernatorial caution, legal/administrative headwinds, and a tight window reduce odds. Why not lower? GOP supermajorities, an introduced bill ready to move, salient recent reports about noncitizen registrations, and the ability to tack provisions onto an omnibus bill all keep a meaningful path open. Upward updates: scheduled committee hearings and votes, clear Senate passage in May, House leadership signaling support, or inclusion in an omnibus elections package. Downward updates: leadership statements shelving the issue until fall, further stripping from vehicles, or calendar signals that squeeze floor time.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nBefore July 1, 2025, will Ohio enact legislation expanding its verification requirements of a voter's citizenship?\n\nQuestion background:\nThe Ohio Senate: [Gavarone, Brenner Introduce Bill to Require Proof of Citizenship to Vote](https://ohiosenate.gov/members/theresa-gavarone/news/gavarone-brenner-introduce-bill-to-require-proof-of-citizenship-to-vote)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if, before July 1, 2025, the state of Ohio enacts legislation requiring voters to provide proof of US citizenship beyond the requirements at the time of this question, according to [credible sources](https://www.metaculus.com/faq/#definitions).\n\nAny subset of voters being required to provide such proof would count (for example if it only applied to first-time voter registrants or creating a new requirement for mail-in voters). An example of a bill that would count is [Senate Bill 153](https://www.legislature.ohio.gov/legislation/136/sb153). This question resolves upon enactment; therefore other questions such as when the legislation takes effect or whether it survives court challenges and is implemented is immaterial to this question's resolution. Please note that under Ohio law, a bill is considered enacted \"after both houses have passed and agreed on identical bills.\" ([Source](https://www.lsc.ohio.gov/assets/organizations/legislative-service-commission/files/chapter-5-enacting-legislation-10021971.pdf))\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nIn Ohio, Republican lawmakers introduced Senate Bill 153 (SB 153), which would create new requirements for citizen-led ballot initiatives.

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any).

Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
