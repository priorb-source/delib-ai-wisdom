  "information": "In late May 2025, President Trump granted clemency to a large group of individuals. News outlets including The Hill and Politomix reported on May 28-29 that over two dozen people received pardons or commutations in what was described as a 'clemency spree' or 'blitz'. According to Office of the Pardon Attorney data, there were approximately 25 clemency actions in May. The recipients included political allies like former Congressman Michael Grimm and former Connecticut governor John G. Rowland, reality TV stars Todd and Julie Chrisley, and musicians such as NBA YoungBoy.\n\nSince taking office in January 2025, President Trump has granted approximately 1,600 pardons or commutations, a figure more than six times the total from his entire first term. A large portion of this number stems from a mass clemency order issued on his first day in office, which pardoned roughly 1,500 individuals convicted of offenses related to the January 6, 2021, Capitol attack. The administration has installed key personnel to manage the process, including Ed Martin as the new pardon attorney at the Justice Department and Alice Marie Johnson as a White House pardon czar.\n\nDuring his first presidential term, Donald Trump did not grant any clemencies during the month of June in any of the four years. For his second term, a May 28, 2025, report from the Washington Times indicated that Trump has signaled more pardons could be forthcoming, including for two men convicted in the plot to kidnap Michigan Governor Gretchen Whitmer. A White House official was also quoted stating the President has come to the aid of political supporters and donors and has expressed sympathy for allies caught in the judicial system.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "About 1 month (until June 30, 2025; knowable by early July once public disclosures are tallied)",
    "status_quo_outcome": "Yes — continued, visible clemency activity exceeding three individuals during June",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "After a late‑May clemency blitz, the White House pauses in June (possibly saving a larger tranche for a July 4 rollout) and issues at most one or two discrete clemencies; or delays public disclosure until July, keeping June’s publicly known count ≤2.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "The administration continues its current cadence and announces another small batch (or multiple drips) of pardons/commutations in June; or issues a targeted blanket action (e.g., a themed category) covering more than two people, all publicly disclosed within June.",
    "rationale": "Evidence and trend: Per the research assistant, Trump executed a late‑May clemency spree (> two dozen actions around May 28–29) and has signaled more to come, with loyal personnel (new pardon attorney and a White House pardon czar) facilitating throughput. Reports indicate very high aggregate clemency volume since January, including a mass action on day one, suggesting an environment where additional actions are routine rather than exceptional. The threshold here is low (>2 people), so even a modest June tranche or a couple of staggered announcements would satisfy “Yes.”\nStatus quo weighting: The current trajectory is active, high‑frequency clemency. Barring a deliberate pause, the base expectation is continued activity into June, making “Yes” the status quo outcome.\nWhy not higher: Two countervailing considerations keep the forecast below ~90%. First, Trump historically clustered clemencies around news cycles; he could intentionally hold June actions for an Independence Day push, leaving June at ≤2. Second, given critical media coverage (e.g., the Guardian piece) and possible internal sequencing, the team might temporarily slow rollouts or bunch them for maximum political impact.\nWhy not lower: The operational pipeline appears primed, and public signaling of “more to come” post‑spree makes a complete June freeze less likely. The bar (>2) is easy to clear with even a minor announcement. Also, blanket or themed actions would instantly meet the threshold.\nKey updates to watch: Any early‑June White House or OPA notices; Trump/ally hints on Truth Social; reporting about a July 4–timed package (downside for June); indications of internal pause or backlash affecting timing (downside); or leaks naming specific beneficiaries slated for June (upside).",

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
