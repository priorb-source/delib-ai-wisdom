    "review": "Forecaster 3 raises the most compelling new argument: Osborn's stated timeline of deciding by 'early summer' is crucial. June 1 falls in late spring (before the summer solstice on June 20-21), so 'early summer' most naturally means June-July, AFTER the resolution date. This linguistic/calendar point is persuasive. Additionally, Forecaster 3's historical pattern analysis is valuable - Osborn announced his 2024 race in July 2023 (16 months before election), suggesting a similar timeline would place his 2026 announcement in June-July 2025. Forecaster 2's optimism about a 6-8 week exploratory period seems based more on possibility than probability - while Osborn COULD announce quickly given his existing infrastructure, the question is whether he WILL. With no urgent deadline for a November 2026 race and his own stated 'early summer' timeline, the evidence points toward a post-June 1 announcement. However, 'early summer' has imprecise boundaries and political circumstances can shift, so some uncertainty remains warranted.",
    "rationale": "After reviewing the other forecasters' analyses, I'm updating downward based primarily on: (1) Osborn's own public statement about deciding by 'early summer' - since June 1 is technically late spring, his stated timeline suggests June-July, which would miss the cutoff; (2) His 2024 announcement pattern (July 2023 for November 2024 race) suggests he prefers announcing ~16 months before the election, which would be July 2025 for the 2026 race; (3) Typical exploratory committees lasting 3-6 months, and he only began in early April. My initial forecast of 40% gave too little weight to his stated timeline and historical pattern. However, I'm not going as low as 30% because: (1) 'Early summer' is imprecise language that some interpret as late May; (2) Political circumstances could accelerate his decision; (3) 38 days still provides meaningful time for unexpected developments. The evidence now points more clearly toward a post-June 1 announcement, but meaningful uncertainty remains.",
