    "review": "The other forecasters and I reached a strong consensus, with all probabilities falling within a narrow range (28-35%). We all agree that the strategic incentives for President Ouattara favor delaying his announcement, and that the base rate for such declarations is closer to the election date (October 2025) than the June 1, 2025 deadline. The core arguments are consistent: maintaining ambiguity keeps the opposition off-balance and his own party in line, and there is no obvious political catalyst in the coming month that would force an early declaration. Forecaster 2 made a particularly salient point by framing the 'complete absence of signals' not just as a lack of information, but as strong evidence for a 'No' outcome. With only a month to go, one would expect some political groundwork or media leaks if a major announcement were imminent. Forecaster 3's concept of 'status quo weighting' also reinforces this view.",
    "rationale": "My initial forecast was 35%. After reviewing the other analyses, I am lowering my forecast slightly to 30%. I am not making a major change because the reasoning of the other forecasters strongly aligns with my own. However, I found Forecaster 2's emphasis on the 'absence of signals' to be particularly persuasive. In the current political environment, it is highly improbable that a candidacy announcement for an incumbent president could be planned for the next 33 days without any preceding rumors, leaks, or scheduling of a major party event. This silence is a significant negative indicator. While I still believe the possibility of a surprise announcement as a 'show of force' is real, the logistical realities and the lack of any preparatory chatter lead me to conclude this scenario is slightly less likely than I first estimated. My updated forecast of 30% reflects a greater weight on the strong evidence provided by the current quiet political landscape.",
