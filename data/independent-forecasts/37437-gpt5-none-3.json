    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "About 56 days (until the end of June 30, 2025)",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Persistent gray-zone pressure—air and naval sorties, cyber, economic coercion, and Coast Guard/PAP actions near Taiwan and its outlying islands—without PLA ground troops landing on Taiwan-controlled territory; the U.S. issues routine condemnations but does not allege a ground-force invasion.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "PLA ground forces conduct a limited seizure of a Taiwan-held outlying island (e.g., Kinmen, Matsu, or Pratas) or a broader amphibious/airborne landing on Taiwan proper; the White House, State Department, or Pentagon publicly states that PRC forces have invaded Taiwan by landing ground troops.",
    "rationale": "Time is short (≈8 weeks) and the required trigger is highly escalatory: PLA ground forces landing on Taiwan-controlled territory plus a public U.S. accusation characterizing it as an invasion. The base rate for a cross-strait amphibious landing in any given two-month window is extremely low, and such an operation would almost certainly be preceded by observable mobilization (amphibious assets massing, RO-RO requisitions, large-scale joint exercises, stockpiling), none of which has been flagged here. The status quo is sustained coercion below the threshold of ground-force use—air/missile drills, maritime harassment, and law-enforcement gray-zone tactics—designed to avoid a war-triggering event. While a small, sudden seizure of an outlying island is more plausible than a full invasion, Beijing has strong incentives to avoid crossing this red line suddenly; moreover, Washington might choose calibrated language (“attack,” “assault,” “seizure”) rather than the politically freighted word “invasion,” creating an additional hurdle for resolution as Yes.\nWhy not higher: A ground landing would be strategically momentous, economically catastrophic, and militarily risky for the PRC; the U.S. would likely detect preparations well in advance, and there is no known current crisis demanding such escalation within the next 56 days. Why not lower: Tail risks remain—an opportunistic move against an outlying island, accidental escalation during exercises, or a political decision in Beijing to test resolve. If PLA marines/airborne troops did land, U.S. officials would likely publicly frame it as an invasion.\nUpdate signals upward: Credible reports of PLA amphibious/airborne mobilization, RO-RO requisitions, unusual force posture around Kinmen/Matsu/Pratas, mass civilian shipping cancellations near the Strait, U.S. intelligence leaks warning of imminent action, air/sea exclusion zones imposed by PRC, or kinetic strikes preceding a landing. Update downward: De-escalatory steps (e.g., restored cross-strait confidence-building measures), sustained reduction in PLA activity, or clear U.S.-China diplomatic thaw. Research assistant provided no additional information, so this assessment leans on base rates, observable-indicator logic, and known incentives.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill the United States accuse the People's Republic of China of invading Taiwan before July 1, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nCFR: [Why China-Taiwan Relations Are So Tense](https://www.cfr.org/backgrounder/china-taiwan-relations-tension-us-policy-trump)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if, before July 1, 2025, the US government publicly accuses the People's Republic of China of invading Taiwan by sending its ground military forces into Taiwan without consent from the Taiwanese government in Taipei.\n\n\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nNo additional information available.\n\nToday is 2025-05-05.\n\nBefore answering you think:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n(e) You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
