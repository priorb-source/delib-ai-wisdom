    "review": "Both forecasters raised critical information I failed to account for. Forecaster 2 highlights ~100 clemencies granted over Jan-Apr 2025 (averaging 25/month) and the institutionalization via new pardon attorney and 'pardon czar' appointments - this suggests a fundamentally different second-term clemency operation than the first term. Forecaster 3 notes a late-May clemency spree (~25 actions on May 28-29) that demonstrates both active pipeline and operational capacity, plus identifies Juneteenth as a potential June timing hook. My original analysis over-anchored on first-term patterns (zero June clemencies 2017-2020) without recognizing that second-term dynamics appear completely different. The key insight both forecasters share: the threshold of 'more than 2' is very low relative to established activity levels. However, Forecaster 3's acknowledgment of clustering patterns (burst then lull) is important - the late-May spree of ~25 actions could mean June is a cooldown period. Forecaster 2's 85% may slightly underweight this lumpiness risk, while Forecaster 3's 65% better balances the high baseline activity against clustering effects.",
    "rationale": "I am updating substantially upward from 30% to 62%. My original forecast erroneously weighted first-term June patterns too heavily when the evidence clearly shows second-term clemency operations are fundamentally different - averaging ~25/month versus sporadic first-term activity. The late-May spree of ~25 clemencies demonstrates: (1) an active pipeline of vetted cases, (2) willingness to act frequently, and (3) institutional capacity via dedicated personnel. Critically, the threshold is very low - only 3+ individuals needed. Even accounting for clustering effects (post-spree lull), achieving 3+ clemencies in a 30-day period seems more likely than not when the established baseline is 25/month. Juneteenth provides a natural timing hook for criminal justice-related clemencies. I'm not going as high as Forecaster 2's 85% because clustering is a real phenomenon - presidents often clear the deck then pause - and a July 4 package remains plausible. I'm slightly below Forecaster 3's 65% but in the same range, as their balanced analysis most closely matches my updated view. The combination of institutionalized processes, demonstrated recent activity, low threshold, and available timing hooks outweighs concerns about post-spree cooling.",
