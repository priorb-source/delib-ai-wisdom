  "information": "According to NOAA data cited in reports, the warmest May on record was in 2020 with a temperature anomaly of +0.95°C versus the 1901-2000 mean, followed by 2016 at +0.93°C. For the current year, preliminary data showed January 2025 was the hottest January on record, March 2025 ranked first or tied for first, and April 2025 ranked as the second warmest. The first three months of 2025 were the second-warmest first quarter recorded. The strong El Niño event that persisted from May 2023 to April 2024 has transitioned to a neutral ENSO (El Niño–Southern Oscillation) state.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "NOAA typically releases monthly global temperature data 3-4 weeks after month end, so the outcome should be known by late June or early July 2025, approximately 2-5 weeks from now.",
    "status_quo_outcome": "May 2025 is very warm and ranks in the top 3-5 warmest Mays on record, but does not break the May 2020 record of +0.95°C anomaly.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "May 2025 experiences elevated temperatures but falls short of the May 2020 record, possibly ranking 2nd or 3rd warmest May. This occurs due to the neutral ENSO conditions providing less warming boost than the El Niño that influenced previous record years, combined with natural variability that prevents consistent record-breaking despite the overall warming trend.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "May 2025 exceeds the May 2020 record due to sustained regional heat waves across multiple continents, elevated ocean temperatures that remained high despite neutral ENSO conditions, and the continuation of the exceptional warmth seen in January and March 2025, pushing global mean temperatures above the +0.95°C threshold.",
    "rationale": "Several factors inform this forecast. The research assistant notes that 2025 has shown mixed temperature performance: January was the hottest on record, March ranked first or tied for first, but April was only second warmest, and Q1 2025 was the second-warmest first quarter. This pattern suggests 2025 is exceptionally warm but not consistently breaking every monthly record. Critically, the strong El Niño that persisted through May 2023-April 2024 has transitioned to neutral ENSO conditions. El Niño events typically boost global temperatures, so this transition likely reduces the probability of breaking records compared to the 2023-2024 period. The record to beat (May 2020 at +0.95°C) is substantial and was set during different climate forcing conditions. The fact that April 2025 was only second warmest is a notable contrary indicator - if 2025 were on a trajectory to systematically break all monthly records, we'd expect April to have ranked first. Good forecasting emphasizes the status quo, and the status quo based on recent patterns suggests May 2025 will likely rank in the top few warmest Mays but not necessarily claim the #1 spot. My forecast is not higher because the neutral ENSO conditions and April's second-place ranking suggest we're not in a record-shattering pattern for every month. It's not lower because climate change continues to push temperatures upward, 2025 has shown exceptional warmth in some months, and ocean heat content may remain elevated enough to support a record. I would revise upward if preliminary May data showed exceptional widespread heat anomalies, or downward if early reports indicated May was merely warm rather than exceptionally hot.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill NOAA report that May 2025 is the hottest May on record?\n\nQuestion background:\n[NOAA Climate change impacts](https://www.noaa.gov/education/resource-collections/climate/climate-change-impacts)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if NOAA at its [Climate at a Glance Global Rankings](https://www.ncei.noaa.gov/access/monitoring/climate-at-a-glance/global/rankings/globe/tavg/land_ocean/202504) tracker reports that May 2025 is the 1st warmest on record.\n\nEnsure that Region is set to Global. Ensure that Surface is set to Land and Ocean.\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nAccording to NOAA data cited in reports, the warmest May on record was in 2020 with a temperature anomaly of +0.95°C versus the 1901-2000 mean, followed by 2016 at +0.93°C.

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
