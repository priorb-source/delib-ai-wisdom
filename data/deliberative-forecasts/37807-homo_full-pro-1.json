    "review": "The analyses from all three forecasters, including my own, are remarkably aligned. We have all identified the central conflict of the question: the new administration's strong political will to reform SNAP versus the powerful force of bureaucratic inertia over a very short, six-week timeframe. We all agree that formal legislative or regulatory changes are impossible by the July 1 deadline. We also correctly identified that the primary, and perhaps only, path to a 'No' outcome is a quick, symbolic edit to the USDA webpage ordered by political leadership. The only difference between the forecasts is the precise probability assigned to this symbolic change scenario, with forecasts ranging from 85% to 90%. Forecaster 3's analysis was particularly compelling in emphasizing the 'immense' procedural hurdles, even for what seems like a simple text change, which I may have slightly underestimated.",
    "rationale": "After reviewing the other forecasts, I am updating my probability slightly upward. My initial reasoning remains the same: the status quo is the strong prior due to the extremely short timeline and the slow nature of government processes. The analyses of my fellow forecasters reinforced this core thesis. However, I found Forecaster 3's reasoning for their 90% forecast convincing enough to move my own. Specifically, I am giving more weight to the argument that even a seemingly 'cosmetic' change to an official government guidance webpage is not frictionless. Such a change would likely require review from legal, policy, and communications staff, who would be wary of creating public confusion by posting guidance that doesn't align with the currently enforceable law (The Food and Nutrition Act). The fact that the administration is actively pursuing change through the state waiver process (e.g., Nebraska, Idaho) provides a tangible outlet for their policy goals, potentially reducing the incentive to make a purely symbolic and potentially confusing change on the national webpage in the immediate term. Therefore, I am decreasing my assessment of the risk of a 'No' outcome from 15% down to 12%, leading to a revised forecast.",
