    "review": "The other two forecasters provided critical new information that was absent from my initial analysis. My forecast was based on the outdated news of the August 2024 license approval and general regional trends, which led me to a highly optimistic conclusion. Forecaster 2's introduction of a missed April 2025 launch deadline and a delay caused by a 'dashboard system' is a powerful negative signal. Forecaster 3 provided an even more compelling argument by identifying the root cause as a fundamental disagreement over data interception for national security, with talks reportedly at a 'preliminary stage' as of March 2025. This is a far more serious obstacle than a simple technical delay. I find their reasoning, particularly Forecaster 3's, to be highly convincing and it completely changes the outlook for this question.",
    "rationale": "I am drastically updating my forecast from 85% to 20%. My initial reasoning was flawed as it relied on old information and failed to account for recent, significant roadblocks. The new evidence presented by the other forecasters, specifically the missed April 2025 deadline and the ongoing negotiations over a regulatory 'dashboard' tied to national security and data interception, is decisive. Such policy and technical disputes are rarely resolved quickly. With talks described as being at a 'preliminary stage' in late March, it is extremely unlikely that a full agreement can be reached, implemented, and the service launched in the short time remaining before July 1, 2025. The status quo is one of delay due to a major, unresolved issue.\n\nI am changing my forecast from a confident 'Yes' to a confident 'No'. The 20% probability I am now assigning accounts for the small chance of a sudden, high-level political intervention forcing a compromise, given that there was initial presidential support for the project. However, the evidence of a fundamental disagreement on a sensitive issue like data access strongly suggests that the service will not be available by the deadline.",
