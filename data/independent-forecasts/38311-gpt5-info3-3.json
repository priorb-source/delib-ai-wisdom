  "information": "According to reports from the Nikkei newspaper, the upcoming G7 summit may not produce a traditional final joint statement due to disagreements between the U.S. and other member nations. The summit may instead result in several separate documents on specific topics of cooperation, while excluding more contentious issues like global trade and relations with Russia from the formal agenda to avoid conflict. In preparation for the summit, German Chancellor Olaf Scholz is scheduled to meet with President Trump at the White House on June 5.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Approximately 1–3 weeks (the summit is scheduled for June 2025, likely mid-to-late month)",
    "status_quo_outcome": "Yes — the U.S. President attends G7 summits in person, and the White House has confirmed Trump will visit Canada for the meeting.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "The summit is postponed beyond June or canceled; or Trump cancels last minute due to a domestic crisis, health/security issue, or chooses to participate only virtually/not enter a room with other leaders at the summit venue.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Trump flies to Canada and joins at least one G7 leaders’ session or group event where he is physically in the same room as other heads of state.",
    "rationale": "Base rate: Modern U.S. presidents almost always attend the G7 in person; last-minute no-shows are rare. Specific evidence: CTV reports the White House has confirmed Trump will visit Canada for the G7 in June, which strongly signals intent and planning. The research assistant notes possible lack of a joint statement and policy disagreements (per Nikkei), but those affect communiqué drafting, not attendance; if anything, contentious agendas increase incentive to attend to shape outcomes. There is also normal pre-summit diplomacy (e.g., Scholz meeting Trump on June 5), consistent with expected participation. Why not higher: Small residual risks remain — schedule slippage moving the summit out of June, an acute domestic or international crisis, health/security issues, or an idiosyncratic late cancellation. What would move me up: Public release of the President’s official travel schedule with firm dates, pool reports of wheels-up, and especially photographic evidence of Trump in a leaders’ session. What would move me down: Credible reporting of a summit postponement, a major domestic emergency, health concerns, or explicit indications he will skip or only participate remotely.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill Donald Trump attend the G7 Summit in June 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nCTV: [Donald Trump will visit Canada for G7, White House confirms](https://www.ctvnews.ca/politics/article/white-house-confirms-trump-will-visit-canada-for-g7-leaders-summit/)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if US President Donald J. Trump attends in person a G7 summit held in June 2025.\n\n\"In person\" is defined as occupying the same physical space closely enough at the G7 Summit that he can see and hear other heads of state through direct un-intermediated exchange of photons and sound waves.\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nAccording to reports from the Nikkei newspaper, the upcoming G7 summit may not produce a traditional final joint statement due to disagreements between the U.S. and other member nations. The summit may instead result in several separate documents on specific topics of cooperation, while excluding more contentious issues like global trade and relations with Russia from the formal agenda to avoid conflict. In preparation for the summit, German Chancellor Olaf Scholz is scheduled to meet with President Trump at the White House on June 5.\n\nToday is 2025-06-03.\n\nBefore answering you think:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n(e) You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
