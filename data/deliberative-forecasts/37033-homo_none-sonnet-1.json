    "review": "The other forecasters and I show strong convergence (20%, 28%, 32%) around a low probability with similar reasoning: very short timeframe, status quo bias, and lack of evidence for imminent payments. Forecaster 2 raises valuable points I underweighted: (1) the payment mechanism being operational is more significant than I credited - the infrastructure now exists, (2) international debt sustainability pressure could accelerate timelines, and (3) the explicit possibility of monthly schedules deserves more consideration. If payments are monthly, we could see one in early May. However, all forecasters acknowledge the critical constraint: the 5-year gap from 2020 agreement to first payment signals glacially slow processes. Forecaster 3 correctly emphasizes that government payment systems operate on months, not weeks, especially in constrained economies. The April 10 'reaffirmation' immediately after the April 9 payment is interesting - this timing could signal genuine momentum or simply be political messaging following the first payment. None of us found evidence of scheduled payments, which is telling given the recency and visibility of this issue.",
    "rationale": "Upon reflection, I slightly underweighted the significance of the payment mechanism now being operational and the possibility, however uncertain, of monthly or rapid sequential payments. The infrastructure to make payments demonstrably exists, which reduces some implementation barriers. However, I maintain that the 5-year delay from agreement to first payment is an extremely strong signal about pace. Government bureaucracies, especially in resource-constrained settings, rarely make payments weeks apart. The research assistant found no evidence of imminent payments, no announced schedule, and no reports of allocated funds for a second payment. Status quo favors no additional payment in 38 days. I'm updating modestly upward from 20% to 24% to better account for the operational payment system and the non-zero possibility of monthly payments or international pressure driving faster action, while respecting the overwhelming evidence that Zimbabwe's payment processes move very slowly.",
