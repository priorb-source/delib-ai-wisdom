  "information": "According to multiple polls from early 2025, Reform UK's support has grown significantly. A YouGov poll in early February showed Reform UK taking the lead over Labour for the first time, with 25% of the vote compared to Labour's 24% and the Conservatives' 21%. It found that one in four Conservative voters from the July 2024 election would now vote for Reform. Later polls from late April by sources like YouGov and More in Common showed Reform UK and Labour tied at 25%, or Reform slightly ahead at 26%. Polling expert Sir John Curtice noted the unprecedented unpopularity of both Labour (24% average rating) and the Conservatives (22%), with Reform narrowly ahead at 25%. A poll by Find Out Now in late January also placed Reform UK in the lead with 26% of the vote, ahead of the Conservatives at 23% and Labour at 22%. By contrast, the Politico poll-of-polls, the resolution source for the question, was reported in one analysis as showing Reform UK at 14.1%, significantly behind Labour (33.7%) and the Conservatives (23.7%).\n\nOn May 1, 2025, local elections are scheduled to take place in England, representing the first major electoral test since the Labour party's landslide victory in the July 2024 general election. Voters will elect over 1,600 councillors and mayors across 23 local authorities. In conjunction with these elections, a UK parliamentary by-election is being held in Runcorn and Helsby. Opinion polls for the by-election in early April indicated a lead for Reform UK, with 28% support, putting them 6 points ahead of Labour (22%) and 8 points ahead of the Conservatives (20%). It was also reported that up to 60 council candidates had defected from the Conservative party to run for Reform UK in the May elections.\n\nRecent reports indicate a significant shift in the British political landscape. Patrick English, director of political analytics at YouGov, described the emergence of 'five party politics,' observing that both Labour and Conservative support levels are declining while support for Reform UK, the Liberal Democrats, and the Green Party is rising. A poll by More In Common found that 41% of voters lack faith in any of the main party leaders, and an Ipsos poll from March 2025 found that 36% of British adults were considering voting for Reform UK. Public sentiment is reportedly characterized by disillusionment with the traditional parties, with key voter issues including immigration, local infrastructure like potholes, and economic concerns. Polling data shows only 60% of those who voted for Labour in the July 2024 election would do so again.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "2 months. The resolution window is from May 1, 2025, to June 30, 2025.",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No. The most recently cited data from the resolution source, Politico's poll-of-polls, shows Reform UK at 14.1%, trailing Labour (33.7%) and the Conservatives (23.7%) by a massive margin. If this trend continues, Reform UK will not become the highest polling party, let alone by a 4-point margin.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Reform UK's performance in the May 2025 local elections is strong but not spectacular, failing to catalyze a further surge in national polls. While their support in individual polls remains high, it either plateaus or is not consistent enough across all pollsters to dramatically shift the Politico poll-of-polls average. The Labour government avoids any major scandals, and their support stabilizes. Consequently, the gap remains too large to close and exceed by 4 points before the July 1 deadline.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Reform UK achieves a landslide victory in the Runcorn and Helsby by-election and makes sweeping gains in the May 1st local elections, exceeding all expectations. This triggers a media firestorm and a political earthquake, causing a cascade of Conservative voters to abandon their party for Reform. In the following weeks, every major pollster shows Reform with a consistent lead over a collapsing Labour party. This sustained, widespread polling lead is so significant that it forces the slow-moving Politico poll-of-polls to reflect this new reality, showing Reform UK with a lead of 4 points or more by mid-June.",
    "rationale": "My forecast is based on the significant disconnect between Reform UK's momentum in individual polls and the structural inertia of the resolution source, Politico's poll-of-polls. The research indicates a genuine surge in support for Reform, with some individual polls even placing them in the lead over the traditional main parties. This is driven by widespread voter disillusionment with both Labour and the Conservatives. The local elections on May 1st could act as a major catalyst, potentially validating and accelerating this trend. However, the question hinges on a poll-of-polls aggregator, which is designed to be a lagging, smoothing indicator, not a volatile one. The reported gap is immense, with Reform at 14.1% needing to overtake Labour at 33.7% and establish a 4-point lead. Accomplishing such a historic political realignment, and having it fully reflected in an aggregator within a tight two-month window, is an exceptionally high bar to clear. While the political environment is volatile, the mechanics of the resolution source heavily favor the status quo. My probability is not lower because the momentum for Reform is undeniable and the potential for a political shock in the current climate is real. A spectacular election result today could theoretically set off the required polling cascade. My probability is not higher because the aggregator's inertia presents a formidable mathematical and structural barrier. For me to increase my forecast, I would need to see multiple, successive polls from a wide variety of pollsters in early May showing a commanding and growing lead for Reform UK, suggesting the trend is both powerful and sustained enough to overcome the aggregator's lag time. Conversely, if post-election polling shows Reform's support has plateaued, I would lower my forecast.",
