    "review": "All three forecasters converged independently on 60%, which is notable and suggests robust reasoning around similar factors. Forecaster 2 and 3 added valuable specificity I had underweighted: (1) The IMF austerity program as a concrete source of economic pain, not just general challenges - this typically creates severe anti-incumbent headwinds in Latin American contexts; (2) The mechanics of vote-splitting across NDP, ABOP, and other opposition parties in a 51-seat multi-member district system with malapportionment, which structurally advantages the largest party; (3) Offshore oil prospects as a forward-looking narrative that could mitigate some economic discontent. Forecaster 3's point about electoral system efficiency and geographic concentration is particularly insightful - in fragmented multi-member districts, maintaining second-place finishes can preserve plurality status even with reduced vote share. However, I'm concerned we may be collectively underweighting the severity of IMF program pain - Latin American incumbents implementing austerity often face brutal electoral punishment. The convergence at exactly 60% by all three forecasters, while reassuring, could also indicate anchoring rather than truly independent assessment. That said, the balance of factors genuinely does seem to support a 'slightly favored' probability range.",
    "rationale": "After reviewing the other analyses, I'm maintaining my forecast at 60%. The key factors remain: (1) VHP's incumbent plurality advantage and organizational presence from winning 20 seats in 2020; (2) Opposition fragmentation between NDP, ABOP, and others that could split anti-incumbent votes across multiple parties; (3) NDP's severe leadership handicap with Bouterse's murder conviction limiting their ceiling; (4) Electoral system mechanics that reward the largest party in multi-member districts even with reduced support. Against these: (1) IMF austerity programs historically devastate incumbent support in the region; (2) Economic pain creates strong motivation for change; (3) We lack recent polling to confirm VHP maintains lead. The convergence of all three forecasters at 60% validates the reasoning but also raises slight concern about groupthink. However, the 'slightly favored but uncertain' range (55-65%) genuinely reflects the balance between structural advantages and economic headwinds. I'm not moving up because the austerity factor is genuinely severe; not moving down because opposition weakness and fragmentation are real constraints on their ability to capitalize on discontent.",
