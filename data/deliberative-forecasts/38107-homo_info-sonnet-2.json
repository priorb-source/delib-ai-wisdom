    "review": "The other forecasters raised several compelling points I had underweighted. Forecaster 2 correctly emphasized that Comey was already interviewed by the Secret Service without being arrested - if authorities had found immediate probable cause, they would have acted then. This is significant evidence. Forecaster 3 identified a specific 2023 Supreme Court ruling requiring subjective intent for threat prosecutions, which creates a higher legal barrier than I initially acknowledged. Both forecasters noted that legal experts are skeptical of prosecution viability, which I should have weighted more heavily. They also correctly observe that no charges, warrants, or subpoenas have been issued as of May 30, with only 32 days remaining. These are strong arguments for a lower probability than my initial 8%.",
    "rationale": "Upon reflection, I'm updating my forecast downward based on three key factors: (1) The fact that Comey was interviewed without arrest indicates authorities did not find immediate probable cause; (2) The specific Supreme Court precedent requiring subjective intent creates a higher legal bar for prosecution than I initially weighted; (3) Legal expert skepticism and the absence of any filed charges with only 32 days remaining makes the timeline even more challenging. However, I'm not going all the way to 3% because the investigation remains active and confirmed, the resolution criteria is broad ('arrest anywhere for any reason'), and the political environment contains genuine unpredictability. The 5% forecast from Forecaster 2 appropriately balances these considerations - acknowledging the strong structural barriers while recognizing the non-zero probability from ongoing investigation and political dynamics.",
