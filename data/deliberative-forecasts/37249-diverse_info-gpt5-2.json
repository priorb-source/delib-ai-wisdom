    "review": "Both forecasters emphasize the key constraint I leaned on: Politico’s poll-of-polls moves slowly and a 4-point lead is a very high bar over a short window. Forecaster 2’s point about the high “considering” pool (36%) is a useful reminder that headroom exists, but translating consideration into sustained leads across multiple pollsters within 8 weeks is still a big ask. I agree with their emphasis on inertia and need for a catalyzing shock; their 15% feels directionally close to my original view.\n\nForecaster 3 adds claims about a by-election showing Reform at 28% and notable councillor defections. While these data suggest momentum and media oxygen, I’m not persuaded they materially raise the probability of reaching the specific Politico threshold. Local and by-election dynamics, plus councillor movements, often overstate national intent and don’t directly shift national averages unless followed by a flurry of consistent national polls. F3’s 30% seems too high given (a) multi-party competition caps spreads, (b) the aggregator’s lag/smoothing, and (c) the need not just to be first but to be 4 points clear during a narrow May–June window.\n\nNet: The added arguments increase my appreciation of near-term volatility around the local elections, but they don’t overcome the structural and temporal hurdles. I’ll edge my probability up slightly to reflect the possibility of a May bounce translating into a run of national polls, but I remain below F2 and well below F3.",
    "rationale": "The bar is strict: between May 1 and June 30, Politico’s UK poll-of-polls must show Reform #1 and at least 4 points ahead. Late-April individual polls sometimes had Reform tied or narrowly ahead in the mid-20s, implying a clustered three-way race. For Politico’s average to register a 4+ point lead, Reform would likely need multiple reputable polls over 1–3 weeks showing a clear margin (roughly 3–6 points ahead of Labour), while the Conservatives also remain subdued. That requires a sustained narrative shock hurting Labour (or a Reform bandwagon) that persists across pollsters.\n\nHeadwinds:\n- Aggregation lag/smoothing: Even if a few polls flip sharply, the Politico average will under-react unless the shift is broad and sustained.\n- Multi-party fragmentation: In a five-party environment, spreads compress; getting to a 4-point average lead is harder than a one-off poll lead.\n- Base rates: It’s historically rare for an insurgent party to open and sustain a 4-point national average lead, especially within two months.\n\nTailwinds/what could prove me wrong:\n- Immediate post–local election momentum: If early May delivers strong Reform narratives and is followed by multiple national polls with Reform at ~28–30% and Labour sliding to low–mid 20s, the average could move quickly enough by mid-to-late June.\n\nBalance: The environment is volatile and Reform has headroom, but clearing a 4-point lead in a smoothed aggregator over this tight window remains unlikely. I modestly raise my estimate to reflect the possibility of a May surge translating into a run of strong national polls, while keeping the probability low overall.",
