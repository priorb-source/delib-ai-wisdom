    "review": "All three forecasters identify the central tension between Alassane Ouattara's strategic ambiguity and the growing pressure from his party, the RHDP, for him to run. We all agree that the status quo is him remaining undeclared and that there is no specific political imperative tied to the June 1st deadline, which favors a 'No' outcome. Forecaster 2 reinforces this by pointing out the arbitrariness of the date and Ouattara's history of maintaining ambiguity. The most impactful new evidence came from Forecaster 3, who provided a specific, compelling list of high-level endorsements from within the RHDP throughout late 2024 and early 2025. This evidence of a coordinated, sustained internal campaign to name him the candidate is more powerful than the general 'party pressure' I had initially considered. It suggests a deliberate effort to create an air of inevitability that could culminate in a formal announcement sooner rather than later.",
    "rationale": "I am increasing my forecast from 25% to 35%. My initial analysis was heavily weighted by the recent disqualification of key opposition figures, which I believed would reduce the urgency for Ouattara to declare. I reasoned this gave him more time and space to potentially anoint a successor. However, the specific evidence provided by Forecaster 3—citing repeated, public declarations by senior ministers that Ouattara *will be* the candidate—convinces me that the internal party momentum is a stronger factor than I had assessed. This coordinated messaging campaign makes an early declaration in May more plausible, as it would serve to formalize the party's position and capitalize on this manufactured momentum. Despite this update, I am keeping the probability below 50%. The core arguments against an early declaration remain strong: historical precedent (e.g., his August 2020 declaration), the strategic advantages of waiting to declare as an incumbent, and the lack of any compelling external threat that necessitates an early move. The 10-point increase reflects a re-evaluation of the internal political dynamics, which now appear more likely to precipitate an announcement before the arbitrary June 1 deadline than I previously believed.",
