    "review": "Both forecasters emphasize the arithmetic hurdle (+47k over two months) and the supply-side throttle (starts/permits/HMI) limiting near-term inflows. I agree with that core logic and with the historical base rate: >550k was essentially a 2006–07 phenomenon. They add a useful nuance: even as builders cut starts, a near-term bulge from completions plus softer sales could lift inventory before the slowdown bites. However, given typical month-to-month volatility in HNFSEPUSSA, sustaining +20–30k per month for April/May still looks exceptional. I also think their probabilities (18–20%) run a bit high relative to the required acceleration and historical monthly changes. They didn’t address that the starts/permits pullback mainly affects the second half of 2025 inventory more than May, nor did they quantify how often we’ve seen two-month gains of ~+9–10%—which is rare. Overall, their reasoning supports a No outcome; I find their tail-risk scenario reasonable but not enough to push odds near 1-in-5.",
    "rationale": "Starting point: 503k in March (FRED HNFSEPUSSA). To exceed 550k in May requires ~+47k over two prints, or roughly +9.4% in two months. Typical monthly swings in this series are on the order of low single-digit thousands to perhaps ~10–15k in more active periods; sustained +20–30k monthly rises are unusual outside extreme episodes. Supply-side indicators (starts -14% m/m, single-family permits -2%, HMI ~42) argue against a sudden supply flood. Demand is mixed: sales are decent (724k SAAR in March, up YoY) but mortgage rates are elevated, which could weaken April/May sales and lift inventory at the margin. A completions bulge could add stock near term, but getting to >550k by May would likely require both an unusually weak sales print and an unusually large completions-driven jump, plus favorable revisions—an unlikely stack. Revisions are a risk but typically not on the order needed to bridge ~47k in two months. Net: I keep the probability low, but I nudge it up slightly to reflect the plausible (if still unlikely) short-term accumulation scenario highlighted by the other forecasters. I would raise materially only if April’s inventory prints ≥525–530k or if we see evidence of a sharp sales air-pocket alongside elevated completions; I would lower if April comes in ≤515k.",
