    "status_quo_outcome": "No - the objective remains marked as 'in progress' on the tracker",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Despite ongoing efforts to undermine or change the PSLF program through administrative actions or proposed legislation, the tracker maintainers determine that the program has not been effectively terminated by July 1, 2025. Legal challenges, implementation delays, or incomplete policy changes mean the objective stays marked as 'in progress' or another non-complete status.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "The administration takes definitive administrative action to terminate the PSLF program - such as issuing rules that end new enrollments, canceling existing agreements, or implementing changes that the tracker maintainers view as effective termination. Even if legal challenges are ongoing, the tracker is updated to show 'complete' because the program has been functionally ended by executive action before July 1, 2025.",
    "rationale": "This question hinges on whether community-maintained tracker will mark a major federal program termination as 'complete' within 48 days. Several factors work against this: (1) Time constraint: 48 days is very short for completing major policy changes, especially ones requiring legislative action or surviving legal review. (2) Program entrenchment: PSLF is established by federal law and serves hundreds of thousands of borrowers, making termination complex and legally challenging. (3) Status quo bias: The objective is currently 'in progress,' suggesting some action has been taken but completion is not imminent. Tracker maintainers would need clear evidence of effective termination to mark it complete. (4) Implementation lag: Even if aggressive administrative actions were announced, actual implementation and the tracker's recognition of completion would likely extend beyond this timeframe. The main scenario for 'Yes' would be if dramatic administrative actions have already occurred that tracker maintainers view as functionally terminating the program, regardless of ongoing legal challenges. However, such definitive action seems unlikely to be both implemented AND recognized as complete within 48 days. For my forecast to move higher, I would need evidence of imminent major administrative actions with clear timelines. For it to move lower, I would need evidence that legal or political obstacles have stalled progress entirely.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill the Project 2025 Tracker spreadsheet have the objective of terminating the Public Service Loan Forgiveness program marked as complete before July 1, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nAt the time of this question, the objective was marked as \"in progress.\" The 2025 Tracker is a project of the Keep_Track subreddit and is explained [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/Keep_Track/comments/1ii7tbr/project_2025_tracker_is_now_live/).\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if the Project 2025 objective to \"terminate the Public Service Loan Forgiveness program\" is marked as complete according to [this spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1QGG6wNHna-1tt91yXNkOauAJJ7snobFjfEnmxlmzhl4/edit?gid=0#gid=0) before July 1, 2025. If it is anything other than complete (such as \"in progress\") when accessed by Metaculus on or after July 1, 2025, then the question resolves as **No**.\n\n\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nNo additional information available.\n\nToday is 2025-05-14.\n\nBefore answering you think:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n(e) You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
