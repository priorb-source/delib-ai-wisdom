    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "About 26 days (until July 1, 2025)",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "The New York Times covers Chinese consumer trends or Fed money-market operations but uses standard English terms (e.g., “reverse repurchase,” “reverse repo,” “resale,” “daigou,” or “reverse consumption”) rather than the exact phrases “reverse purchasing” or “reverse purchase.” No incidental use of “reverse purchase” appears in business/legal contexts.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "The Times publishes a piece between June 10–30, 2025 that either: (1) quotes Chinese state media or social platforms and explicitly cites the term “reverse purchasing,” or (2) runs a business/markets article that uses the exact phrase “reverse purchase” (e.g., “reverse purchase agreement”), which then shows up in the NYT site search results.",
    "rationale": "- Short window: The term must appear in NYT items dated after June 9 and before July 1, 2025—a roughly 3‑week span.\n- Phrase rarity: In English-language financial and consumer reporting, “reverse purchasing” is uncommon. For money markets, the standard term is “reverse repurchase (repo),” not “reverse purchase.” For consumer trends, U.S. outlets more often write “reverse consumption,” “daigou,” or paraphrase the concept.\n- Editorial style: NYT tends to prefer established English terminology. Even when covering Chinese neologisms, they often translate or describe them rather than adopting less idiomatic phrases—unless the meme itself becomes widely quoted.\n- Status quo weight: With no current NYT usage and no clear sign this specific phrasing has broken into Western coverage, the default is that it won’t appear in the narrow window.\n- Why not lower: There is a nonzero chance NYT does a timely explainer on China’s consumer trends and quotes People’s Daily or Chinese social media verbatim, including “reverse purchasing,” or a markets piece happens to use the exact “reverse purchase” phrasing.\n- What would move me up: Evidence that Western/English-language outlets (or NYT itself pre-window) started using “reverse purchasing” or “reverse purchase”; a published NYT China-trend feature plan or newsletter tease adopting the exact term; or an NYT markets column that explicitly writes “reverse purchase agreement.”\n- What would move me down: Continued absence of the term in English coverage; signs that NYT style guidance sticks strictly to “reverse repo” and avoids the alternative phrasing.\n- Research assistant summary: No additional information available, so this forecast relies on general usage patterns and editorial norms.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill the New York Times mention \"reverse purchasing\" before July 1, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nPeople's Daily: [“Reverse purchasing” reflects the vitality of the Chinese market](http://finance.people.com.cn/n1/2025/0430/c1004-40471159.html)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if the NY Times mentions \"reverse purchasing\" in any of its content items as found through [this search](https://www.nytimes.com/search?dropmab=false&lang=en&query=%22reverse%20purchasing%22&sort=best), dated after June 9, 2025 and before July 1, 2025. This question will also count \"reverse purchase,\" which can be found through [this link](https://www.nytimes.com/search?dropmab=false&lang=en&query=%22reverse%20purchase%22&sort=best).\n\n\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nNo additional information available.\n\nToday is 2025-06-05.\n\nBefore answering you think:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n(e) You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
