    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Approximately 3 weeks.",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No. The background information suggests a recent 'plunge' in consumer sentiment. If the negative factors driving this trend persist, the index is likely to remain at depressed levels, at or below 60.0.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "The economic concerns that caused the sentiment plunge in May, such as the prospect of new tariffs, persist or worsen. Disappointing inflation or labor market data released in June further dampens consumer spirits, causing the final index to settle at or below 60.0.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "The May plunge represents a temporary overreaction to negative news. In June, sentiment stabilizes and slightly recovers due to positive developments, such as a delay in tariff implementation, a strong jobs report, or falling gasoline prices, pushing the final index number above 60.0.",
    "rationale": "My forecast is primarily based on the single piece of provided information: an Axios article from May 19, 2025, titled 'Why the consumer sentiment plunge is different now.' The word 'plunge' indicates a sharp and significant deterioration in consumer confidence in the preceding month. Consumer sentiment often exhibits downward stickiness; after a major negative shock, it tends to recover slowly rather than snapping back immediately. Therefore, the status quo is one of depressed sentiment, making an outcome of 60.0 or lower more likely than not. The 60.0 level is historically low, suggesting a serious downturn in consumer mood. \n\nMy forecast is not lower (i.e., the probability of 'Yes' is not smaller) because we lack quantitative data on the 'plunge.' It might have been a drop from a high level to one still above 60 (e.g., from 75 to 63). Sentiment can also be volatile, and a modest positive surprise in economic data or policy news could be sufficient to keep the index just above the 60.0 threshold. \n\nMy forecast is not higher because the term 'plunge' implies significant underlying concerns, such as the tariffs mentioned in the article's context, which are unlikely to be fully resolved within a few weeks. The negative momentum makes a swift recovery above this low threshold difficult. \n\nI would increase my probability forecast for 'Yes' if the preliminary June sentiment data shows a strong rebound, or if there is definitive news that threatened tariffs will not be implemented. Conversely, I would decrease my probability if the final May numbers confirm a reading below 60, or if further negative economic news emerges early in June.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill the June 2025 University of Michigan Consumer Sentiment Final Report number be greater than 60.0?\n\nQuestion background:\nAxios: [Why the consumer sentiment plunge is different now](https://www.axios.com/2025/05/19/tariffs-consumer-economy-sentiment)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if the University of Michigan's reported June Final Results of the Index of Consumer Sentiment, expected to be posted [here](https://data.sca.isr.umich.edu/reports.php) on the final Friday of June 2025, is greater than 60.0 for June 2025. Less than or equal to that amount resolves the question as **No**.\n\n\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nNo additional information available.\n\nToday is 2025-06-04.\n\nBefore answering you think:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n(e) You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
