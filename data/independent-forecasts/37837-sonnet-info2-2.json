  "information": "Between May 2023 and June 2024, the US government documented 757 reports of Unidentified Aerial Phenomena (UAPs), with 708 of them occurring in the air. Of these, only 49 cases were officially closed. A notable number of these sightings occurred near the U.S.-Mexico border, particularly in Arizona. Media reports have covered recent military-related incidents, including a US Air Force F-16 fighter jet that was struck and damaged by an object over Arizona in January 2023. In a separate event from September 2024, a US Air Force pilot reported a close encounter with an object traveling at Mach 2 during a mission in California.",

    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Approximately 5-6 weeks. The outcome will be known on or after July 1, 2025 when NUFORC posts June 2025 data, with today being May 23, 2025.",
    "status_quo_outcome": "June 2025 sees a typical summer peak in UFO reporting to NUFORC, with sightings likely in the 350-450 range based on historical seasonal patterns where summer months see 20-40% increases over baseline levels.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "June 2025 experiences weather patterns that discourage outdoor activities, or public interest in UFO reporting has waned from recent highs. NUFORC receives 400 or fewer reports, representing either a typical or below-average June with no major triggering events to spike reporting behavior.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "June 2025 sees favorable weather conditions encouraging outdoor activities during peak summer season. Sustained public interest from recent government UAP disclosures continues to motivate civilians to report sightings. A possible viral social media event or minor news story about UFOs/UAPs generates additional reporting activity, pushing the monthly total above 400.",
    "rationale": "The National UFO Reporting Center has processed over 180,000 reports since 1974, suggesting a long-term average of roughly 300-350 reports per month. However, reporting rates vary significantly by season and are influenced by media attention and public awareness. June is historically a peak month for UFO sightings due to warmer weather, longer daylight hours, and more people engaged in outdoor activities. This seasonal effect typically produces 20-40% increases over baseline monthly averages. The research assistant's information about government UAP reports (averaging 58/month) is not directly relevant since NUFORC receives civilian reports which typically far exceed official government documentation. The threshold of 400 reports appears deliberately calibrated near expected June levels, suggesting the question is designed to be competitive. Recent government disclosure efforts and media coverage of UAPs have maintained elevated public interest, which could sustain higher reporting rates. However, without access to specific recent June data from NUFORC, there's uncertainty about whether 400 is above or below the recent June average. My forecast is not higher because: 400 may represent an above-average June requiring favorable conditions, there's no specific triggering event expected, and reporting enthusiasm may have stabilized after initial government disclosure interest peaked. My forecast is not lower because: June is definitively peak season historically, current public awareness of UAPs remains elevated, and the online reporting system makes submissions easy. I would revise upward if: NUFORC's recent monthly data showed consistently higher numbers, major UFO-related news broke before or during June, or specific events were planned that would generate attention. I would revise downward if: historical June data showed typical levels well below 400, or early June 2025 reporting rates tracked significantly below pace.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill the number of UFO sightings reported by the National UFO Reporting Center exceed 400 for June 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nAccording to the [National UFO Reporting Center](https://nuforc.org/about-us/): \"The National UFO Reporting Center was founded in 1974 by noted UFO investigator Robert J. Gribble. The Center’s primary function over the past five decades has been to receive, record, and to the greatest degree possible, corroborate and document reports from individuals who have been witness to unusual, possibly UFO-related events. Throughout its history, the Center has processed over 180,000 reports, and has distributed its information to thousands of individuals.\"\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if The National UFO Reporting Center posts greater than 400 UFO/UAP sighting reports at [this link](https://nuforc.org/ndx/?id=event) for the month of June 2025, as displayed when accessed by Metaculus on or after July 1, 2025.\n\n\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nBetween May 2023 and June 2024, the US government documented 757 reports of Unidentified Aerial Phenomena (UAPs), with 708 of them occurring in the air.

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
