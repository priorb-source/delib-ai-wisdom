  "information": "The FSIS follows a structured process for closing recalls. This process involves verifying that the recalling firm has notified all its customers, confirming that the product has been removed from circulation, conducting effectiveness checks to ensure the product is no longer available to consumers, and verifying that the company has implemented corrective actions. For Class I recalls, which are deemed high-risk, the FSIS enforces more rigorous verification requirements before it can be closed. Recalls involving foreign material contamination necessitate a comprehensive investigation into the source of the contaminant and the implementation of effective preventive measures.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "52 days (as of 2025-05-09)",
    "status_quo_outcome": "As of today, May 9, 2025, the recall status is 'Active'. If the process for closing the recall is not completed before the deadline, the status will remain 'Active', and the question will resolve as No.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "The investigation into the source of the foreign matter proves complex, or the FSIS effectiveness checks encounter delays in verifying that all product has been accounted for and removed from commerce. These procedural or bureaucratic delays push the official closure of the recall past the June 30, 2025 deadline.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Johnsonville, being a large and well-resourced company, efficiently executes its recall plan. They quickly account for the recalled product, identify and correct the source of the contamination, and provide the necessary documentation to the FSIS, allowing the agency to complete its verification and change the status to 'Closed' before July 1, 2025.",
    "rationale": "The key factor in this forecast is the tension between Johnsonville's efficiency and the procedural thoroughness of the FSIS. The recall was issued on April 5, 2025, giving the company nearly three months to resolve it before the July 1, 2025 deadline. My research indicates that the FSIS follows a multi-step process for closing recalls, including verifying customer notification, ensuring product removal, conducting effectiveness checks, and approving corrective actions. For a Class I recall involving foreign matter, this process is particularly rigorous and designed for safety, not speed. The status quo is 'Active', and inertia favors a 'No' outcome. However, Johnsonville is a major corporation with a significant incentive to resolve this matter swiftly to protect its brand. It likely has a sophisticated and well-practiced recall system. Given that over a month has already passed, the most labor-intensive parts of the recall, like customer notification and product retrieval, are likely well underway or complete. The remaining time is for verification and paperwork. My forecast is not higher because bureaucratic processes within a federal agency like the FSIS can be unpredictable and are prone to delays. Any complication in the effectiveness checks or the approval of Johnsonville's corrective actions could easily push the closure into July. My forecast is not lower because nearly three months is a plausible timeframe for a well-managed company to complete even a rigorous recall process. I would raise my probability if there were public statements from the company or FSIS indicating the recall was proceeding smoothly. I would lower my probability if the recall were expanded or if there were any reports of difficulties in accounting for the product.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill the USDA-posted recall by Johnsonville LLC of cheddar bratwurst for foreign matter contamination issued April 5, 2025 be closed before July 1, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nReal Simple: [Over 22,000 Pounds of a Popular Sausage Brand Recalled Due to Contamination](https://www.realsimple.com/sausage-recall-2025-11711268)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if the status of the recall posted by the U.S. Department of Agriculture’s Food Safety and Inspection Service (FSIS) is changed from Active to Closed on [this page](https://www.fsis.usda.gov/recalls-alerts/johnsonville-llc-recalls-cheddar-bratwurst-product-due-possible-foreign-matter) before July 1, 2025. If the recall is still shown as Active when the link is accessed by Metaculus on or after July 1, 2025, this question resolves as **No**.\n\n\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nThe FSIS follows a structured process for closing recalls.

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
