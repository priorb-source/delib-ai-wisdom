    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "About 56 days (until July 1, 2025)",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No — Florida’s current voter citizenship attestation/verification rules remain in place with no new requirement that voters themselves provide additional proof.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "The 2025 regular session adjourns without passing any bill that requires voters to provide documentary proof of citizenship (e.g., HB 831 stalls or is stripped to agency data checks only), and no special session occurs before July 1. Alternatively, an elections package passes but only adds backend database checks (e.g., SAVE, jury records) without placing a new proof-of-citizenship documentation burden on voters.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Before July 1, the Legislature passes and the Governor signs (or allows to become law) a bill like HB 831 that requires at least some voters to provide documentary proof of U.S. citizenship beyond current law—such as first-time registrants, those registering via third-party groups, or mail ballot applicants—to take effect at some later date (implementation/timing or litigation would not matter for resolution).",
    "rationale": "Time: Roughly eight weeks remain. Florida’s regular session in odd-numbered years typically ends around early May. If a qualifying bill passed this session, the Governor would have a short window (generally up to 15 days post-adjournment) to sign, veto, or let it become law, so we would likely know by mid/late May. After that, only a special session could change the outcome before July 1, which is possible but uncommon absent a strong push.\n\nStatus quo baseline: The default is No. Most sessions do not produce new voter-facing documentary requirements, especially those that risk federal preemption under the NVRA. Florida already requires attestation under penalty of perjury and uses some backend verification; moving to require voters to present documentary proof (e.g., passport, birth certificate) is a bigger legal/political lift.\n\nPolitical/legislative factors: Florida has a Republican trifecta and has regularly advanced election and immigration-related legislation. That supports some chance of passage. However, measures that explicitly require voters to provide documentary proof for federal elections have faced significant legal headwinds in other states (e.g., Kansas, Arizona). Even if Florida’s leadership is willing to court litigation, creating voter-facing documentation requirements can be operationally complex (dual systems for federal vs state ballots, etc.), which can make late-session adoption less likely or lead to such provisions being stripped in negotiations.\n\nQuestion wording constraint: The resolution requires that voters be required to provide proof. Purely administrative expansions (state-run database checks) would not count. That narrows the path to Yes. The cited example bill (HB 831) appears to set such a requirement, but unless language like that survives to enactment, backend-only verification changes won’t resolve the question as Yes.\n\nSignals and timing: As of May 6, absent clear, high-profile reporting of Florida enacting a voter documentary proof requirement—something that would likely garner national attention—the safer assumption is that either the provision stalled or remains uncertain. With the regular session likely concluded or concluding, the probability mass shifts toward No unless there is confirmation that a qualifying bill passed and is pending gubernatorial action.\n\nWhy not higher: Legal vulnerability (NVRA preemption), implementation burdens, and the narrow requirement that voters themselves provide proof reduce the base chance. The session timing further compresses the window.\n\nWhy not lower: GOP control, alignment with national party priorities, and the fact that any subset of voters counts (e.g., first-time registrants, mail voters) keep a non-trivial chance alive. If a qualifying provision passed in an omnibus elections bill, enactment could occur within weeks.\n\nWhat would move me up: Credible reports that both chambers passed a bill requiring voter-provided proof of citizenship, placement on the Governor’s desk, or the calling of a special session with this as a stated priority. What would move me down: Credible confirmation that HB 831 (or equivalent) died or that final elections bills contain only agency-run verification without new voter documentary requirements.\n\nResearch assistant note: No additional information was available, so this forecast leans on institutional timelines, legal context, and base rates rather than confirmed bill status.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nBefore July 1, 2025, will Florida enact legislation expanding its verification requirements of a voter's citizenship?\n\nQuestion background:\nTallahassee Democrat: [Florida may require proof of citizenship to vote under new legislation echoing Trump](https://www.tallahassee.com/story/news/local/state/2025/04/02/got-id-proof-of-citizenship-may-soon-be-needed-to-vote-in-florida/82756919007/)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if, before July 1, 2025, the state of Florida enacts legislation requiring voters to provide proof of US citizenship beyond the requirements at the time of this question, according to [credible sources](https://www.metaculus.com/faq/#definitions).\n\nAny subset of voters being required to provide such proof would count (for example if it only applied to first-time voter registrants or creating a new requirement for mail-in voters). An example of a bill that would count is [HB 831](https://www.flsenate.gov/Session/Bill/2025/831). This question resolves upon enactment; therefore other questions such as when the legislation takes effect or whether it survives court challenges and is implemented is immaterial to this question's resolution.\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nNo additional information available.\n\nToday is 2025-05-06.\n\nBefore answering you think:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n(e) You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
