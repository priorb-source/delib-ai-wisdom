  "information": "Y Combinator (YC) is launching its inaugural AI Startup School in San Francisco on June 16-17, 2025. The event is a free conference intended for 2,000 top AI students, researchers, and recent graduates, with YC offering up to $500 for travel expenses. The program's goal is to shape the next generation of AI startups by focusing on entrepreneurship, product building, and fundraising. YC has announced that Sam Altman and Elon Musk are among the event's headline speakers.\n\nSam Altman and Elon Musk co-founded OpenAI in 2015 as a non-profit foundation, with Musk providing significant initial funding. Musk left the organization in 2018 citing disagreements with Altman and the company's direction. After OpenAI was re-launched as a for-profit entity, Musk filed a lawsuit alleging a violation of the original non-profit principles. Their public rivalry has also included a hostile, unsolicited $97.4 billion takeover bid for OpenAI led by Musk, which Altman publicly dismissed, and reported competition for influence over U.S. government AI projects.\n\nIn May 2025, news reports indicated that Sam Altman had made conciliatory gestures towards Elon Musk. Altman reportedly wrote to Musk proposing a collaboration on the development of artificial general intelligence (AGI) and extended an 'olive branch.' While Musk had not publicly responded to the written offer, reports mentioned that informal contacts had occurred between the technical teams of their respective organizations. Separately, Altman publicly posted on social media to Musk, stating, 'AGI is too important, can't let petty grudges get in the way.'",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "~20 days until the window opens (after 7:59 AM PDT, Jun 16, 2025); ~22 days until it closes (before 12:00 AM PDT, Jun 18, 2025). If no clear evidence, resolution by Jul 1 (~35 days).",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Both speak in separate solo keynotes/fireside chats; no joint panel or group-on-stage moment occurs, or one appears remotely/cancels, so they are never physically on the same stage at the same time.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "YC schedules a joint fireside chat/panel featuring both, or brings all headliners on stage together for a closing segment/photo/Q&A, with both Altman and Musk physically present.",
    "rationale": "- Baseline: At multi-speaker conferences, headline guests typically appear in separate sessions unless a joint segment is explicitly promoted. With no current program indicating a joint conversation, the status quo points to No.\n- Relationship dynamics: Per the research assistant, Altman and Musk have a fraught history (OpenAI split, lawsuit, hostile takeover bid). Altman reportedly offered an olive branch in May 2025 and appealed publicly for collaboration. That increases the chance above a very low base, but there’s no public reciprocation from Musk yet.\n- Incentives and risks: A joint appearance would generate significant buzz but also risk overshadowing the event with controversy. For a student-focused conference that is already free and capacity-limited, YC has less need for a high-drama joint segment. Security/PR complexity further reduces odds of a last-minute joint plan.\n- Attendance reliability: Altman is highly likely to attend in person; Musk’s in-person attendance is less reliable. Physical co-presence is required, so any remote participation or no-show by either makes Yes impossible.\n- Rough decomposition: P(Musk attends in person) ~65–70%; P(Altman attends) ~90–95%; P(share-stage | both attend) ~10–15% absent explicit scheduling. Multiplying yields ~7–10% overall.\n- Why not higher: No explicit joint session announced; adversarial history; YC’s likely preference for separate segments; Musk’s unpredictability.\n- Why not lower: Both are confirmed headliners at the same two-day event; Altman’s recent conciliatory signals; YC could engineer a symbolic joint moment (e.g., closing on-stage photo/panel).\n- Updates that would increase probability: Official schedule or teaser of a joint fireside/panel; public friendliness or joint messaging between Altman and Musk; reports of coordinated security/PR planning for a joint segment.\n- Updates that would decrease probability: Published schedule showing only separate appearances; announcements of remote participation; any renewed public hostility; credible reports of Musk’s non-attendance or schedule conflict.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill Sam Altman and Elon Musk be on the stage together at YC AI Startup School?\n\nQuestion background:\nY Combinator is an American venture capital firm known for launching over 5,000 companies including Airbnb, Stripe, and Reddit. In 2025, Y Combinator announced AI Startup School, a conference in San Francisco held on June 16–17, aimed at 2,000 final-year students and recent graduates in computer science, artificial intelligence, and related fields.&#x20;\n\nY Combinator has announced that both Sam Altman and Elon Musk are among the headline speakers at the AI Startup School, but it is unknown whether they will appear on stage together at the same time.\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question will resolve as Yes if Sam Altman and Elon Musk share a stage together at YC AI Startup School after 7:59 AM, June 16, 2025, and before 00:00 AM, June 18, 2025. Otherwise, this question will resolve as No.\n\nSharing a stage is defined as both individuals being physically present on the same platform at the same time.&#x20;\n\nThis question will resolve according to a preponderance of evidence. If there is no clear evidence of this occurring before July 1, 2025, this question will resolve as No.\n\nAll times for this question are in Pacific Daylight Time (PDT).  &#x20;\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nY Combinator (YC) is launching its inaugural AI Startup School in San Francisco on June 16-17, 2025.

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
