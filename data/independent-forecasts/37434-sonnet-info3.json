  "information": "By March 2025, AquaBounty's market capitalization had fallen to approximately $2.2 million, with its stock price dropping from a 52-week high of $3.05 to well below $1. The stock is trading below the NASDAQ compliance threshold, risking delisting. Despite the low price, institutional investor Epiq Partners LLC increased its holdings in the company by 423.5% in the fourth quarter. As of early 2025, institutional investors and hedge funds own 8.92% of the company's stock.",

    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "57 days until July 1, 2025",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No bankruptcy filing - AquaBounty continues operating without filing for bankruptcy protection",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "AquaBounty secures emergency financing, completes a debt restructuring, finds a strategic partner or acquirer, or simply manages to continue operations through July 1 despite financial difficulties without formally filing for bankruptcy protection",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "AquaBounty exhausts its cash reserves, cannot meet debt obligations or payroll, fails to secure additional financing, and files for Chapter 7 or Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection before July 1, 2025",
    "rationale": "The market signals indicate severe financial distress. A market capitalization of only $2.2 million for a publicly-traded biotechnology company is extraordinarily low and typically indicates the market views the equity as nearly worthless. The stock price collapse from $3.05 to well below $1, combined with NASDAQ delisting risk, reinforces this assessment. However, several factors moderate the bankruptcy probability within this specific 57-day timeframe: (1) Status quo bias - even severely distressed companies often limp along for months before filing bankruptcy as they exhaust all alternatives; (2) The 423.5% increase in holdings by Epiq Partners, while small in absolute terms, suggests at least one institutional investor sees some value or opportunity; (3) Bankruptcy is a deliberate legal action that companies typically delay as long as possible, trying debt restructuring, asset sales, or emergency financing first. The short timeframe works both ways - it's not enough time for a turnaround, but it's also a relatively brief window for a bankruptcy filing to occur. Companies in distress often survive quarter to quarter. Without access to the actual financial statements showing cash position, burn rate, and debt obligations, I'm relying heavily on market signals. For my forecast to move higher (toward 40-50%), I would need evidence of: imminent debt default, single-digit weeks of cash runway, or failed financing attempts. For my forecast to move lower (toward 10-15%), I would need evidence of: successful fundraising, debt extension agreements, or a credible restructuring plan. Given the extreme distress signals but accounting for status quo bias and the specific 57-day window, I assess the probability at 25%.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill AquaBounty Technologies file for bankruptcy before July 1, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\n[AquaBounty Technologies Announces Full Year 2024 Financial Results](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1603978/000160397825000012/aqb-20250327xex99_1.htm)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question will resolve as **Yes** if AquaBounty Technologies, Inc., files any petition for bankruptcy protection in the United States, under any chapter of the United States Bankruptcy Code, before July 1, 2025. The question will resolves on the filing of such a petition, not on whether any bankruptcy protection is granted by a court. If no such petition is filed by that date, this question will resolve as **No**.\n\n\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nBy March 2025, AquaBounty's market capitalization had fallen to approximately $2.2 million, with its stock price dropping from a 52-week high of $3.05 to well below $1.

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
