  "information": "As of May 2025, the number of active destinations was estimated to be around 39, based on OAG schedule data, down from 53 in May 2024. A number of airlines that suspended routes in October 2023, including British Airways, Lufthansa Group, Saudia, EgyptAir, and Pegasus, had not fully returned. Key Gulf carriers like Kuwait Airways and Qatar Airways also remained absent. Lebanon’s tourism ministry has projected that summer arrivals for 2025 will be 30% below 2019 levels.",

    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Approximately 6 weeks, with the outcome determined on or after July 1, 2025.",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No. The number of active destinations is currently around 39, a significant drop from 53 a year ago. If the current security situation and airline schedules persist, the count will remain well below the threshold of 51.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "The low-intensity conflict between Israel and Hezbollah continues through June 2025. Consequently, major international airlines that suspended flights in late 2023, such as Lufthansa, British Airways, and key Gulf carriers, do not perceive a sufficient reduction in risk to resume services. The summer tourism season fails to materialize, and the number of direct flight destinations remains below 45.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "A durable ceasefire is brokered between Israel and Hezbollah in late May or early June 2025. This creates a rapid shift in security assessments, prompting several major European and Gulf airlines to quickly reinstate their profitable summer routes to Beirut to capture holiday and VFR (Visiting Friends and Relatives) traffic. This swift resumption of multiple routes pushes the total number of destinations above 51 by July 1.",
    "rationale": "My forecast is heavily influenced by the current geopolitical and security situation. The research provided indicates a sharp decline in direct flight destinations from 53 in May 2024 to just 39 in May 2025. This 26% decrease is a direct consequence of the conflict that began in October 2023, leading major international carriers to suspend services. The status quo is a persistent, low-level conflict that deters risk-averse airlines. For the number of destinations to increase by at least 13 in the next six weeks, a significant positive catalyst is required. Airline scheduling is typically done months in advance, and while schedules can be adjusted, reinstating routes requires logistical planning and a strong signal of stability.\n\nMy probability is not higher because the core driver of the decline—regional conflict—remains unresolved, and there are no strong indications of an imminent, lasting ceasefire. The tourism ministry's own pessimistic forecast for the summer further supports a subdued outlook. The short timeframe until the resolution date makes a full recovery to over 51 destinations highly improbable under current conditions.\n\nMy probability is not lower (e.g., 1-5%) because a 'Yes' outcome, while unlikely, is not impossible. A sudden diplomatic breakthrough could lead to a rapid change in airline calculus, especially given the potential revenue from the summer season. The infrastructure and prior agreements for these routes exist; they are merely suspended. A positive shock event could trigger their rapid reactivation.\n\nI would increase my forecast if a credible ceasefire is announced before mid-June and major airlines publicly confirm their intent to resume flights. Conversely, I would lower my forecast if the conflict escalates significantly.",

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
