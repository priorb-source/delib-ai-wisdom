    "review": "All three forecasts cluster narrowly between 25-32%, suggesting strong agreement on the core dynamics. Forecaster 2 emphasizes the strict acknowledgment requirement as a significant barrier given China's recent pattern of denying Trump's call claims - this is a valid concern I underweighted. Forecaster 3 makes the strongest new argument: that leader calls historically follow working-level talks to endorse frameworks or manage escalation. This is a pattern-based insight that increases the conditional probability of a call if the Geneva talks produce any substantive outcome. Both forecasters appropriately weight the May 10-11 talks as the critical near-term catalyst, occurring just before the resolution window opens. Forecaster 3's characterization of a leader call as a 'low-cost tool' for managing escalation is also compelling - even amidst high tensions, a phone call is less committal than a summit. However, all three of us must contend with the very recent negative signals: Trump's May 5 statement of 'no immediate plans' and China's continued denials are only 2 days old, making rapid reversal less likely.",
    "rationale": "Upon reflection, I find Forecaster 3's historical pattern argument persuasive but Forecaster 2's acknowledgment concern equally valid. The Geneva talks on May 10-11 represent a concrete inflection point - if they produce even modest progress, the historical pattern suggests a leader call becomes more probable to validate or advance the framework. The narrow timing (talks end May 11, resolution window starts May 12) actually favors this mechanism. The birthday summit rumors, while uncertain, do provide a focal point for mid-June coordination that could necessitate a preparatory call. However, I remain sobered by the freshness of negative signals (May 5-6 statements) and the strict mutual acknowledgment requirement in an environment where China has repeatedly denied recent communications. The 34-day window is sufficient for diplomatic circumstances to shift, especially catalyzed by the imminent Geneva talks, but the status quo inertia of non-communication for nearly 4 months is strong. I'm updating slightly upward to acknowledge Forecaster 3's pattern-based reasoning about post-negotiation leader calls, but not dramatically given the countervailing factors.",
