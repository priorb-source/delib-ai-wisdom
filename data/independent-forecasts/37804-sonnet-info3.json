  "information": "The U.S. Public Health Service and the CDC last changed the recommended fluoride level in 2015, when it was updated from a range of 0.7–1.2 mg/L to a single level of 0.7 mg/L. That revision process took four years, including public comment periods and interagency review. As of spring 2025, major professional organizations including the American Dental Association (ADA), the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP), and the Association of State and Territorial Dental Directors (ASTDD) have reiterated their support for the current 0.7 mg/L recommendation.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Approximately 6 weeks from today (May 20, 2025) until the resolution date of July 1, 2025",
    "status_quo_outcome": "Yes - The CDC continues to recommend 0.7 mg/L as the optimal fluoride level, unchanged from the current recommendation established in 2015",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "HHS/CDC either lowers the recommended fluoride level below 0.7 mg/L, removes the recommendation entirely due to political pressure, or takes the CDC webpage offline without providing a replacement recommendation page",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "The CDC's recommendation page remains unchanged through July 1, 2025, continuing to recommend 0.7 mg/L as the optimal level. Despite the announced HHS review, no formal changes are implemented by the resolution date",
    "rationale": "The status quo strongly favors a Yes outcome primarily due to time constraints. My research assistant notes that the previous recommendation change in 2015 took four years, including public comment periods and interagency review. With only 6 weeks remaining until the resolution date, completing a formal revision process appears nearly impossible. The NPR article indicates HHS will review fluoride guidance, creating political pressure for change, particularly given RFK Jr.'s known skepticism of water fluoridation. However, major professional organizations (ADA, AAP, ASTDD) continue supporting the current 0.7 mg/L recommendation, which would likely oppose and slow any reduction. The main risk for a No outcome would be an administrative action to remove the webpage entirely rather than a formal policy revision, but this would face significant institutional and legal obstacles. Federal health agencies cannot simply delete longstanding public health guidance without due process. Even an expedited review would typically require months of deliberation, stakeholder consultation, and formal approval processes. My forecast is not higher (e.g., 90%+) because there is explicit political will to review this guidance, and administrative actions can occasionally move faster than expected. My forecast is not lower (e.g., 60-70%) because bureaucratic inertia is extremely strong, especially over just 6 weeks, and there's no evidence of an active, near-complete review process that could conclude by July 1. I would update higher if evidence emerged that the review process had stalled or been postponed. I would update lower if there were credible reports of an imminent policy announcement or administrative directive to remove the guidance",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill the CDC still recommend 0.7 mg/L fluoride as the optimal level in community water supplies on July 1, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nNPR: [HHS will review guidance on the addition of fluoride to drinking water](https://www.npr.org/2025/04/10/g-s1-59452/hhs-rfk-fluoride-drinking-water-epa)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if the CDC's [Community Water Fluoridation Recommendations](https://www.cdc.gov/fluoridation/about/community-water-fluoridation-recommendations.html) recommends greater than or equal to 0.7 mg/L as the concentration that maximizes fluoride's oral health benefits while minimizing potential harms. If a lesser amount is recommended or if there is no longer any recommendation at all, then the question resolves as **No**.\n\nIf the page is pulled offline with no replacement, this question also resolves as **No**.\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nThe U.S. Public Health Service and the CDC last changed the recommended fluoride level in 2015, when it was updated from a range of 0.7–1.2 mg/L to a single level of 0.7 mg/L. That revision process took four years, including public comment periods and interagency review. As of spring 2025, major professional organizations including the American Dental Association (ADA), the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP), and the Association of State and Territorial Dental Directors (ASTDD) have reiterated their support for the current 0.7 mg/L recommendation.\n\nToday is 2025-05-20.\n\nBefore answering you think:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n(e) You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
