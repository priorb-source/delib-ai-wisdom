    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "2 months",
    "status_quo_outcome": "Yes. The provided background indicates a recent surge in anti-government protests following a martial law declaration in late 2024. This implies a highly volatile political status quo where large-scale public mobilization is a likely and recurring feature, rather than an anomaly.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "The political crisis that prompted the martial law declaration de-escalates significantly between May and July 2025. The government and opposition reach a functional compromise, public anger subsides, and no new triggering events occur. Any protests that do happen fail to reach the 10,000 participant threshold or are not reported by the Global Protest Tracker before the deadline.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Lingering political tensions from the martial law declaration are reignited by a new event, such as a controversial government policy, a key court ruling, or a significant political anniversary. A coalition of opposition parties, unions, and civil society groups organizes a mass demonstration in Seoul which draws well over 10,000 participants and is subsequently recorded by the Global Protest Tracker.",
    "rationale": "My forecast is primarily based on the single most important piece of information provided: the hypothetical background of a martial law declaration in South Korea in late 2024, followed by a surge in protests. This indicates a severe political crisis. Such crises rarely resolve completely in a few months, leaving a high-tension environment ripe for further mass mobilization. South Korea has a robust history of large-scale public demonstrations, and the 10,000-participant threshold is frequently surpassed during periods of political turmoil. The two-month forecast window is relatively short, but given the volatile status quo, it provides ample opportunity for a triggering event. My probability is not higher because there is a small chance that the crisis peaked earlier in the year and the situation has since stabilized, or that a protest occurs but is not logged by the specific tracking source in time. It is not lower because ignoring the gravity of a martial law declaration and its aftershocks would be a significant oversight; such an event makes further large protests more probable than not. I would raise my forecast upon news of renewed high-level political conflict or calls for mass rallies, and lower it upon news of significant political reconciliation.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill the Global Protest Tracker report any protests in South Korea with 10,000+ participants, before July 1, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nACLED December 2024: [South Korea: Anti-government protests surge following martial law declaration](https://acleddata.com/2025/01/15/asia-pacific-overview-january-2025/#keytrends6)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if the [Global Protest Tracker](https://carnegieendowment.org/features/global-protest-tracker?lang=en) reports a protest in South Korea with 10,000 or more participants with a start date after the launch of this question and before July 1, 2025.\n\n\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nNo additional information available.\n\nToday is 2025-05-01.\n\nBefore answering you think:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n(e) You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
