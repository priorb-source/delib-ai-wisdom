    "review": "My initial forecast of 25% was based on the tension between the very short timeframe and strong structural barriers versus a single, but significant, Israeli media report suggesting a deal was likely. Forecaster 2's analysis at 22% was very similar to my own, reinforcing my view and helpfully clarifying that an 'announcement' of an agreement-in-principle would suffice, which slightly lowers the bar for a 'Yes' outcome. However, Forecaster 3's analysis at 11% presented a crucial argument I had not fully weighted: the historical and ongoing tendency for both sides to avoid the specific term 'agreement' in favor of 'understandings' to bypass domestic political hurdles, most notably the INARA review process in the US Congress. This point is highly persuasive, as it provides a strong mechanism for why substantive de-escalation could occur without triggering a 'Yes' resolution. This semantic but politically critical distinction significantly raises the bar for resolution and was the primary driver for my update.",
    "rationale": "I am lowering my forecast from 25% to 15%. The core obstacles—a very short 47-day timeline and immense domestic political opposition in both Washington and Tehran—remain the strongest arguments for a 'No' outcome. While the Israeli media report remains the single most important piece of evidence suggesting a 'Yes' is possible, I am now more convinced by Forecaster 3's argument that even successful negotiations are unlikely to be publicly labeled an 'agreement.' Both the US and Iran have strong incentives to frame any de-escalatory pact as an informal 'understanding' to avoid triggering legislative review (like INARA in the US) and to minimize domestic political backlash. Therefore, the path to a 'Yes' resolution requires not only a diplomatic breakthrough but also a politically risky decision to formalize it with specific language, making it substantially less likely. My updated 15% forecast reflects the possibility that the Israeli report is accurate and that a deal is close, but tempers this with the high probability that any such deal would be deliberately structured to avoid the 'agreement' label.",
