    "review": "Both forecasters largely align with my prior view: persistence of mild deflation, weak demand/property drag, soft PPI, and food as the key swing factor. New/useful additions: (1) explicit emphasis on the resolution risk tied to the FRED series/rounding near zero; (2) the May Day services bump as a potentially stronger counterweight; and (3) the role of MOFCOM/high-frequency food trackers as decisive inputs. None introduced concrete new data that would shift the base case; they mostly refined the framing of risks already on my radar.",
    "rationale": "We have three consecutive negative YoY prints into April and no compelling evidence of a demand or energy upturn strong enough to flip May decisively positive. Food (notably pork) likely remained a drag, PPI deflation persists, and policy support so far appears to cap downside rather than generate meaningful upside. The Golden Week services impulse and possible pork rebound keep this close, and the FRED rounding near zero slightly widens outcome uncertainty. Netting these, I still see marginally higher odds of another small negative print, but close enough to zero that a +0.1% outcome is plausible. Given that the other analyses don’t provide new hard data, I retain my prior slight-lean-to-Yes stance without adjustment.",
