    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "About 56 days (until June 30, 2025 local US time)",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "PLA continues gray-zone pressure (air/naval incursions, blockade drills, economic measures) without landing ground forces on Taiwan-controlled territory; the US issues routine condemnations but does not allege a ground-force invasion.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "PRC lands PLA troops on Taiwan-administered territory (e.g., Kinmen/Matsu/Pratas or Taiwan’s main island), and the US government publicly states that China has invaded Taiwan by deploying ground forces there.",
    "rationale": "- Base rates and inertia: A PLA amphibious landing on Taiwan-controlled territory would be an historic escalation with high risk of major-power war. The base rate over any short window is extremely low. With only ~8 weeks left, the status quo strongly favors No.\n- Specific wording threshold: The resolution requires a US government public accusation of an invasion via ground forces. Even in a limited-seizure scenario (e.g., an outlying island), Washington might choose calibrated language (“seizure,” “attack,” “occupation”) rather than “invasion,” further lowering odds that the criterion is met by July 1.\n- Warning indicators: A large-scale landing would likely be preceded by visible mobilization (embarkation of amphibious/RO-RO fleets, civilian shipping requisitions, force staging, NOTAMs/navigation closures, logistics and medical stockpiles, information ops). No such indicators are noted here, and my research assistant provided no new information.\n- Why not higher: The combination of short timeline, high costs/risks for Beijing, and the US’s tendency to use precise language makes a qualifying accusation unlikely.\n- Why not lower: Non-zero risk remains of a sudden limited grab (e.g., Pratas or a Kinmen islet) or a crisis/miscalculation that prompts PLA ground insertion, after which US officials could describe it as an invasion by ground forces.\n- What would move me up: Credible reports of PLA amphibious mobilization; unusual maritime/airspace closure notices around Taiwan; embarkation of marine/army units; CCP rhetoric signaling imminent “resolution”; PRC landing or boarding actions on Taiwan-held land; US statements labeling such an action an invasion.\n- What would move me down: Continued routine PLA activity without mobilization signatures; de-escalatory PRC/US statements; absence of large-scale exercises or maritime closures through mid-June.\n- Assistant summary: No additional information available, so I rely on base rates, timeline, and typical signaling patterns before major operations.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill the United States accuse the People's Republic of China of invading Taiwan before July 1, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nCFR: [Why China-Taiwan Relations Are So Tense](https://www.cfr.org/backgrounder/china-taiwan-relations-tension-us-policy-trump)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if, before July 1, 2025, the US government publicly accuses the People's Republic of China of invading Taiwan by sending its ground military forces into Taiwan without consent from the Taiwanese government in Taipei.\n\n\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nNo additional information available.\n\nToday is 2025-05-05.\n\nBefore answering you think:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n(e) You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
