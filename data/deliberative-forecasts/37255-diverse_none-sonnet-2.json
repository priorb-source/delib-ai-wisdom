    "review": "The other forecasters raise several important points I hadn't fully considered. Forecaster 2 provides crucial information that Libya signed the agreement in 2019 but has not ratified—this six-year gap without action is more damning than I initially weighted. Forecaster 3 highlights that ratification requires both legislative approval AND formal deposit with the AU, adding an administrative step that consumes time even after legislative action. Forecaster 3 also notes potential AU/AfCFTA meetings in June as a possible catalyst, which is a fair consideration but still requires extraordinary circumstances to materialize. Both forecasters emphasize the House of Representatives' paralysis more specifically than I did. Forecaster 2's 2% seems overly pessimistic—it essentially prices in near-impossibility when 'improbable but not impossible' better describes the situation. Forecaster 3's 7% seems more calibrated. All three of us converge on the fundamental assessment: status quo heavily favors No, Libya's political dysfunction is severe, and there are no visible signs of momentum. The key disagreement is just how unlikely a breakthrough would be in the next 60 days.",
    "rationale": "After reviewing the other analyses, I'm updating downward but not as low as Forecaster 2. The critical new information is that Libya signed in 2019 yet has done nothing for six years—this track record is worse than 'no action since 2018 opening.' The deposit requirement with the AU adds time beyond legislative approval that I underweighted. However, I disagree with Forecaster 2's near-certainty (98%) that nothing will happen. A 2% forecast implies this is almost impossible, when the reality is more 'highly improbable but technically feasible.' International pressure, a sudden political settlement, or an executive decision to fast-track could still occur, even if unlikely. June AU meetings provide a potential catalyst window. My original 10% was too optimistic given the complete absence of signals, the six-year gap despite signing, and the multi-step process required. But 2% is too extreme. I'm settling at 6%, which acknowledges the severe obstacles while maintaining that a two-month window isn't impossibly short for a motivated government receiving external pressure.",
