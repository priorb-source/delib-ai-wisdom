    "review": "All three forecasters are closely aligned, with initial probabilities ranging from 10% to 14%, indicating a strong consensus that a declaration from Ralph Norman before July 1, 2025 is unlikely. Forecaster 2's analysis largely mirrors my own, emphasizing the short timeframe and the lack of preparatory signals, which reinforces my confidence in the baseline assessment. The most compelling new argument comes from Forecaster 3, who correctly identifies the Q2 FEC fundraising deadline on June 30 as a specific, structural incentive for a candidate to announce in the final days of this window. An announcement in late June would allow Norman to capitalize on initial enthusiasm and report a fundraising number, creating momentum. I had not specifically weighted this deadline-driven incentive in my initial analysis, and I find it to be a convincing argument for why an announcement might happen within this specific, narrow timeframe despite the lack of other signals.",
    "rationale": "My initial forecast of 10% was based on the strong 'status quo' bias over a very short time period (32 days) and the complete absence of public reporting or signals (e.g., staff hires, FEC filings) indicating an imminent campaign launch. The analyses from the other forecasters confirm this is the correct primary line of reasoning. However, Forecaster 3 raised a crucial point I had overlooked: the strategic value of announcing just before the June 30th FEC quarterly fundraising deadline. This provides a tangible incentive for a candidate to launch their campaign in late June, which falls within the resolution window. This specific catalyst offers a plausible narrative for a 'Yes' outcome that is not just a random surprise. While I still believe the overall probability is low due to the lack of observable groundwork, this deadline-related incentive is significant enough to warrant a modest increase in my forecast. I am updating my probability from 10% to 13% to account for this newly considered factor, which places my forecast between the other two experts and reflects a synthesis of our collective reasoning.",
