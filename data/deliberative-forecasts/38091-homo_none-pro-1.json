    "review": "The other two forecasters reached a consensus forecast of 60%, very close to my initial 65%. Their reasoning was highly aligned with my own, focusing on the recent trend of approximately one new signatory per month. I found their analyses very convincing. Two points they raised were particularly useful additions to my own thinking. First, Forecaster 2 quantified a longer-term average signing rate of ~0.82 per month since late 2023, which provides a slightly more conservative baseline than the immediate trend. Second, both forecasters effectively articulated the 'lumpiness' of diplomatic schedules, highlighting that a prepared signing could easily be scheduled just outside the one-month resolution window for purely administrative or political reasons. Forecaster 3's point about a 'bandwagon' effect also reinforces the likelihood of the trend continuing, even if it doesn't specify the timing.",
    "rationale": "After reviewing the other expert analyses, I am slightly revising my forecast downward. My initial forecast of 65% was based heavily on the strong recent momentum of one signatory in April and another in May. The other forecasters' reasoning, which I found persuasive, introduced a healthy note of caution about the precise timing of diplomatic events. Forecaster 2's calculation of a longer-term average rate of 0.82 signatories/month suggests that a one-month gap is not unusual. Furthermore, both forecasters' emphasis on the 'lumpiness' of scheduling—where a signing could slip from late June to early July—convinced me that my initial forecast might have been slightly overconfident about the event falling within this specific 30-day window. I still believe the recent momentum is the most predictive factor and that a signing is more likely than not. However, to account for the risk of random timing variance, I am adjusting my forecast from 65% to 62%. This reflects a minor tempering of my confidence while still holding that the underlying trend points towards a 'Yes' outcome.",
