  "information": "Mahmoud Khalil, a lawful permanent resident and Palestinian activist, was detained by Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) in March 2025. An immigration judge subsequently ruled that he can be deported, concluding that the government had met its burden to prove grounds for deportation based on national security and foreign policy concerns. Khalil's legal team is appealing this decision to the Board of Immigration Appeals (BIA) and has also filed a separate habeas corpus petition in federal court, arguing that the government's actions violate his First Amendment rights.\n\nOn May 11, 2025, a federal judge in New Jersey extended a temporary restraining order (TRO) that bars ICE from deporting Mahmoud Khalil. The extension was granted because the court found Khalil’s First-Amendment and Administrative Procedure Act claims to be “plausible.” Further legal briefings have been scheduled, and TROs that are extended typically remain in effect until a court rules on a motion for a preliminary injunction.\n\nThe case occurs within a broader context of the Trump administration's actions against individuals involved in pro-Palestinian activism. Reports indicate that since January 2025, the administration has revoked visas for over 1,000 foreign university students. Additionally, the Zionist organization Betar US announced it is working with the administration to help deport demonstrators it considers a threat, and has publicly named Mahmoud Khalil in its statements. U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio has also written that allowing Khalil to remain in the country would create a “hostile environment for Jewish students.”",

    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "About 48 days (until July 1, 2025)",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No — the existing federal court TRO continues to bar removal through July 1, either via further extensions or by being replaced with a preliminary injunction.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "The district court maintains injunctive relief (extends the TRO or grants a preliminary injunction) pending resolution of First Amendment/APA claims, and any government appeal does not lift the injunction before July 1. Khalil remains detained but is not transported out of the United States.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "The district court denies a preliminary injunction in June and dissolves the TRO; the government swiftly opposes any stay on appeal; the Third Circuit declines emergency relief; ICE already has travel documents arranged and removes Khalil within days, before July 1.",
    "rationale": "Key facts from the research assistant: Khalil, a lawful permanent resident and Palestinian activist, was detained by ICE in March 2025. An immigration judge found him removable on national security/foreign policy grounds. His team appealed to the BIA and separately filed a federal habeas/APA case. On May 11, 2025, a federal judge in New Jersey extended a TRO blocking removal, finding his First Amendment and APA claims “plausible,” and set further briefing. TROs extended in this posture often remain in place until the preliminary injunction ruling.\n\nBaseline/status quo favors No. With about 7 weeks left, federal courts commonly keep temporary relief in place while considering preliminary injunctions; written rulings can take weeks. Even if the court denies a PI in mid-to-late June, plaintiffs often secure short-term administrative stays from the court of appeals while seeking emergency relief, which can push removal beyond July 1. Moreover, ICE rarely risks contempt by removing someone under a live TRO.\n\nPaths to Yes exist but require a cascade: the district court would need to deny the PI and dissolve the TRO on a quick timetable; the plaintiff would need to fail to obtain an administrative stay or emergency stay from the Third Circuit; and ICE would need travel documents and logistics lined up to effectuate removal within days. That is feasible but not the default. Political pressure and the IJ’s national-security rationale raise the risk somewhat; if the district court emphasizes deference or jurisdictional limits, it could move faster to dissolve relief. Conversely, the judge’s finding that claims are “plausible” suggests at least a meaningful chance of injunctive relief through July 1.\n\nWhy not higher: A live TRO already blocks removal, courts often preserve the status quo on constitutional claims, and the 48-day window is short once briefing, hearings, and potential appeals are accounted for.\n\nWhy not lower: The government may push for expedited resolution; the court could deny a PI; appellate emergency stays are not guaranteed; and logistics for removal can move quickly if documents are in hand.\n\nWhat would move me up: A firm hearing date very soon with indications the judge is skeptical of plaintiffs’ claims; denial of a preliminary injunction; dissolution or expiry of the TRO without extension; reports that the Third Circuit declined an administrative stay; confirmation that travel documents and a destination country are secured.\n\nWhat would move me down: The TRO being converted to a preliminary injunction; explicit indications from the judge favoring plaintiffs; a briefing/hearing schedule that lands late June with signals of continued extensions; any appellate administrative stay; reports of difficulties securing travel documents or a receiving country.",

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
