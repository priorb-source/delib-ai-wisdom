    "review": "The other two forecasters presented analyses that strongly align with my own, resulting in an identical forecast of 85%. Both correctly identified the central tension between the program's statutory basis and the current administration's stated opposition. Forecaster 2's reasoning was particularly convincing by explicitly citing the historical precedent of the prior Trump administration (2017-2021), which criticized the program but failed to eliminate it or its web presence. This adds a solid piece of evidence strengthening the status quo argument. Forecaster 3 introduced a novel and important point that I had overlooked: the technical risk of a URL change. Given the resolution criteria's strict requirement for the page to be at a specific URL, a routine website reorganization could cause this question to resolve as 'No' irrespective of the program's status. This is a well-considered argument against a higher probability.",
    "rationale": "After reviewing the other analyses, I am maintaining my forecast of 85%. The consensus among all three forecasters strengthens my confidence in this number. My initial reasoning, which balanced the program's statutory protection against the risk of executive action, holds up. The arguments from the other forecasters have enriched my perspective without fundamentally shifting the balance of probabilities. Forecaster 2's point about the prior administration's failure to remove the program reinforces my belief in the strength and inertia of the status quo. Forecaster 3's introduction of the technical risk (e.g., a URL change during a site-wide update) is a valid, new consideration. This technical risk adds a small, independent probability of a 'No' outcome. However, I find that this new risk is effectively counterbalanced by the strengthened historical evidence for the status quo. The combination of a significant, but not overwhelming, political risk and a small, but non-zero, technical risk leads me to conclude that a 15% chance of failure (and thus an 85% chance of success) remains the most accurate assessment. The very short timeframe of six weeks until the resolution date is a key factor weighing against either political or technical changes being implemented.",
