  "information": "In early June 2025, Russian energy company Gazprom abandoned its plan to build a major gas distribution hub in Turkey. Reports cited insufficient pipeline capacity from Turkey to Greece and Bulgaria as a key reason for the project's lack of feasibility. Separately, Bulgaria has pursued other energy initiatives, signing gas exploration and drilling agreements with Shell and NewMed for blocks in the Black Sea. Bulgaria also has reserved 1 billion cubic meters of gas per year from the Alexandroupolis LNG terminal in Greece.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Approximately 25 days remain until the July 1, 2025 deadline.",
    "status_quo_outcome": "The status quo outcome is NO - the Botas Gas Agreement continues to exist without formal cancellation being announced before the deadline.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Bulgaria and Turkey continue negotiations about the agreement but fail to reach a formal cancellation announcement before July 1, 2025. The parties may be working toward termination or restructuring, but bureaucratic processes, legal requirements, or diplomatic considerations prevent a formal announcement within the 25-day window. Alternatively, they reach some interim arrangement that avoids outright cancellation.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "The reported financial distress at Bulgargaz reaches a crisis point, forcing immediate action. Given PM Borissov's explicit request to exit the deal and the severe debt situation, either Bulgaria unilaterally announces termination of the agreement, or Turkey agrees to the cancellation request. The announcement could come from either party, potentially without full agreement from the other side (which still counts per the resolution criteria).",
    "rationale": "The evidence presents a mixed picture. On one hand, there are strong pressures favoring cancellation: (1) Bulgaria's PM has explicitly asked Erdogan to let Bulgaria exit the deal, indicating high-level political will; (2) Bulgargaz reportedly faces bankruptcy due to debts to BOTAS, creating urgent financial pressure; (3) Bulgaria is actively diversifying its energy sources through Black Sea exploration deals and LNG terminal reservations, suggesting it's preparing alternatives. On the other hand, as of June 6, 2025, no cancellation has been announced despite these pressures existing for some time. This is significant given only 25 days remain. International energy agreements between state-affiliated companies typically involve complex legal and diplomatic processes that don't resolve quickly. The fact that nothing has been announced yet, despite clear motivation and opportunity, suggests meaningful inertia. The research assistant's report about Gazprom's abandoned Turkey hub project and Bulgaria's alternative energy sources indicates Bulgaria is moving away from this arrangement strategically, but this doesn't necessarily accelerate the formal cancellation timeline. Good forecasting practice emphasizes base rates and status quo bias - most things stay the same in short timeframes, and formal international agreements rarely get cancelled on compressed timelines. However, the bankruptcy threat and explicit political request do create meaningful probability of rapid action. I'm not forecasting higher because: (1) nothing announced yet with only 25 days left suggests low urgency despite pressures; (2) bureaucratic/legal processes typically take longer; (3) both parties may prefer restructuring over outright cancellation. I'm not forecasting lower because: (1) the financial crisis could force immediate action; (2) high-level political engagement suggests this is a priority; (3) the resolution criteria are permissive (announcement by either party, even if denied, counts).",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill the Botas Gas Agreement between Bulgaria and Turkey be cancelled before July 1, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\n[Borissov to Erdogan: Bulgaria Needs Out of the Botas Gas Deal](https://www.novinite.com/articles/232423/Borissov+to+Erdogan%3A+Bulgaria+Needs+Out+of+the+Botas+Gas+Deal) | [Bulgargaz on verge of bankrupty due to debts to Turkish gas company BOTAS: Turkish media](https://www.turkiyetoday.com/business/bulgargaz-on-verge-of-bankrupty-due-to-debts-to-turkish-gas-company-botas-turkish-med-3201881)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if before July 1, 2025, the natural gas transmission agreement between Bulgargaz EAD and BOTAŞ Petroleum Pipeline Corp is announced by either party as being cancelled.\n\nTermination of the agreement by either side, even if denied by the other side, would still count.\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nIn early June 2025, Russian energy company Gazprom abandoned its plan to build a major gas distribution hub in Turkey.

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
