    "review": "Both forecasters provide crucial information I lacked. Forecaster 2 presents concrete fundraising data showing Jones with a commanding 2:1 advantage ($1.8M raised/$1.4M cash versus Taylor's $1M total). This is highly significant just 14 days before the primary. Forecaster 3 identifies major establishment endorsements for Jones from former Governors McAuliffe and Northam plus Rep. Bobby Scott—these represent substantial organizational and mobilization advantages. Both pieces of evidence are concrete and verifiable, not speculation. However, I appreciate that both forecasters appropriately maintain uncertainty given the absence of polling data. Forecaster 2's point about money mattering more in down-ballot races is particularly salient for an AG primary. Their forecasts of 72% and 67% reflect appropriate confidence levels given this new evidence.",
    "rationale": "The fundraising and endorsement data significantly strengthen the case for Jones beyond what I initially assessed. My original 62% forecast was based primarily on Jones's 2021 statewide campaign experience, which I estimated added roughly 12 percentage points to a 50-50 baseline. The new information provides two additional concrete advantages: (1) A 2:1 fundraising edge this close to election day indicates superior campaign infrastructure, advertising reach, and GOTV capacity—in low-information primaries like AG races, this matters substantially; (2) Endorsements from two recent Democratic governors and a long-serving congressman signal consolidated establishment support, which typically translates to organizational strength and voter guidance in primaries. However, several factors prevent me from going as high as Forecaster 2's 72%: Taylor's $1M fundraising still represents a credible campaign; the absence of polling means I cannot confirm these advantages have translated to voter support; and Democratic primary electorates can value different factors than establishment support suggests. Balancing the concrete new evidence with remaining uncertainties, I'm updating upward by approximately 6 percentage points to 68%.",
