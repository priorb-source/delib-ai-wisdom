    "review": "Forecaster 3 raises the most compelling new argument I had not adequately considered: the electoral mechanics and timing. If elections in Serbia are typically held 45-60 days after being called, an announcement before July 1 would necessitate a mid-July to mid-August election date. Summer elections are politically suboptimal in most European democracies due to vacation periods and lower turnout - this is a significant constraint I underweighted. Forecaster 3 also correctly notes that with only 46 days remaining and SNS holding a majority, the path of least resistance is appointing a new PM rather than calling elections. \n\nForecaster 2's emphasis on the PM resignation as a 'potent trigger' has merit, but may overweight the mechanical likelihood. In parliamentary systems with clear majorities, PM resignations don't automatically trigger elections - the governing party typically just appoints a replacement. The article language ('could face') is speculative, not reporting imminent plans.\n\nHowever, I don't find Forecaster 3's 14% fully convincing either. Political crises can accelerate decisions in unpredictable ways, and Vučić/SNS have demonstrated willingness to use tactical snap elections. Some meaningful probability remains even if the timing is suboptimal.",
    "rationale": "My key update is incorporating the electoral timing mechanics argument. An announcement before July 1 means a summer election, which is avoided in most European democracies for practical reasons. Combined with: (1) only 17 months since December 2023 elections, (2) SNS can easily appoint a new PM from their majority, (3) no corroborating evidence of imminent dissolution, and (4) the speculative nature of the article, the probability should be materially lower than my initial 45%.\n\nHowever, retaining some probability above Forecaster 3's 14% is warranted because: political crises can override normal calculations, Vučić has used snap elections tactically before, and there remains genuine uncertainty about internal coalition dynamics we cannot observe. The resignation itself does constitute a meaningful disruption to the status quo.\n\nI'm revising downward significantly based primarily on the timing constraint argument, while maintaining probability for political unpredictability.",
