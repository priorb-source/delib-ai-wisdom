    "review": "Both forecasters raise important points that challenge my initial reasoning. Forecaster 2 correctly emphasizes that the research assistant finding 'no additional information available' is actually significant evidence - if one of these five prominent candidates had already been disqualified, this would likely be readily discoverable. This suggests either the BBC article refers to a different opposition leader or no disqualification has occurred yet. Forecaster 3 makes a crucial distinction: the question asks about five SPECIFIC candidates, not whether disqualifications are happening generally in Ivory Coast. Both forecasters appropriately weight the status quo bias more heavily than I did - with only 32 days remaining, the default assumption should be that these candidates remain eligible unless evidence suggests otherwise. I was overconfident in assuming the BBC article necessarily refers to one of these five candidates without confirming evidence. However, I find Forecaster 2's 35% too low given the active disqualification environment and the prominence of these opposition figures. The context still warrants elevated risk above baseline.",
    "rationale": "After deliberation, I'm updating my forecast downward significantly. My original 65% was based on an assumption that the BBC article about a 'main opposition leader' likely refers to one of these five candidates, but I lacked confirming evidence for this. The critical insight from other forecasters is that 'no additional information available' from the research assistant is actually meaningful negative evidence - if Laurent Gbagbo, Simone Gbagbo, or another major figure on this list had been disqualified, this would be discoverable information. The question's specificity matters: it asks about five PARTICULAR candidates, not whether disqualifications are occurring generally. With only 32 days remaining, the burden of proof should be on evidence that these specific individuals face imminent disqualification. That said, I'm not going as low as 35% because: (1) the BBC article confirms an active disqualification environment, (2) these are prominent opposition figures with histories of electoral challenges, (3) electoral commissions can act quickly, and (4) information lag could explain the lack of confirming details. I'm settling on 48%, reflecting genuine uncertainty about whether the reported disqualification involves one of these five, while acknowledging elevated risk above baseline given the contentious electoral context.",
