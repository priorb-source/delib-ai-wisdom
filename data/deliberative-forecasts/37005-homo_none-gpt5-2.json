    "review": "Both forecasters reinforce the same core points I used: sustained double‑digit CPC lead, Liberal support in the mid‑20s, and seat models translating that gap into a likely CPC majority with Liberals far from majority territory. The explicit confirmation of the new 343-seat House (majority at 172) is useful. I also found helpful their concrete “move-up” triggers (e.g., several weeks of Liberal national 38–40%, Ontario leads 5–10+, Quebec rebound vs. Bloc, and 338Canada medians ≳160 seats) and the additional bearish signals like fundraising/candidate-retirement trends. None of this contradicts my priors; it largely strengthens them. I don’t see new evidence that would raise the probability; if anything, the added detail on constraints (Ontario/Atlantic suburban shifts, Bloc/NDP ceilings) marginally validates a very low number.",
    "rationale": "Path to 172 remains extraordinarily narrow. Given current conditions described by peers—Liberals in the mid‑20s nationally, CPC sustained double‑digit lead—Liberals would need an historic, broad-based swing (≈10–15 points nationally) plus highly efficient regional vote: dominant recovery in Ontario (especially GTA), reconsolidation in Atlantic Canada, meaningful Quebec rebound against the Bloc, and limited leakage to the NDP in urban cores. Under FPTP, a mere tie isn’t enough; a clear Liberal lead would be required to touch 172. Base rates for such a reversal from entrenched incumbent unpopularity are very low. Tail scenarios exist (leadership change with a strong honeymoon, major CPC implosion, or exogenous shock that reshapes cost-of-living perceptions), but even these would more plausibly lift Liberals into competitive minority territory rather than a clean majority. I would update upward only with sustained polling that shows Liberals leading nationally by several points and 338Canada (or similar) pushing their median seat count into the 150–160+ range with a visible right tail above 172. Absent that, the majority outcome looks highly improbable. Given that my prior was already 2%, and the peer analyses add confirmatory rather than new bullish evidence, I’m holding at 2%.",
