  "information": "Recent data for the US Industrial Production Index (INDPRO) shows accelerating year-over-year (YoY) growth through early 2025: -0.2% in January, +0.45% in February, +0.85% in March, and +1.49% in April. The April rebound was largely driven by a 1.2% increase in oil extraction and a 2.2% rise in oil processing. In contrast, civil non-energy processing industries have seen a persistent decline since the beginning of the year, averaging a 0.7% monthly fall between January and April.\n\nForward-looking indicators for May 2025 presented a mixed picture. The flash ISM manufacturing PMI for May was above the 50-point growth threshold, and the S&P Global PMI also rose. However, the Conference Board’s Leading Economic Index (LEI) fell by 1.0%, its largest drop since March 2023, and the core Producer Price Index (PPI) saw its first decline since 2020. Hard data proxies were also varied: aggregate hours worked in manufacturing were flat in April, while May's rail car-loadings and electricity output were tracking close to April's levels. Auto assemblies rebounded following shutdowns in the first quarter.\n\nThe global economic environment shows signs of slowing. The U.S. Energy Department forecasts that global oil consumption growth will be less than 1 million barrels per day in 2025 and 2026, a significant drop from the historical average, partly due to economic slowdowns in Asia. China's manufacturing PMI for May rose to 49.5 but remained in contractionary territory for the second straight month, although sub-indexes for production and new orders improved. In the Eurozone, industrial production grew in early 2025, but the outlook is considered uncertain due to potential U.S. tariffs.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "About 2 weeks. The data for May 2025 is expected to be released by the Federal Reserve around June 15, 2025.",
    "status_quo_outcome": "Yes. The year-over-year (YoY) growth has been positive and accelerating for the three months leading up to May, reaching +1.49% in April. A continuation of this trend would result in a 'Yes' outcome.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "A 'No' outcome occurs if industrial production in May 2025 falls significantly compared to April 2025. This could be triggered by a sharp, unexpected contraction in manufacturing, potentially due to a sudden drop in consumer demand for durable goods, a disruption in the energy sector, or a broader economic shock hinted at by the recent drop in the Leading Economic Index (LEI).",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "A 'Yes' outcome occurs if the recent momentum is maintained or even if it slows moderately. As long as there is no major monthly contraction, the positive YoY growth from April provides a substantial buffer, making positive YoY growth for May the most likely path.",
    "rationale": "My forecast is based on the strong positive momentum in the year-over-year (YoY) industrial production figures leading into May 2025. The data shows a clear accelerating trend, moving from -0.2% in January to +1.49% in April. This creates a significant positive base effect, meaning industrial production would need to contract sharply on a month-over-month basis in May to fall into negative YoY territory. The hard-data proxies for May, such as rail car-loadings and electricity output, tracking close to April's levels, suggest such a sharp contraction has not occurred. Furthermore, forward-looking indicators like the flash ISM and S&P Global PMIs for May remain in expansionary territory, supporting continued growth.\n\nHowever, I am not forecasting a higher probability due to several notable risks. The recent growth has been heavily concentrated in the volatile energy sector, while non-energy civil industries have been in decline. This creates a fragile foundation for the overall index. Additionally, several leading indicators are flashing warning signs: the Conference Board’s LEI saw its largest drop since March 2023, and the core Producer Price Index (PPI) declined for the first time since 2020, suggesting weakening demand. A slowing global economic environment, particularly in Asia and China, also presents a headwind.\n\nMy forecast is not lower because the existing positive YoY buffer of +1.49% is substantial. Overcoming this buffer would require a significant negative shock in a single month, which is not supported by the available real-time data. While the negative leading indicators are concerning for the medium-term outlook, they are less likely to cause an immediate and sharp reversal in a single month's data without a clear catalyst.\n\nI would increase my probability forecast if initial regional Fed manufacturing surveys for May prove strong or if early data for June suggests continued economic resilience. Conversely, I would decrease my forecast if there were a major supply chain disruption, financial market distress, or if revised data for April and May showed a significant downward revision.",
