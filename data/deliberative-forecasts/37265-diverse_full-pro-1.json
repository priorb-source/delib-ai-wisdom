    "review": "My initial forecast of 15% was positioned between Forecaster 2 (20%) and Forecaster 3 (12%), indicating a general consensus on the core dynamics: the inertia of the status quo versus tangible regional security risks within a short timeframe. Forecaster 2 introduced a valuable point I had not explicitly weighed: the economic and diplomatic inertia created by Tanzania's significant tourism industry. The State Department would likely be hesitant to issue a country-wide Level 3 advisory, which would have severe economic repercussions, when it can use more targeted regional warnings. Forecaster 3 provided crucial historical context, noting that significant terrorist incidents *within* Tanzania have been infrequent despite the ongoing spillover risk from Mozambique, and that the country has not seen the kind of acute, nationwide surge in crime that has triggered upgrades elsewhere. This context dampens the immediate significance of the recent alerts and border activity, suggesting they are part of an ongoing, monitored situation rather than an acute escalation. Both arguments persuasively strengthen the case for the status quo holding over the next two months.",
    "rationale": "After reviewing my peers' analyses, I am revising my forecast downward. My initial 15% probability correctly identified the key risks (Mozambique insurgency spillover, coastal security alerts, regional precedent), but I believe I underestimated the resilience of the status quo. The other forecasters raised two compelling points that strengthen the case for a 'No' outcome. First, the State Department has a strong incentive to avoid a country-wide Level 3 advisory for a major tourist destination like Tanzania, given the significant economic and diplomatic implications. They are more likely to continue using the existing Level 3 warning for the Mtwara region to signal localized risk without disrupting the entire country's travel profile. Second, the historical context provided by Forecaster 3 is critical: the security threats cited, while real, are not new and have not produced a significant, nationwide deterioration or major incident within Tanzania proper for several years. The recent embassy alerts and border activity are more likely evidence of continued monitoring of a known risk, which is already reflected in the current Level 2 advisory, rather than a precursor to an imminent upgrade. The bar for a country-wide change within the next 60 days is very high and would likely require a major, unexpected event, which is a tail risk. Therefore, I am lowering my probability from 15% to 12%.",
