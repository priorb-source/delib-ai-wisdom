  "information": "Recent trade policy developments include the introduction of a new 10% U.S. tariff on bananas, effective April 5, 2025. Separately, following trade talks in Geneva, a trade agreement between the U.S. and China was announced on May 14, 2025. The agreement includes tariff reductions and is expected by some analysts to reduce global economic uncertainty.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "About 4–5 weeks (BLS average price for May 2025 should post with the mid‑June CPI release).",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No — the May 2025 BLS average price for bananas is at or above $0.6300/lb.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "The new 10% U.S. banana tariff (effective Apr 5, 2025) is at least partly passed through to retail by May, compounding earlier shipping/port cost pressures. Grocers lift posted prices from common $0.59–$0.69 levels to the higher end, pushing the national average to roughly $0.64–$0.68.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Pass‑through of the tariff is delayed or muted due to contracts and grocer loss‑leader strategy. A strong USD and easing logistics offset costs. Major chains keep widespread $0.59–$0.62 promotions through much of May, pulling the national average to $0.620–$0.629.",
    "rationale": "Baseline/levels: In recent years the BLS banana average has typically been in the low‑to‑mid 60‑cent range, with multiple months at or above $0.63. The Quartz piece and industry commentary point to upward cost pressure from port fees and logistics; your research assistant adds that a new 10% U.S. tariff on bananas began Apr 5, 2025. That is a clear near‑term upside risk to May’s average. Even partial pass‑through (a few cents per lb) would likely keep May at or above $0.63. \nTrade policy context: The reported May 14 U.S.–China tariff‑reduction deal should have little direct bearing on bananas, which are predominantly sourced from Latin America. Thus, it doesn’t create a strong downward force for May. \nPass‑through and pricing behavior: Bananas are often used as a loss leader, which can dampen or delay pass‑through at retail. Contracts and promotional cadence could keep some stores at $0.59/lb. That is the main path to a sub‑$0.63 outcome, especially if the dollar is firm and Panama Canal/logistics pressures ease slightly. However, given the new tariff’s timing (in effect for nearly all of May) and the existing cost backdrop, the status‑quo outcome leans toward ≥$0.6300. \nWhy not higher than this probability? There is real uncertainty about retail pass‑through speed and the extent to which large chains maintain promotional pricing on bananas despite cost increases. If promotions are broad in May, the average could still come in just under the threshold. \nWhy not lower? A fresh 10% tariff is a strong, proximate catalyst for upward movement, and recent readings have not been consistently below $0.6300. With only weeks left in the reference month, large, immediate price declines are unlikely. \nWhat would move me up (toward Yes)? Evidence that April’s BLS banana average came in clearly below $0.6300; widespread reports of May promotions at $0.59 across major chains; indications of tariff exemptions or deferrals for key source countries. \nWhat would move me down (toward No)? April BLS banana average ≥$0.6300; scanner/retail anecdotes showing 69–79¢ pricing becoming common; import cost data or shipper notices showing tariff pass‑through to U.S. buyers in April–May.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill the price of bananas reported by the US BLS for May 2025 be under 63 cents a pound?\n\nQuestion background:\nQuartz: [Move over, eggs – bananas are the next victim](https://qz.com/bananas-dole-price-hikes-inflation-port-fees-trump-tari-1851772583)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if the price reported by the Bureau of Labor Statistics [here](https://data.bls.gov/toppicks?survey=ap) for Bananas, per lb. - APU0000711211, to the thousandths of a decimal point, is under $0.6300 for May 2025.\n\n\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nRecent trade policy developments include the introduction of a new 10% U.S. tariff on bananas, effective April 5, 2025.

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
