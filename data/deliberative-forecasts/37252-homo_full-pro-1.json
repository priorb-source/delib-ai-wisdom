    "review": "Both other forecasters presented compelling arguments rooted in the same evidence, but with higher confidence levels. Their core argument, which I found persuasive, is the strength of the established 'base rate.' With multiple qualifying protests occurring per month in the lead-up to the current period, the probability of two full months—encompassing a contentious snap presidential election—passing with zero such events is extremely low. Forecaster 2's framing that a 'No' outcome would require a 'drastic and unforeseen shift' from the status quo was particularly effective in challenging my initial caution. Forecaster 3's analysis was very similar to mine but assigned a higher probability, attributing most of the remaining uncertainty to the resolution source risk, which I agree is a key factor.",
    "rationale": "I am updating my forecast upward from 85% to 90%. After reviewing the other analyses, I believe my initial forecast gave too much weight to the possibility that the June 3rd election might act as a political 'release valve' and pacify the protest environment for the remainder of the month. The other forecasters correctly emphasized that a contentious election is more likely to be a catalyst for further mobilization, not a damper. The established momentum and high frequency of large-scale protests in early 2025 make it highly probable at least one more will occur before July 1. I am not increasing my forecast to 95% because I remain aligned with Forecaster 3 on the significance of the resolution criteria risk. My remaining 10% uncertainty is now almost entirely focused on the possibility that a qualifying protest occurs but is either not reported by the Global Protest Tracker by the deadline or is reported with a participant estimate below 10,000.",
