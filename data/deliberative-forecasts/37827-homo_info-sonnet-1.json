    "review": "Forecasters 2 and 3 both provide thoughtful analyses but appear to have significantly overestimated the base rate. Forecaster 2 estimates 3-6 African pilot reports annually and Forecaster 3 estimates 2-4 annually, but the research assistant's data clearly states 4-6 reports total over the entire 10-year period (2015-2024), not per year. This is a critical misreading. At 4-6 reports over 120 months, we get approximately 0.04-0.05 reports per month, or roughly 4-5% probability for June specifically. Forecaster 3 raises valid additional considerations about NUFORC being US-focused, language barriers, and lower commercial air traffic density in Africa - these are good points that support a low probability rather than challenging it. The January 2025 Rwanda example that all forecasters cite confirms these reports can occur but doesn't establish a higher frequency than the historical baseline. Using proper Poisson probability calculations with λ=0.042 (5 reports/120 months), P(X≥1) ≈ 4.1%. The other forecasters' higher estimates of 12% and 30% appear mathematically unjustified given the historical data.",
    "rationale": "After reviewing the other forecasters' analyses, I'm confident my original calculation was correct. The research assistant clearly stated 4-6 pilot reports from Africa over 10 years, not per year. This yields a base rate of approximately 0.04-0.05 reports per month. The other forecasters seem to have miscalculated by a factor of roughly 5-10x. Forecaster 3's points about structural barriers (US-centricity of NUFORC, language issues, internet access, awareness) are well-taken and actually reinforce why the historical rate is low, but they don't provide grounds to update away from what the data shows. The January 2025 Rwanda example is consistent with the historical base rate - we'd expect about one report every two months on average, so seeing one in January 2025 is not surprising. My 5% forecast properly reflects the mathematical probability given historical data, incorporates appropriate uncertainty around the small sample size, and accounts for status quo bias. No compelling evidence or argument has been presented to warrant a significant update.",
