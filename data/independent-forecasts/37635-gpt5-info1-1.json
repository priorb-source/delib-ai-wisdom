  "information": "According to reports from May 2025, Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum has achieved a 76% approval rating, making her the best-evaluated president since the 1994-2000 term. In specific areas, 63.4% of respondents positively evaluated her management of poverty reduction, and her administration's policies have been linked to a 24.9% reduction in homicides. However, on transparency and anti-corruption, 57.4% of respondents had a negative perception. Her administration has announced a $298 billion investment plan. Some polls cited her approval rating as high as 82%.",

    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "About 45 days (until June 28, 2025)",
    "status_quo_outcome": "Yes (Milei 61%, Sheinbaum 60% on Morning Consult at the time stated)",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Sheinbaum’s Morning Consult approval ticks up by 1–3 points from honeymoon momentum or positive headlines, or Milei slips a point; any tie or Sheinbaum lead resolves No.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Milei holds or widens a slim lead due to continued disinflation/economic stabilization or a legislative win, while Sheinbaum’s rating holds steady or softens slightly.",
    "rationale": "- Short horizon and current edge: With ~45 days left and Milei up by 1 point per the prompt, the status quo narrowly favors Yes. However, Morning Consult’s weekly tracker can move 1–2 points from noise alone, and a tie resolves No, which mechanically lowers the Yes probability. \n- Sheinbaum’s likely upward bias: The research assistant reports Mexican polls showing very high approvals (76–82%). While cross-pollster levels differ, this suggests strong fundamentals and a honeymoon tailwind that could translate into a modest Morning Consult uptick by late June. That makes a 1-point Milei lead fragile. \n- Milei’s mixed but improving fundamentals: Argentina’s disinflation and reform narrative could sustain Milei near current levels or nudge him up, but his ratings have been more volatile and sensitive to economic pain and protests. Small negative shocks could erase a 1-point advantage. \n- Net: Given (1) the razor-thin margin, (2) tie counts as No, (3) likely honeymoon resilience for Sheinbaum, and (4) plausible but not assured positive drift for Milei, I lean slightly below 50% for Yes. \nWhy not higher: Tie-as-No and Sheinbaum’s honeymoon strength raise the bar for Milei. Why not lower: The current measured lead, short time window, and potential good news for Milei (continued disinflation or policy wins) keep Yes reasonably live. \nUpdates: I would move up if Morning Consult shows Milei ≥2–3 point lead in early/mid-June, or if Argentina posts clear positive economic headlines without offsetting unrest. I would move down if Morning Consult shows Sheinbaum already at/above Milei before mid-June, or if Mexico’s approval remains buoyant while Milei dips on economic or political setbacks.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill Javier Milei have a higher approval rating than Claudia Sheinbaum on June 28, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nAt the time of this question, Sheinbaum is at 60% as compared with Milei at 61%.\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if Javier Milei has a higher approval rating than Claudia Sheinbaum at [Morning Consult](https://pro.morningconsult.com/trackers/global-leader-approval) when checked by Metaculus on or after June 28, 2025. A tie or a lead by Sheinbaum resolves the question as **No**.\n\n\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nAccording to reports from May 2025, Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum has achieved a 76% approval rating, making her the best-evaluated president since the 1994-2000 term.

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
