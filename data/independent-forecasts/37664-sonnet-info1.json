  "information": "Anthropic's historical release cadence for major versions shows a lengthening gap: approximately 5 months between Claude 1 (March 2023) and Claude 2 (July 2023), and approximately 8 months between Claude 2 and Claude 3 (March 2024). Previous numbered Claude models have been made available to paid web users and via API within 48 hours of their announcement, without a public waitlist.",

    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Approximately 46 days (6.5 weeks) until July 1, 2025",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No - Claude 4 has not been released and is not currently available to the general public",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Anthropic does not announce or release Claude 4 before July 1, 2025. This could occur due to extended development and safety testing periods, strategic decisions to continue iterating on the Claude 3 family, technical challenges requiring more time, or competitive positioning considerations that favor a later release date.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Anthropic announces Claude 4 in the next 3-4 weeks and makes it available to the general public (via API or website) within 48 hours of announcement, consistent with their historical release pattern. The model has been in late-stage testing and Anthropic decides to launch before the summer period.",
    "rationale": "The status quo strongly favors a No outcome since we're already in mid-May 2025 with no announcement. Based on historical release cadence, Claude 4 would have been expected around February-March 2025 (11-12 months after Claude 3's March 2024 release, following the lengthening gap pattern). We're now 2-3 months past that window. While Anthropic has historically moved quickly from announcement to public availability (within 48 hours), they must first announce the model, and there are no public indications of an imminent release. With only 46 days remaining, time is becoming a significant constraint. However, the probability is not lower because: (1) 6.5 weeks is technically sufficient time for announcement and release given Anthropic's fast deployment history, (2) companies sometimes hold releases for strategic timing, and (3) late-stage development could be ongoing without public visibility. The probability is not higher because: (1) the expected release window has already passed, (2) no leaks or hints have emerged, and (3) the absence of any pre-release signals this late is concerning. I would update higher if Anthropic makes any announcement or if credible leaks emerge. I would update lower as more days pass without indication, or if Anthropic announces another Claude 3.x variant instead.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill Claude 4 be available to the general public before July 1, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nPromptLayer: [Everything we know: Claude 4](https://blog.promptlayer.com/claude-4/)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if a member of the general public can access Anthropic's Claude 4 model without first joining a waitlist or participating in an early access or testing phase. If Anthropic does not release Claude 4 before July 1, 2025, this question resolves as **No**.\n\nThe resolution will rely on [credible sources](https://www.metaculus.com/help/faq/#definitions), including that it may rely on the ability of Metaculus employees to access Claude 4. \"Access\" may be via API, the Anthropic website, or any other method that allows interaction with Claude 4. Models that do not include both \"Claude\" and \"4\" in the name will not be considered for resolution of this question.\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nAnthropic's historical release cadence for major versions shows a lengthening gap: approximately 5 months between Claude 1 (March 2023) and Claude 2 (July 2023), and approximately 8 months between Claude 2 and Claude 3 (March 2024). Previous numbered Claude models have been made available to paid web users and via API within 48 hours of their announcement, without a public waitlist.\n\nToday is 2025-05-16.\n\nBefore answering you think:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n(e) You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
