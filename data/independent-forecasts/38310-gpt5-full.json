  "information": "Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney formally invited Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy to the G7 summit scheduled for June 15-17, 2025, in Kananaskis, Alberta. The invitation was extended in March 2025. On May 27, 2025, Zelenskyy confirmed his intention to go, stating to Ukrainian journalists, \"G7: I was invited by the Canadian Prime Minister Carney. And I will be.\" Canadian security planning documents list Zelenskyy among the expected attendees, prompting preparations including a no-fly-zone over the area.\n\nBetween 2022 and 2024, Volodymyr Zelenskyy participated in three G7 summits: he attended the 2023 summit in Hiroshima, Japan, in person, and attended the 2022 summit in Elmau, Germany, and the 2024 summit in Apulia, Italy, virtually. Throughout the war, he has made numerous international trips, including visits to Washington, Paris, and Davos. On June 2, 2025, he arrived in Vilnius, Lithuania, to attend the Bucharest Nine summit ahead of the NATO summit scheduled for June 24-25 in The Hague.\n\nA key topic of discussion related to the G7 summit is the potential for new sanctions against Russia. US Senators Lindsey Graham and Richard Blumenthal have advocated for a new package of sanctions to be coordinated with European allies before the summit. However, according to news reports citing EU diplomats, it is unlikely that the European Union will have a new sanctions package ready by mid-June. President Zelenskyy has publicly called for increased pressure on Russia and for joint sanctions to be agreed upon at the G7 level.",

    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "About 12–14 days, with resolution by June 17, 2025.",
    "status_quo_outcome": "Yes",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "A sudden wartime crisis in Ukraine (e.g., major missile barrages or a breakthrough on the front) compels Zelenskyy to remain in-country; or a late security/health issue or aviation/logistics disruption leads to cancellation or a switch to virtual participation; or an unforeseen venue/security disruption in Canada reduces his in-person role.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Zelenskyy flies to Alberta and attends the G7 leaders’ sessions in Kananaskis, physically interacting with other heads of state, participating in photo-ops and bilateral meetings on-site.",
    "rationale": "Signals strongly favor attendance. According to the assistant’s report, PM Mark Carney formally invited Zelenskyy for June 15–17, 2025; on May 27 Zelenskyy stated publicly he will go; Canadian security planning lists him among expected attendees, with preparations such as a no-fly zone. Zelenskyy is actively traveling internationally this month (e.g., in Vilnius on June 2), and he has a track record of making significant in-person appearances when strategically valuable. The G7 is a prime venue for pushing coordinated Russia sanctions and aid, aligning with his stated goals. These are clear, convergent indicators for a Yes. Why not higher? There remains meaningful tail risk for last-minute cancellations: wartime exigencies could force him to stay, security concerns could elevate, or a health/aircraft/logistics issue could intervene. Precedent also shows variability (virtual participation in 2022 and 2024 G7s). Why not lower? We have explicit commitment from Zelenskyy, host-nation planning that assumes his presence, and strategic incentives to attend in person. What would move me upward: confirmed travel details (departure/flight tracking), official Canadian/Ukrainian schedules with on-site bilaterals, his arrival in North America, and stable conditions in Ukraine in the days prior. What would move me downward: credible reports of a major surge in Russian attacks or a domestic emergency, official guidance that he will participate virtually, indications of security concerns specific to Kananaskis, or reports of illness/transport issues.",
