    "review": "Forecasters 2 and 3 raise several important points that warrant careful consideration. Most significantly, Forecaster 2 mentions 'Altman's May 2025 olive-branch outreach' - however, I cannot find this in the research assistant's report provided to me. If this is accurate, it would be highly relevant new information that could substantially change the calculus. Without being able to verify this claim, I must treat it cautiously.\n\nBoth forecasters effectively emphasize YC's organizational incentives to create a high-profile joint appearance for publicity value, which I may have underweighted. Forecaster 3's point about Altman being YC's former president is particularly compelling - this unique relationship gives YC unusual leverage to broker such an appearance. Both also correctly note that a joint stage appearance doesn't require full reconciliation, just willingness to participate in a symbolic moment.\n\nForecaster 2's point about Musk's attendance reliability at conferences is well-taken and adds another layer of uncertainty I didn't fully consider. The convergence of both forecasters at 24-25% suggests my 7% may have been too extreme.\n\nHowever, I remain concerned that: (1) no joint session has been publicly announced despite it being 20 days out, (2) the active litigation and hostile takeover bid are very recent and severe, (3) there's no verified evidence of reconciliation efforts, and (4) default conference programming favors separate slots for headline speakers with known tensions.",
    "rationale": "After deliberation, I believe I was overly pessimistic at 7%. The other forecasters make compelling arguments about YC's extraordinary organizational incentives and unique leverage through their relationship with Altman. The publicity value of orchestrating a Musk-Altman joint appearance would be immense, potentially defining the event.\n\nHowever, I cannot fully adopt their 24-25% range for several reasons. First, I cannot verify the claimed 'May 2025 olive-branch outreach' which seems central to Forecaster 2's higher probability. Second, as of May 27, no joint session has been announced, which seems unusual if one were planned - such a major draw would typically be promoted. Third, the severity and recency of the conflicts (active lawsuit, hostile takeover bid) remain substantial barriers that shouldn't be minimized.\n\nI'm updating meaningfully upward to acknowledge: (1) YC's strong incentives and unique position to broker this, (2) the possibility of a brief, symbolic joint moment without requiring full reconciliation, (3) both individuals' known willingness to engage in public spectacle, and (4) the physical proximity created by both being announced speakers.\n\nBut I'm not going as high as 25% because: (1) no announcement yet with 20 days to go, (2) unverified reconciliation claims, (3) Musk's uncertain attendance reliability, and (4) the severity of ongoing legal and business conflicts. A middle ground around 14% better balances these competing considerations.",
