  "information": "Following a phone call between the two leaders, Donald Trump stated that Xi Jinping had invited him to visit China, an invitation he accepted. Trump also extended a reciprocal invitation for Xi to visit the US. On June 11, 2025, Trump posted on social media that he and Xi had agreed to meet in person, with the date and location to be announced later. The official statement from the Chinese government mentioned that Trump was invited to visit China but did not mention Xi accepting an invitation to visit the US. In March 2025, Trump had announced that Xi would visit Washington in the 'not too distant future,' without specifying a date.\n\nUS-China trade talks resumed in London on June 9, 2025, with a US delegation that included the Treasury Secretary, Commerce Secretary, and Trade Representative. On June 11, Trump announced that a US-China trade agreement was finalized. Chinese officials characterized the outcome as a 'framework agreement.' A White House official stated that the agreement, which is subject to final approval from both leaders, allows the US to impose a 55% tariff on Chinese imports, while China would impose a 10% tariff on US imports. A 90-day pause on tariffs is set to expire on July 9, 2025, with new tariffs scheduled to take effect on July 8.\n\nDonald Trump's confirmed upcoming international travel includes the G7 Summit in Canada from June 16-18, 2025, and the NATO Summit in the Netherlands from June 24-25, 2025. Chinese President Xi Jinping is scheduled to be in Central Asia for a summit in Kazakhstan from June 16-18, 2025. Historically, US presidential visits to China involve extensive logistical and security preparations, typically beginning weeks or months in advance. As of mid-June 2025, there have been no public reports of advance teams being dispatched or security preparations being made for a potential visit by Trump to China.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "15 days",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Logistical constraints and Donald Trump's packed international travel schedule prevent the arrangement of a visit to China on such short notice. The leaders postpone their meeting until later in the year.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Following the NATO summit, Donald Trump makes a rapid, unannounced visit to China for a short, symbolic meeting with Xi Jinping to publicly sign the framework trade agreement before the July 1 deadline.",
    "rationale": "The forecast is heavily weighted towards a 'No' outcome primarily due to logistical and scheduling impossibilities. Presidential visits to China require extensive advance planning, security preparations, and logistical support, none of which have been publicly reported with only 15 days remaining. Furthermore, Donald Trump's schedule is already occupied with the G7 and NATO summits in the latter half of June, leaving a very narrow window for a trip across the globe. The status quo, where no visit is planned, is the most likely continuation. The probability is not lower than 10% because of President Trump's documented preference for high-profile, personal diplomacy and his tendency to deviate from traditional protocols. A surprise, hastily arranged summit to sign the recently announced trade framework agreement would align with his political style and provide a significant media event. However, the probability is not higher than 10% because the logistical barriers are substantial and the lack of any preparatory signs is very strong evidence against a visit occurring. I would increase this forecast upon any credible report of US advance teams in China or a joint announcement specifying a date. Conversely, I would lower it if officials suggest a meeting later in the year or as each day passes without any such announcements.",

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
