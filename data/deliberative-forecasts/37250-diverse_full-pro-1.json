    "review": "The other forecasters and I are in strong agreement on the low probability of Mr. Garcia's return before the deadline. Both provided a clear-eyed view of the significant barriers. Forecaster 2's structured breakdown into three distinct barriers (Bukele's stance, Trump administration resistance, and the missed deadline) was a helpful framing. Forecaster 3's analysis was particularly compelling, introducing the concept of a 'base rate' for such cases: 'international custody cases with hostile counterparties and an uncooperative home executive almost never resolve in weeks.' This is a powerful argument that anchors the forecast in historical precedent beyond the specifics of this single case. Forecaster 3 also raised a novel, albeit low-probability, scenario where President Bukele might choose to expel Garcia to the U.S. simply to shift the political responsibility for him. I found this to be a thoughtful addition to the spectrum of possibilities.",
    "rationale": "I am slightly lowering my forecast from 5% to 4%. The deliberation with my peers has solidified my conviction in a low-probability outcome. The most influential point was Forecaster 3's argument regarding the base rate for resolving complex international custody disputes. My initial analysis focused correctly on the immediate political and legal obstacles, but framing it against the backdrop that such standoffs with uncooperative governments almost never resolve within a two-month window provides a more robust foundation for the forecast. The fact that a court-ordered deadline on April 7 has already passed without consequence is a powerful datapoint demonstrating that the normal mechanisms of judicial enforcement are not functioning effectively in this case. The combined, public, and dug-in resistance from the executive branches of both the U.S. and El Salvador creates a diplomatic inertia that seems nearly impossible to overcome in the short time remaining. While the legal pressure from the U.S. judiciary is real, its power to compel action from two determined presidents before July 1st appears minimal. Aligning with Forecaster 3 at 4% reflects a stronger conviction in the power of this status quo.",
