    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Approximately 30 days (from May 29, 2025 to June 28, 2025)",
    "status_quo_outcome": "California continues experiencing significant drought conditions affecting 20+ million residents, as drought conditions are already described as 'returned' and 'already bad' according to the SF Gate article",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Unexpected late-season rainfall in early June significantly alleviates drought conditions across California, bringing the number of residents living in drought areas below 20 million. Alternatively, the current drought is less severe than the article suggests, with fewer than 20 million currently affected, and conditions don't worsen substantially over the next month.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Current drought conditions persist through June as expected for California's dry season. With California's population around 39 million, having 20 million (approximately 51%) in drought areas would indicate widespread but not extreme coverage. The article's characterization of drought having 'returned' and being 'already bad' suggests significant population exposure that likely extends through June.",
    "rationale": "This forecast heavily weights the status quo for several key reasons. First, the timeframe is only 30 days, and drought conditions typically evolve slowly, especially during California's dry season. June is historically one of the driest months in California's Mediterranean climate, making significant improvement unlikely. Second, the SF Gate article explicitly states the drought has 'returned' and is 'already bad,' suggesting substantial current impacts. Third, 20 million residents represents roughly 51% of California's ~39 million population - a significant but not extreme threshold that could encompass major population centers plus rural areas. Without access to current Drought Monitor data, I must infer from the article's language. The phrase 'already bad' suggests conditions are serious now. If current levels are near or above 20 million, persistence is highly likely given the season and short timeframe. The main uncertainty is whether current conditions have already crossed the 20 million threshold or are approaching it. My forecast would be higher (80-85%) if I knew current levels were already above 20 million, as inertia strongly favors persistence. It would be lower (40-50%) if credible data showed current levels were significantly below 15 million, though this seems inconsistent with the article's framing. To update upward, I'd need: confirmation that 20+ million are currently affected, or forecasts of continued dry conditions. To update downward, I'd need: data showing fewer than 15 million currently affected, or forecasts of unusual June precipitation.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill California have 20.0 million or more residents living in drought on June 28, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nSF Gate: [California's drought has returned — and it's already bad](https://www.sfgate.com/bayarea/article/california-drought-problem-20271547.php)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if Drought Monitor at [this link](https://www.drought.gov/states/california) lists greater than or equal to 20.0 million California residents in areas of drought, when the link is accessed by Metaculus on or after June 28, 2025. If the number is below that, this question resolves as **No**.\n\nThe question will resolve as soon as the page is accessed by Metaculus Admins on the resolution date. However, if there are issues accessing the page, then resolution will wait up until the end of the tournament's scoring at which point if Metaculus has still not been able to access the resolution source, this question will be **annulled**.\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nNo additional information available.\n\nToday is 2025-05-29.\n\nBefore answering you think:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n(e) You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
