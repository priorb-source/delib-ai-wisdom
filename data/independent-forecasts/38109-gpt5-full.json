  "information": "Kalshi, a prediction market platform regulated by the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC), has been actively offering daily MLB markets since April 17, 2025. Sports-related contracts represent a significant portion of its business, accounting for over 80% of weekend trading volume. The company has handled substantial trading activity, including $27 million for the Super Bowl and $500 million for the March Madness basketball tournament. Kalshi has also filed with the CFTC to expand its offerings to include single-game predictions.\n\nThe platform faces legal and regulatory challenges. A judge in Nevada is expected to rule quickly on a case involving Kalshi's prediction markets. Major sports leagues have voiced concerns; the NBA has cited 'substantial integrity risks' due to a perceived lack of regulatory oversight compared to traditional sportsbooks, and Major League Baseball has highlighted the need for consumer protections equivalent to state-level regulations. In response, Kalshi has announced plans to enhance user protections, including voluntary opt-outs, self-imposed trading breaks, and deposit caps.\n\nJune is part of the MLB regular season, during which games are scheduled on nearly every calendar day. The MLB All-Star Game is scheduled for July 2025. Other baseball-related events in late June include the Liga Mexicana de Béisbol (LMB) All-Star Game, set to take place from June 27 to 29, 2025.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "About 30 days (through June 30, 2025; verifiable by July 1)",
    "status_quo_outcome": "Yes — Kalshi continues listing at least one MLB game market each calendar day, as it has since mid-April.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "At least one June day passes with MLB games but no Kalshi MLB game market is listed or available (e.g., temporary site-wide outage lasting the entire day, a policy pause on MLB/sports due to an adverse court ruling or CFTC action, or an internal scheduling miss on a light Monday/Thursday slate).",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Kalshi maintains its current cadence of daily MLB game listings throughout June and, if any legal issue arises (e.g., Nevada ruling), it mitigates via geofencing or targeted compliance steps without pausing nationwide MLB markets.",
    "rationale": "Evidence and base rate: The assistant’s report indicates Kalshi has offered daily MLB markets since Apr 17, 2025, and sports now drive a large share of volume (80%+ on weekends). June is a normal MLB regular-season month with games essentially every day, so demand and content are there. Inertia favors continuation, and Kalshi has strong business incentives to keep MLB listings live daily. Track record over ~6 weeks suggests operational readiness.  Countervailing risks: (1) Legal/regulatory: A Nevada judge intends to move quickly on a case related to Kalshi’s prediction markets; major leagues (including MLB) have raised integrity and consumer protection concerns. A sudden nationwide halt ordered by a regulator or a broad injunction is a tail risk in June, though Nevada-specific action would most likely be addressed via geofencing rather than a full pause. (2) Operational: The resolution requires perfection (every day). Even with high day-by-day reliability, the compound probability over 30 days is meaningfully lower. A full-day outage or a missed listing on a low-slate day could break the streak.  Why not higher: The “every day” requirement compounds small daily risks, and there is nonzero short-term legal uncertainty in June. Why not lower: Strong recent momentum, clear commercial incentives, and likely ability to handle any Nevada-specific ruling without nationwide suspension. No All-Star break in June reduces scheduling pitfalls.  What would move me up: Observing the first week of June with uninterrupted daily MLB listings; news that the Nevada matter is delayed, narrowed, or resolved favorably; explicit Kalshi commitments or product calendars for June.  What would move me down: Any sign of a regulatory action targeting sports or single-game MLB contracts, an adverse court order that prompts a temporary pause, a sustained platform outage, or evidence that Kalshi’s MLB listings skip certain days.",
