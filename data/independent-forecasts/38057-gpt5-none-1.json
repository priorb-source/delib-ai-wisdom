    "status_quo_outcome": "The bout proceeds as booked at UFC 316; the fight itself is competitive with a slight stylistic edge to Dvalishvili but close to 50/50.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "- The matchup is canceled or either fighter withdraws and Dvalishvili does not face O’Malley at UFC 316 (resolves No).\n- The fight happens and O’Malley wins by KO/TKO, decision, or submission (resolves No).",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Dvalishvili and O’Malley fight at UFC 316 and Dvalishvili wins—most plausibly by decision via sustained wrestling/control, or by late TKO/submission after cumulative grappling pressure.",
    "rationale": "- Framing: The question resolves Yes only if (1) Dvalishvili vs. O’Malley occurs at UFC 316 and (2) Dvalishvili wins. Any cancellation, opponent change, or O’Malley victory resolves No. So the forecast equals P(fight occurs as booked) × P(Dvalishvili wins | fight occurs).\n\n- Scheduling/base rates: For headline UFC fights months out, late withdrawals and reschedulings are not rare. A reasonable base for a booked PPV headliner actually happening as scheduled is around 75–85%. I’ll use ~80% pending weigh-ins/fight week.\n\n- Matchup: Stylistically, Dvalishvili’s relentless chain wrestling, cardio, and pace are a classic test for O’Malley’s rangy striking, footwork, and improved takedown defense. On paper this is competitive. Without relying on uncertain recent results, a fair conditional estimate is close to even, perhaps a slight lean to Dvalishvili (around 52–58%) due to wrestling/control potential over 5 rounds. I’ll center at ~55% conditional on the fight occurring.\n\n- Unconditional: 0.80 (fight occurs) × 0.55 (Merab win | occurs) ≈ 44%.\n\n- Status quo weighting: The bout appears booked (ESPN lists it as Dvalishvili vs. O’Malley 2). If nothing changes, we expect the fight to take place and be close to a coin flip with a slight Merab edge. The non-trivial cancellation/opponent-change risk mechanically drags the Yes probability below 50%.\n\n- Research assistant input: None (“No additional information available”), so this forecast leans on base rates and style-based priors rather than specific camp/health intel or current betting odds.\n\n- Why not higher? Because (a) the fight must actually occur at UFC 316 as scheduled, and (b) O’Malley’s striking threat and potential TDD improvements keep the matchup close; a clean 60%+ for Merab would require stronger evidence of dominance (e.g., clear prior win over O’Malley with repeatable path, markedly favorable market odds, or O’Malley injury/layoff concerns).\n\n- Why not lower? Dvalishvili’s style is historically high-win-probability against elite strikers if he can enforce wrestling over five rounds. Given typical cancellation risk only, dropping far below the mid-40s would require markets or news clearly favoring O’Malley or increased pullout risk.\n\n- What would move me up: Confirmed healthy camps and on-time weigh-ins for both, strong market shift toward Merab (e.g., -150 or shorter), or credible reports of O’Malley injury/grappling vulnerabilities.\n\n- What would move me down: Any injury/withdrawal rumors, opponent change, market movement installing O’Malley as a clear favorite (e.g., -150), or evidence that the first meeting (if recent) exposed exploitable gaps in Merab’s approach.",

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
