  "information": "Han Duck-soo is required by law to resign from his post as acting president by May 4, 2025, to be eligible for the presidential election. He has already missed the April 15 deadline to register for the People Power Party (PPP) primary. Consequently, PPP leadership has publicly stated he will not be included in their primary process. South Korean constitutional norms and historical precedent discourage caretaker heads of state from running for office.\n\nMultiple polls conducted in April 2025 show Han Duck-soo's public support ranging between 2% and 12%. Lee Jae-myung of the opposition Democratic Party leads in polls with approximately 46% support. One poll from April 20 indicated that 66% of respondents found Han's potential candidacy 'unacceptable'. Despite low public support, a faction within the People Power Party, with reports of over 50 lawmakers and a 'National Candidate Support Committee', are actively urging him to run.\n\nIn multiple public statements and interviews with news outlets such as the Financial Times and Yonhap in late April 2025, Han Duck-soo has consistently maintained that he 'has not yet decided' on a presidential run. His stated immediate priority is the US-South Korea trade negotiations scheduled for April 24. No visible campaign infrastructure or preparations for a presidential bid have been observed.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "13 days (from April 22, 2025 to May 5, 2025)",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No - Han Duck-soo does not announce his candidacy",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Han Duck-soo continues focusing on his acting president duties through the US-South Korea trade negotiations on April 24. He maintains his position of 'not yet decided' and either explicitly declines to run or simply allows the May 5 deadline to pass without announcing, avoiding controversy given constitutional norms against caretaker leaders seeking election and his poor polling numbers.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Facing intense pressure from the PPP faction of 50+ lawmakers and the National Candidate Support Committee, Han Duck-soo announces his intention to run as an independent or alternative candidate before May 5. He resigns from acting president by May 4 as legally required, calculating that even with low polling he can serve as a unifying conservative alternative or that circumstances could shift in the final weeks.",
    "rationale": "The status quo strongly favors a No outcome. Han has consistently stated he 'has not yet decided' rather than making any moves toward candidacy. Critical barriers include: (1) He missed the April 15 PPP primary deadline and party leadership explicitly excluded him; (2) His public support is extremely weak at 2-12% versus Lee Jae-myung's 46%, with 66% finding his candidacy unacceptable; (3) Constitutional norms and historical precedent discourage caretaker leaders from running; (4) No campaign infrastructure exists with only 13 days remaining; (5) He must legally resign by May 4, which he hasn't done. The evidence suggests he's focused on immediate governance priorities like the April 24 trade negotiations rather than campaign preparation. However, the probability is not zero because: (1) A significant PPP faction is actively pressuring him to run; (2) He has technically left the door open by not definitively declining; (3) The 13-day window technically allows for an announcement; (4) Politicians occasionally make surprising last-minute decisions under party pressure. For my forecast to move higher, I'd need to see: Han resigning from acting president, visible campaign preparation, stronger polling, or explicit statements indicating intention to run. For it to move lower (near zero), I'd need a definitive public statement declining to run. Given the overwhelming barriers but small remaining window and factional pressure, I estimate a low but non-negligible probability.",

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
