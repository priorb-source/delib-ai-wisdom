    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "About 32–33 days (through June 30, 2025), with resolution clear by early July 2025.",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No — in a typical month, presidents issue few or no clemencies; absent a deliberate push, the month would likely end with 0–2 grants.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "The White House, facing criticism about recent clemencies, pauses any new wave; any individual grants in June total two or fewer. Alternatively, any larger tranche is held for a symbolic date like July 4, pushing activity into July.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Trump announces a small batch (≥3) around a symbolic moment (e.g., his June 14 birthday) or reacts to a legal/political news cycle with a clemency salvo; or he issues a targeted or blanket action (e.g., for certain Jan. 6 defendants) that covers more than two individuals.",
    "rationale": "The threshold is low (more than two people in the month), which raises the likelihood compared to predicting a large wave. Trump’s first-term pattern featured sporadic months with clusters (e.g., 2020), while many months had none. Early in his second term, reporting (e.g., the May 2 Guardian piece) suggests he has already been active with controversial pardons, indicating willingness to use the power outside end-of-term windows. June offers natural catalysts: symbolic dates (June 14) and late-June news cycles (e.g., potential Supreme Court decisions) that could prompt headline-grabbing clemency announcements. Countervailing forces exist: recent critical coverage could encourage a tactical pause; process and vetting might slow the cadence; and he may prefer to time a bigger announcement for July 4. Given these, I put extra weight on the status quo (no or minimal monthly clemency) but adjust upward because the bar is just three people and Trump’s style favors episodic batches. Research assistant provided no additional information beyond the Guardian reference, so this relies on base rates, Trump’s historical behavior, and calendar catalysts. Not higher: many months historically see zero clemency, and backlash in May could temper June activity or shift it to July. Not lower: the threshold is minimal, and Trump often opts for conspicuous moves; even a modest batch would clear the bar. I would update up if there are credible reports of planned June clemency actions (especially tied to June 14 or reactions to late-June legal events), or hints of a blanket/sectoral action. I would update down if the White House signals a pause, channels activity to early July, or if we see a notable end-of-May wave that likely reduces near-term demand for June actions.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill Donald Trump grant executive clemency to more than 2 individuals in June 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nGuardian: [Trump white-collar criminal pardons cost public $1bn, says ex-DoJ official](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/may/02/trump-pardons-cost-liz-oyer)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if Donald J. Trump grants [executive clemency](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_people_granted_executive_clemency_in_the_second_presidency_of_Donald_Trump) to greater than 2 individuals in June 2025.\n\nPartial pardons or clemencies count. They will only count if publicly disclosed. Wide-reaching blanket pardons or commutations also count.\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nNo additional information available.\n\nToday is 2025-05-29.\n\nBefore answering you think:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n(e) You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
