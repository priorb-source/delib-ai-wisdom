    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "38 days until June 1, 2025",
    "status_quo_outcome": "Based on the April 4, 2025 NYT article, the status quo appears to be that the Trump administration has announced or is implementing tariffs on Switzerland, with Switzerland being placed on a 'top 10' tariffs list. The question specifically asks about a 31% rate, which suggests this is the reported or proposed rate.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "The tariff rate on Switzerland is not exactly 31% on June 1, 2025. This could occur if diplomatic negotiations lead to a different rate, implementation is delayed beyond June 1, legal challenges prevent the tariff from taking effect, the administration changes the rate before implementation, or the specific subheading 9903.01.60 lists a different percentage.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "The harmonized tariff schedule shows exactly 31% additional duty for Switzerland under subheading 9903.01.60 on June 1, 2025. This would happen if the Trump administration follows through with its announced tariff plan, maintains the specific 31% rate through implementation, and the tariff takes effect on or before June 1 without modification.",
    "rationale": "The April 4 NYT article provides strong evidence that Swiss tariffs are a real policy initiative. With 38 days until resolution, there is sufficient time for implementation if this is indeed the plan. The question's specificity about 31% and the exact subheading suggests this rate has been reported or announced. However, several factors introduce uncertainty: (1) Tariff rates often change between announcement and implementation due to negotiations, (2) The exact timing of implementation is uncertain, (3) Legal or procedural delays can occur, (4) The administration may adjust rates based on diplomatic or economic considerations. The status quo bias suggests favoring implementation since an official tariff list has apparently been announced, but the precision required (exactly 31%, exactly that date, exactly that subheading) means each condition introduces some probability of deviation. I'm not higher because tariff details frequently change during the implementation process, and we lack confirmation that 31% is already locked in. I'm not lower because the NYT reporting indicates this is a serious policy initiative with apparent momentum, and the timeline is reasonable for implementation.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill the US government's harmonized tariff schedule list the tariff on Switzerland as 31% on June 1, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nNew York Times: [Swiss Indignant to Make the Top 10 of Trump’s Tariffs List](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/04/business/trump-tariffs-switzerland.html)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if the duty provided in the applicable subheading is + 31% for Switzerland at the American government's [harmonized tariff schedule](https://hts.usitc.gov/search?query=switzerland) when accessed by Metaculus on or after June 1, 2025.\n\nWhether the provision is listed as suspended will not affect resolution.\r\n\r\nPlease note that this question is asking whether the cell in the 'RATES OF DUTY' column '1, General' appearing alongside subheading 9903.01.60 on the Harmonized Tariff Schedule indicates an additional ad valorem duty rate of 31% for articles the product of Switzerland, regardless of any specificities noted in the 'Article Description' column.\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nNo additional information available.\n\nToday is 2025-04-24.\n\nBefore answering you think:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n(e) You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
