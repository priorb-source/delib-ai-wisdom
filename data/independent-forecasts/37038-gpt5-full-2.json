  "information": "A 17% 'reciprocal' tariff on Israeli goods was announced by the US on April 2, 2025, and codified under heading 9903.01.48 of the Harmonized Tariff Schedule (HTS) with an effective date of April 9. Subsequently, the implementation of this tariff was suspended for 90 days, deferring the collection of duties until July 9, 2025. Reports state that the official HTS website has been updated to list a '+17%' duty for Israel, which is currently marked as 'suspended'.\n\nThe US is Israel's largest trading partner, with bilateral trade valued at $34 billion in 2024. The two countries have a 40-year-old free trade agreement. On April 1, 2025, the Israeli government announced the immediate cancellation of all its remaining tariffs on U.S. imports. Following the US tariff announcement, Israeli Economy Minister Nir Barkat stated that officials from both countries are optimistic about reaching a new trade agreement before the suspension period expires on July 9, 2025. Ongoing discussions also aim to address the trade deficit between the nations.\n\nThe United States recently implemented a general 10% tariff on imports from most trading partners. Concurrently, the administration has pursued other trade actions, including imposing a 25% tariff on imported automobiles and certain auto parts, and increasing tariffs on Chinese goods to over 100% in response to retaliatory measures. Additionally, new tariffs ranging from 41% to over 3,500% have been announced on solar imports from several Southeast Asian countries, pending a final decision in June 2025.",

    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "About 38 days (until 2025-06-01)",
    "status_quo_outcome": "Yes",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "The U.S. and Israel finalize and implement a new trade arrangement before June 1, and the USTR/USITC publish an HTS modification removing or changing HTS 9903.01.48 (or otherwise eliminating the +17% listing for Israel) with immediate effect, so the HTS website no longer shows +17% for Israel on June 1.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "The existing HTS entry (9903.01.48) that lists +17% for Israel remains posted through June 1, 2025—whether or not it is marked “suspended.”",
    "rationale": "- What we know: Per the research assistant, a 17% reciprocal tariff on Israeli goods was announced April 2, 2025, codified at HTS 9903.01.48 with an effective date of April 9, and then suspended for 90 days (deferring collection until July 9). The official HTS website already shows a +17% duty for Israel and marks it as suspended. The question’s resolution explicitly states that a “suspended” label does not affect resolution.\n- Status quo: The site already lists +17% for Israel. If nothing changes by June 1, the question resolves Yes.\n- How this could change: A rapid U.S.–Israel agreement could lead to a new proclamation/modification that removes or alters 9903.01.48 before June 1, with the HTS updated accordingly. That is possible but would require both a negotiated deal and timely formal implementation and site update well before the current suspension end date (July 9). Government trade schedule updates typically follow formal legal steps and often take time; given the suspension already defers collection, there is less urgency to remove the listing before July.\n- Why not higher: There is non-trivial risk that negotiations produce a quick deal and the administration moves to rescind the measure promptly, with the USITC updating the HTS before June 1. A court action or policy reversal could also trigger an expedited change.\n- Why not lower: The listing is already live. Bureaucratic inertia and the existing 90-day suspension reduce the likelihood of removing the entry prior to June 1. Even if talks progress, it’s common for formal changes to lag announcements and take effect on set dates.\n- What would change my view upward: Confirmed indications from USTR/USITC that no HTS modification will be made before July 9; statements that the suspension will simply run its course; or evidence of slow procedural timelines.\n- What would change my view downward: A joint U.S.–Israel announcement of a finalized agreement with a specific, near-term effective date to rescind 9903.01.48, publication of a presidential proclamation or USITC notice scheduling immediate HTS changes, or visible edits to the HTS indicating imminent removal of the +17% listing for Israel before June 1.",
