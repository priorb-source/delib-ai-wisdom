    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Approximately 2 months until July 1, 2025",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No - Niger maintains its current travel advisory level without being upgraded to Level 4",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "The security situation in Niger remains relatively stable over the next two months. While terrorism threats and crime concerns persist, there are no major incidents that would prompt the US State Department to escalate to the highest advisory level. The existing advisory level (likely Level 3 - Reconsider Travel) continues unchanged through July 1, 2025.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "A significant security deterioration occurs in Niger, such as a major terrorist attack targeting foreigners, a sharp escalation in violence, additional political instability following the 2023 coup, or a critical incident involving US citizens. This prompts the US State Department to upgrade Niger to Level 4 - Do Not Travel within the next two months.",
    "rationale": "The forecast requires weighing several factors. First, the timeframe is quite short at only 2 months, which limits the probability of major policy changes. The US State Department typically changes travel advisories in response to significant events or sustained deterioration rather than routine adjustments. The background information indicates Niger already faces serious challenges including terrorism, crime, and limited medical care, suggesting it may already be at Level 3 (Reconsider Travel). Niger experienced a military coup in July 2023, which has likely kept the country on the State Department's radar. Status quo bias is important here - the world changes slowly, and without a major triggering event, the advisory level is likely to remain constant. For the forecast to be higher, I would need evidence of: (1) Niger's current advisory level being Level 3 with recent escalating concerns, (2) patterns of the State Department making rapid upgrades in similar situations, or (3) specific intelligence about deteriorating conditions. For the forecast to be lower, I would need confirmation that Niger already has Level 4 (making the question resolve as Yes immediately) or evidence of improving conditions. Given the existing security concerns but short timeframe and status quo bias, I estimate a 25% probability.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill Niger receive a \"Level 4 – Do Not Travel\" travel advisory from the US State Department before July 1, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nTravel and Tour World: [Niger Faces Growing Travel Risks: U.S. Travel Advisory Highlights Terrorism, Crime, and Limited Medical Care for Tourists in the Country](https://www.travelandtourworld.com/news/article/niger-faces-growing-travel-risks-u-s-travel-advisory-highlights-terrorism-crime-and-limited-medical-care-for-tourists-in-the-country/)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if the country of Niger has received a Level 4 [travel advisory](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/International-Travel-Country-Information-Pages/Niger.html) from the US Department of State before July 1, 2025.\n\n\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nNo additional information available.\n\nToday is 2025-05-02.\n\nBefore answering you think:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n(e) You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
