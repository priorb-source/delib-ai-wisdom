    "review": "Both forecasters center on mean reversion from an extreme trough and the low bar for a Yes outcome, which matches my framing. New elements they raised: (1) a claim that year-ahead inflation expectations spiked to the highest since 1981 and that unemployment expectations hit their highest since 2009—if accurate, these are notable headwinds; (2) explicit emphasis on the timing of the May prelim limiting exposure to later mid-month data; and (3) the possibility that April’s shock factors (tariffs/volatility) are partly “priced in.” I find their logic broadly convincing on mean reversion and on the low hurdle, with the caveat that the cited inflation/unemployment-expectations extremes would temper the rebound odds. Net, their arguments nudge me slightly higher but not to 60%+ given ongoing headwinds and four straight declines.",
    "rationale": "I continue to see a tug-of-war between: (a) strong mean-reversion odds from a near-trough level and a very low threshold (>50.8), and (b) persistent headwinds (inflation concerns, potential gas price firmness, labor-market uncertainty). The historical behavior of the series at extremes and typical month-to-month volatility make any uptick plausible without major macro improvement. The additional points about April’s negative shocks already being embedded marginally increase the chance of a bounce. However, if inflation expectations and unemployment expectations truly spiked to multi-decade highs in April, that argues for lingering pessimism into early May. Balancing these, I move slightly up from my prior 54% to reflect mean reversion and the low bar, but I remain only modestly above even because the downtrend and headline risks could still keep May at or below 50.8.",
