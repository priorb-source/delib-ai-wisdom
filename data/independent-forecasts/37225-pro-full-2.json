  "information": "The most recent poll, conducted on April 22, 2025, projects the Progressive Reform Party (VHP) winning 29% of seats, the National Democratic Party (NDP) 24%, and the National Party of Suriname (NPS) 14%. An earlier poll from January 2025 showed the NDP at 54% and the VHP at 29%. The incumbent VHP, led by President Chandrikapersad Santokhi, aims to secure at least 26 of the 51 available seats in the National Assembly. The opposition NDP has publicly ruled out any post-election collaboration with the VHP.\n\nPositive economic factors for the incumbent VHP government include a reduction in inflation from 60% to 10%, compliance with an IMF program, and the signing of a Final Investment Decision with TotalEnergies for the Granmorgu oil field. The government also instituted a 15% salary increase for government employees and pensioners in 2024, with an additional 5% in January 2025. Conversely, negative factors include high public dissatisfaction, with 56% of the public dissatisfied with the current government and 66% believing the country is worse off than five years prior. The country faces persistent poverty and a $4 billion national debt. One report cited President Santokhi's approval rating at approximately 3%.\n\nThe general election is scheduled for May 25, 2025. A significant change in the electoral process is the shift to a National Proportional Representation system, which replaces the previous district-based system and will be used for the first time. The opposition is described as fragmented. The NDP is facing challenges after the death of former leader Desi Bouterse. Some smaller parties, including the Sociaal Democratische Unie (SDU), Permanente Voorspoed Republiek Suriname (PVRS), and De Nieuwe Wind (DNW), have formed an alliance to run together under the SDU banner.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Approximately one month. The election is scheduled for May 25, 2025, and the outcome should be known within a few days of that date.",
    "status_quo_outcome": "The incumbent Progressive Reform Party (VHP) wins a plurality of seats, consistent with the most recent polling data.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Widespread public dissatisfaction with the incumbent government galvanizes voters in the final weeks. This anti-incumbent sentiment coalesces around either a recovering National Democratic Party (NDP) or the National Party of Suriname (NPS), allowing one of them to surpass the VHP and win a plurality of seats.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "The VHP successfully leverages its message of macroeconomic stabilization and future oil prosperity to secure a plurality. The opposition remains too fragmented to consolidate the anti-government vote, particularly with the NDP weakened by the recent death of its longtime leader, allowing the VHP to win the most seats despite low approval ratings.",
    "rationale": "My forecast is primarily based on the most recent polling data from April 22, 2025, which places the Progressive Reform Party (VHP) ahead of its main rival, the National Democratic Party (NDP), by five percentage points (29% to 24%). With the election less than a month away, this is a significant lead. The key political dynamic is the recent death of former NDP leader Desi Bouterse, which appears to have caused a collapse in his party's support, as evidenced by the dramatic drop from 54% in a January 2025 poll. This makes the April poll the most reliable indicator of the current political landscape. The VHP, as the incumbent party, has a mixed record. On one hand, it can campaign on positive macroeconomic achievements, such as reducing inflation, complying with an IMF program, and securing a major oil investment. On the other hand, it faces severe public discontent, with President Santokhi's approval rating at a mere 3% and a majority of citizens feeling the country is on the wrong track. However, the opposition appears unable to capitalize on this dissatisfaction. The NDP is in a state of flux without its leader, and the rest of the opposition is described as fragmented. The introduction of a new National Proportional Representation system may further splinter the opposition vote, benefiting the VHP as the single largest party. The probability is not higher because the VHP's extreme unpopularity creates significant volatility. A late surge of anti-incumbent sentiment towards a single opposition party could easily erase the VHP's current lead. The probability is not lower because the opposition's structural weaknesses, especially the NDP's leadership crisis, are profound. It is difficult for a fragmented opposition to consolidate support in such a short period. I would increase my forecast if new polls show the VHP extending its lead. I would decrease it if polls suggest the NDP is recovering or another party is successfully consolidating the anti-VHP vote.",
