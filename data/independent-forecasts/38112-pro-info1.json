  "information": "The 17th BRICS Summit is scheduled for July 6-7, 2025, in Rio de Janeiro. As the host nation, Brazil's presidential adviser Celso Amorim stated in a May 11, 2025 interview that BRICS_ 'should stabilise where it is' before admitting more members. Official draft agendas for the summit, circulated in late April 2025, prioritize financial-architecture reforms and Global South development funds, containing only non-committal language regarding further enlargement. Brazil has invited Mexico, Uruguay, and Colombia to attend the summit as non-members.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Approximately 5 weeks.",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No. The 17th BRICS summit will conclude without any new countries being invited to join as full members, in line with the host country Brazil's stated preference for a period of consolidation.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Brazil, as the host nation, successfully focuses the summit's agenda on its priorities of financial architecture reform and deepening ties with existing members. Other members, like India, concur with the need for consolidation after the recent rapid expansion. The final summit declaration reaffirms the bloc's importance but makes no mention of new full member invitations, deferring the topic to future summits.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Despite Brazil's initial position, a strong diplomatic push from China and Russia for continued strategic expansion prevails during closed-door meetings. They successfully argue that inviting a key partner country, like Turkey or Nigeria, to full membership is a necessary response to current geopolitical events. A last-minute consensus is reached, and one country is invited to demonstrate the bloc's continued momentum.",
    "rationale": "My forecast is based primarily on the strong and recent evidence provided by the host nation, Brazil. Presidential adviser Celso Amorim's statement on May 11, 2025, that BRICS 'should stabilise where it is' before further enlargement is the single most important factor. The host country has significant power to set the agenda, and this public statement indicates a clear intention to pause expansion. This position is further supported by draft agendas from late April 2025, which prioritize financial matters and do not include enlargement as a key topic. After a major expansion round in 2023 and the introduction of a partner framework in 2024, a period of consolidation and integration is a logical and expected phase for the organization. The focus will likely be on making the expanded bloc function effectively before adding more complexity.\n\nMy probability is not lower than 15% because BRICS operates on consensus, and the pro-expansion voices, particularly China and Russia, remain influential. These countries view enlargement as a key tool for increasing geopolitical weight. It is possible they could exert significant pressure behind the scenes to elevate at least one partner country to full member status as a compromise, demonstrating that the door to membership remains open. A sudden global event could also shift priorities, creating an urgent strategic reason to invite a specific nation.\n\nMy probability is not higher than 15% because overcoming the publicly stated opposition of the host nation on such a fundamental issue is a high bar. Brazil is a founding member, and its concerns about institutional capacity and maintaining cohesion will be taken seriously. With India also historically being cautious about rapid expansion, there is likely a significant caucus supporting a pause. The short time remaining until the summit makes a major reversal of Brazil's declared policy unlikely.\n\nI would increase my forecast if a senior Brazilian official publicly backtracked on the 'stabilise' stance, or if there were credible reports of a strong, unified push for a specific candidate by Russia and China. I would decrease my forecast if the final published agenda for the summit explicitly excludes enlargement, or if another key member like India publicly endorses Brazil's call for a pause.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill a new country be invited to BRICS at the 17th BRICS Summit?\n\nQuestion background:\n[BRICS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BRICS) is an intergovernmental organization originally founded by Brazil, Russia, India, and China, which held their first formal summit in 2009. South Africa was invited to join in 2010, completing the original five-member grouping. BRICS serves as a forum for cooperation among major emerging economies, with a focus on economic development, political coordination, and reform of international institutions.\n\nAt the [15th BRICS Summit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/15th_BRICS_summit) in August 2023, the group announced a major expansion. Full membership invitations were extended to Argentina, Egypt, Ethiopia, Iran, Saudi Arabia, and the United Arab Emirates. Argentina later declined the invitation, while Saudi Arabia has not formally accepted. Egypt, Ethiopia, Iran, and the UAE officially joined on January 1, 2024.&#x20;\n\nAt the [16th BRICS Summit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/16th_BRICS_summit) in October 2024, held in Kazan, Russia, BRICS formally introduced a new partner country framework. Thirteen countries were invited as partners at the 16th Summit: Algeria, Belarus, Bolivia, Cuba, Indonesia, Kazakhstan, Malaysia, Nigeria, Turkey, Thailand, Uganda, Uzbekistan, and Vietnam. Algeria, Turkey, and Vietnam have not yet confirmed participation. Indonesia later joined as a full member on January 6, 2025.\n\nThe 17th BRICS Summit is scheduled to take place on July 6–7, 2025, in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. Many countries have formally expressed interest in joining BRICS, but new members can only be admitted with unanimous agreement from existing members. While expansion remains a stated goal of the bloc, no new invitations have been confirmed.\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question will resolve as **Yes** if at least one previously not invited country is invited to join BRICS as a full member during or before the 17th BRICS summit.\n\nThis question will only resolve based upon an invitation for full membership, not partner status or any other status in the organisation.\n\n* An invitation of a partner country to become a full member will resolve this question as **Yes**.\n* Reinvitation of Saudi Arabia or Argentina will not be sufficient to resolve this question as **Yes**.&#x20;\n* Whether or not a country accepts its invitation will have no impact on this question.\n* If the 17th BRICS summit is delayed, that will not impact this question unless the delay is to after August 31, 2025, in which case this question will be annulled.\n* The specific cutoff for resolution will be 00:00 following the final day of the summit. For example, if the summit is held as expected on July 6-7, the cutoff will be July 8, 00:00. This question will use the timezone of the summit's location, if the summit has no physical location, it will use UTC.\n* For the purposes of this question, \"country\" is defined as a UN member state.\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nThe 17th BRICS Summit is scheduled for July 6-7, 2025, in Rio de Janeiro. As the host nation, Brazil's presidential adviser Celso Amorim stated in a May 11, 2025 interview that BRICS_ 'should stabilise where it is' before admitting more members.

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
