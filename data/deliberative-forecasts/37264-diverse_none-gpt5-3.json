    "review": "Forecaster 2 adds a crucial correction: Niger has been at Level 4 since the 2023 coup, with an ordered departure and sustained insecurity. That directly challenges my initial assumption (Level 3 overall). If that’s right—and it aligns with my recollection of post-coup advisories for Sahel states—then the question likely resolves Yes unless the resolution requires a new advisory issuance within the window. Forecaster 2’s “scheduled review” point is speculative (State updates are irregular), but it isn’t necessary: the condition is already met if the advisory is currently Level 4. Forecaster 3’s analysis appears to rest on an incorrect premise that Niger is below Level 4 and also overstates the rarity of Level 4 in the Sahel; Mali, Burkina Faso, and Niger have commonly been Level 4 in recent years.",
    "rationale": "I’m updating because my prior assumed Niger was Level 3 with localized Level 4 areas. Evidence and memory since the July 2023 coup indicate Niger has been countrywide Level 4, reinforced by ordered departure and persistent terrorism/kidnapping risks. If the resolution criterion accepts “has received a Level 4” at any time before July 1, the answer is already Yes. Even under a stricter interpretation (must be Level 4 as of or newly issued before July 1), the probability remains high: the security trajectory (jihadist activity, junta rule, departure of U.S./French forces, strained U.S.–Niger ties) makes a downgrade highly unlikely in the next two months, and advisories tend to be sticky absent clear improvement. I don’t go to 100% due to residual ambiguity about the question’s interpretation and the low but nonzero chance of an idiosyncratic bureaucratic change. Key up/down signals: Up if we confirm the State page currently lists Level 4; down only if there’s credible reporting of a downgrade or normalization of consular posture.",
