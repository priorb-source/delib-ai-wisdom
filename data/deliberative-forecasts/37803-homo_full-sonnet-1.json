    "review": "All three forecasters reached remarkably similar conclusions (7-10%), identifying the same core evidence: explicit policy hostility, concrete dismantling actions, 4+ months offline with no restoration signals, historical precedent, and an extremely short 42-day timeframe. The tight clustering suggests we're appropriately calibrated on this question.\n\nForecaster 3 makes a particularly compelling point about the 42-day timeframe being 'extremely short for bureaucratic action' - even if unexpected political will materialized, executing a website restoration through government processes in 6 weeks would be challenging. This is a stronger constraint than I initially weighted.\n\nForecaster 2's consideration of independent bureaucratic restoration is theoretically possible but seems unrealistic given the high-level policy direction from Pentagon leadership. Forecaster 3's mention of 'technical/operational necessity' is interesting but unlikely - this portal is specifically about climate resilience, not core warfighting operations that might require urgent restoration.\n\nNo forecaster introduced compelling new evidence that would warrant a significant update. The debate is really about calibrating appropriate tail risk for a 6-week window against overwhelming directional evidence.",
    "rationale": "Upon reflection, I'm slightly adjusting downward to align with Forecaster 3's emphasis on the extremely compressed timeframe. While I appropriately identified all major factors, the 42-day window is a more severe constraint than my initial 8% weighted. Even if unexpected political pressure emerged from June Congressional hearings, translating that into actual website restoration within 6 weeks would require: (1) political will to override explicit Pentagon policy, (2) technical implementation, (3) content approval processes, and (4) overcoming active resistance from DoD leadership. This chain seems even less likely on careful consideration.\n\nThe systematic nature of climate program dismantling - $377 million cuts, Navy plan rescission, executive order revocation, explicit statements - all reinforce that this isn't casual neglect but deliberate policy. Historical precedent from 2017-2021 strongly suggests multi-year offline periods.\n\nI maintain some probability (7% rather than near-zero) for genuine tail risks: court orders, unexpected administrative actions, or technical restoration without policy reversal. But the timeframe constraint deserves more weight.",
