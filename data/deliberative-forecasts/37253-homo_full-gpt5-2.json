    "review": "Both forecasters emphasize the absence of pre-test signatures at Punggye-ri and the short, ~2‑month window—points I noted, but they weigh them more heavily. Forecaster 2 adds a useful base-rate nuance: North Korean nuclear tests cluster in Jan–Feb and September, with only one late-spring (May 2009) test, which slightly depresses the prior for May–June. Both also stress Chinese sensitivity and Pyongyang’s ability to extract signaling value from missile/cruise/naval demonstrations without paying the higher diplomatic cost of a nuclear detonation. I find these arguments largely convincing. The clearest incremental considerations for me were the seasonal clustering and the stronger emphasis on how “no site prep now” meaningfully reduces odds within a 61‑day window. I agree with their triggers for moving up (visible portal activity, cable runs, pumping, allied intel warnings) and down (continued dormancy into mid‑June, explicit Chinese pressure).",
    "rationale": "Time remaining is short (~61 days). While Punggye-ri is likely operable and DPRK rhetoric about accelerating nuclear armament continues, there are no public indicators of imminent test preparation (vehicles, cable/pipe runs, portal sealing, pumping). Historically, such signatures have appeared days to weeks before a detonation. The additional base-rate point that tests tend to occur in Jan–Feb or September—with only one late-spring instance—further lowers the prior for this specific window. Countervailing factors (reduced marginal costs given UNSC dynamics, sustained weapons test tempo, potential symbolic timing such as June 25) keep a non-trivial tail. Netting these, I’m revising downward from 14% to 9%, placing more weight on the absence of current prep signals and seasonal timing. I would adjust up quickly on credible Punggye-ri activity or allied warnings; conversely, if we reach mid‑June with continued dormancy, I would taper to ~3–4%.",
