  "information": "As of late April 2025, reports indicated that the Tax Reform Bill had been passed by the Nigerian House of Representatives and was awaiting approval from the Senate before requiring presidential assent. Taiwo Oyedele, Chairman of the Presidential Tax Reform Committee, had stated in January 2025 that the bills were expected to be passed into law in the first quarter of 2025, with implementation scheduled to begin on July 1, 2025. The Q1 2025 deadline for passage has been missed.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "About 57 days (from May 5, 2025 to July 1, 2025)",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No — as of today, the bill is not yet enacted; absent further action by the Senate and presidential assent before July 1, the outcome is No.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "The Senate does not take up or complete the Tax Reform Bill in May/June, or passes a version requiring harmonization that drags past late June; alternatively, the President delays assent beyond July 1 even if the Senate passes it in late June.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "The Senate fast-tracks the Tax Reform Bill in May or early June, passes a version aligned with the House’s to avoid lengthy conference, and the President assents promptly (within days), with credible sources confirming enactment before July 1.",
    "rationale": "- Where things stand: Per the research assistant, the House has passed the Tax Reform Bill; the Senate still needs to pass it and the President must assent. The government’s tax reform chair had targeted Q1 passage with July 1 implementation, but Q1 was missed.\n- Time and process: Roughly two months remain. Nigeria’s National Assembly can move quickly on executive-priority bills when leadership is aligned. However, two steps remain (Senate passage and assent), and any bicameral differences could require harmonization, adding time. Presidential assent can be quick but is another potential bottleneck.\n- Drivers toward Yes: This is an administration-backed reform with a stated July 1 implementation target. The House’s passage signals momentum, and the ruling party’s alignment across branches can enable fast-tracking. If the Senate schedules second/third readings soon and keeps the bill close to the House version, enactment before July 1 is feasible.\n- Risks pushing to No: Omnibus tax reforms can attract amendments and scrutiny, slowing Senate committee work. There may be fiscal concerns (VAT revenue sharing with states) that invite debate. The legislative calendar likely loses sitting days around Eid al-Adha in June, compressing time. Even with Senate passage in late June, any harmonization or a brief assent delay could push enactment past July 1.\n- Status quo weighting: The default, if nothing changes, is No because enactment has not yet occurred and delays are common. That said, the existing momentum (House passage, executive priority, publicly stated July 1 target) modestly tilts the odds toward action.\n- Why not higher: Two institutional hurdles remain with limited legislative days; slippage from the earlier Q1 target suggests schedule risk. Any conference committee or brief presidential delay can tip the outcome to No.\n- Why not lower: One chamber has already passed it; it’s government-backed with a public implementation date of July 1, indicating intention to complete before that date. The Senate can and sometimes does pass such bills quickly, and the President can assent rapidly once received.\n- What would move me up: Senate scheduling of second/third readings within May; committee report adoption signaling minimal changes; public commitment by Senate leadership to pass in May/early June; news of coordination between chambers to avoid harmonization; indications the Presidency plans immediate assent. \n- What would move me down: Signals of controversy over VAT exemptions, referral back to committee, a crowded Senate agenda or extended recess, or reports that implementation will slip beyond July 1.\n\nI interpret “enacts legislation” to require both Senate passage and presidential assent before July 1, 2025. Any Act (not just this specific bill) that explicitly exempts real estate transactions from VAT would resolve Yes if enacted by then, per credible sources (e.g., National Assembly records, Presidency statements, the gazetted Act).",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill Nigeria enact legislation exempting real estate transactions from VAT before July 1, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\n[FG: Tax reform bill to exempt real estate transactions from VAT, boost housing affordability in Nigeria](https://nairametrics.com/2025/04/25/fg-tax-reform-bill-to-exempt-real-estate-transactions-from-vat-boost-housing-affordability-in-nigeria/)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if, before July 1, 2025, the government of Nigeria enacts legislation exempting real estate transactions from the Value Added Tax (VAT) according to [credible sources](https://www.metaculus.com/help/faq/#definitions).\n\nFor example, the current iteration of the Tax Reforms Bill that is [being considered](https://brtnews.ng/tax-reforms-bill-to-exempt-real-estate-transactions-from-vat/) by the National Assembly, if it should be enacted, would count for purposes of this question.\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nAs of late April 2025, reports indicated that the Tax Reform Bill had been passed by the Nigerian House of Representatives and was awaiting approval from the Senate before requiring presidential assent.

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
