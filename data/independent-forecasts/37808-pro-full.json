  "information": "The U.S. Department of State released the results for the Diversity Visa Program (DV-2026) lottery in early May 2025. Applicants can check their status online through the Entrant Status Check page until September 30, 2026. This followed the release of the DV-2025 results on May 3, 2025. The registration period for the DV-2026 lottery ran from October to November 2024. The program awards up to 55,000 permanent residence visas annually. The State Department has emphasized that the official website, dvprogram.state.gov, is the only channel for results.\n\nThe Diversity Visa program was established by the Immigration Act of 1990. The Trump administration, which began in January 2025, has previously expressed opposition to the program. The administration issued executive orders in January 2025 concerning Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion (DEI) related websites across federal agencies. In April 2025, a bill was introduced in the House of Representatives with the goal of terminating the statutory DV program.\n\nIn May 2025, the US Department of State imposed visa restrictions on Indian travel agency executives and staff who were found to have knowingly enabled unlawful entry into the US. In a separate action, the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) announced the termination of Temporary Protected Status (TPS) for Afghanistan, scheduled to take effect on July 14, 2025. Concurrently, a federal court issued a preliminary injunction that blocked a DHS attempt to terminate TPS for Venezuelan nationals.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "The outcome will be known on July 1, 2025, which is approximately six weeks from today (May 20, 2025).",
    "status_quo_outcome": "The Diversity Visa program page remains online at the specified URL, as it is part of the State Department's function in administering a program mandated by federal law.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "The Trump administration takes swift executive action to remove pages related to the Diversity Visa program, possibly justifying it under its January 2025 executive orders concerning DEI, or Congress unexpectedly fast-tracks and passes the bill introduced in April 2025 to terminate the program.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Bureaucratic and legislative inertia prevail. The bill to terminate the program stalls in Congress, and the administration does not prioritize executive action to remove the page, allowing the State Department to maintain the website as required by existing law.",
    "rationale": "My forecast heavily weights the status quo, as government websites for congressionally mandated programs are generally stable. The Diversity Visa program was established by the Immigration Act of 1990 and cannot be terminated without legislative change. The bill introduced in the House in April 2025 is a clear signal of intent, but passing legislation through both chambers of Congress in under six weeks is highly improbable for a contentious issue like immigration. The primary risk comes from a potential executive action, similar to the administration's orders on DEI websites. However, such an action would likely face immediate and potentially successful legal challenges, as seen with the preliminary injunction blocking the termination of TPS for Venezuela. Since the DV-2026 cycle is already in progress, with results accessible until September 2026, the State Department has a clear operational and legal reason to maintain its informational pages. The probability is not higher than 85% because the administration's stated opposition and recent actions create a non-trivial chance of a rapid, disruptive executive order to take down the page. The probability is not lower because the legal and procedural barriers to removing the page for a statutory program are significant, and the timeframe is very short. I would lower my forecast if the House bill were to be fast-tracked or if specific White House directives targeting the DV program website emerged. I would raise it if the administration's focus clearly shifted elsewhere.",

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
