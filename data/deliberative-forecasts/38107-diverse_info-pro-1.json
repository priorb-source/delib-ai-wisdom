    "review": "The other two forecasters provide excellent, reinforcing analyses that align with my own initial assessment. We are in strong agreement on the core drivers: the very high legal bar for a 'true threat,' the unprecedented nature of arresting a former FBI director, and the extremely short time frame. Forecaster 3's citation of the 2023 Supreme Court ruling, which requires prosecutors to prove subjective intent to threaten, is a particularly powerful point that I had not explicitly considered. This ruling significantly strengthens the legal barriers against prosecution for this specific social media post. Forecaster 2's framing of the general base rate—that the arrest of any high-profile, legally savvy figure in a month is extremely low—is also a useful way to conceptualize the improbability of the event, even beyond the specifics of this case. Their reasoning is highly convincing and adds important specificity to my initial analysis.",
    "rationale": "I am updating my forecast downward from 3% to 2%. The deliberation with my fellow forecasters has reinforced my initial reasoning while also convincing me that the probability is slightly lower than I first estimated. My core rationale remains unchanged: the status quo, the high legal standard for a 'true threat,' and the short one-month timeline make an arrest highly unlikely. However, Forecaster 3's specific point about the 2023 Supreme Court ruling adds a crucial legal detail that makes the path to prosecution even more difficult than I had articulated. Proving Comey's subjective intent to threaten based on the available evidence is an immense challenge for prosecutors, making a prerequisite arrest very improbable. This, combined with the observation from both forecasters that the formal legal process (warrants, subpoenas, etc.) has not even begun, suggests my initial 3% might have placed slightly too much weight on political volatility. I am lowering my forecast to 2% to align with this more detailed understanding of the legal and procedural hurdles, while still accounting for the very small tail risk of an arrest for an unrelated reason or an unforeseen, rapid escalation.",
