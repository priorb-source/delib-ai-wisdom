    "review": "All three forecasts converge on 15-20%, reflecting strong agreement on the core reasoning: the 10-day timeframe, complete absence of announcement signals, and 11 days having passed since the CNN article all favor No. Forecaster 2 makes a particularly compelling point that I should weight more heavily - if Stevens intended to capitalize on the vacuum created by withdrawals, she likely would have announced within days, not waited nearly two weeks. Forecaster 3 effectively emphasizes what I noted but didn't stress enough: the complete absence of media speculation, staff hiring, or fundraising activity is a strong negative indicator. However, neither forecaster introduced fundamentally new information that would warrant a major update. We all recognize the same dynamics: unlikely but not impossible, with the status quo heavily favored.",
    "rationale": "After deliberation, I'm updating slightly upward from 15% to 16% to acknowledge the consensus range while maintaining a conservative stance. The key insight from the discussion is that 11 days have elapsed since the CNN article reporting other withdrawals - this is actually more significant than I initially weighted. If Stevens were going to seize the moment, the window was immediately after those withdrawals, not now with 10 days left. The complete absence of any signals (no fundraising reports, no staff moves, no media speculation, no statements of interest) with such little time remaining is highly indicative. However, I'm not moving higher than 16% because: (1) political decisions can happen rapidly under party pressure, (2) 10 days remains technically sufficient, and (3) we're operating with incomplete information. The tight clustering of our forecasts (15-20%) suggests we've properly calibrated around the key evidence and reasoning.",
