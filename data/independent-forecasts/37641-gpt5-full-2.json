  "information": "Circle Internet Group, Inc. has filed a public S-1 application with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) for an initial public offering (IPO), with plans to list on the New York Stock Exchange under the ticker symbol 'CRCL'. The initial confidential submission was in January 2024, with a public update on April 1, 2025. The lead underwriters include Morgan Stanley, Citigroup, JPMorgan Chase, Barclays, and Deutsche Bank. This is Circle's second attempt to go public after a failed SPAC merger in 2021, which had valued the company at $9 billion. The current IPO valuation is estimated at $4 billion to $5 billion. As of mid-May 2025, the deal status is 'filed' but not yet 'active', with no road-show date or price range announced.\n\nCircle's main business is issuing the USDC stablecoin, which has a market capitalization of approximately $60 billion. The company's revenue is primarily generated from managing the reserve assets backing USDC, which produced $1.7 billion in income in 2024, accounting for 99.1% of total revenue. The company's financial performance has varied, reporting a net loss of $768.8 million in 2022 followed by a net income of $267.6 million in 2023. For 2024, Circle's revenue was $1.68 billion, while net income declined 42% to $155.7 million and adjusted EBITDA fell 29% to $285 million. A major expense in 2024 was $907.9 million paid to partner Coinbase for USDC distribution. The company's liquidity was $1.05 billion at the end of 2024.\n\nAccording to multiple reports in May 2025, Circle's IPO plans were paused or delayed due to market volatility, sometimes referred to as the 'Trump effect'. A May 12 article in Expansión specifically listed Circle among several companies putting IPO plans on hold. However, the market for fintech listings is not entirely closed, as exemplified by the IPO of eToro on May 13. The broader cryptocurrency sector saw venture capital funding double to $6 billion in Q1 2025 compared to the previous year, despite a drop in the number of deals. During the same quarter, the total market value of stablecoins increased by 12%. The regulatory framework for stablecoins in the U.S. remains under development.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "47 days (through June 30, 2025)",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No — as of mid-May there is no price range, no roadshow, and reports say the deal is paused; without a quick turn to “active,” a June listing is unlikely.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Circle keeps the IPO on hold through June due to market volatility or SEC review pace; no S-1/A with a range appears by early/mid-June, the roadshow doesn’t launch, or the company opts to wait until H2 2025. A switch to Nasdaq (or any venue other than NYSE) before July 1 would also resolve No under these rules.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Within the next 1–2 weeks Circle files an S-1/A with a price range, receives NYSE approval, launches a ~7–10 business day roadshow, gets the S-1 declared effective, prices in late June, and begins trading on the NYSE under “CRCL” before July 1.",
    "rationale": "What I know from the assistant’s report: Circle publicly filed its S-1 on April 1, 2025, aiming for the NYSE (ticker CRCL). It has top-tier underwriters and meaningful scale (USDC ~$60B market cap; 2024 revenue $1.68B, net income $156M). Yet as of mid-May the deal is “filed” not “active,” with no price range or roadshow, and several May reports say Circle paused plans due to market volatility. The IPO window isn’t closed—eToro listed in May—but conditions are choppy. Timeline mechanics: From filing a range to first trade typically takes ~2–3 weeks (roadshow ~7–10 business days, SEC effectiveness, pricing, then listing). With 47 days left, a June listing is still feasible if they pivot to active soon, but any continued pause into early June sharply reduces the odds. Status quo heavily favors No: no active marketing, no range, and public chatter of delay. Why not higher than 30%: The lack of a range/roadshow by mid‑May and reports of a pause suggest Circle is waiting for a steadier tape. They have a history of a prior aborted go‑public attempt, and regulatory/political noise around stablecoins could keep them cautious. The calendar is tight; a single additional week of inaction pushes the earliest realistic listing into July. Why not lower than 30%: Circle appears operationally ready (S‑1 on file, bulge-bracket syndicate). The business is profitable at current rates, stablecoin market cap is growing, and crypto-related listings are not entirely shut. If markets stabilize, they can move quickly and grab a late‑June slot. What would change my view: - Upward: An S‑1/A with a price range, a roadshow announcement, or NYSE listing approval in the next 1–2 weeks (+40–60% depending on timing). A strong crypto/risk rally or passage/progress on U.S. stablecoin legislation would also help. - Downward: Continued silence through June 7–10, explicit reports of postponement to H2, a change of planned venue to Nasdaq, or any adverse regulatory/USDC event. In those cases I’d drop to <10%.",
