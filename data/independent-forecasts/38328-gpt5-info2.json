  "information": "Historically, the 705-seat European Parliament sees between 80 and 120 replacements over a five-year term, which averages to approximately 1-2 departures per month. This turnover can be due to a variety of reasons, including appointments to national posts, retirement, scandals, or health issues. The rate of departures is often higher during the first year of a new parliamentary term. Precedents from previous scandals are mixed; while events like 'Qatargate' did lead to resignations, some indicted MEPs, such as Eva Kaili and Marc Tarabella, resisted calls to step down for several months while legal proceedings were ongoing.",

    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "26 days (from 2025-06-05 to 2025-07-01)",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Routine churn quiets down in late June; MEPs implicated in the Huawei lobbying affair or other issues publicly insist on staying pending investigations; no major national appointments draw MEPs out; any planned departures are timed for early July or later.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "At least one MEP announces stepping down between June 10–30 due to scandal fallout, health/personal reasons, appointment to a national government role, party leadership post, or legal ineligibility; announcement is made during/around a June plenary week when such notices are commonly recorded.",
    "rationale": "Baseline: Over a five‑year term the EP sees ~80–120 replacements (≈1.3–2.0 per month). Applied to a 21‑day window (Jun 10–30), a Poisson model implies roughly a 50–75% chance of at least one resignation, with the first year tending higher due to early‑term reshuffles. Plenary periods in June also slightly increase the likelihood that announcements are made and recorded in this window.\nScandal effect: The Huawei lobbying story could nudge probability up, but past cases (e.g., Qatargate) show many MEPs resist resigning quickly; some fight on for months. So I assign only a modest upward adjustment relative to base rates.\nWhy not higher: Many resignations cluster around major institutional transitions (e.g., Commission formation) or national elections; no clear, dated pipeline points to late June. Embattled MEPs often delay resigning. The window is short and excludes early June.\nWhy not lower: The base rate alone supports roughly coin‑flip to two‑thirds odds in a 3‑week span, and we are in the early part of the term with an active controversy plus a June plenary when such announcements often surface.\nWhat would move me up: Credible reports of an MEP being appointed to a national cabinet or top party role, formal charges or party expulsions with explicit calls to resign, or media leaks indicating an imminent resignation timed for the June plenary.\nWhat would move me down: Public commitments by implicated MEPs to stay on; signals that potential departures are scheduled for July; a quiet news cycle through mid‑June with no new developments on the lobbying story.\nAssistant’s summary incorporated: 80–120 replacements per term (~1–2/month), higher early‑term turnover; scandals sometimes cause resignations but often with long lags.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill any members of the European Parliament resign before July 1, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nEuro News: [Lobbying scandal related to Huawei: What we know so far](https://www.euronews.com/my-europe/2025/05/21/lobbying-scandal-related-to-huawei-what-we-know-so-far)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if a member of the European Parliament announces their resignation after June 9, 2025 and before July 1, 2025.\n\n\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nHistorically, the 705-seat European Parliament sees between 80 and 120 replacements over a five-year term, which averages to approximately 1-2 departures per month.

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
