    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "About 47 days (until July 1, 2025)",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No — he remains in the U.S., likely still in detention or released under supervision, with removal not executed by July 1.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "His detention challenge and/or related litigation continues; a court issues a stay or the case remains pending; travel documents are not secured or a receiving country does not accept him; ICE cannot arrange removal in time.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "He already has a final removal order, travel documents are issued, no court stay is in place, and ICE books a seat and removes him within the next several weeks.",
    "rationale": "There is no specific, recent public information provided about Mahmoud Khalil’s removal posture, and the assistant found no additional info. The prompt’s note that his “challenge to his detention moves forward” suggests ongoing litigation about custody (e.g., habeas/Zadvydas-type issues). Those cases often indicate removal has not been feasible or imminent; when courts entertain detention challenges, it is frequently because removal is not reasonably foreseeable. In such circumstances, deportation within a short, 7-week window is uncommon.\n\nBase rates: For a specific named detainee without evidence of imminent travel documents and a cleared legal path, the chance of ICE executing removal within ~1–2 months is generally low. Deportations require a final order, accepted travel documents, no active stay, and flight logistics; any pending litigation or country-cooperation issues can delay for weeks to months.\n\nWhy not higher: We lack signals of imminence (e.g., issuance of travel documents, denial of a stay, docket entries indicating removal is scheduled). The existence of a moving detention challenge tilts against near-term deportation.\n\nWhy not lower: If he does have a final order and the detention challenge concerns only custody (not removal), and if travel documents are already in hand, ICE can sometimes effect removal within weeks, especially if a court denies relief or a stay. That keeps a nonzero chance alive.\n\nWhat would move the forecast up: Reporting or court filings showing (1) final order of removal with no active stay, (2) receiving country acceptance and travel documents issued, (3) a scheduled removal date or recent denials of emergency relief. What would move it down: Any stay of removal, indications that travel documents are not forthcoming or country will not accept him, or court signals that his detention challenge is likely to succeed because removal is not reasonably foreseeable.\n\nResearch assistant summary: No additional information available; thus, the forecast leans on process/base-rate reasoning and the implication of ongoing detention litigation.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill Mahmoud Khalil be deported before July 1, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\n[Mahmoud Khalil's challenge to his detention moves forward]()\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if the United States deports Mahmoud Khalil before July 1, 2025. For purposes of this question, \"deported\" means Khalil being transported out of the territory of the United States against his will.\n\n\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nNo additional information available.\n\nToday is 2025-05-14.\n\nBefore answering you think:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n(e) You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
