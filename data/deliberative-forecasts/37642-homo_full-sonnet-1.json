    "review": "All three forecasters converged remarkably on 18-20%, using nearly identical reasoning. We all emphasized: Fed's explicit 'not in a hurry' messaging, major institutions pushing rate cut forecasts to July or later, inflation at 2.7% above target, strong labor market (4.2% unemployment), low market pricing via CME FedWatch, and the compressed timeline with only 1-2 FOMC meetings remaining before July 1. Forecaster 3 made a valuable point I underweighted: CPI is showing deceleration, which is a positive signal for potential cuts. Additionally, the Fed's March projection of two cuts in 2025 indicates they're not opposed to cutting, just cautious on timing. However, this doesn't fundamentally change the calculus - the question is whether cuts come before vs. after July 1, and all evidence points to July or later. Forecaster 2's emphasis on the Fed's preference for 'gradual, well-telegraphed policy changes' reinforces why a June surprise is unlikely. The fact that we all independently reached nearly identical forecasts using comprehensive but similar reasoning actually increases my confidence in the 18-20% range as appropriate calibration.",
    "rationale": "After reviewing the other analyses, I don't see compelling reasons to adjust my forecast. The convergence at 18-20% across three independent analyses using similar comprehensive reasoning suggests this range appropriately captures the probability. The core logic remains: (1) Fed officials have been unambiguous about patience, (2) institutional forecasters uniformly expect July or later, (3) economic conditions don't signal urgency despite some CPI deceleration, (4) the timeline is very compressed with limited meeting opportunities, and (5) the Fed rarely surprises markets without telegraphing. While CPI deceleration and the Fed's projection of two 2025 cuts are worth noting as potential positive signals, they don't overcome the weight of evidence favoring no cut before July 1. The 20% forecast already appropriately balances the strong status quo bias against residual uncertainty from one remaining meeting and potential unforeseen shocks. The tight clustering of forecasts at 18-20% validates this probability range.",
