    "review": "Forecaster 2’s argument closely matches my prior view and adds useful specificity: the House deadlines and a June 2 sine die make the window extremely tight, and a special session would need an explicit call from the governor. I agree with their emphasis on status quo bias and the House as a brake on Senate crackdowns. Forecaster 3’s 15% feels too high. They appear to treat “active consideration” as meaningful momentum and seem to conflate any THC restrictions with a full ban. Given the resolution requires a total statewide prohibition on the sale of THC, typical hemp/Delta-8/Delta-9 crackdowns with carve-outs likely wouldn’t qualify. Also, the real window is ~2.5 weeks for the regular session, not 6–7 effective weeks, unless a special session is called, which is unlikely for this topic. Overall, Forecaster 2’s reasoning is convincing; Forecaster 3 overestimates both timing and breadth of likely legislation.",
    "rationale": "Key points unchanged: (1) The resolution requires a full ban on sale of THC statewide. That would likely conflict with Texas’ Compassionate Use Program and FDA-approved THC medications, making a clean, exception-free ban politically and practically implausible. Most realistic bills target hemp-derived intoxicating cannabinoids or impose age/labeling limits—those would not satisfy the “full ban” criterion. (2) Timing is prohibitive. With House deadlines largely past and sine die June 2, moving a sweeping, controversial measure through both chambers and conference in the final stretch is highly unlikely. After June 2, success would require a special session called by the governor with this topic on the call, which recent priority signals do not support. (3) Political headwinds remain: prior efforts to sharply restrict hemp intoxicants struggled, and the in-state hemp industry plus medical stakeholders would oppose an absolute ban. Non-zero tail risk remains for a last-minute amendment to a must-pass bill or an unexpected special session, but any such legislation would almost certainly include carve-outs that fail the strict resolution test. In light of Forecaster 2’s precise calendar notes (June 2 sine die), I slightly adjust up from 2% to 3% to reflect marginally more runway and low-probability procedural maneuvers, but the base case remains No.",
