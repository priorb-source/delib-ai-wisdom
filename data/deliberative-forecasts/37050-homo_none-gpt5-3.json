    "review": "Both forecasters appropriately anchor on base rates, short horizon, and the recent 2024 reshuffle, which reduces near-term odds. They also correctly note the announcement-based resolution and identify typical triggers (M&A, splits, severe crises, sector-balance motivations). The quantified base-rate translation (~0.6 events/year → ~10% in ~2 months) is useful. Their mention of plausible future adds (Alphabet/Meta) via swapping out an older telecom/tech constituent (e.g., Verizon) is a good tail-risk scenario, though not visibly catalyzed right now. I don’t see material new evidence beyond my initial view; rather, their arguments reinforce it. The only incremental nuance is the explicit two-month base-rate conversion landing closer to 10% than higher teens, which slightly pressures my prior toward the low end of my range.",
    "rationale": "Time left is short (~67 days). The DJIA committee changed the roster in 2024, which historically precedes a settling period. There are no widely signaled catalysts (no announced large splits, transformative M&A, or clear committee intent). The most salient tail remains an acute deterioration at a constituent (Boeing or, secondarily, Verizon/3M) or a sudden desire to improve representation by adding a mega-cap like Alphabet/Meta—changes the committee can announce with little notice. Those are plausible but not indicated right now. Given the peers’ base-rate framing at ~10% for this window and absence of fresh signals, I keep a modest probability, nudging toward the lower end of my initial thinking but not meaningfully changing the forecast. I remain slightly above 10% to reflect the Boeing/representation tail and the announcement-based resolution (a late-June surprise would still resolve Yes).",
