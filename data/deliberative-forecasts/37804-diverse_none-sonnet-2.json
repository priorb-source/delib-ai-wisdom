    "review": "Both forecasters make compelling arguments about bureaucratic inertia and procedural timelines that I underweighted in my initial analysis. Forecaster 2's emphasis on the lack of new paradigm-shifting scientific evidence is particularly important - political pressure alone rarely overrides established health guidance this quickly. Forecaster 3's observation that agencies typically keep existing guidance with review disclaimers rather than pulling recommendations abruptly is valuable. Their 88-90% forecasts are well-reasoned and grounded in how federal agencies actually operate. However, I believe they may slightly underweight two factors: (1) the resolution criterion explicitly includes simple page removal as a No outcome, which could occur faster than formal policy change, and (2) the current political context may create faster-than-normal pressure for visible action. The mention of HHS reviewing fluoride guidance in the question background, potentially connected to fluoride-skeptical political figures, suggests non-trivial risk of rapid, top-down intervention. That said, their core argument about the 6-week timeline being insufficient for proper bureaucratic process is strong and has moved me upward from my initial 75%.",
    "rationale": "After deliberation, I'm updating upward from 75% to 82%. The other forecasters correctly emphasized that: (1) changing a 10-year-old public health recommendation requires substantial process even under political pressure, (2) the lack of new scientific evidence makes rapid change less justifiable, and (3) agencies typically maintain guidance during reviews. The ~6-week timeline from now to July 1st is genuinely very short for federal bureaucracy. However, I'm not moving all the way to 88-90% because: (1) the question explicitly resolves as No if the page is simply taken offline, which could theoretically happen through political directive faster than formal policy change, (2) the current political environment and HHS review announcement suggest meaningful pressure for visible action, and (3) a 'precautionary pause' removing the numeric recommendation while stating 'under review' is plausible. My 82% forecast balances strong institutional inertia with non-trivial political and procedural risks in a compressed timeframe.",
