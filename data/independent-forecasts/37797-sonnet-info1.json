  "information": "Following its plenary meeting in Paris from February 17-21, 2025, the Financial Action Task Force (FATF) announced no changes to its 'black list' of High-Risk Jurisdictions subject to a Call for Action, which continues to include North Korea, Iran, and Myanmar. During the same plenary, Laos and Nepal were added to the 'grey list' of jurisdictions under increased monitoring, while the Philippines was removed. The FATF also maintained the suspension of Russia's membership, which has been in place since February 2023, without adding the country to either the grey or black lists.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Approximately 3-5 weeks. The FATF June 2025 plenary meeting should occur in late June, with results typically announced shortly after the conclusion of the meeting.",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No. The status quo is that no changes are made to the black list, which would continue to include only North Korea, Iran, and Myanmar.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "The FATF maintains the current black list unchanged at its June 2025 plenary. North Korea, Iran, and Myanmar remain the only three jurisdictions subject to a Call for Action, with no new additions and no removals. This represents continuity from the February 2025 plenary.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "The FATF either removes one of the current three countries (most plausibly Iran if significant reforms occur, or Myanmar if there's political stabilization) or adds a new jurisdiction to the black list (potentially Russia given its suspended membership status, though this would be unusual without prior grey list placement).",
    "rationale": "The FATF black list is historically very stable, with changes being rare events. The research assistant's report shows that at the most recent February 2025 plenary (just 3 months ago), there were NO changes to the black list, despite changes being made to the grey list. This recent stability is highly informative.\n\nFor removals: North Korea shows no cooperation and is extremely unlikely to be removed. Iran has been on the list for years and would need substantial reforms - unlikely in just 3 months. Myanmar's political situation remains unstable following the military coup. None of these three jurisdictions are likely to demonstrate sufficient progress in such a short timeframe to warrant removal.\n\nFor additions: Russia is the most plausible candidate given its suspended membership since February 2023. However, FATF has not added Russia to either list despite two years of suspension, suggesting political sensitivity or procedural constraints. Adding countries directly to the black list without prior grey list placement is extremely rare - countries typically graduate through the grey list first. No other jurisdiction appears to be an imminent candidate.\n\nThe base rate strongly favors no change. Black list modifications require consensus among FATF members and represent the most severe designation in the AML/CFT regime. The recent February plenary's decision to maintain the status quo, combined with the short 3-month interval until the June meeting, suggests minimal likelihood of change.\n\nMy forecast is not higher because: (1) the black list is exceptionally stable; (2) we just had a plenary with no changes; (3) insufficient time has passed for meaningful reforms; (4) adding Russia directly remains politically complex and procedurally unusual.\n\nMy forecast is not lower because: (1) low-probability events do occur; (2) Russia's suspended status creates unique circumstances; (3) Iran has historically moved on and off the list; (4) unforeseen political developments could occur.\n\nTo update higher, I would need: evidence of significant AML/CFT reforms in listed countries, or signals that FATF will formalize Russia's status. To update lower, I would need: explicit statements from FATF about maintaining the current list, or evidence that Russia will not be added.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill any jurisdictions be added to or removed from the FATF \"black list\" following the FATF Plenary meeting in June 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nWikipedia: [Financial Action Task Force blacklist](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Financial_Action_Task_Force_blacklist)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if following its June 2025 plenary, the Financial Action Task Force (FATF) has made any changes to its \"High-Risk Jurisdictions subject to a Call for Action\" list, which at the time of this question consists of North Korea, Myanmar and Iran. Resolves according to the [official list](https://www.fatf-gafi.org/en/countries/black-and-grey-lists.html).\n\nThe question may resolve according to [credible sources](https://www.metaculus.com/help/faq/#definitions) in case the website is unavailable or not timely updated.\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nFollowing its plenary meeting in Paris from February 17-21, 2025, the Financial Action Task Force (FATF) announced no changes to its 'black list' of High-Risk Jurisdictions subject to a Call for Action, which continues to include North Korea, Iran, and Myanmar.

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
