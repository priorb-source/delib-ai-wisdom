  "information": "According to multiple news reports from late May 2025, former Ivorian President Laurent Gbagbo is considered disqualified from the 2025 presidential election. This is due to a 2018 conviction for the looting of the Central Bank of West African States (BCEAO), which resulted in a 20-year prison sentence and the loss of his civic rights. Sources such as Le Point, tunisienumerique.com, and Abidjan.net state that he remains struck from the electoral list. His political party, the People's African Party-Côte d'Ivoire (PPA-CI), announced in late April 2025 that it would evaluate the situation in the first half of June 2025 and consider a 'new level in the fight' if his status on the electoral list does not change.",

    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Approximately 32 days until July 1, 2025",
    "status_quo_outcome": "Yes - Laurent Gbagbo appears to already be disqualified from the electoral list",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "All five listed candidates remain legally eligible to run through July 1, 2025, with no official disqualifications or removals from the electoral list occurring during this period. This could happen if Laurent Gbagbo's disqualification is reversed through legal appeals, or if the reporting about his current status is inaccurate.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "At least one of the five candidates is officially removed from the electoral list or becomes legally ineligible before July 1, 2025. Based on current reporting, Laurent Gbagbo appears to already satisfy this criterion as he is reported to be struck from the electoral list due to his 2018 conviction and loss of civic rights.",
    "rationale": "The research assistant's report indicates that Laurent Gbagbo is currently considered disqualified from the 2025 presidential election as of late May 2025. Multiple credible sources (Le Point, tunisienumerique.com, Abidjan.net) report that he remains struck from the electoral list due to a 2018 conviction for looting the BCEAO, which resulted in a 20-year prison sentence and loss of civic rights. The BBC background article about a 'main opposition leader removed from Ivory Coast electoral list' likely refers to this situation. Since today is May 30, 2025, and the question asks about disqualifications occurring before July 1, 2025, if Gbagbo's disqualification has indeed already occurred (as the reporting suggests), then the resolution criteria would already be satisfied. The key uncertainties are: (1) the precise timing and legal status of Gbagbo's removal from the electoral list, (2) whether this disqualification has been officially formalized, and (3) the possibility of a legal reversal. His party's statement about evaluating the situation in early June suggests ongoing legal efforts, but the multiple sources describing his current disqualified status increase confidence. I'm not forecasting higher (closer to 95-98%) because there remains some uncertainty about the official legal status and the possibility of a successful appeal or administrative reversal before July 1. I'm not forecasting lower because the evidence strongly suggests a disqualification has already occurred. I would revise upward with official electoral commission confirmation of the disqualification, and downward if credible sources report he has been reinstated to the electoral list.",
