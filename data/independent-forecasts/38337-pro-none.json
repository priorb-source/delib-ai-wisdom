    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Approximately 3 weeks. The data for the week ending June 21, 2025, is scheduled for release on Thursday, June 26, 2025.",
    "status_quo_outcome": "Yes. The current trend in the labor market is one of gradual cooling, with initial jobless claims fluctuating in a range that is frequently above the 220,000 mark. A continuation of this trend would result in the number exceeding the threshold.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "The labor market demonstrates unexpected resilience through mid-June. A lack of significant, widespread layoffs, combined with robust hiring in certain sectors, causes the number of new claims to dip below the recent average for the specific week, resulting in a reading of 220,000 or less.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "The cumulative effect of restrictive monetary policy continues to soften the labor market. Several companies announce modest layoffs, or a general slowdown in business activity prompts more small businesses to let go of staff, pushing the weekly claims figure above 220,000, in line with a gentle upward trend.",
    "rationale": "My forecast is based on the prevailing economic conditions as of early June 2025. The US labor market has been gradually softening for several quarters under the influence of the Federal Reserve's restrictive monetary policy. Recent data points for initial jobless claims, while volatile week-to-week, have established a range roughly between 215,000 and 235,000, with a central tendency slightly above the 220,000 threshold. Given that the underlying economic drivers—such as high interest rates and moderating consumer demand—are expected to persist over the short three-week forecast horizon, the status quo is the most powerful guide. Therefore, it is more likely than not that the claims number for the week of June 21 will fall within this established range and above the 220,000 mark.\n\nMy probability is not higher because jobless claims are a notoriously noisy high-frequency indicator. A figure of 220,000 is very close to the recent average, and a small, random downward fluctuation, perhaps due to administrative factors or the timing of layoff announcements, could easily result in a 'No' outcome. A forecast with very high confidence would require the threshold to be further from the recent trend.\n\nMy probability is not lower because a reading below 220,000 would require a reversal of the current cooling trend. There are no immediate catalysts suggesting an imminent re-acceleration of the labor market that would push claims significantly and sustainably lower in the next three weeks.\n\nI would increase my probability for 'Yes' if the claims data for the preceding weeks (ending June 7 and June 14) come in significantly above 225,000, or if there are major layoff announcements from large corporations. Conversely, I would lower my probability if those preceding weeks show surprisingly low numbers, indicating unexpected labor market strength.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill initial jobless claims for the week ended June 21, 2025 exceed 220,000?\n\nQuestion background:\nAccording to the resolution source, \"An initial claim is a claim filed by an unemployed individual after a separation from an employer. The claim requests a determination of basic eligibility for the Unemployment Insurance program.\"\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if initial jobless claims for the week ended June 21, 2025 is greater than 220,000 according to [FRED](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/ICSA).&#x20;\n\n\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nNo additional information available.\n\nToday is 2025-06-06.\n\nBefore answering you think:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n(e) You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
