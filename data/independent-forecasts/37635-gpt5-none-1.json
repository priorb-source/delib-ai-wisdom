    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "About 45 days (roughly 6.5 weeks) until June 28, 2025",
    "status_quo_outcome": "Yes — Milei currently leads Sheinbaum 61% to 60% per Morning Consult at the time stated.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Sheinbaum’s early-term honeymoon remains robust or ticks up (e.g., steady security or social policy wins), while Milei’s approval dips on continued austerity pain, protests, legislative setbacks, or a bout of financial volatility; or the two are tied on the check date (ties resolve No).",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Milei maintains or widens a slim edge as inflation continues falling, reforms pass or show traction, the peso stays orderly, and economic sentiment stabilizes; Sheinbaum eases a point or two from honeymoon levels or faces a short-lived controversy, leaving Milei clearly above her on the check date.",
    "rationale": "- Setup: Morning Consult will be the arbiter, and ties count as No. Today, Milei is reportedly up by 1 point (61 vs. 60). With only ~45 days left, large moves are less likely; MC’s tracker typically shifts gradually week to week. That favors the status quo slightly, but the tie-as-No rule trims that edge. \n- Baselines: Mexican presidents often sustain high approvals early; AMLO remained elevated for years. Sheinbaum near ~60% is plausible to hold. Milei’s approval has been more volatile: austerity and recession weigh against him, but visibly falling inflation and any legislative wins could support him short term. \n- Volatility and tie risk: The current margin is just 1 point. Weekly noise or rounding can easily produce a tie, which resolves No. That lowers the chance of a Yes even if Milei is roughly holding steady. \n- Time horizon: Over ~6 weeks, typical MC movements are a few points at most absent major shocks. That slightly favors whoever leads now, but not strongly given the small margin and tie penalty. \n- Why not higher? The tie-as-No rule plus Sheinbaum’s likely stability around 60% means even a flat-to-slightly-down Milei risks ending tied or behind. Small measurement shifts could erase a 1-point lead. \n- Why not lower? Milei already leads and could benefit from continued disinflation, a legislative win, or simply holding pattern dynamics over a short window. \n- What would move me up: Clear evidence in MC of Milei extending a lead (e.g., 2–3 points), passage of key reforms, further marked disinflation with improving sentiment, or signs of Sheinbaum drifting to the high-50s. \n- What would move me down: MC trend showing Milei slipping or Sheinbaum edging up (e.g., Sheinbaum ≥62 while Milei ≤60), high-profile protests or policy defeats in Argentina, or financial stress (currency wobble) that dents Milei’s numbers. \n- Research assistant note: No new data provided; I’m weighting the given baseline (61 vs. 60) and general tracker dynamics. Given the small margin, short horizon, and tie-as-No rule, I lean only slightly to Yes.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill Javier Milei have a higher approval rating than Claudia Sheinbaum on June 28, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nAt the time of this question, Sheinbaum is at 60% as compared with Milei at 61%.\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if Javier Milei has a higher approval rating than Claudia Sheinbaum at [Morning Consult](https://pro.morningconsult.com/trackers/global-leader-approval) when checked by Metaculus on or after June 28, 2025. A tie or a lead by Sheinbaum resolves the question as **No**.\n\n\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nNo additional information available.\n\nToday is 2025-05-14.\n\nBefore answering you think:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n(e) You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
