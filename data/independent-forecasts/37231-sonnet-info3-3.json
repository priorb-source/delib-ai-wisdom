  "information": "Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum has publicly rejected the International Monetary Fund's (IMF) prediction of a 0.3% economic contraction in Mexico for 2025. She stated that the economic models of the Ministry of Finance contradict the IMF's projection and that the government has a strategic plan, known as 'Plan México', to reactivate and strengthen the national economy. As part of this strategy, the president has called on commercial banks to reduce interest rates to promote economic growth.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "The April 2025 unemployment data will likely be released by mid-May 2025, so within approximately 2-3 weeks. However, since we are at April 29, 2025, the employment situation for April has already been determined - it just needs to be officially compiled and published.",
    "status_quo_outcome": "YES - Mexico's unemployment rate would remain below 3%",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "US tariffs on Mexican goods severely disrupt the automotive and manufacturing sectors, leading to immediate layoffs and pushing unemployment above 3.0%. The IMF's predicted economic contraction materializes quickly, causing broader labor market weakness that manifests in the April data.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Mexico's labor market remains resilient despite external pressures. The government's 'Plan México' initiative and pressure on banks to reduce interest rates help maintain economic activity. The full impact of US tariffs hasn't yet translated into significant job losses by April, and Mexico's historically low unemployment rate (often in the 2.5-3.0% range) continues.",
    "rationale": "Mexico has historically maintained relatively low unemployment rates, typically ranging between 2.5% and 3.5% over the past several years. Since we are already at the end of April 2025, the unemployment outcome for this month has essentially already occurred - the data simply hasn't been compiled and released yet by Trading Economics.\n\nThe status quo strongly favors a YES outcome. Mexico's unemployment rate has frequently been below 3% in recent years, and labor markets generally don't experience rapid month-to-month swings absent major economic shocks.\n\nHowever, there are countervailing factors: The background information highlights US tariffs affecting auto supply chains, which could increase unemployment in Mexico's important manufacturing sector. Additionally, the IMF's prediction of a 0.3% economic contraction for 2025 suggests some economic weakness, though President Sheinbaum has rejected this forecast and outlined 'Plan México' to strengthen the economy.\n\nCritically, even if tariff impacts are real, they typically take time to fully manifest in unemployment data. Job losses from supply chain disruptions usually occur over several months, not immediately. Since April is essentially complete, any tariff impacts announced recently would more likely appear in May or June data.\n\nMy forecast is not higher (above 70%) because: There are genuine economic headwinds from US tariffs and potential economic contraction that create uncertainty. Without access to the most recent February-March 2025 unemployment data, I cannot be more confident about the precise trend.\n\nMy forecast is not lower (below 60%) because: Mexico's strong historical pattern of low unemployment, the fact that April's outcome is already determined, and the typically slow-moving nature of labor market changes all support the status quo of unemployment remaining below 3%.\n\nTo update higher: I would need to see February or March 2025 data showing unemployment well below 2.8%, indicating strong momentum for staying under 3%.\n\nTo update lower: I would need evidence of February-March 2025 unemployment already approaching or exceeding 3%, or reports of major, immediate layoffs in Mexico's manufacturing sector occurring in April.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill Mexico's unemployment rate be under 3% in April 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nAP: [US tariffs ripple through auto supply chains into Mexico](https://apnews.com/article/mexico-stellantis-trump-tariffs-sheinbaum-569ae29d203b1997d50a3a9655c928a8)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if Mexico's unemployment rate is less than 3.0% for April 2025 according to data presented by [Trading Economics](https://tradingeconomics.com/mexico/unemployment-rate).\n\n\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nMexican President Claudia Sheinbaum has publicly rejected the International Monetary Fund's (IMF) prediction of a 0.3% economic contraction in Mexico for 2025.

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
