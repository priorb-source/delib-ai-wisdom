    "review": "Forecaster 2 provided crucial information I was missing: the May 2025 final reading was 52.2, which is ALREADY 1.8 points below the 54.0 threshold. This fundamentally changes the question from 'Will sentiment drop below 54.0?' to 'Will sentiment stay below 54.0 or recover above it?' This completely inverts my initial analysis. Forecaster 2's 68% probability for Yes seems well-reasoned given this status quo, though they appropriately note the gap is small (only 1.8 points) and May showed improvement from preliminary to final. Forecaster 3's 30% seems incorrect given the revelation that we're already below threshold - they appear to have made the same error I did in assuming we need to fall TO 54.0 rather than stay BELOW it. Forecaster 3 did provide valuable context on inflation expectations (7.3% for next year, up from 6.5%) and the 75% of consumers citing tariffs as uncertainty, but their probability doesn't align with starting from 52.2. The Conference Board data jumping from 85.7 to 98 is an important counterpoint suggesting consumer psychology may be stabilizing or improving in some dimensions.",
    "rationale": "I made a critical error in my initial forecast by not knowing the current May reading. With May final at 52.2 (already below 54.0), the status quo outcome is Yes, not No. The question becomes whether June will recover the 1.8 points needed to reach 54.0 or remain depressed. Key factors favoring Yes (staying below 54.0): the consistent downward trend through early 2025, very weak economic expectations (47.9), ongoing tariff concerns affecting 75% of consumers, and rising inflation expectations. Key factors favoring No (recovering above 54.0): the gap is quite small (just 1.8 points or 3.4%), May showed resilience by improving from preliminary to final, Conference Board confidence jumped significantly suggesting mixed consumer signals, and normal monthly volatility could easily produce this modest increase. My updated view: while sentiment could recover above 54.0, the momentum is downward and good forecasting favors continuity. However, the small gap and mixed signals create meaningful uncertainty. I'm updating significantly upward from my initial 30% to approximately 62%, reflecting that we're starting from below the threshold but acknowledging substantial probability of modest recovery.",
