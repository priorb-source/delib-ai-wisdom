    "no_outcome_scenario": "A 'No' outcome would require an unprecedented and abrupt reversal of fiscal trends within the next three weeks. This would involve the US government running a sudden, massive budget surplus large enough to reduce the total debt by what would likely be hundreds of billions of dollars. Such an event would necessitate an unpredicted, gigantic tax windfall combined with an immediate, drastic halt to most government expenditures, a scenario with no historical precedent.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "A 'Yes' outcome occurs if the US government's fiscal trajectory continues without radical deviation. Federal spending on established programs and interest payments proceeds as expected, while tax revenues align with recent patterns. This leads to a continued daily budget deficit, which is financed by issuing new debt, ensuring the 'Total Public Debt Outstanding' remains well above the $37 trillion threshold on the resolution date.",
    "rationale": "This forecast is based on the high-inertia, strong upward trend of the US national debt. Based on data from mid-2024, the debt grew by over $3 trillion in the preceding year. Extrapolating this well-established trend indicates that the $37 trillion threshold will have been crossed months before June 2025. As of the forecast date (June 4, 2025), the debt is estimated to be approximately $37.8 trillion. Therefore, for a 'No' outcome, the debt would need to decrease by over $800 billion in just 23 days, which is fiscally and politically implausible. The structural drivers of debt—including mandatory spending, defense, and interest costs—are not subject to such rapid change. The provided background information on wholesale inventories is noted but is irrelevant to federal debt levels and was not used in this analysis. My probability is not 100% to account for the infinitesimally small chance of a major data reporting error or a 'black swan' fiscal event. It is not lower because the fiscal inertia of the US government makes a significant debt reduction over a three-week period a virtual impossibility. I would only lower my forecast upon news of an immediate, massive, and politically enacted budget surplus.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill the US national debt be greater than $37 trillion on June 27, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nBase rate information can be found at [Merchant Wholesalers, Except Manufacturers' Sales Branches and Offices: Durable Goods: Furniture and Home Furnishings Inventories/Sales Ratio](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/R4232IM163SCEN).\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if the value for Total Public Debt Outstanding at the Debt to the Penny chart at the US Treasury's [Debt to the Penny](https://fiscaldata.treasury.gov/datasets/debt-to-the-penny/debt-to-the-penny) tracker for June 27, 2025 is greater than or equal to $37,000,000,000,000.\n\nIf the resolution source does not report that specific date, then the resolution will be based on the amount corresponding with the first date after it.\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nNo additional information available.\n\nToday is 2025-06-04.\n\nBefore answering you think:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n(e) You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
