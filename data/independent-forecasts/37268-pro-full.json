  "information": "As of early May 2025, Muqtada al-Sadr has publicly and repeatedly reaffirmed his boycott of the 2025 Iraqi parliamentary election. In April 2025, he rejected a plea from the Iraqi President to reconsider his decision, stating he would not participate with 'the corrupt'. In March 2025, he forbade his followers from voting or participating in the election. A Qatari report from late April indicated al-Sadr is unwilling to take responsibility for the political mistakes of the rival Shia Coordination Framework. During a speech on May 2, 2025, he told supporters to 'speak out if their speech benefits reform, and remain silent if silence benefits reform.'\n\nThe Iraqi government has set November 11, 2025, as the date for the parliamentary elections. The Independent High Electoral Commission (IHEC) announced that the registration period for political alliances would run from April 15 to May 4, 2025. The political landscape is marked by significant divisions within the Shia bloc. The Shiite Coordination Framework, a major coalition, plans to participate in the election with at least six separate lists, though they are in discussions to form a post-election coalition. The electoral law remains a point of contention among political blocs.\n\nMuqtada al-Sadr has a history of reversing decisions to boycott elections. He previously reversed boycotts in 2014 and 2021. The 2021 reversal occurred in mid-August, approximately two months before the election. Despite his current boycott, al-Sadr has urged his followers to update their voter registration records. Some political sources have discussed the possibility of al-Sadr participating indirectly through an independent list to maintain influence, a strategy he has used in the past. In June 2022, after his party won 73 seats in the 2021 election, he ordered his entire parliamentary bloc to resign.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Approximately two months. The question resolves on July 1, 2025.",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No. Muqtada al-Sadr's Alliance Towards Reforms party will continue its stated boycott of the 2025 parliamentary election and will not announce its participation.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Muqtada al-Sadr adheres to his repeated public pronouncements and maintains his boycott. The May 4, 2025, deadline for registering political alliances passes without the Alliance Towards Reforms registering, making its participation as a coalition procedurally impossible and cementing the decision to stay out of the election.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "In a characteristic political reversal, Muqtada al-Sadr announces that participation is necessary to fight corruption from within. This announcement before July 1, 2025, could follow an extension of the alliance registration deadline or a last-minute registration on May 4th, allowing the Alliance Towards Reforms to formally enter the race.",
    "rationale": "My forecast is 20%. The evidence currently weighs heavily in favor of a continued boycott. Al-Sadr has been firm and consistent in his public statements, recently rejecting a plea from the Iraqi President to participate. The most significant factor is the imminent procedural deadline of May 4, 2025, for the registration of political alliances. With less than two days remaining, the window for the 'Alliance Towards Reforms' to register is closing fast, making non-participation the strong status-quo outcome. However, the probability is not close to zero due to al-Sadr's established history of dramatic, last-minute reversals on election boycotts, as seen in both 2014 and 2021. His ambiguous call for supporters to update their voter registration also suggests he may be keeping his options open. A 20% probability acknowledges the significant chance of a characteristic U-turn, which is entirely plausible for al-Sadr, while giving more weight to the current public stance and the concrete procedural barrier posed by the registration deadline. My forecast would increase if the registration deadline is extended. Conversely, my forecast would decrease significantly if the May 4 deadline passes with no registration by the Alliance.",
