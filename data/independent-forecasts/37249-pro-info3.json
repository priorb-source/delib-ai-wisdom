  "information": "Recent reports indicate a significant shift in the British political landscape. Patrick English, director of political analytics at YouGov, described the emergence of 'five party politics,' observing that both Labour and Conservative support levels are declining while support for Reform UK, the Liberal Democrats, and the Green Party is rising. A poll by More In Common found that 41% of voters lack faith in any of the main party leaders, and an Ipsos poll from March 2025 found that 36% of British adults were considering voting for Reform UK. Public sentiment is reportedly characterized by disillusionment with the traditional parties, with key voter issues including immigration, local infrastructure like potholes, and economic concerns. Polling data shows only 60% of those who voted for Labour in the July 2024 election would do so again.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "2 months",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No. Currently, the Labour Party is the highest polling party in the Politico poll of polls. Reform UK is not in first place, and is not leading by 4 or more percentage points.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "The current political trends continue without a major political shock. Reform UK's support may continue to grow, but not rapidly enough to overtake the governing Labour Party and establish a 4-point lead in the polling average before the July 1, 2025 deadline. The Labour government avoids any major scandals, and the electorate's disillusionment does not coalesce into a decisive, concentrated surge for Reform within the timeframe.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "A major political crisis, such as a severe economic downturn or a major scandal implicating the Labour government, causes a catastrophic collapse in their support. Disaffected Labour and Conservative voters shift their allegiance directly to Reform UK in large numbers, causing a rapid political realignment that is reflected in the polls. This surge propels Reform into a clear lead of 4 points or more in the Politico poll of polls.",
    "rationale": "My forecast is primarily based on the significant inertia of national polling averages and the short two-month timeframe. For a 'Yes' outcome, Reform UK would need to experience a polling surge of unprecedented speed and magnitude, sufficient to not only take first place but also establish a 4-point lead. Such a shift typically requires a major catalyzing event. The research indicating widespread disillusionment and that 36% of voters are 'considering' Reform suggests the potential for volatility is high. However, converting potential support into a decisive lead in a poll-of-polls within eight weeks is an exceptionally high bar. The noted emergence of 'five party politics' could also fragment the opposition, making it harder for any one party to build a substantial lead. My probability is not lower because the political environment is clearly unstable, and a major government failure could trigger the rapid realignment required. My probability is not higher because, absent a significant political shock, the status quo is overwhelmingly likely to hold over such a short period; poll averages change slowly. I would increase the probability if multiple polls in May showed Reform consistently surging past 25% while Labour's support fell below 30%. I would decrease the probability if polling trends stabilize.",

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
