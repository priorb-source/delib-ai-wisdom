  "information": "Public sentiment in Greenland shows strong support for the principle of independence, with various polls indicating approval from over 80% of the population. However, opinions on the timing vary, with many favoring a more gradual approach. A January 2025 survey revealed that while 84% support independence, 45% of supporters would reconsider if it meant a decline in living standards. The debate over independence has been recently intensified by comments from former U.S. President Donald Trump about acquiring the island, which also prompted a solidarity visit from Danish King Frederik X in late April 2025 and a visit from a U.S. private sector delegation exploring investment opportunities.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Approximately 2 months, until July 1, 2025.",
    "status_quo_outcome": "The government of Greenland, led by the gradualist Inuit Ataqatigiit party, will continue to focus on building economic self-sufficiency and will not announce a date for an independence referendum within the short timeframe.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "The ruling coalition prioritizes economic stability, mindful of polling that shows public support for independence is conditional on maintaining living standards. They continue negotiations with Denmark and explore foreign investment opportunities as part of their long-term, gradual path to independence, allowing the July 1, 2025 deadline to pass without scheduling a referendum.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Capitalizing on heightened nationalist sentiment following recent U.S. interest and Danish diplomatic visits, a more radical faction within Greenland's parliament or a key coalition partner pressures the government into making a bold move. To demonstrate its commitment to sovereignty and appease populist demands, the government unexpectedly announces a date for an independence referendum.",
    "rationale": "My forecast is based on the strong inertia of the status quo, which is the most reliable predictor over short timeframes. The ruling Inuit Ataqatigiit party won the recent election on a platform of gradual independence, signaling a cautious approach. The research data reinforces this, indicating that while a majority (84%) support independence in principle, nearly half of those supporters (45%) would reconsider if it led to economic decline. This economic reality serves as a powerful brake on any rapid moves towards a referendum, as the government is unlikely to risk a vote it could lose or 'win' only to face an economic crisis without the Danish block grant.\n\nMy probability is not lower than 15% because the political environment is unusually volatile. Recent high-level interest from the United States and Denmark has increased the salience of the sovereignty issue, creating a window for political actors to force the government's hand. An unexpected event, such as a concrete and highly favorable foreign investment proposal or a political misstep by Denmark, could act as a catalyst, overcoming the government's natural caution.\n\nMy probability is not higher than 15% because the fundamental obstacles remain significant and the timeframe is very short. Announcing a referendum is a major political act that requires consensus and planning, which is difficult to achieve in under two months, especially for a government that favors a deliberate pace. The economic dependency on Denmark is the core issue, and this has not changed.\n\nI would increase my forecast if there were credible reports of a rift within the ruling coalition on the timing of a referendum, or if a major economic deal was announced that could plausibly replace Danish subsidies. I would decrease my forecast if Greenland's leaders issued a definitive statement postponing any referendum discussions until after 2025.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nBefore July 1, 2025, will the government of Greenland officially announce a date for an independence referendum?\n\nQuestion background:\nReuters: [Greenland's independence gradualists win election amid Trump control pledge](https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/greenland-election-tests-independence-ambitions-us-interest-looms-2025-03-11/)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if, before July 1, 2025, a referendum on the independence of Greenland from the Denmark is officially scheduled. If this does not occur before that date, this question resolves as **No**.\n\nFor purposes of this question, the referendum will be considered \"officially scheduled\" when it is announced by a person or entity with the authority to do so within Greenland. Please note that broader legality, such as it being overturned by the government of Denmark, will be considered irrelevant for this question.\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nPublic sentiment in Greenland shows strong support for the principle of independence, with various polls indicating approval from over 80% of the population.

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
