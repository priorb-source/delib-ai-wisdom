  "information": "Donald Trump has a history of attending high-profile sporting events. His recent UFC appearances include UFC 309 in November 2024 and UFC 314 on April 13, 2025. His attendance at UFC 314 was noted on his official public schedule. The time between UFC 314 in Miami and UFC 316 in Newark is less than two months. Some analyses of his past behavior suggest he rarely attends two UFC events in such close succession.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Roughly 1–2 months, until UFC 316 occurs (likely in early-to-mid June 2025).",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "As President, Trump’s schedule fills with official travel or a major event (e.g., an international summit or domestic policy initiative) the same weekend, and without a compelling headliner he opts not to attend another UFC so soon after UFC 314.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Because Newark is close to his usual travel orbit (D.C./NY area) and if UFC 316 has a marquee headliner or an ally on the card, Trump accepts Dana White’s invitation and makes a brief in-venue appearance for optics and base energizing.",
    "rationale": "Base rates favor No for any specific UFC PPV: there are ~12 numbered PPVs per year and Trump typically attends only a small subset. Recent behavior shows frequent UFC appearances (e.g., UFC 309 in Nov 2024 and UFC 314 on Apr 13, 2025), but attending two PPVs in close succession is still uncommon. The assistant notes he rarely does two UFC events so close together, which pushes the probability down. Countervailing factors push up: Newark is logistically easy from D.C./NY, security is proven workable (he attended UFC 314 as sitting President), and he and Dana White value the publicity. Without concrete signals (public schedule entries, Dana White teases, or credible reporting), the status quo is that he does not attend, and good forecasting practice weights that more heavily because the world changes slowly. Why not higher: No confirmed headliner or public hints yet; possible early-June Presidential obligations (e.g., international summits) often crowd the calendar. Why not lower: He has recently shown willingness to attend UFC as President, the venue is nearby, and UFC benefits from his presence. What would move me up: Credible reports or official schedule hints; Dana White publicly signaling attendance; a major star headlining (e.g., a blockbuster title fight) or a coordinated political-media push around the event. What would move me down: Confirmed schedule conflicts (overseas summit or major domestic event that weekend), security/optics concerns, or signs the UFC 316 card lacks marquee draw.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill Donald Trump attend UFC 316?\n\nQuestion background:\nNew York Times: [Trump and Some of His Cabinet Members Attend U.F.C.

These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if President Donald Trump is anywhere within the grounds of the venue where [UFC 316](https://www.ufc.com/event/ufc-316) takes place. Otherwise this resolves as **No**.\n\n\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nDonald Trump has a history of attending high-profile sporting events.

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
