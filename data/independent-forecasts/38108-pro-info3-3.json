  "information": "Multiple external analyses and news reports have questioned the accuracy of DOGE's savings claims. A report by watchdog group Open The Books found that only 42% of the terminated contracts and 27% of the grants cited by DOGE could be publicly tracked. Media investigations, including one by The New York Times, have alleged numerous errors in DOGE's accounting, such as double-counting, including contracts that had already expired, and taking credit for 'zombie contracts' that never existed. An estimate by The Atlantic suggested actual verified savings may only amount to $2 billion. Furthermore, a CNN analysis projected that the effort could ultimately cost the government $135 billion due to the expense of retraining and rehiring workers who were let go.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "31 days",
    "status_quo_outcome": "The Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) will continue to post large, politically-motivated savings figures on its website, largely ignoring external criticism regarding the validity of its accounting methods.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Intense public and political pressure, possibly driven by new damaging reports from watchdog groups or major media outlets, forces DOGE to moderate its claims to maintain a semblance of credibility, resulting in a total stated savings of less than $200 billion by the deadline.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Driven by political incentives to demonstrate massive success, DOGE leadership uses its control over the reporting methodology to ensure the claimed savings figure on its website meets or exceeds the $200 billion psychological threshold by July 1, 2025, regardless of external validation.",
    "rationale": "My forecast is based primarily on the resolution criteria, which hinge on the figure DOGE *claims* on its website, not on any externally verified or actual savings. The research provided indicates a significant and well-documented disconnect between DOGE's claims and reality, citing double-counting, 'zombie contracts,' and massive discrepancies found by watchdog groups. This suggests that the number on doge.gov is a political communication tool rather than a fiscal accounting figure. The department's political backers have a strong incentive to report a headline-grabbing number, and $200 billion is a powerful, round figure. The existing criticism from the NYT and CNN, while damaging to the department's credibility, is unlikely to force a change in a purely political metric in the short term; in fact, it may cause the department to double down. Therefore, the path of least resistance for DOGE is to continue its aggressive accounting and announce it has hit its target.\n\nMy probability is not higher because the scale of the criticism is substantial and bipartisan scrutiny could increase. A high-profile scandal or a key political supporter withdrawing their endorsement could force the department to publish a more conservative (though likely still inflated) number to mitigate political damage. The forecast is not lower because DOGE has unilateral control over the website's content. The incentives to claim success are immense, and admitting their figures are inflated by posting a number below a major threshold like $200B would be a significant political defeat. I would raise my probability if DOGE or its high-profile supporters issue statements reaffirming their methods and hinting at larger future savings. I would lower it if a congressional committee with subpoena power were to launch a formal investigation into the claims before the resolution date.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill Doge claim a total savings of $200 billion or more on July 1, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nNY Post: [Tech guru admired by Elon Musk estimates ‘over $100 billion’ in taxpayer money is being wasted or stolen](https://nypost.com/2025/02/25/us-news/tech-guru-admired-by-elon-musk-estimates-over-100-billion-in-taxpayer-money-is-being-wasted-or-stolen/)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if the Department of Government Efficiency [claims](https://doge.gov/savings) a total estimated savings of greater than or equal to $200 billion when checked by Metaculus on or after July 1, 2025.\n\n\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nMultiple external analyses and news reports have questioned the accuracy of DOGE's savings claims.

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
