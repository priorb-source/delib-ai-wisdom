    "review": "All three forecasters, including myself, agree on the core assessment: the probability of a North American country receiving a CDC yellow fever advisory by June 1, 2025, is low. Our shared reasoning is based on the strong status quo, the short five-week timeframe, and the multi-step process required for an advisory to be issued (introduction, local transmission, detection, and official notice). Forecaster 2 correctly identified Panama as the most likely pathway for spread from the outbreak in Colombia. Forecaster 3 provided the most impactful new piece of evidence, which I had not considered: specific and highly effective public health measures already in place. Specifically, Panama's vaccination coverage of over 95% in high-risk border zones and Costa Rica's vaccine mandate for travelers from affected regions. This evidence is highly convincing. These are not just general public health capacities; they are targeted, proactive barriers directly addressing the primary risk pathway. My initial forecast now seems too high because it did not account for the robustness of these specific defenses.",
    "rationale": "My initial forecast of 8% was primarily driven by the severity of the South American outbreak reported by PAHO. However, after reviewing the other forecasters' analyses, I am revising my forecast downward. The key piece of new information, raised by Forecaster 3, is the existence of specific, strong public health countermeasures in the most at-risk countries. Panama's reported vaccination rate of over 95% in high-risk zones near the Colombian border is a formidable barrier to the virus establishing local transmission. This, combined with measures like Costa Rica's traveler vaccine mandates, significantly reduces the probability of the virus spreading northward, establishing an outbreak, and being detected in time to trigger a CDC advisory within the very short five-week window. The chain of events required for a 'Yes' outcome is not just unlikely due to timing, but it is also actively being defended against by proven methods. I am therefore lowering my forecast from 8% to 3%. The probability remains above zero to account for the unpredictable nature of outbreaks and the possibility that an imported case could bypass these measures and find a susceptible pocket of the population, but the new evidence strongly suggests this is a very low-probability event.",
