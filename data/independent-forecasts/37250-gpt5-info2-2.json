  "information": "The Trump administration has publicly resisted the court orders. President Trump stated the case is 'in the hands of lawyers' but also claimed he 'could' have Garcia returned with a single phone call but would not, citing alleged MS-13 gang affiliations. The Department of Homeland Security acknowledged the initial deportation was an 'administrative mistake'. Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem stated that if Garcia were to return to the U.S., he would be immediately deported again.",

    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "About 61 days (until July 1, 2025)",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "The administration continues to resist existing court orders and seeks/maintains stays on any mandate to facilitate his physical return; litigation and contempt threats do not resolve before July 1. Garcia does not clandestinely re-enter the U.S. in a way that credible sources confirm.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "A court issues (and leaves in force) a clear, enforceable order compelling DHS to physically return/parole Garcia into U.S. territory before July 1, or Garcia manages to enter the U.S. (lawfully or unlawfully) and credible reporting confirms his presence (e.g., apprehension inside the U.S. or processing at a port of entry).",
    "rationale": "- Baseline/status quo: The administration is publicly resisting court orders, per the research assistant. President Trump has said he will not have Garcia returned despite claiming he could. DHS acknowledged an “administrative mistake,” yet the DHS Secretary reportedly stated that if Garcia returned, he would be immediately deported again. This signals strong executive-branch resistance to facilitating his presence on U.S. soil.\n- Timeline: Only about two months remain. Even if courts are moving, securing a non-stayed, enforceable order compelling physical return, and then executing logistics for return, is difficult on this time horizon when the executive branch is resisting. Appeals and stays are common in immigration litigation, especially on high-profile cases.\n- Paths to Yes: (1) Court compels immediate return without a stay and the administration complies; (2) Garcia independently re-enters and is confirmed by credible reporting (e.g., apprehension). Path (1) is possible but faces governmental resistance and likely stays; path (2) is low-probability given his high profile and the risks/logistics of re-entry.\n- Why not higher: The combination of explicit presidential opposition, DHS posture, and limited time strongly favors no physical return by July 1. Courts can threaten contempt, but extracting compliance within weeks is uncertain, and the government can often obtain temporary stays pending appeal.\n- Why not lower: DHS called the deportation an “administrative mistake,” which marginally increases the chance some judicial or executive correction occurs. Also, a small but non-zero chance exists of an unexpected legal breakthrough or an unplanned entry that credible sources verify.\n- What would move me up: A new court order expressly mandating physical return with no stay granted; public indications that DHS is arranging transport/parole; credible reports of imminent travel or coordination with U.S. officials; bipartisan political pressure signaling imminent compliance.\n- What would move me down: Confirmation of an appellate stay that will run past July 1; signals that the administration will defy orders without consequence in the short term; credible reporting that Garcia remains in his home country with no movement toward re-entry.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill Kilmar Abrego Garcia return to the United States before July 1, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nWikipedia: [Deportation of Kilmar Abrego Garcia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deportation_of_Kilmar_Abrego_Garcia)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if Kilmar Abrego Garcia after the launch of this question and before July 1, 2025 enters territory of the United States according to [credible sources](https://www.metaculus.com/help/faq/#definitions).\n\nSubsequently leaving the United States, such as a deportation, will not cause this question to re-resolve.\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nThe Trump administration has publicly resisted the court orders.

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
