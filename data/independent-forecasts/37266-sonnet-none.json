    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Approximately 2 months (from May 2, 2025 to July 1, 2025)",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No - Mozambique does not receive a Level 4 travel advisory",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "The protests in Mozambique either de-escalate or remain at manageable levels. The security situation stabilizes or improves. The US State Department maintains Mozambique at its current advisory level (likely Level 2 or 3), determining that while caution is warranted, the situation does not warrant a complete 'Do Not Travel' designation.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Civil unrest in Mozambique dramatically escalates with widespread violence, potential government crackdowns causing significant casualties, breakdown of law and order, or emergence of armed conflict. The deteriorating security situation becomes severe enough that the US State Department determines US citizens face imminent danger throughout the country and issues a Level 4 advisory.",
    "rationale": "Level 4 'Do Not Travel' advisories are extremely rare and reserved for the most dangerous situations globally - typically active war zones, countries with pervasive terrorism, or complete breakdowns of civil order. Currently, only about 10-20 countries worldwide hold this designation (places like Afghanistan, Syria, Yemen, Somalia). The referenced article indicates protests and travel advisories in Mozambique, but protests alone rarely trigger Level 4 status unless they evolve into extreme, widespread violence. The base rate argument strongly favors 'No' - the vast majority of countries experiencing civil unrest do not reach Level 4 status. With only 2 months until resolution, there's limited time for the dramatic escalation required. While political instability can escalate quickly and the mention of travel advisories suggests elevated concern, the status quo bias is powerful here - most situations don't deteriorate to worst-case scenarios. My forecast would increase significantly if reports emerged of: mass casualties, evacuation orders for US citizens, armed conflict, or State Department language indicating imminent Level 4 consideration. My forecast would decrease with: protest de-escalation, political dialogue, government stabilization measures, or improved security assessments. The probability reflects the low base rate of Level 4 advisories, strong status quo bias, but acknowledges the existing instability creates non-negligible risk within the timeframe.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill Mozambique receive a \"Level 4 – Do Not Travel\" travel advisory from the US State Department before July 1, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nMSN: [ATTA issues travel advisory for Mozambique amid protests](https://www.msn.com/en-za/travel/travel-preparation/atta-issues-travel-advisory-for-mozambique-amid-protests/ar-AA1wHavB?ocid=BingNewsVerp)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if the country of Mozambique has received a Level 4 [travel advisory](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/International-Travel-Country-Information-Pages/Mozambique.html) from the US Department of State before July 1, 2025.\n\n\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nNo additional information available.\n\nToday is 2025-05-02.\n\nBefore answering you think:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n(e) You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
