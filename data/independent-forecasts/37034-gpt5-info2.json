  "information": "As of late April 2025, West Texas Intermediate (WTI) oil prices were around $64-$65 per barrel, after the American Petroleum Institute reported a decrease of 4.565 million barrels in U.S. crude oil inventories for the week ending April 18. This price is near the breakeven point for many drilling operations, which is estimated to be around $65 per barrel. A Dallas Fed survey of 130 energy firms in Texas, New Mexico, and Louisiana indicated that firms are dealing with increased costs, reduced rig counts, and layoffs. The survey's company outlook index decreased by 12 points, while the outlook uncertainty index increased by 21 points, with executives citing tariffs on steel (25%) as increasing costs for casing and tubing.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "About 5.5 weeks (until the Baker Hughes report for the week ending Friday, May 30, 2025; fallback resolution window runs to June 1, 2025 ET)",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No — recent US total rig counts have been roughly around 600 (±10) in April 2025, so staying at/above 583 is the default without a sizable, sustained drop.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "WTI stabilizes or rebounds toward $70+, producers keep activity flat-to-down only marginally, and weekly Baker Hughes prints show small changes (e.g., -1 to -3 rigs/week), leaving the US total near the high-590s to low-600s by May 30.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "WTI lingers in the mid-60s or dips further, gas prices remain weak, and operators accelerate cuts (especially gas-focused and higher-cost plays), yielding a cumulative ~15–25 rig decline over the next 5–6 weeks that pushes the total below 583 by May 30.",
    "rationale": "Baseline and recent history: Since mid-2023, the US rig count has mostly hovered around 600–620. A print below 583 would be a fresh low relative to much of the last year, implying a nontrivial but not base-case move given only ~5–6 weeks left. Weekly changes are typically small (single digits), so the base-rate move over this horizon is modest.\nCurrent conditions and trend: As of late April 2025, WTI is around $64–65/bbl—near breakeven for many—and sentiment from the Dallas Fed energy survey points to cost pressure (e.g., steel tariffs raising casing/tubing costs), reduced rig counts, and rising uncertainty. These push in the direction of slower activity and further gradual declines. Gas-focused activity remains more vulnerable if Henry Hub stays weak.\nTime constraint: To resolve Yes, we likely need either (a) a starting point already near the upper-580s or (b) an unusually brisk pace of declines (e.g., averaging around -3 to -5 rigs per week) from roughly ~600 to get sub-583 by May 30. That’s possible but requires the unfavorable conditions to persist and translate into actual weekly cuts quickly.\nWhy not higher: The survey evidence, cost pressures, and mid-60s oil create real downside risk; if the next couple of Baker Hughes prints are negative, the path to <583 becomes plausible within the remaining weeks.\nWhy not lower: The status quo is still near ~600, and declines are usually incremental. Dropping to <583 would likely require a multi-week string of larger-than-average net declines or a notable market shock (e.g., WTI < $60 sustained). With limited time, inertia favors staying above the threshold.\nWhat would move my forecast up: Two consecutive weekly prints showing larger declines (e.g., -5 to -10 rigs each), fresh guidance/capex cuts from major shale operators, WTI dipping and holding below ~$60, or continued gas price weakness prompting additional gas rig idling.\nWhat would move my forecast down: A WTI rebound to >$70, stabilization or upticks in weekly rig counts, or signals that operators are maintaining/layering rigs in the Permian despite cost pressure.\nRA summary used: WTI ~$64–65, inventory draw noted, Dallas Fed survey shows worsening outlook and higher uncertainty with cost pressures (steel tariffs) contributing, plus reports of reduced rig counts and layoffs. These support a modestly bearish stance on rigs but not necessarily a rapid, deep drop within a few weeks.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill the number of active US drilling rigs be less than 583 for the week ending May 30, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nSeekingAlpha: [U.S. rig count falls for third straight week, Baker Hughes says](https://seekingalpha.com/news/4430543-u-s-rig-count-falls-for-third-straight-week-baker-hughes-says)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if the last count of active US drilling rigs for the week ending May 30, 2025, according to the [Baker Hughes North America Rig Count](https://rigcount.bakerhughes.com/na-rig-count), is less than 583. Specifically, it will resolve based on the number listed as the United States Total for the most recent week in the May 30, 2025 North America Rig Count Report. This is the number of active drilling rigs and includes the total of those classified as gas, oil and miscellaneous, in every US location including inland waters, land and offshore.\n\nIf no report dated May 30, 2025, is released before June 1, 2025, Eastern Time, Metaculus may resolve this question using the most recent report available dated between May 23, 2025, and June 1, 2025, inclusive. If no such report exists, this question will be annulled.\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nAs of late April 2025, West Texas Intermediate (WTI) oil prices were around $64-$65 per barrel, after the American Petroleum Institute reported a decrease of 4.565 million barrels in U.S. crude oil inventories for the week ending April 18.

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any).
