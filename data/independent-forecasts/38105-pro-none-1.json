    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Approximately 1 month.",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No agreement is announced. Lebanon's government continues to fail to implement the reforms required to unlock IMF funds, and the multi-year deadlock persists.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Lebanon's fragmented political elite fails to agree on and legislate the prior actions demanded by the IMF, such as banking sector restructuring, capital controls, and fiscal reforms. The deadline of July 1, 2025, passes without a deal being finalized, as the political inertia that has characterized the crisis for years continues.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Facing a catastrophic acceleration of the economic collapse and intense international pressure, a coalition of political actors pushes through an emergency legislative package in June 2025. This package meets the minimum threshold of the IMF's requirements, allowing the IMF Executive Board to approve and announce an official agreement just before the deadline.",
    "rationale": "My forecast is based heavily on the persistent status quo. Lebanon and the IMF reached a Staff-Level Agreement (SLA) in April 2022, but Lebanon's political establishment has failed to implement the required reforms for over three years. These reforms are structurally complex and politically divisive. With only one month remaining until the deadline, the window to overcome years of legislative deadlock and pass contentious laws on issues like banking restructuring and capital controls is exceptionally narrow. The provided article, which is over a year old, contains optimistic statements from a government official, but such rhetoric has not historically been followed by concrete action. There is no new intelligence suggesting this pattern has changed. The probability is not lower because the severity of Lebanon's crisis always allows for a small chance of a last-minute, desperation-driven deal. The probability is not higher due to the extremely short timeline and the deep-seated political resistance to the necessary reforms. For me to increase my forecast, I would need to see concrete legislative progress, such as one of the key reform bills being passed by parliament.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill the IMF and Lebanon announce an agreement before July 1, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\n[Lebanon finance minister confident of a new deal with IMF to help crumbling economy](https://www.newarab.com/news/lebanon-finance-minister-confident-new-deal-imf)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if Lebanon and the International Monetary Fund announce any economic agreement between the two entities signed after the launch of this question and before July 1, 2025. In order to count, it must involve the IMF agreeing to provide money to Lebanon, whether through loans, grants, or any other means.\n\n\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nNo additional information available.\n\nToday is 2025-05-30.\n\nBefore answering you think:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n(e) You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
