  "information": "Egypt has a recent history of hosting major international sporting events. In April 2025, the country hosted the World Karate Premier League in Cairo, which involved 384 players from 67 countries. In May 2025, Egypt hosted the Pharaohs' Championship for Rhythmic Gymnastics with 18 participating countries, the African Championship for Rhythmic Gymnastics with 8 participating countries, and the 25th World Military Equestrian Championship with 20 participating nations. Egypt is also scheduled to host the Senior World Karate Championships (an event of the separate World Karate Federation) in November 2025.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "About 53 days (until end of June 30, 2025)",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No announcement by the International Traditional Karate Federation before July 1, 2025",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Talks between Egypt and ITKF continue but the Executive Board defers a decision (or public announcement) to a later congress in late 2025; or another host is selected but ITKF plans to announce after July 1; or Egypt is tentatively chosen but ITKF waits to finalize contracts and does not issue an official statement in time.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Following the ITKF President’s visit and negotiations, the ITKF Executive Board approves Egypt for 2026 in May/June and ITKF publishes an official announcement on its website or official channels before July 1, 2025.",
    "rationale": "- Time/decision process: There are only ~7 weeks left. Federations often announce hosts 12–24 months out, so a mid-2025 announcement for a 2026 event is plausible. However, absent a current ITKF announcement and given that the recent news is only of discussions, the status quo favors “no announcement yet” by July 1.\n- Evidence for higher chance: Egypt’s recent record of hosting multi-sport events and karate events (including WKF’s Senior World Championships in Nov 2025) shows strong capacity and government backing. A high-profile meeting between Egypt’s sports minister and the ITKF President suggests active negotiations that could culminate quickly.\n- Evidence limiting the chance: The WKF and ITKF are different bodies; hosting WKF 2025 doesn’t guarantee ITKF 2026. The question requires an official ITKF announcement (not just Egyptian media), which raises the bar. With limited time left, even if Egypt is selected, ITKF may delay public confirmation for procedural or contractual reasons.\n- Why not higher: Lack of a current ITKF confirmation, unclear timing of ITKF board/council decisions before July, and the frequent lag between selection and formal announcement.\n- Why not lower: Clear interest from ITKF leadership and Egypt’s demonstrated hosting capability make a near-term decision possible; smaller federations sometimes move faster.\n- What would update me upward: Any ITKF notice of an upcoming Executive Board meeting or congress before July; ITKF statements calling Egypt a preferred or provisional host; joint ITKF–Egypt MOU with timing hints; credible leaks from ITKF officials.\n- What would update me downward: Signals that ITKF will decide at a later 2025 congress; reports of another country bidding with advanced preparations; silence from ITKF channels through mid-June.",

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
