    "review": "Both forecasters provide critical new information that significantly strengthens the case for a NO outcome. Forecaster 2 documents concrete House opposition: HB 46 passed 118-16 to expand medical cannabis, and the House previously diluted a Senate ban attempt into regulatory measures. This is hard evidence of overwhelming House resistance, not just speculation about political headwinds. Forecaster 3 provides valuable procedural details - SB 3 passed the Senate 25-6 on May 7 and is currently in House State Affairs Committee, and the governor has 20 days post-adjournment to sign (extending into mid-June). However, Forecaster 3's 32% forecast appears to underweight the House opposition that Forecaster 2 documented. The 118-16 House vote is a massive supermajority against restricting cannabis access, and the House's track record of diluting Senate bans suggests institutional resistance rather than just timing issues. Forecaster 2's emphasis on the House as the critical bottleneck, backed by recent voting data, is compelling. The $8 billion hemp industry opposition with Agriculture Commissioner support adds another layer of difficulty. While Forecaster 3 is correct that a procedural path exists and that late-session deals occasionally happen, the concrete evidence of House sentiment suggests such a deal is highly improbable.",
    "rationale": "After reviewing both forecasters' analyses, I need to downward adjust my initial 8% forecast. The most significant new information is the documented House opposition through actual legislative votes. The 118-16 vote on HB 46 to expand medical cannabis access represents overwhelming bipartisan opposition to restricting THC, and the House's previous dilution of a Senate ban bill shows this isn't just about timing but about fundamental policy disagreement between chambers. My initial analysis correctly identified short timelines, lack of explicit Abbott support, and public opposition as key factors, but I underestimated the strength of House institutional resistance. The Senate's 25-6 passage of SB 3 and Lt. Gov. Patrick's strong advocacy show real political will from powerful actors, which keeps the probability above near-zero. The extended signing window through mid-June that Forecaster 3 identified means there is technically time for last-minute deals. However, bridging a 118-16 House vote in favor of expansion to passing a comprehensive ban would require an extraordinary reversal. The House appears to be not just passively resistant but actively moving in the opposite direction. I'm updating down to 6% - acknowledging the concrete evidence of House opposition while maintaining a small probability for unexpected end-of-session compromises or procedural maneuvers that occasionally override earlier positions.",
