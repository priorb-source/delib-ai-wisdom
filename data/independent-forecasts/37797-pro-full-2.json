  "information": "Following its plenary meeting in Paris from February 17-21, 2025, the Financial Action Task Force (FATF) announced no changes to its 'black list' of High-Risk Jurisdictions subject to a Call for Action, which continues to include North Korea, Iran, and Myanmar. During the same plenary, Laos and Nepal were added to the 'grey list' of jurisdictions under increased monitoring, while the Philippines was removed. The FATF also maintained the suspension of Russia's membership, which has been in place since February 2023, without adding the country to either the grey or black lists.\n\nIn February 2025, South Africa's National Treasury reported that the country had addressed or largely addressed 20 of its 22 FATF action items, with the remaining two expected to be resolved by June 2025. The goal is to facilitate an exit from the grey list by October 2025. In West Africa, a May 2025 meeting of the GIABA Ministerial Committee noted that Senegal had exited the FATF grey list in October 2024. However, four other regional members—Nigeria, Mali, Burkina Faso, and Côte d'Ivoire—remain on the grey list, with Nigeria's government stating an aim to be removed by the end of May 2025.\n\nIndian government officials announced in May 2025 their intention to submit fresh intelligence to the FATF concerning terrorist infrastructure operating within Pakistan. This development follows Pakistan's removal from the FATF Grey List in October 2022. At the time of its removal, the FATF noted that Pakistan should continue working with the Asia Pacific Group (APG) to improve its anti-money laundering and counter-terrorism financing systems. Separately, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) has also recently advised Pakistan to enhance its AML/CFT effectiveness.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Approximately one month. The outcome will be known following the FATF Plenary in June 2025.",
    "status_quo_outcome": "The FATF 'black list' (High-Risk Jurisdictions subject to a Call for Action) remains unchanged, with North Korea, Iran, and Myanmar as the sole members.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "The FATF concludes its June 2025 Plenary, and its public statement confirms that the list of 'High-Risk Jurisdictions subject to a Call for Action' continues to consist solely of North Korea, Iran, and Myanmar.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Following its June 2025 Plenary, the FATF announces a change to its 'black list', either by adding a new jurisdiction or removing an existing one. Any change, addition or removal, would resolve the question as Yes.",
    "rationale": "My forecast is based on the significant inertia and high threshold for changes to the FATF black list. Changes are rare, and the list has been stable. The February 2025 plenary, which resulted in no changes to the black list, reinforces this LNU (Last known update) pattern.\n\nRegarding the current members:\n1.  **North Korea:** Has long-standing, severe deficiencies in its anti-money laundering and counter-terrorism financing (AML/CFT) regime tied to its weapons programs. There is no indication of any progress that would warrant its removal.\n2.  **Iran:** Was re-added in February 2020. Given the current geopolitical tensions, its removal is highly improbable.\n3.  **Myanmar:** Was added in October 2022 following the military coup. The internal political and security situation has not improved, making its removal extremely unlikely.\n\nRegarding potential additions:\n1.  **Russia:** While its FATF membership remains suspended, the organization has refrained from adding it to the black or grey lists. Such a move would require a strong consensus among member states, which may be difficult to obtain, and would represent a significant escalation in financial pressure. While it remains a possibility due to the ongoing conflict in Ukraine, the lack of action over the past two years suggests the bar for this is very high.\n2.  **Grey-listed Countries:** Movement from the 'grey list' to the 'black list' is uncommon and would signal a complete breakdown in cooperation. The countries mentioned in the report (e.g., in West Africa) are engaged in remediation plans. Pakistan, despite new intelligence being submitted by India, was removed from the grey list in 2022, and a direct move to the black list would be an unprecedented step.\n\nThe most probable outcome is that the status quo will be maintained. The world changes slowly, and international bodies like the FATF move deliberately. The probability is not lower than 10% to account for the small but non-zero chance of a geopolitical event prompting FATF to take drastic action, most likely concerning Russia. The probability is not higher because there is no clear signal or precursor event suggesting any of the current black-listed countries are close to being removed, nor that a consensus is forming to add a new jurisdiction. For my forecast to move towards 'Yes', I would need to see credible intelligence of a major consensus shift among G7 members to blacklist Russia or another state. Conversely, my confidence in 'No' would increase if pre-plenary statements focus on technical matters with no mention of country-specific escalations.",

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any).
