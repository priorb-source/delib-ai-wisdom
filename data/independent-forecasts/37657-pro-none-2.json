    "status_quo_outcome": "No. As of today, there are no known or reported human cases of HKU5-CoV-2.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "The virus fails to jump from its animal reservoir to humans, or a sporadic case occurs but is not detected, identified, and officially reported by a credible public health organization before the July 1, 2025 deadline.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "A person, likely in China, becomes infected with HKU5-CoV-2 through contact with the host species (pipistrelle bats) or an intermediate animal. The infection is successfully diagnosed and the case is confirmed and reported by the WHO, CDC, or a similar credible source before July 1, 2025.",
    "rationale": "My forecast is heavily weighted towards the status quo, which is no human cases. The primary reason for the low probability is the extremely short timeframe of approximately six weeks. For the question to resolve 'Yes', a chain of unlikely events must occur in rapid succession: a zoonotic spillover event, the infected person developing detectable symptoms, successful laboratory identification of a novel virus, and official reporting by a credible international body. The discovery of new animal viruses is common; the successful jump to humans which is then detected is rare for any specific virus. The research assistant's report provided no additional information, so my forecast relies on this low base rate. \n\nWhy the forecast is not lower: The possibility of zoonotic spillover is never zero, particularly for coronaviruses in known hotspots. The virus is a merbecovirus, the same group as MERS-CoV, which has a history of infecting humans. Therefore, a human infection is theoretically possible.\n\nWhy the forecast is not higher: The short deadline is the main limiting factor. The entire detection and reporting process for a single novel case is highly unlikely to be completed within six weeks. Thousands of viruses exist in animal reservoirs, and the vast majority never cause a reported human case.\n\nI would increase my forecast if there were credible reports of unusual respiratory illness clusters in regions where the host bat species is prevalent.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill there be any human cases of the novel coronavirus, HKU5-CoV-2, before July 1, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\n[Discovery of HKU5-CoV-2, a Novel Coronavirus in China](https://assure-test.com/discovery-of-hku5-cov-2-a-novel-coronavirus-in-china/)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if before July 1, 2025, there are any human cases reported anywhere globally of HKU5-CoV-2.\n\nQuestion resolves according to [credible sources](https://www.metaculus.com/help/faq/#definitions), especially the World Health Organization or US Centers for Disease Control.\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nNo additional information available.\n\nToday is 2025-05-16.\n\nBefore answering you think:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n(e) You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
