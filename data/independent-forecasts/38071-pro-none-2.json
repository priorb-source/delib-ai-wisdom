    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Approximately 3 weeks. The primary is scheduled for June 17, 2025.",
    "status_quo_outcome": "A highly competitive primary with no declared frontrunner. Several candidates, notably State Senator Aaron Rouse and 2021 LG nominee Hala Ayala, are vying for the nomination, making the outcome highly uncertain.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Hala Ayala leverages her superior statewide name recognition from her 2021 campaign and her political base in vote-rich Northern Virginia. She consolidates support from establishment figures and voters familiar with her, edging out Rouse and other candidates in a crowded field.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Aaron Rouse successfully capitalizes on the significant momentum from his critical 2023 special election victory. He crafts a compelling narrative as a fresh face with a proven ability to win in a competitive district, building a strong coalition that starts in his Hampton Roads base and expands statewide to secure the nomination.",
    "rationale": "This forecast is based on the analysis of a competitive primary field with limited public data, as noted by the research assistant's report of no additional information. The primary contest for the Democratic nomination for Lieutenant Governor appears to be principally between State Senator Aaron Rouse and former Delegate Hala Ayala. My probability of 45% reflects a very tight race where Rouse is a strong contender but faces a slight structural disadvantage.\n\nThe case for Aaron Rouse winning (a 'Yes' outcome) rests on his significant political momentum. His victory in the 2023 State Senate special election was pivotal for Virginia Democrats, giving him a powerful narrative of electability and a 'winner' profile. This victory in a swing district (Virginia Beach) is a potent argument in a primary. His background as a former NFL player also gives him a unique and recognizable profile.\n\nThe primary reason the forecast is not higher is the formidable candidacy of Hala Ayala. As the 2021 nominee for this same office, she possesses statewide name recognition that Rouse likely cannot match. This is a significant advantage in a lower-information, down-ballot primary. Her political base in the Democratic stronghold of Northern Virginia is also a major asset. The presence of a multi-candidate field could further benefit the best-known candidate, which is likely Ayala.\n\nThe reason the forecast is not lower is that Rouse's momentum and narrative are genuinely strong. There may be an appetite among primary voters for a new face after the Democratic ticket's losses in 2021. Rouse's 2023 victory provides a clear contrast and a feeling of forward progress.\n\nI would update my forecast upwards for Rouse upon seeing major endorsements from figures like Senators Warner or Kaine, strong fundraising numbers that outpace Ayala's, or reliable polling showing him with a consistent lead. Conversely, I would update my forecast downwards if Ayala secures those endorsements, outraises Rouse significantly, or establishes a clear lead in polling.",
