    "review": "Forecaster 2 and Forecaster 3 present a critical factual disagreement that fundamentally changes the question interpretation. Forecaster 2 claims Niger already has Level 4 status since the July 2023 coup, making this about reissuance during periodic reviews (65% forecast). Forecaster 3 states Niger is currently Level 3 overall with specific border areas at Level 4, making this about a substantive upgrade (27% forecast). This factual disagreement is crucial and verifiable.\n\nForecaster 3's analysis appears more credible for several reasons: (1) The nuanced distinction between overall Level 3 with regional Level 4 warnings matches typical State Department patterns for Sahel countries with border insurgencies, (2) The detailed breakdown of what would constitute triggers for upgrade suggests familiarity with how these designations work, (3) If Niger were already country-wide Level 4, this would likely be more prominently featured in the question background.\n\nHowever, Forecaster 2 raises an important point I hadn't fully considered: periodic reviews do occur, and advisories can be updated within normal bureaucratic cycles, not just in response to crises. Even if Niger is Level 3, the combination of volatile security environment, post-coup instability, and potential U.S. force posture changes creates multiple pathways to Level 4 beyond just a single dramatic incident.\n\nForecaster 3's scenario analysis is thorough and aligns with my original reasoning about catalysts being necessary, but assigns slightly higher probability (27% vs my 20%) due to Niger's elevated risk profile and the tail risk of Sahel volatility.",
    "rationale": "After reviewing both analyses, I'm updating my reasoning to account for uncertainty about Niger's current advisory status and the insight about periodic reviews. If Niger is already Level 4 (Forecaster 2's claim), the probability of reissuance within 2 months would indeed be much higher. However, I find Forecaster 3's interpretation more plausible based on typical State Department practices for countries with regional but not nationwide crises.\n\nKey factors supporting an update upward from my original 20%: (1) Some probability that Niger already has Level 4 and just needs reissuance, (2) Periodic review cycles could occur within the 2-month window even without crisis triggers, (3) The post-coup environment and U.S. military withdrawal create genuine uncertainty about consular capacity and security, (4) Forecaster 3's more detailed analysis suggests 27% is appropriate for the upgrade scenario.\n\nKey factors preventing me from going higher: (1) More likely Niger is Level 3 overall currently, requiring a substantive upgrade rather than reissuance, (2) No evidence of imminent triggers or scheduled reviews, (3) Status quo bias remains strong for advisory changes, (4) The 2-month window is quite short for bureaucratic processes absent crisis.\n\nI'm increasing my forecast from 20% to 30% to reflect: the uncertainty about current status (small probability Forecaster 2 is correct), the valid point about periodic reviews, and alignment with Forecaster 3's more thorough analysis of the upgrade scenario.",
