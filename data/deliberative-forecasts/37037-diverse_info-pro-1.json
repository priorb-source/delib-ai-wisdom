    "review": "Forecaster 2 provides a compelling, structured analysis. Their key contribution is identifying specific and plausible pathways for a 'No' outcome that I had not fully appreciated: a policy adjustment to add Lesotho to the existing 'pause' granted to other countries, an LDC carve-out, or even data corrections. The evidence that the administration has already shown flexibility is a crucial point. Forecaster 3's analysis seems less convincing. Their forecast of 58% is primarily driven by uncertainty over whether the current tariff is *exactly* 50%, which seems to challenge the premise given in the background information rather than forecast the future state. Furthermore, they note a June SADC summit, which, if anything, should increase the probability of the tariff remaining in place until after June 1, yet their forecast is the lowest. I find Forecaster 2's reasoning much stronger and a valuable refinement of the initial problem.",
    "rationale": "My initial forecast of 85% was heavily weighted on bureaucratic and diplomatic inertia, given the extremely short timeline of just over five weeks. While I still believe this is the most powerful factor, the deliberation has convinced me to lower my confidence. Forecaster 2's analysis was particularly persuasive in highlighting that the administration has already demonstrated flexibility by implementing a 90-day pause for some countries. This establishes a precedent and a mechanism for a relatively swift policy change that doesn't require a complete overhaul of the new tariff regime. Adding Lesotho to this pause list, or creating a broader carve-out for Least Developed Countries (LDCs), are plausible actions that could be executed before the June 1 resolution date in response to diplomatic pressure and negative press. These specific scenarios represent a more significant risk to the status quo than I had initially calculated. Consequently, I am adjusting my forecast downward to reflect this increased potential for a policy reversal. I am not going as low as Forecaster 3, as I believe the short timeline remains the dominant variable, and the default outcome is still that the tariff schedule remains unchanged. The adjustment from 85% to 75% reflects the incorporation of these new, concrete pathways to a 'No' outcome.",
