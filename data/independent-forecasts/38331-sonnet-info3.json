  "information": "In early June 2025, the government of Tanzania blocked access to X. The country's information minister stated the ban was due to the platform hosting explicit sexual material, including pornographic and LGBTQ+ content, which he said was 'contrary to the East African state's laws, culture, customs, and traditions.' The move followed a recent change in X's policy to allow 'consensually produced and distributed' adult content. The Legal and Human Rights Centre (LHRC), a local rights group, described the action as part of a 'troubling pattern of digital repression' ahead of scheduled elections in October.",

    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Approximately 26 days until resolution on July 1, 2025",
    "status_quo_outcome": "Yes - all seven countries (China, Iran, Myanmar, North Korea, Russia, Turkmenistan, and Venezuela) remain listed as currently blocking X",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "At least one of the seven countries lifts its ban on X within the next 26 days, or Wikipedia editors determine through consensus that one or more countries should no longer be listed as 'currently' blocking access, possibly due to technical implementation changes, inconsistent enforcement, or updated information about the block's status",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "All seven countries maintain their existing blocks on X through the end of June 2025, with no policy reversals or significant changes to how Wikipedia editors categorize these restrictions. The status quo continues unchanged for the brief 26-day period",
    "rationale": "The status quo strongly favors a Yes outcome. These seven countries have maintained blocks on Twitter/X for extended periods - China since 2009, Russia since March 2022, and others for similarly long durations. These blocks are rooted in fundamental political and censorship policies of authoritarian or semi-authoritarian regimes that rarely reverse course quickly. The timeframe of just 26 days makes significant policy changes extremely unlikely. The research assistant's report about Tanzania blocking X in early June 2025 actually reinforces the trend of governments restricting rather than liberalizing access to the platform, though Tanzania is not among the seven countries being tracked. The question requires ALL seven countries to remain on the list for a Yes resolution, creating seven potential failure points. However, given the entrenched nature of censorship in China, Iran, North Korea, Russia, Turkmenistan, Myanmar, and Venezuela, and the brevity of the remaining time period, the probability of any single country reversing course is very low. The main risks to a Yes outcome are: (1) Wikipedia editorial disputes or reinterpretation of what counts as 'currently blocked', (2) unexpected geopolitical developments, or (3) technical verification issues. However, these remain edge cases. My forecast is not higher because Wikipedia can be unpredictable and there's inherent uncertainty in how editors maintain these lists. It's not lower because all indicators point to policy stability in authoritarian information controls over such a short timeframe",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nAt the end of June 2025, will Wikipedia still list all these countries as \"currently\" blocking access to X (formerly Twitter)?\n\nQuestion background:\nAccording to the resolution source, \"Censorship of Twitter refers to Internet censorship by governments that block access to Twitter (officially known as X since July 2023). Twitter censorship also includes governmental notice and take down requests to Twitter, which it enforces in accordance with its Terms of Service when a government or authority submits a valid removal request to Twitter indicating that specific content published on the platform is illegal in their jurisdiction.\"\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if Wikipedia still lists X (formerly known as Twitter) as currently blocked in China, Iran, Myanmar, North Korea, Russia, Turkmenistan and Venezuela at [this link](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Censorship_of_Twitter#Current) when accessed by Metaculus on or after July 1, 2025. If the Wikipedia article does not list X as currently being blocked in any of those countries, this question resolves as **No**.\n\nThe question will resolve as soon as the page is accessed by Metaculus Admins on the resolution date. However, if there are issues accessing the page, then resolution will wait up to July 7, 2025, at which point if Metaculus has still not been able to access the resolution source, this question will be **annulled**. Admins will also use their discretion if there appears to be an [edit war](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Edit_warring) or lack of Wikipedia [consensus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Consensus) and may annul the question in such a case; however, Admins will also strive to resolve the question as definitively Yes or No, and such an edge case should be considered a rare outcome.\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nIn early June 2025, the government of Tanzania blocked access to X. The country's information minister stated the ban was due to the platform hosting explicit sexual material, including pornographic and LGBTQ+ content, which he said was 'contrary to the East African state's laws, culture, customs, and traditions.'

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
