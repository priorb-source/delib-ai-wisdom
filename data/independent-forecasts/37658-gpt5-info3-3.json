  "information": "Several activist investors have taken positions in U.S. Steel. Third Point, a hedge fund, disclosed ownership of 12.2 million shares at the end of the first quarter of 2025, with its leader, Daniel Loeb, expressing optimism that the merger can be completed. Another firm, Toms Capital Investment Management, held 4.9 million shares during the same period. U.S. Steel's stock has been volatile, rising 2.5% on May 9, 2025, after reports of progress in merger talks. However, market analysis has noted the stock trading at $44 per share, a significant discount to Nippon Steel's $55 per share offer.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Approximately 46 days (until July 1, 2025)",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No — the deal remains pending (no SEC Form 8-K termination filed) by July 1, 2025.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Regulatory reviews (e.g., CFIUS) and stakeholder negotiations continue without a definitive decision. The parties signal willingness to keep working toward approvals and, if needed, extend timelines rather than terminate. No 8-K announcing termination or abandonment is filed before July 1.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "A clear regulatory block or insurmountable condition emerges (e.g., CFIUS indicates it will recommend prohibition, or the administration publicly signals opposition), or labor/mitigation terms prove unacceptable. The companies jointly (or one unilaterally, per the merger agreement) announce termination and file an 8-K before July 1.",
    "rationale": "Baseline/status quo: Deals typically drift rather than abruptly end; the most likely near-term path is continued review and negotiation, not a sudden 8-K termination within the next ~6 weeks. The market spread (US Steel at ~$44 vs the $55 offer) signals material risk and timing uncertainty, but not an imminent collapse. Reports of recent “progress in merger talks” and significant activist long positions (Third Point ~12.2m shares; Toms Capital ~4.9m shares) suggest informed investors see a viable path to completion or at least continued engagement rather than near-term abandonment.\nWhy not higher: A termination within 46 days generally requires a decisive external event (e.g., formal adverse CFIUS outcome or public, credible administration opposition). There’s no current indication of such an imminent trigger; instead, headlines point to ongoing talks and some progress. Japan is a close U.S. ally, making an outright national-security block less likely than for buyers from adversarial jurisdictions. Deals often extend rather than collapse when timelines slip.\nWhy not lower: The spread remains large (~$11), reflecting real political/regulatory risk (CFIUS review, labor concerns, broader industrial-policy optics). A shift in administration posture, union impasse, or unacceptable mitigation could still cause a quick pivot to termination. The binary nature of national-security reviews means updates can arrive abruptly.\nWhat would move me up: Credible reports of CFIUS staff recommending prohibition; a public signal from Treasury/White House opposing the transaction; DOJ/antitrust or labor developments that make conditions unacceptable; any disclosure of an imminent outside-date breach without willingness to extend. What would move me down: Announced CFIUS clearance (or acceptance of mitigation), a formal labor agreement/support, or authoritative reporting that the administration is comfortable with the deal proceeding.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill the US Steel/Nippon Steel merger collapse before July 1, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nWikipedia: [Proposed acquisition of U.S. Steel by Nippon Steel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proposed_acquisition_of_U.S._Steel_by_Nippon_Steel)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question will resolve as **Yes** if, before July 1, 2025, either U.S. Steel or Nippon Steel files an SEC Form 8-K announcing the merger agreement's termination or abandonment.\n\n\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nSeveral activist investors have taken positions in U.S. Steel.

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
