  "information": "Alberta Premier Danielle Smith has stated that her government will permit a citizen-led referendum on independence in 2026 if a public petition gathers sufficient signatures. Smith has personally said she does not support separation but believes the decision should be made by Albertans. To facilitate this process, her government introduced Bill 54, which lowers the threshold for initiating a referendum from 20% to 10% of eligible voters (approximately 177,000 signatures) and extends the time for collection from 90 to 120 days. The government also formed a panel called 'Alberta Next' to explore the province's autonomy and future relationship with the federal government.\n\nThe process for triggering a referendum requires a successful citizen petition. The petition must gather at least 177,000 signatures, which then must be officially verified by Elections Alberta before the government can formally schedule a vote. As of early May 2025, a group named 'Project for Alberta Prosperity' announced its intention to organize a signature collection campaign. Its president claimed they had already exceeded the required signature threshold, while other unverified reports mentioned 80,000 signatures being collected in 36 hours. However, no petition had been formally submitted or certified by Elections Alberta.\n\nThe discussion around a potential referendum occurs amid heightened tensions between Alberta and the federal government over energy policies, the carbon tax, and fiscal distribution, particularly following the re-election of the federal Liberal party. The proposal has faced opposition from within Alberta. Leaders of the Sturgeon Lake and Mikisew Cree Nations have publicly opposed an independence referendum, stating their treaties were with the Crown, not the province. The official provincial opposition, the New Democratic Party of Alberta, has accused Premier Smith of promoting separatism.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Less than two months, with a deadline of July 1, 2025.",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No referendum date is officially announced by the government of Alberta.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "The citizen-led petition does not get submitted, or if it is, the signature verification process by Elections Alberta is not completed before the deadline. Even if the petition is certified, the government uses the remaining time for deliberation and does not make an official announcement before July 1, 2025.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "The 'Project for Alberta Prosperity' formally submits a petition with a sufficient number of valid signatures in the immediate future. Elections Alberta, possibly under political pressure, completes the verification process with unprecedented speed. In response to the certified petition and heightened political tensions with the federal government, Premier Smith's government acts swiftly to officially announce a referendum date just before the July 1, 2025 deadline.",
    "rationale": "My forecast is heavily weighted towards a 'No' outcome primarily due to the extremely tight timeline. With less than two months until the deadline, the procedural steps required to trigger a referendum are a significant barrier. The process explicitly requires a citizen petition to be submitted and then officially verified by Elections Alberta. This verification process, which involves checking approximately 177,000 signatures against official records, is a meticulous and time-consuming bureaucratic task that is highly unlikely to be completed within this short window. While the pro-independence group claims to have gathered sufficient signatures, these claims are unverified, and the petition has not yet been formally submitted. The status quo is that no date is set, and overcoming the inertia of bureaucratic processes and political deliberation before July 1st is a formidable challenge. Premier Danielle Smith has also stated she does not personally support separation, suggesting she may not be motivated to rush the process, instead using the threat as political leverage against the federal government. My probability is not lower than 10% because the political environment is volatile. The Smith government has created the mechanism for a referendum and there is an active group organizing for it. An unexpected political event could create immense pressure to expedite the process, making a rapid announcement a low-probability but not impossible event. My probability is not higher because the logistical and bureaucratic hurdles are substantial and concrete, whereas the political drive for an immediate announcement is speculative. For me to update my forecast towards 'Yes', I would need to see an official announcement from Elections Alberta that they have received the petition and are beginning an expedited verification process. Conversely, as each week passes without the petition being formally submitted, my forecast will trend closer to 0%.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nBefore July 1, 2025, will the government of Alberta officially announce a date for an independence referendum?\n\nQuestion background:\nPolitico: [The quiet threat to Canadian unity isn’t Quebec — it’s Alberta](https://www.politico.com/news/2025/04/27/the-quiet-threat-to-canadian-unity-isnt-quebec-its-alberta-00311719)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if, before July 1, 2025, a referendum on the independence of Alberta from Canada is officially scheduled. If this does not occur before that date, this question resolves as **No**.\n\nFor purposes of this question, the referendum will be considered \"officially scheduled\" when it is announced by a person or entity with the authority to do so within Alberta. Please note that broader legality, such as within Canada, will be considered irrelevant for this question, so if the federal government declared the referendum illegal, the question would still resolve as Yes.\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nAlberta Premier Danielle Smith has stated that her government will permit a citizen-led referendum on independence in 2026 if a public petition gathers sufficient signatures.

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
