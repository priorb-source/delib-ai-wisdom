  "information": "The U.S. Department of State released the results for the Diversity Visa Program (DV-2026) lottery in early May 2025. Applicants can check their status online through the Entrant Status Check page until September 30, 2026. This followed the release of the DV-2025 results on May 3, 2025. The registration period for the DV-2026 lottery ran from October to November 2024. The program awards up to 55,000 permanent residence visas annually. The State Department has emphasized that the official website, dvprogram.state.gov, is the only channel for results.\n\nThe Diversity Visa program was established by the Immigration Act of 1990. The Trump administration, which began in January 2025, has previously expressed opposition to the program. The administration issued executive orders in January 2025 concerning Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion (DEI) related websites across federal agencies. In April 2025, a bill was introduced in the House of Representatives with the goal of terminating the statutory DV program.\n\nIn May 2025, the US Department of State imposed visa restrictions on Indian travel agency executives and staff who were found to have knowingly enabled unlawful entry into the US. In a separate action, the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) announced the termination of Temporary Protected Status (TPS) for Afghanistan, scheduled to take effect on July 14, 2025. Concurrently, a federal court issued a preliminary injunction that blocked a DHS attempt to terminate TPS for Venezuelan nationals.",

    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Approximately 6 weeks (from May 20, 2025 to July 1, 2025)",
    "status_quo_outcome": "YES - The page remains online. The Diversity Visa program is currently operating normally, with DV-2026 results released in early May 2025 and the registration page actively maintained as part of a congressionally-mandated program.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "The Trump administration takes executive action to remove the DV program registration page from the State Department website as part of broader immigration policy changes, potentially justified by the April 2025 House bill seeking to terminate the program or as part of broader federal website modifications. The page is taken down or redirected even while the underlying statute technically remains in place.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "The page remains online because the DV program is established by the Immigration Act of 1990 and cannot be eliminated by executive action alone. The program continues operating normally with DV-2026 results active until September 2026. The short 6-week timeframe and bureaucratic inertia prevent any major changes, and removing a congressionally-mandated program's webpage would face legal challenges. The page stays accessible for informational purposes as the DV-2027 registration period approaches in October 2025.",
    "rationale": "The status quo strongly favors YES. The Diversity Visa program is statutory (Immigration Act of 1990), not merely executive policy, and is currently operating normally with DV-2026 results just released in May 2025. The specific webpage in question provides essential instructions for a congressionally-mandated program. While the Trump administration has expressed opposition to the DV program (2017 tweet cited) and a House bill was introduced in April 2025 to terminate it, legislative changes require time that exceeds the 6-week window until July 1, 2025. The previous Trump administration (2017-2021) did not succeed in eliminating the program despite opposition. The January 2025 executive orders on DEI websites don't directly apply to an immigration program established by statute. The administration has shown willingness to take aggressive immigration actions (TPS terminations), but those actions have faced legal challenges (Venezuelan TPS injunction). The key risk is that the administration could remove the webpage as an administrative action separate from eliminating the program itself, though this would likely face legal challenges given the program's statutory basis. The very short timeframe and bureaucratic inertia strongly favor the status quo. I would update higher with evidence of continued normal operation in June or successful legal challenges blocking immigration website modifications. I would update lower with specific executive directives targeting the DV website or evidence of other immigration webpages being removed. The combination of strong status quo bias, statutory protections, short timeframe, but real administrative opposition yields a high but not certain probability.",

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower.
