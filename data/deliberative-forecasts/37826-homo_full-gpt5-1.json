    "review": "Both forecasters emphasize that, post–May 10 ceasefire and planned withdrawals, the default is de-escalation with retaliation—if any—kept to the LoC/PoK rather than Pakistan proper. I agree. They added a few useful nuances I hadn’t made explicit: (1) the June “seasonal” uptick in infiltration attempts that can raise the hazard rate; (2) the month-long window argument (more time for a spoiler event); and (3) concrete tactical indicators to watch (NOTAMs, IAF/PAF posture, evacuations). I also find persuasive their point that India can achieve deterrent signaling without striking Sindh/Balochistan/Punjab/KP, which directly affects this question’s resolution. Where I diverge is on the magnitude: Forecaster 3’s 18% seems high relative to the base rate and the clear diplomatic track through early June; Forecaster 2’s 12% aligns more closely with my priors.",
    "rationale": "Core drivers remain de-escalatory: a fresh ceasefire (May 10), reported pullbacks by end-May, and an active diplomatic campaign into early June. India has already extracted signaling value via April–May operations and coercive non-kinetic moves (IWT suspension, border closure), reducing near-term incentives to risk a larger war by hitting Pakistan proper again. International partners likely continue to press restraint; Pakistan’s economic fragility also discourages it from inviting escalation. Meanwhile, “full authority” for Western Commanders increases responsiveness to violations but does not equate to political pre-authorization for strikes into Pakistan’s provinces, which carry qualitatively higher escalation risk than actions along the LoC/PoK. The most plausible trigger for a June strike into Pakistan proper is a mass-casualty attack in India credibly linked to Pakistan-based groups or a lethal cross-border strike causing significant Indian casualties. Even then, the modal Indian response historically is calibrated and often confined to the LoC/PoK. I’m modestly nudging my estimate up to reflect the forecasters’ seasonal infiltration point and the month-long window, but I still see the probability as low given the current trajectory and incentives to consolidate the ceasefire and diplomatic gains.",
