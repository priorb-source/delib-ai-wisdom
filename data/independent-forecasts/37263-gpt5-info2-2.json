  "information": "Uber's recent expansion strategy has focused on major international markets and technological partnerships. In December 2024, the company launched an \"Uber Taxi\" service in Curitiba, Brazil, integrating licensed local taxi drivers onto its platform through a partnership with mobility company Stuo. In the U.S., Uber partnered with autonomous vehicle developer May Mobility in May 2025, with plans to deploy self-driving taxis in Arlington, Texas, by late 2025 and expand to other cities in 2026. Reports indicate that Uber's historical pattern in the Caribbean has been to prioritize larger markets over smaller island jurisdictions.",

    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "About 60 days (until July 1, 2025)",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "The TCI government maintains its current stance against unlicensed ride-hailing, taxi interests remain opposed, and Uber does not list Turks and Caicos on its site; no credible launch announcement appears before July 1.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Uber strikes a quick agreement with the government or a taxi association to launch an Uber Taxi model using licensed drivers, updates its website to show availability in Turks and Caicos, and credible local or international outlets report the launch before July 1.",
    "rationale": "- Status quo: As of early May 2025, Uber does not operate in Turks and Caicos. Local media highlight crackdowns on illegal taxis, signaling regulatory sensitivity and likely opposition to informal ride-hailing. Small islands with strong taxi lobbies and fixed-fare regimes have historically resisted Uber-style entries. Default trajectory therefore points to No.\n- Company strategy and base rates: The research assistant notes Uber’s recent focus on larger markets and partnerships (e.g., Curitiba Uber Taxi; U.S. AV pilots). In the Caribbean, Uber has prioritized bigger markets (e.g., Dominican Republic) or limited, regulated arrangements (e.g., Jamaica). Launching in a small market like TCI within two months would be atypical relative to Uber’s recent expansion cadence.\n- Timing constraints: With roughly two months left, a compliant launch would likely require government coordination and taxi-industry buy-in, plus driver onboarding and back-end configuration. Without visible preparatory signals (press leaks, government consultations, Uber job postings, or local MoUs), a near-term launch is improbable.\n- Why not higher: Short timeline, small market size, regulatory headwinds, and taxi-industry resistance lower odds. No public indicators of an imminent launch.\n- Why not lower: Uber can deploy an Uber Taxi model relatively quickly if regulators and taxi associations agree, leveraging licensed drivers and minimizing regulatory friction. TCI’s heavy tourism could make a small, seasonal pilot attractive, and Uber has used taxi-integration playbooks elsewhere.\n- What would move me up: Credible reporting of talks between Uber and TCI authorities or taxi associations; official statements inviting ride-hail integration; Uber website showing a coming-soon tag or job postings for TCI; government RFPs or regulatory updates enabling ride-hailing.\n- What would move me down: Explicit government statements rejecting ride-hailing platforms; renewed enforcement actions specifically targeting app-based services; Uber communications ruling out small-island launches in 2025.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill Uber be available in the Turks and Caicos Islands on July 1, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\n[Tourism Stakeholders Warned About Encouraging Use of Illegal Taxis](https://magneticmediatv.com/2025/04/tourism-stakeholders-warned-about-encouraging-use-of-illegal-taxis/)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if Uber is available in Turks and Caicos as shown on the [Uber website](https://www.uber.com/us/en/search-results/?query=TURKS+AND+CAICOS) or according to [credible sources](https://www.metaculus.com/faq/#definitions).\n\n\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nUber's recent expansion strategy has focused on major international markets and technological partnerships.

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
