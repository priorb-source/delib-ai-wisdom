    "review": "Both forecasters largely mirror my priors: public White House confirmation, allied corroboration, short time to event, and strong incentives make attendance the status quo. New wrinkles they surfaced that are useful: (1) explicit consideration that the summit could be postponed or moved out of June (relevant to resolution); (2) the possibility of a truncated presence or avoiding a plenary. Neither changes the central balance much. A postponement seems very unlikely at this late stage, and even a shortened presence would likely still meet the in-person criterion if he participates in any multilateral or on-venue bilateral with fellow heads. Their downside tails (health, crises, security) and upside signals (USSS pre-positioning, detailed schedules, wheels-up) are consistent with mine. I note the RA’s small inconsistencies (e.g., SecGen identity, G7 location) as reason for a minor caution, but they don’t undercut the core on-record confirmations.",
    "rationale": "We are ~20 days out with on-the-record White House confirmation and allied echoes. U.S. presidents almost always attend NATO summits, and Trump has clear policy goals he is actively pushing that benefit from in-person leverage. Security and logistics for a POTUS visit will already be well advanced. Residual risk comes from Trump’s unpredictability, age-related health tails, potential domestic/international crises, security concerns, travel disruptions, or an extremely unlikely summit postponement beyond June. The possibility of attending but avoiding a plenary is a niche risk to resolution, but any on-venue interaction with other heads would satisfy the defined \"in person\" criterion. Net: these are genuine but small tails. Given this, I keep my prior assessment essentially unchanged.",
