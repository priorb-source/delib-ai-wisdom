  "information": "In Ohio, Republican lawmakers introduced Senate Bill 153 (SB 153), which would create new requirements for citizen-led ballot initiatives. The bill would compel paid signature gatherers to wear visible badges, list employers on petitions, and maintain detailed records. The bill's definition of 'paid' circulators is considered broad, and it requires petition signers to be registered voters on the exact day they sign. As of early May 2025, this bill had not completed the legislative process. In February 2025, a provision requiring Ohioans to prove citizenship to register to vote at the Bureau of Motor Vehicles was removed from the state's transportation budget by Republicans. Instead, BMV employees will be prohibited from offering registration forms to individuals identified as non-citizens. This change was prompted by a report from Secretary of State Frank LaRose indicating that non-citizens were accidentally registering to vote, partly due to language barriers.\n\nThe Ohio legislature has Republican supermajorities in both the Senate (26-7) and the House (67-32). Senators Theresa Gavarone and Andrew Brenner are key sponsors pushing for stricter election laws. In early 2023, Governor Mike DeWine signed HB 458, a voter ID law. However, Governor DeWine has also expressed some hesitation regarding the current proof-of-citizenship proposals. Organizations such as the ACLU are actively opposing the new legislation. The Ohio General Assembly has session days scheduled through late June 2025, ahead of the July 1, 2025 resolution deadline.\n\nThere is a national trend of Republican-led efforts to enact proof-of-citizenship voting requirements. At the federal level, the U.S. House of Representatives passed the Safeguard American Voter Eligibility (SAVE) Act, which would require proof of citizenship for voter registration. Several states have pursued similar legislation. Wyoming passed a law requiring proof of citizenship to vote, which will take effect on July 1, 2025. In Iowa, a state audit found 277 noncitizens were registered to vote or had voted in the 2024 election. In Tennessee, a bill to create a portal for election workers to verify voter citizenship has advanced in the state House. In Michigan, a proposed constitutional amendment that would have required proof of citizenship for voter registration failed to pass.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Less than 2 months.",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No legislation expanding the verification requirements of a voter's citizenship is enacted by the deadline.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "The Ohio General Assembly's session concludes before the July 1, 2025 deadline without passing a proof-of-citizenship bill. Despite the Republican supermajorities, the legislative leadership prioritizes other matters, influenced by Governor DeWine's noted hesitation and the recent decision in February 2025 to remove a similar provision from the state budget. The bill either stalls in committee or is never brought for a full floor vote.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Spurred by national trends and pressure from key sponsors within the party, the Republican leadership fast-tracks a proof-of-citizenship bill in the final weeks of the legislative session. The bill passes both the House and Senate along party lines, leveraging the supermajorities. Governor DeWine, despite his reservations, signs the bill into law to maintain party unity and avoid a likely veto override.",
    "rationale": "My forecast of 30% reflects a situation where the political power to enact such legislation exists, but the immediate political will appears to be lacking. The single most influential piece of evidence is the recent, concrete action by Ohio Republicans in February 2025 to remove a proof-of-citizenship provision from the transportation budget. This indicates that, when given a clear opportunity, the majority party chose not to advance this specific policy, suggesting a lack of consensus or appetite for the political and legal battles it would entail. This strong signal supports the status quo outcome.\n\nHowever, the probability is not close to zero for several reasons. First, the Republican party holds supermajorities in both legislative chambers, giving them the raw power to pass legislation quickly if leadership makes it a priority. Second, there is a clear national trend and internal pressure from sponsors like Senators Gavarone and Brenner to pass stricter election laws, as evidenced by their previous legislative efforts and the passage of the voter ID law (HB 458). Finally, the legislative calendar still has time for a bill to pass before the July 1 deadline.\n\nMy forecast is not higher because of the aforementioned removal of the budget provision, coupled with Governor DeWine's expressed hesitation. A hesitant governor adds a procedural hurdle and signals potential division within the party that could sap momentum. The short timeline also makes it less likely for a controversial bill to navigate the full legislative process.\n\nMy forecast is not lower because the sheer size of the Republican majority cannot be ignored. A sudden shift in priorities, perhaps triggered by a national event or a new local report on non-citizen voting, could easily overcome the current inertia and lead to the bill's swift passage. To update my forecast higher, I would need to see evidence of the bill being prioritized by leadership, such as scheduling it for floor votes. To update lower, I would look for definitive statements from legislative leaders or the Governor that the issue will not be considered this session.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nBefore July 1, 2025, will Ohio enact legislation expanding its verification requirements of a voter's citizenship?\n\nQuestion background:\nThe Ohio Senate: [Gavarone, Brenner Introduce Bill to Require Proof of Citizenship to Vote](https://ohiosenate.gov/members/theresa-gavarone/news/gavarone-brenner-introduce-bill-to-require-proof-of-citizenship-to-vote)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if, before July 1, 2025, the state of Ohio enacts legislation requiring voters to provide proof of US citizenship beyond the requirements at the time of this question, according to [credible sources](https://www.metaculus.com/faq/#definitions).\n\nAny subset of voters being required to provide such proof would count (for example if it only applied to first-time voter registrants or creating a new requirement for mail-in voters). An example of a bill that would count is [Senate Bill 153](https://www.legislature.ohio.gov/legislation/136/sb153). This question resolves upon enactment; therefore other questions such as when the legislation takes effect or whether it survives court challenges and is implemented is immaterial to this question's resolution. Please note that under Ohio law, a bill is considered enacted \"after both houses have passed and agreed on identical bills.\" ([Source](https://www.lsc.ohio.gov/assets/organizations/legislative-service-commission/files/chapter-5-enacting-legislation-10021971.pdf))\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nIn Ohio, Republican lawmakers introduced Senate Bill 153 (SB 153), which would create new requirements for citizen-led ballot initiatives.
