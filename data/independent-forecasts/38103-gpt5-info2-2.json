  "information": "In the Canadian market, Tesla has experienced a significant downturn in early 2025. New vehicle registrations in Québec dropped by 85-90% in the first quarter of the year. Concurrently, a J.D. Power survey indicated a shift in Canadian consumer preference, with Tesla falling from second to eighth place among most-considered EV brands. Other manufacturers, such as General Motors, surpassed Tesla as the top seller of EVs in Canada during this period. Public sentiment has also been a factor, with protests occurring at a B.C. Tesla dealership on March 23, 2025, where participants called for a boycott of the company.",

    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "About 32 days (check on/after July 1, 2025)",
    "status_quo_outcome": "Yes — the page still explicitly says Tesla products are not eligible for the home EV charger rebate.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "BC Hydro revises the specific page to remove the explicit Tesla-ineligible wording by July 1 (e.g., shifts to generic language about excluding U.S.-made goods, moves the brand-specific note to another page, restructures the site, or reverses the exclusion).",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "The page continues to state that Tesla products are not eligible for the EV charger at home program, unchanged from the March 12, 2025 announcement.",
    "rationale": "Status quo strongly favors continuation. The exclusion was newly announced on March 12, 2025 as part of a B.C. policy to preference Canadian goods and exclude U.S.-produced goods where practicable. With only about a month until resolution, policy and web copy inertia is high. There is little time for a trade-policy reversal or legal action to force changes. Public/political context provides no pressure to reinstate Tesla; if anything, it supports maintaining the stance: Tesla’s Canadian market momentum weakened in early 2025 (sharp drop in Québec registrations; J.D. Power shows lower consideration; GM overtook Tesla in EV sales), and B.C. saw anti-Tesla protests in March. That reduces the political cost of continuing the exclusion.\nWhy not higher? The resolution hinges on exact wording on a specific page. Even if the policy remains, BC Hydro might quietly generalize the language (e.g., “U.S.-produced goods are ineligible”) and remove the explicit Tesla reference, or restructure the page—either would resolve No under the stated criteria. There’s also a small chance of a quick policy softening if intergovernmental negotiations progress.\nWhy not lower? Reversing or even softening a just-announced policy within months is uncommon absent major developments. Brand-specific naming suggests intent to keep the message visible at least through the near term.\nWhat would move me up? Additional BC Hydro or B.C. government communications reiterating Tesla’s ineligibility on multiple pages, or signals of prolonged Canada-U.S. policy friction. What would move me down? Any update shifting to generic country-of-origin language without naming Tesla, a site redesign removing the Tesla mention from the specified page, or news of a policy accommodation/reciprocity deal with the U.S.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill BC Hydro still exclude Tesla from its EV charger rebate program for single-family homes in July 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nAccording to the resolution source, \"The Government of B.C. and BC Hydro are taking action to preference Canadian goods in our rebate programs going forward and to exclude, where practicable, U.S. produced goods. As of March 12, 2025, Tesla products (electric vehicle chargers, energy storage batteries and inverters) are not eligible for CleanBC and BC Hydro rebates. If you purchased or have received pre-approval for your Tesla product before March 12, 2025, it can still qualify for rebates and will be processed as normal.\"\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if BC Hydro at [this page](https://www.bchydro.com/powersmart/electric-vehicles/rebates-incentives/rebates-home-chargers.html) when checked by Metaculus on or after July 1, 2025, says that Tesla products are not eligible for the EV charger at home program. If it does not mention Tesla being ineligible, then this question resolves as **No**.\n\n\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nIn the Canadian market, Tesla has experienced a significant downturn in early 2025.

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
