  "information": "According to Ukraine's State Statistics Service, the annual inflation rate has shown an accelerating trend in early 2025, rising from 12.9% in January to 13.4% in February, and reaching 14.6% in March. The monthly inflation rate for March 2025 was 1.5%, up from 0.8% in February. The March data represents the highest annual inflation rate since May 2023. Specific price increases in March were significant in several categories, including eggs (+18.8%) and clothing and footwear (+13.3%). On a year-over-year basis, food and non-alcoholic beverages increased by 17.4%, while housing, water, electricity, gas, and other fuels rose by 20.2%.\n\nThe National Bank of Ukraine (NBU) has maintained its key interest rate at 15.5% in an effort to control inflation. The NBU revised its year-end 2025 inflation forecast to 8.7% and its 2025 GDP growth forecast down to 3.1%. NBU statements indicate an expectation that inflation will peak in the second quarter of 2025 and subsequently decline during the summer, partly due to an anticipated increase in crop yields, which is projected to lower food inflation. The bank has identified ongoing risks including the war, infrastructure damage, and labor shortages.\n\nThe primary factors driving recent inflation include increased production costs for businesses and supply chain disruptions resulting from the war. Intensified attacks on energy infrastructure and population mobilization have also been cited as contributing pressures. The cost of the 2025 Easter food basket was reported to be 18-19% higher than in the previous year. On the other hand, potential disinflationary factors include the NBU's monetary policy and a reported decrease in consumer demand. Some economists expect seasonal factors to lead to an increase in vegetable production and a subsequent decrease in food prices in late spring or early summer.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Approximately 1-2 weeks. Ukraine's State Statistics Service typically releases monthly inflation data in the first week of the following month, so April 2025 data should be available in early May.",
    "status_quo_outcome": "Yes - inflation reaches at least 15.0% in April",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "April inflation stays below 15.0% if the National Bank of Ukraine's tight monetary policy (15.5% interest rate) more effectively dampens demand than expected, seasonal vegetable production increases earlier than anticipated leading to rapid food price decreases, or if month-over-month inflation meaningfully decelerates from March's 1.5% rate.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "April inflation reaches 15.0% or higher if the accelerating trend from January (12.9%) through February (13.4%) to March (14.6%) continues, war-related pressures on energy infrastructure and supply chains persist, the Easter food price effects carry through April, and monthly inflation remains elevated similar to March's 1.5% rate.",
    "rationale": "Ukraine's inflation has shown clear acceleration in early 2025, rising from 12.9% in January to 13.4% in February to 14.6% in March. We only need an additional 0.4 percentage points to reach the 15.0% threshold. Several factors strongly support crossing this threshold: (1) The monthly inflation rate accelerated from 0.8% in February to 1.5% in March, showing building momentum. (2) The NBU explicitly expects inflation to peak in Q2 2025, and April is in Q2. (3) We're already on April 22nd, meaning approximately two-thirds of the month has passed under the same pressures that drove March's acceleration. (4) The underlying drivers - war-related infrastructure damage, supply chain disruptions, labor shortages, and elevated food prices - haven't dissipated. (5) Easter food basket costs were 18-19% higher year-over-year. The main countervailing factors are the NBU's tight monetary policy and expectations of seasonal crop increases lowering food prices, but these are more likely to affect late Q2 and summer months rather than April specifically. The NBU's forecast expects the decline to happen \"during the summer,\" not in April. Given the proximity to the threshold, the clear accelerating trend, the NBU's own Q2 peak forecast, and that most of April has already occurred, the status quo strongly points toward crossing 15%. I'm not higher (e.g., 85-90%) because there's inherent uncertainty in economic data and some possibility that disinflationary factors kicked in unexpectedly mid-April. I'm not lower (e.g., 60-65%) because the evidence is quite strong - we're very close to the threshold with clear momentum and explicit central bank expectations of a Q2 peak.",
