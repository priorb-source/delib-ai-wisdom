    "review": "Forecaster 2 provides valuable historical context noting that June 2022 saw approximately 50.0 as the all-time low during peak inflation concerns. This is more recent and relevant than my Great Recession reference of 55.8, and demonstrates that sub-54.0 readings have occurred in modern times. This makes the threshold more plausible than I initially weighted. However, even that historic low was barely below 54.0, and such readings remain exceptionally rare. All three of us lack specific May 2025 or preliminary June 2025 data, which is a critical information gap. Forecaster 3's reasoning closely mirrors mine at 30%, while Forecaster 2's more conservative 18% reflects stronger weighting of base rates. The deliberation highlights that while the tariff 'plunge' reference suggests unusual conditions, we should be cautious about assigning too much probability without concrete data showing current levels are already approaching this extreme threshold.",
    "rationale": "Upon reflection, I'm updating downward from 30% to 23%. The June 2022 precedent of ~50.0 during inflation concerns is important - it shows sub-54.0 is achievable with the right crisis conditions and isn't just a decades-old outlier. This supports some probability mass on Yes. However, Forecaster 2 correctly emphasizes that even with this precedent, such extreme readings remain historically rare. Without specific data showing May 2025 or preliminary June readings are already in danger territory (say, below 56-57), I'm over-weighting the directional signal from the 'plunge' reference. The status quo bias should dominate more heavily. My updated 23% reflects: (1) the June 2022 precedent making this more plausible than Great Recession comparisons suggested, (2) the meaningful signal from tariff concerns and the explicit 'plunge' reference, (3) but stronger weighting toward base rates given our lack of current data, and (4) recognition that even in extreme crises, sentiment typically bottoms in the 50-55 range rather than going much lower.",
