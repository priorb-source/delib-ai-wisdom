    "review": "Forecaster 2 usefully emphasizes the high consensus threshold and the practical near-impossibility of removals for DPRK, Iran, and Myanmar by June—points I agree with. Their explicit dismissal of a Russia blacklisting in the near term is sensible given the lack of pre-signals and FATF’s prior choice to suspend rather than escalate. Forecaster 3’s base-rate framing is directionally right, but their 20% seems high given the lack of pre‑plenary signaling; citing Iran’s occasional engagement as a reason to keep probability elevated isn’t convincing for a one‑month horizon to removal. Neither forecaster brought concrete new signals of an impending change; the main incremental value is reinforcing the rarity of changes and the need for clear pre‑indications.",
    "rationale": "My initial view weighted base rates and the absence of signals, landing at 12%. Reviewing the others, I align more with the conservative stance that a single plenary absent public ICRG flags has a low chance of a black‑list change. Removals: effectively nil for DPRK and Iran; Myanmar’s conflict and governance environment make verified compliance before June implausible. Additions: escalation from grey to black typically follows sustained, publicly noted non‑cooperation—no such cases are currently telegraphed. The Russia scenario remains highly unlikely given prior suspension and political constraints. Considering base rates since 2020 (roughly two black‑list changes across ~15–18 plenaries) and the current lack of signals, I nudge my forecast down modestly from 12% to 9%, reflecting a small residual tail for an unexpected addition rather than any plausible removal.",
