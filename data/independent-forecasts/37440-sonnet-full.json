  "information": "Several bills concerning voter citizenship verification were considered in Florida's legislature. HB 831 would require state-issued IDs to indicate non-citizen status. HB 1381 would require voters to provide proof of citizenship, such as a passport or birth certificate, for new or updated registrations. SB 1330 would require first-time voters to present similar documentation. The 2025 regular legislative session concluded without enacting these bills. A comprehensive bill containing similar provisions, CS/HB 1381, was withdrawn from consideration on May 3, 2025. An extended legislative session, constitutionally required to pass the state budget, began on May 12, 2025.\n\nFlorida's legislature is controlled by a Republican supermajority in both chambers. Governor Ron DeSantis has a history of supporting and signing legislation described as strengthening election integrity. In May 2025, DeSantis signed a law that creates new hurdles for the citizens' initiative process, including a ban on non-citizens and non-residents from gathering signatures for petitions. This followed the enactment of SB 7016 in April 2025, which also restricts ballot initiatives.\n\nThe push for expanded voter citizenship verification in Florida aligns with a broader national trend. The U.S. House of Representatives passed the Safeguard American Voter Eligibility (SAVE) Act, which would require proof of citizenship for voter registration nationwide, though it is unlikely to pass the Senate. Separately, President Donald Trump signed an executive order to impose stricter verification requirements. Other states have also advanced similar legislation; Wyoming passed a law requiring proof of citizenship to vote that is set to become effective on July 1, and a bill in Tennessee to create a citizenship verification portal for election workers has advanced in its state house.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Approximately 56 days until July 1, 2025. An extended legislative session begins May 12, 2025, which provides the primary remaining window for potential legislation.",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No - Florida does not enact expanded citizenship verification requirements before July 1, 2025. The regular legislative session concluded without passing HB 831, HB 1381, or SB 1330, and the most comprehensive bill (CS/HB 1381) was withdrawn from consideration on May 3, 2025.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "The extended legislative session that begins May 12 focuses exclusively on the constitutionally required state budget. No citizenship verification bills are reintroduced or attached to budget legislation. The session concludes without enacting such measures, and no special session addressing this issue is called before the July 1 deadline.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "During the extended session beginning May 12, Republican legislators attach citizenship verification provisions to must-pass budget legislation or rapidly advance a standalone bill. With supermajority control in both chambers, the bill passes quickly and Governor DeSantis signs it by late May or June, well before the July 1 deadline.",
    "rationale": "The most critical factor is the recent withdrawal of CS/HB 1381 on May 3, 2025 - just three days before today. This withdrawal, rather than a simple failure to pass, signals a deliberate decision not to pursue this legislation during the current legislative cycle. Despite favorable conditions (Republican supermajority, supportive governor, national momentum), the comprehensive bill was pulled from consideration.\n\nThe extended legislative session beginning May 12 is constitutionally mandated for passing the state budget. These special budget sessions are typically narrowly focused on fiscal matters rather than policy legislation. While it's technically possible to pass other bills during this period, the timing and context suggest low probability.\n\nSupporting factors for a higher probability include: (1) Republican supermajority control enabling rapid passage if desired, (2) Governor DeSantis's demonstrated support for election integrity measures including signing related legislation in May 2025, (3) alignment with national Republican priorities, and (4) sufficient time remaining before July 1.\n\nHowever, the status quo strongly favors No because: (1) the withdrawal three days ago indicates lack of immediate political will or consensus, (2) extended sessions prioritize budget matters, (3) the regular session opportunity has passed, and (4) good forecasters recognize that dramatic changes within short timeframes are relatively rare.\n\nFor my forecast to increase significantly, I would need to see: new citizenship verification bills introduced in the extended session, public statements from legislative leadership prioritizing this issue, or indication that provisions will be attached to budget legislation. For my forecast to decrease further, I would need: explicit statements that no such legislation will be considered in the extended session, or the session concluding without any movement on these bills.\n\nThe May 3 withdrawal is the strongest signal - it suggests that even with all favorable political conditions aligned, Florida's legislature chose not to pursue this before the regular session ended. While technically still possible, the probability of reversal within 56 days is low.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nBefore July 1, 2025, will Florida enact legislation expanding its verification requirements of a voter's citizenship?\n\nQuestion background:\nTallahassee Democrat: [Florida may require proof of citizenship to vote under new legislation echoing Trump](https://www.tallahassee.com/story/news/local/state/2025/04/02/got-id-proof-of-citizenship-may-soon-be-needed-to-vote-in-florida/82756919007/)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if, before July 1, 2025, the state of Florida enacts legislation requiring voters to provide proof of US citizenship beyond the requirements at the time of this question, according to [credible sources](https://www.metaculus.com/faq/#definitions).\n\nAny subset of voters being required to provide such proof would count (for example if it only applied to first-time voter registrants or creating a new requirement for mail-in voters). An example of a bill that would count is [HB 831](https://www.flsenate.gov/Session/Bill/2025/831). This question resolves upon enactment; therefore other questions such as when the legislation takes effect or whether it survives court challenges and is implemented is immaterial to this question's resolution.\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nSeveral bills concerning voter citizenship verification were considered in Florida's legislature.

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
