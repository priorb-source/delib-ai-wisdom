    "review": "My initial analysis was based on the flawed premise that Berkshire Hathaway held no stake in Domino's Pizza, making a large new purchase seem unlikely. Forecaster 3's analysis fundamentally corrected my understanding by highlighting that Berkshire had already initiated a position in Q3 2024 and added to it in Q4 2024. This context reframes the question from one of initiation to one of continuation. The most decisive piece of evidence came from Forecaster 3: multiple news reports in early May 2025 stating Berkshire had increased its stake to 7%. This specific, quantitative claim directly supports a 'Yes' resolution. Forecaster 2's argument that Berkshire was a net seller overall in the quarter is a valid macro point but is significantly outweighed by specific evidence of accumulation in this particular stock. A firm can easily be a net seller while still adding to a few high-conviction positions.",
    "rationale": "I am substantially increasing my forecast from 8% to 94%. My previous forecast was erroneous because it assumed Berkshire was initiating a new position. The context provided by the other forecasters, particularly Forecaster 3, reveals Berkshire has been actively accumulating a stake in Domino's over the previous two quarters. This pattern makes a further purchase in Q1 2025 a highly logical and probable continuation of their strategy. The forecast is driven almost entirely by the powerful evidence cited by Forecaster 3: recent news reports claiming Berkshire's stake has reached 7%. A 7% stake equates to approximately 2.5 million shares, which is comfortably above the 2,382,000 share threshold for a 'Yes' resolution. My confidence is not 100% due to two small sources of uncertainty: 1) the news reports could be inaccurate, or 2) the purchases that pushed the stake over the threshold might have occurred after the Q1 reporting period ended on March 31st (e.g., in April 2025). However, the timing of these reports, just before the 13F filing deadline, makes it much more likely they refer to Q1 activity. The evidence for a 'Yes' is now overwhelmingly strong.",
