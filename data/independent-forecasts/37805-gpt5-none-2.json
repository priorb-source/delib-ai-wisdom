    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "About 6 weeks (≈42 days) until July 1, 2025",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No — SPN likely has 4 or fewer direct destinations listed on flightsfrom.com",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "By July 1, 2025 the flightsfrom.com/SPN page shows only Guam plus one or two East Asia hubs (e.g., Incheon and possibly Busan or Tokyo), totaling ≤4 destinations, with no additional summer seasonal routes starting by that date.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "At least five destinations appear on flightsfrom.com for SPN on/after July 1, 2025, e.g., Guam, Incheon, Busan, Tokyo (Narita), plus another such as Daegu, Osaka, Nagoya — or domestic CNMI points (Rota, Tinian) are included in the schedules data — bringing the count to 5+.",
    "rationale": "- Baseline/status quo: SPN’s post-pandemic network has been thin, centered on United to Guam and Korean leisure demand (Jeju Air to Incheon; sometimes Busan). Japanese service has been sporadic, and China/Taiwan service remains constrained. The linked background highlights ongoing challenges restoring flights, consistent with a small destination count. \n- Constraint of timing: New scheduled routes for early July would normally already be filed and on sale. With ~6 weeks to go, materially expanding to 5+ destinations is unlikely unless routes are already scheduled for late June/early July. Metaculus will check flightsfrom.com on/after July 1, which typically lists routes operating within the next 7 days; later-in-July starts might not count.\n- Threshold is strict: The bar is >4 (i.e., at least 5). If current reality is Guam + Incheon + possibly Busan + possibly Narita, that’s 3–4. Hitting 5 requires an additional Japanese/Korean secondary city or inclusion of intra-CNMI commuter points.\n- Key uncertainty: Whether flightsfrom.com lists commuter services to Rota (ROP) and Tinian (TIQ). If those appear as scheduled routes (depending on whether the operator files to OAG/GDS and is captured by flightsfrom), the count could surpass 4. Historically, flightsfrom often omits very small unscheduled/charter operations; inclusion of small commuter services is inconsistent, so I don’t assume they’ll be counted.\n- Why not higher: Limited time for new route launches; ongoing tourism recovery challenges; Chinese market unlikely to return by July 1 with scheduled service; Japanese recovery still tentative.\n- Why not lower: It’s plausible that summer seasonality adds a Japanese or additional Korean city, or that flightsfrom.com includes Rota/Tinian via a local scheduled operator, pushing the count to 5.\n- What would move me up: Verified schedules (OAG/airline timetables) showing SPN served from at least five distinct airports during the week of July 1 (e.g., confirmation of both Tokyo and a second Korean city, plus Guam). Confirmation that flightsfrom.com lists Rota and/or Tinian as scheduled destinations would also push this higher.\n- What would move me down: Evidence that Busan or Tokyo summer services are not operating the week of July 1, leaving only Guam and Incheon (or similarly ≤3 routes) on flightsfrom.com.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill there be greater than 4 direct flight destinations from Saipan, Northern Mariana Islands on July 1, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nTravel and Tour World: [Northern Marianas struggles to revive tourism amid flight suspensions and travel restrictions: What you need to know?](https://www.travelandtourworld.com/news/article/northern-marianas-struggles-to-revive-tourism-amid-flight-suspensions-and-travel-restrictions-what-you-need-to-know/)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if there are greater than 4 direct flight destinations listed at the [All scheduled direct (non-stop) flights from Saipan (SPN)](https://www.flightsfrom.com/SPN) tracker when checked by Metaculus on or after July 1, 2025.\n\n\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nNo additional information available.\n\nToday is 2025-05-20.\n\nBefore answering you think:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n(e) You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
