    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "9 days",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No — the currently-declared state of emergency for the energy crisis was scheduled to run through April 29, 2025, so without an extension there would be no SoE in effect on April 30.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "The government allows the March 31 SoE to lapse on April 29 and announces that power supply has stabilized sufficiently to manage under normal authorities; no new or replacement SoE is declared before or on April 30.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Cabinet advises, and the Head of State proclaims, an extension of the energy crisis SoE that explicitly covers April 30 (e.g., another 14–30 days), or a different SoE (e.g., severe weather, public health) is declared that is in force on April 30.",
    "rationale": "- Evidence/status quo: The cited proclamation, issued Mar 31, was set to end Apr 29. On current trajectory, that implies a No on Apr 30 unless extended. My research assistant found no further updates, so I anchor on the posted end date and typical government practice. \n- Reasons for Yes: If rolling blackouts and the underlying fuel/finance issues persist, an SoE extension is a straightforward legal tool to expedite procurement, direct utilities, and manage rationing. Samoa has a track record of extending SoEs when conditions warrant (e.g., Covid). Extensions are often decided close to expiry, so timing is compatible with an extension that covers Apr 30. A non-energy emergency could also trigger a fresh SoE, though that’s a lower-probability path in this 1-day window. \n- Reasons for No: Governments generally prefer to avoid prolonged emergency powers if not essential. The initial 30-day window may have been chosen because authorities expected stabilization by late April; if supply agreements and payments have been arranged, they may let the SoE expire. Lack of ongoing high-salience media signals could suggest improvement (though silence is ambiguous). \n- Why not higher: No is the default and there’s no confirming evidence of persistent crisis necessitating extension. \n- Why not lower: Energy problems can be sticky; with only a one-day requirement (Apr 30), even a short extension would make this Yes. \n- What would move me up: Credible reports of continued blackouts, government statements hinting at or scheduling an extension, or new hazards. \n- What would move me down: Official statements that the crisis is resolved and the SoE will lapse on Apr 29, or clear evidence of stable power and normal operations.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill a state of emergency be in effect in Samoa on April 30, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\n[Samoan Prime Minister declares state of emergency over power cuts](https://www.stuff.co.nz/nz-news/360634988/samoan-prime-minister-declares-state-emergency-over-power-cuts)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if, according to [credible sources](https://www.metaculus.com/faq/#definitions) Samoa is in a state of emergency that has been declared by a governmental entity with the authority to make such a declaration.\n\nFor example, the state of emergency declaration [posted](https://www.facebook.com/samoagovt/posts/hon-prime-minister-of-samoa-press-statement-proclamation-of-emergency-energy-cri/1059050259591457/) by the government of Samoa on Facebook on March 31, 2025 would count. (Note that when it was declared, it was scheduled to be in effect through April 29, 2025.)\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nNo additional information available.\n\nToday is 2025-04-21.\n\nBefore answering you think:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n(e) You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
