    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "One month (until July 1, 2025).",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No. US Presidents do not typically visit Russia, especially given the current geopolitical climate, high tensions over the war in Ukraine, and international sanctions. Such a visit would be an extreme departure from standard diplomatic practice.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "The deadline of July 1, 2025, passes without Donald Trump visiting Russia. The ongoing war in Ukraine, strong condemnation from allies, and domestic political opposition make such a trip diplomatically and politically untenable.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Following a sudden and dramatic geopolitical shift, such as a major breakthrough in Ukraine peace talks that he personally brokered, President Trump makes a surprise, high-stakes visit to Moscow to meet with Vladimir Putin and finalize an agreement.",
    "rationale": "My forecast is based on the extremely high diplomatic, political, and logistical barriers to a US presidential visit to Russia in the current global context. As of May 30, 2025, with only one month remaining in the resolution window, there are no public indications, rumors, or preparatory activities to suggest such a visit is being contemplated. The status quo, which heavily favors no visit, is reinforced by several factors: 1) The ongoing war in Ukraine makes a visit to Moscow politically toxic, as it would be seen as legitimizing Russian aggression and alienating key allies. 2) Presidential trips, particularly to adversarial nations, require months of meticulous planning for security and logistics; a visit within the next 31 days is logistically improbable. 3) Such a move would likely face massive bipartisan condemnation within the United States. My forecast is not lower than 1% solely to account for the small tail risk associated with Donald Trump's demonstrated preference for unconventional, norm-breaking foreign policy actions and his belief in personal diplomacy. He might attempt such a visit as a 'hail Mary' diplomatic play. For me to increase my forecast, I would need to see credible reports of back-channel communications or logistical preparations for a summit.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill Donald Trump visit Russia before July 1, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nWikipedia: [List of international presidential trips made by Donald Trump](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_international_presidential_trips_made_by_Donald_Trump)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if, after May 19, 2025 and before July 1, 2025, President Donald Trump personally visits Russia.\n\n\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nNo additional information available.\n\nToday is 2025-05-30.\n\nBefore answering you think:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n(e) You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
