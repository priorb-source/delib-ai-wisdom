  "information": "According to Ukraine's State Statistics Service, the annual inflation rate has shown an accelerating trend in early 2025, rising from 12.9% in January to 13.4% in February, and reaching 14.6% in March. The monthly inflation rate for March 2025 was 1.5%, up from 0.8% in February. The March data represents the highest annual inflation rate since May 2023. Specific price increases in March were significant in several categories, including eggs (+18.8%) and clothing and footwear (+13.3%). On a year-over-year basis, food and non-alcoholic beverages increased by 17.4%, while housing, water, electricity, gas, and other fuels rose by 20.2%.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Approximately 1-2 weeks. We are currently on April 22, 2025, and April inflation data is typically released by Trading Economics in early May.",
    "status_quo_outcome": "Yes. If current trends continue, Ukraine's inflation rate will likely cross the 15.0% threshold for April 2025.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Inflation stabilizes or increases only marginally in April, remaining below 15.0%. This could occur if monthly price pressures moderate from March's 1.5% level, seasonal factors provide relief, or if government policy interventions successfully dampen price increases in key categories like food and utilities.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "The accelerating trend continues, with inflation rising from March's 14.6% to at least 15.0% in April. Monthly inflation continues at or above the 1.5% rate observed in March, driven by persistent price pressures in food, housing, and utilities sectors, combined with ongoing war-related economic disruptions.",
    "rationale": "The evidence strongly suggests inflation will cross the 15.0% threshold. The research assistant's data shows a clear accelerating pattern: 12.9% (January) → 13.4% (February) → 14.6% (March). This represents increases of 0.5 and 1.2 percentage points respectively, indicating strengthening momentum. We are currently only 0.4 percentage points below the threshold.\n\nKey supporting factors include: (1) Monthly inflation was 1.5% in March, up from 0.8% in February, showing continued price pressures; (2) Critical categories show severe price increases - food up 17.4% YoY and housing/utilities up 20.2% YoY; (3) March 2025 marked the highest inflation rate since May 2023; (4) Ongoing war conditions continue to disrupt supply chains and economic activity.\n\nThe status quo strongly favors crossing 15.0% given the proximity and momentum. However, I'm not assigning higher probability because: inflation can exhibit month-to-month volatility, base effects could moderate the annual rate, and we lack visibility into April's actual data. I'm not going lower because the trend is strongly established, the threshold is extremely close, and the underlying pressures (war, food prices, utilities) show no signs of abating.\n\nTo update higher, I would need preliminary April data or news of major supply shocks. To update lower, I would need evidence of significant price stabilization or policy interventions with demonstrated effects.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill Ukraine's inflation rate increase to at least 15.0% for April 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\n[Ukraine is one step away from stagflation. And here's why](https://en.iz.ru/en/1868046/2025-04-10/ukraine-one-step-away-stagflation-and-heres-why)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if Ukraine's annualized inflation rate is greater than or equal to 15.0% for the month of April 2025, according to the number presented by [Trading Economics](https://tradingeconomics.com/ukraine/inflation-cpi). Under 15.0% resolves as **No**.\n\n\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nAccording to Ukraine's State Statistics Service, the annual inflation rate has shown an accelerating trend in early 2025, rising from 12.9% in January to 13.4% in February, and reaching 14.6% in March. The monthly inflation rate for March 2025 was 1.5%, up from 0.8% in February. The March data represents the highest annual inflation rate since May 2023.

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
