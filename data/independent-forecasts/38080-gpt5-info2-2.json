  "information": "The SEVP certification revocation would prohibit Harvard from enrolling new international students holding F or J visas for the 2025-2026 academic year. The decision affects approximately 6,800 current international students, who constitute about 27% of Harvard's student body. These students would be required to transfer to other SEVP-certified institutions or risk losing their legal status in the United States. Following the announcement, the University of Tokyo stated it is considering accepting affected Harvard students, and the Chinese Foreign Ministry pledged to protect the rights of its overseas students.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "About 34 days (until July 1, 2025)",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No — Harvard’s SEVP certification was revoked on May 22, 2025 and remains revoked; absent action, it will not be in effect on July 1.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Revocation stands through July 1. Harvard either fails to secure a TRO/preliminary injunction, or any lower-court relief is stayed by the First Circuit or the Supreme Court before July 1. DHS does not grant an administrative stay or voluntary reinstatement.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "A court issues a TRO or preliminary injunction restoring Harvard’s ability to enroll F/M (and relevant J) students and that order remains in effect through July 1, or DHS/SEVP grants an administrative stay or reverses the revocation before July 1.",
    "rationale": "Harvard’s certification has been revoked, so the status-quo path is that it remains without SEVP certification on July 1. To flip to Yes, something active must happen quickly: a court order restoring certification pending litigation, or DHS backing off (administrative stay or reinstatement). There is enough time for fast-moving litigation: TROs can be issued in days, and Harvard has strong irreparable-harm arguments (thousands of students’ legal status; institutional damage). The 2020 Harvard/MIT litigation over DHS’s online-class rule was resolved within a week in universities’ favor, showing courts can move quickly and that DHS sometimes retreats under pressure. That said, this case is more adversarial and unprecedented (full decertification of a major university). DHS may frame revocation within its regulatory discretion (8 CFR 214.3) or invoke national-security/foreign influence concerns, which can draw judicial deference and increase the chance higher courts stay any injunction. The Supreme Court has, in recent years, been receptive to executive-branch requests to stay nationwide injunctions, especially in immigration/national-security-adjacent contexts, raising the risk that even if Harvard wins early, relief could be stayed before July 1. Political optics cut both ways: the harms to ~6,800 students (about 27% of Harvard’s body, per the assistant’s report) and international backlash (e.g., University of Tokyo’s signal, China’s MFA comments) create pressure for a pause, but the administration appears willing to escalate and may prefer to fight in court rather than reverse course. Timing matters: even if Harvard gets district-court relief in early/mid June, DOJ could seek an emergency stay in the First Circuit and then the Supreme Court before July 1. That ping-pong risk makes a sustained Yes by the target date uncertain. Why not higher: the current status is No; higher-court stay risk is real; the administration may argue statutory discretion. Why not lower: the legal merits for interim relief look plausible (retaliation/APA and due process concerns), harms are immediate and concrete, and courts often preserve the last peaceable status quo pending full review. What would move me up: evidence of a fast TRO/prelim injunction with a judge signaling strong likelihood of success, bipartisan pressure on DHS, or DHS indicating an administrative stay/review. What would move me down: credible reporting that DHS’s revocation is grounded in specific, documented regulatory noncompliance or security findings, early adverse rulings for Harvard, or signs the First Circuit/Supreme Court is poised to stay any relief.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill Harvard University have a Student and Exchange Visitor Program certification on July 1, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nThe Trump administration and Harvard University have been through a significant confrontation, since Trump took office for the second time. This [started](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/22/us/politics/harvard-university-trump.html) with a task force commissioned by Trump to address antisemitism on campus, but quickly spiralled out of control. The administration asked Harvard to provide detailed records on foreign students, including disciplinary actions and involvement in protests, and demanded that Harvard implement changes to its admissions, hiring, and diversity policies. Harvard refused, citing concerns over academic freedom and student privacy. In response, the administration froze or pulled almost \\$4 billion in federal grants and contracts to Harvard and its research partners. Harvard filed a lawsuit against the administration, accusing it of attempting to interfere in academic decision-making and penalising the institution for resisting politically motivated demands.\r\n\r\nThe situation escalated on May 22, 2025, when the Department of Homeland Security [revoked](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/22/us/politics/trump-harvard-international-students.html) Harvard's certification under the Student and Exchange Visitor Program, effectively barring the university from enrolling international students for the 2025–2026 academic year. This action affects approximately 6,800 international students or 27% of Harvard's student body, who must now transfer to other institutions or risk losing their legal status. The administration justified the move by accusing Harvard of fostering a \"toxic campus climate,\" failing to protect Jewish students, and allegedly collaborating with the Chinese Communist Party.\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question will resolve as **Yes** if, on July 1, 2025, Harvard University has a certification under the Student and Exchange Visitor Program (SEVP) programme allowing international students to enroll, according to [credible sources](https://www.metaculus.com/faq/#definitions).\n\n* An announcement that Harvard's certification will be restored on a date after July 1, 2025 will not suffice to resolve this question. The certification needs to be in effect for this to resolve.\r\n* Getting the certification at any point on July 1, 2025 would resolve this question as **Yes**.\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nThe SEVP certification revocation would prohibit Harvard from enrolling new international students holding F or J visas for the 2025-2026 academic year. The decision affects approximately 6,800 current international students, who constitute about 27% of Harvard's student body. These students would be required to transfer to other SEVP-certified institutions or risk losing their legal status in the United States. Following the announcement, the University of Tokyo stated it is considering accepting affected Harvard students, and the Chinese Foreign Ministry pledged to protect the rights of its overseas students.\n\nToday is 2025-05-28.\n\nBefore answering you think:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n(e) You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
