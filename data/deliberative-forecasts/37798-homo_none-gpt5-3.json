    "review": "Both forecasters emphasize two key points I largely agree with: (1) over a ~4‑week horizon volatility is limited by the large prior sample of games, so current ordering matters a lot; (2) even for an elite team, competition among several near-peers keeps the chance of being exactly No. 1 on a specific check time below 50%. Forecaster 2 adds a helpful framing with a 20–30% prior for a perennial powerhouse on a random midseason date, and also explicitly accounts for the “on/after June 15” check-time risk. Forecaster 3’s weighting of status quo clustering and tie-counting is aligned with my initial reasoning. Neither adds hard new data about current standings, but both reinforce that absent proof LA is currently leading by a cushion, the probability should be meaningfully below 40%.",
    "rationale": "My prior already incorporated most of these considerations (competition among 4–6 top teams, tie likely counting, short horizon, check-time risk). The main incremental takeaway is to give slightly more weight to the check-timing risk and to a conservative prior absent confirmation of a current lead. That nudges me a bit lower. If ties did not count, I’d reduce several more points; since they likely do, I keep the reduction modest. Net: small adjustment down from 32% to 30%.",
