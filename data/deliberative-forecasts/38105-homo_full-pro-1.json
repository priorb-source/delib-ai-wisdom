    "review": "All three forecasters correctly identified the central tension: the new momentum and external pressure for a deal versus Lebanon's historical political gridlock and the very short timeline. My initial forecast of 35% was identical to Forecaster 2's, as we both balanced these competing factors similarly. Forecaster 3, with a 25% forecast, presented a compelling and more pessimistic argument that I found convincing. Specifically, Forecaster 3 placed greater emphasis on the 'extremely short timeline' and the interpretation that the remaining disagreements on the bank-restructuring law are not minor details but fundamental 'politically contentious' principles regarding power and control. This argument suggests the gap between the IMF and Lebanese political factions is wider than I had initially weighted, making a resolution within one month significantly less probable. The argument that such a rapid resolution would be difficult in *any* political system, let alone Lebanon's, was a particularly strong piece of reasoning.",
    "rationale": "I am revising my forecast downward from 35% to 25%. While my initial analysis recognized the severe obstacles, the deliberation, particularly with Forecaster 3, convinced me that I was underweighting the sheer difficulty of the task within the one-month timeframe. The key insight is that the remaining hurdles, specifically the bank-restructuring law, involve fundamental disagreements over power and the distribution of losses—issues that have paralyzed the political system for years. The IMF's public concern over the 'composition' and 'powers' of the new banking authority confirms that this is not a matter of finalizing details but of bridging a major political divide. While the positive factors—an active IMF mission, a specific deal on the table, and immense external pressure from the EU—remain valid and keep the probability from being lower, the historical precedent for gridlock on these exact points is a more powerful predictor of the short-term outcome. A 25% probability better reflects a situation where a breakthrough is possible under extreme pressure, but remains the significantly less likely outcome.",
