    "review": "Both forecasters largely mirror my assessment: short horizon favors current leaders, Dodgers’ true-talent is elite, multiple close contenders keep any single-team probability modest, and ties (if counted) add a few points. They didn’t introduce new evidence on schedule strength or fresh injury timelines that would materially shift my view. I agree with their emphasis on the competitive field (Phillies/Yankees/Orioles/Mets/Tigers) and that LA is not presently atop MLB. I also share the tie-counting assumption; if sole possession were required, I’d trim a few points. No compelling new arguments to push me meaningfully up or down.",
    "rationale": "Time left: ~27 days (~25 games). Status quo: Dodgers are near the top but not in first after a sweep, implying the base outcome leans No in a short window. Path to Yes: a modest LA hot streak plus regression from one or two rivals; ties likely count. Headwinds: multiple strong peers and pitching uncertainty (Snell out; Glasnow/Kershaw timelines) in a short window. The “on or after June 15” check adds minor timing noise but is symmetric across teams. Net: the Dodgers should have the single-highest team probability among near-peers, but on a specific date, that still sits around the mid-20s. I keep my estimate unchanged. If ties didn’t count, I’d be ~23%.",
