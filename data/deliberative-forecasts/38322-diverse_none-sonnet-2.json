    "review": "Forecaster 3 raises the most compelling new argument: the June preliminary report (mid-month, around June 14) will essentially anchor the final reading since the two typically differ minimally. This is a crucial timing insight I underweighted - we'll have strong advance warning before the June 27 final. Forecaster 3's specific watch list (May CPI on June 12, jobs report June 7) and historical anchoring (1980, 2008-09, mid-2022 as the rare sub-54 instances) is rigorous. Forecaster 2's emphasis on vulnerability to shocks is valid but their 30% seems slightly high given base rates. However, both forecasters acknowledge what I noted - the background's mention of a 'plunge' signals genuine concern. The key disagreement is whether that concern justifies 10%, 25%, or 30% probability. Forecaster 3's conservative stance on historical rarity is persuasive, but may slightly underweight the apparent deterioration flagged in the background.",
    "rationale": "After reviewing both analyses, I'm updating downward but not to Forecaster 3's 10%. The preliminary/final relationship is a critical insight - the mid-June preliminary will largely determine the outcome, making this less uncertain than I initially thought. Forecaster 3's historical analysis showing sub-54 readings are truly exceptional (essentially only during acute crises) is compelling. However, the Axios background explicitly references a 'plunge' and tariff-driven concerns, suggesting we're already in weakened territory. Without current data showing May or early June readings, I must give some credence to deterioration having already occurred. My updated view: sub-54 remains historically rare and would likely require the preliminary to come in at 56 or below, which itself is a low-probability event from typical baseline levels. But the flagged concerns prevent me from going as low as 10%. I'm moving to 18% - acknowledging Forecaster 3's excellent structural arguments while maintaining that the background suggests elevated risk beyond normal base rates.",
