    "review": "Forecaster 2 provides crucial new data I lacked: January 2025 was the hottest January on record, March ranked first or tied for first, and April was the second warmest April. This exceptional momentum through the first four months is a much stronger signal than I initially assessed. The first quarter being second-warmest on record significantly strengthens the case for May continuing this trend.\n\nHowever, Forecaster 3 raises important counterarguments. The base rate observation is valid - even in exceptionally warm years, not every month breaks records. The specific regional data is revealing: Ahmedabad, India experienced one of its coolest Mays (3.3°C below normal), which represents significant cooling in a major population center. While Europe and North America showed exceptional heat, this could reflect selective reporting rather than truly global patterns. The point about ENSO's fading influence is also well-taken.\n\nCritically, Forecaster 2 notes that April 2025 ranked second rather than first, which suggests some moderation is occurring even within this warm year. This is an important signal that the record-breaking momentum may be slowing.\n\nThe tension between these perspectives is instructive: the exceptional January-April performance argues for higher probability, but the base rate concerns, ENSO transition, regional cooling in India, and April's second-place finish all suggest caution.",
    "rationale": "Upon reflection, the most significant new information is the exceptional start to 2025 documented by Forecaster 2. Three of the first four months breaking or tying records is a stronger signal than I initially appreciated. This sustained exceptional warmth increases the likelihood that May would continue the trend.\n\nHowever, I'm moderating my update for several reasons: (1) April ranking second rather than first indicates the record-breaking momentum is not absolute, (2) the India cooling data suggests meaningful regional variation rather than uniform global exceptional heat, (3) the base rate argument remains valid - most months don't break records even during rapid warming, and (4) the ENSO neutral transition removes a significant warming boost that likely contributed to the May 2020 record.\n\nThe regional European heat records, while notable, may reflect selective reporting and don't necessarily indicate the global pattern needed for a record. I find Forecaster 3's skepticism about extrapolating from regional data to global patterns persuasive.\n\nBalancing the strong early-year momentum against the moderating factors and base rate concerns, I'm updating modestly downward from my initial 48% to account for the real possibility that April's second-place finish signals a plateauing of the exceptional warmth, even as I acknowledge the year's strong start.",
