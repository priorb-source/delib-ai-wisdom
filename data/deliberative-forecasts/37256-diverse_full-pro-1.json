    "review": "The other forecasters and I are in strong agreement on the core facts and the low probability of ratification. We all identified the same primary obstacles: the extremely short timeline (under 60 days), the empty legislative calendar for May-June, the multitude of severe domestic crises (fiscal, political, electoral), and the historical slowness of South Sudan's legislative processes. The key difference in our initial forecasts was the weight assigned to the faint signals for a 'Yes' outcome. Forecaster 3's analysis was particularly convincing in framing a potential pathway to 'Yes' through a \"quick, symbolic ratification to signal regional integration.\" This is a compelling argument I had not fully considered; a government facing immense domestic pressure might seek a low-cost, positive action on the international stage. This argument, combined with the other forecasters' emphasis on the recency of the Trade Minister's commitment (April 2025), persuades me that the small chance of a sudden political push is slightly higher than I initially estimated.",
    "rationale": "I am maintaining a very low forecast, but I am adjusting it slightly upward based on the deliberation. The evidence overwhelmingly points toward non-ratification before the July 1, 2025 deadline. The key impediments remain: the Transitional National Legislative Assembly is not scheduled to consider any trade-related bills, it meets infrequently, and the government's attention is consumed by a looming election, a severe fiscal crisis, and high-level political instability. Furthermore, the lack of budgetary allocation for AfCFTA obligations demonstrates a lack of practical preparation for implementation, making ratification a low priority. However, I am increasing my forecast from 5% to 8%. The reasoning for this adjustment is based on my peers' persuasive argument that a 'symbolic ratification' remains a possibility. The South Sudanese government, facing numerous internal crises, might see fast-tracking the ratification as an easy, low-cost way to generate positive international news and signal a commitment to regional integration. The recent public support from the Trade Minister and the Chamber of Commerce provides the political cover for such a move. The probability of this scenario is still very small given the procedural hurdles, but it is a more plausible pathway than I had initially modeled.",
