    "review": "- Forecaster 2 adds two useful points I hadn’t explicitly separated: (1) the relevant revision now is second-to-third, whose average absolute size is small (~0.1–0.2 pp), and (2) the unusually large net exports drag (they cite about -4.9 pp) is the most plausible swing factor. I agree both are key. The first point argues against a flip; the second keeps tail risk alive. On balance, this supports a sub-50% probability and tempers optimism despite a plausible channel for a reversal.\n- Forecaster 3 cites conditional historical rates for sign reversals when the advance estimate sits between -0.5% and 0% (35–40%). That’s a helpful empirical anchor, but it’s more pertinent before the second estimate arrives. After a second estimate that remains negative (around -0.2%), the required second-to-third revision (~+0.3 pp) becomes the operative lens, and those revisions are typically smaller. So I find F3’s framing directionally supportive of a material-but-minority chance, but slightly too generous given we now have the second print.\nOverall, F2’s emphasis on the small typical second-to-third revision magnitude slightly lowers the odds relative to a pure advance-estimate-based view, while the net exports volatility prevents a much lower probability. I do not see decisive new evidence to move meaningfully from my prior.",
    "rationale": "- Status quo: The second estimate reportedly remains slightly negative (about -0.2%). Flipping to >0.0% requires roughly a +0.3 pp revision from second to third, larger than the typical second-to-third move (~0.1–0.2 pp) but not out of the question.\n- Revision mechanics: By the third estimate, BEA has most source data in hand; remaining changes tend to be trade/services benchmarks, inventories, and late-arriving March detail. These can move the number, but sign flips from second to third are uncommon.\n- Component risk: A very large net exports drag increases upside tail risk if trade/services are revised favorably. However, much of the revised March goods/trade information was likely incorporated by the second estimate, limiting the remaining scope.\n- Balance: The small average second-to-third revision argues for <40%. The proximity to zero and volatile trade component argue against going too low. Net effect: maintain a mid-30s probability.\nGiven this, I’m holding my prior view: a nontrivial but minority chance of a flip to positive, with the base case remaining a small negative final print.",
