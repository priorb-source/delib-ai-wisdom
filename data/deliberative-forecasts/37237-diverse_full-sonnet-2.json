    "review": "Both forecasters provide valuable perspectives. Forecaster 2's calculation using tariff revenue to back-engineer import values is particularly illuminating - at $16.5B for April 1-28 (extrapolating to ~$17.7B monthly), even at a generous 5% average tariff rate this suggests only ~$354B in imports, barely above threshold. At more realistic 10%+ rates given the baseline 10% tariff plus higher rates on autos and Chinese goods, this points to much lower totals. Forecaster 3 raises important counterpoints I hadn't fully weighted: (1) pipeline effects mean April will still capture pre-tariff shipments, with the full impact hitting May-June harder; (2) services imports provide a stable cushion unaffected by goods tariffs; (3) the margin is narrow - only 1.2% below March's record. However, I find Forecaster 3's 30% too optimistic given the breadth of evidence. The 64% collapse in new orders, 30-40% drops across multiple logistics providers, increased blank sailings, and half-full ships from China all point to severe disruption. While new orders are forward-looking, the real-time shipping data (container arrivals, vessel schedules) reflects actual April activity. Forecaster 2's 5% may be too confident given uncertainty in the tariff revenue calculation (what's the true weighted average tariff rate?) and the pipeline effects Forecaster 3 identifies. The key tension is between hard logistics data showing severe April declines versus the argument that goods-in-transit would cushion the blow.",
    "rationale": "After reviewing both analyses, I'm maintaining a forecast in the low 20s range. The tariff revenue calculation provides the strongest new evidence - it's hard data rather than surveys or indicators. At plausible average tariff rates of 10-15% (given 10% baseline plus higher rates on major categories), $16.5B in revenue for 28 days suggests monthly imports well below the $338.5B threshold. However, three factors prevent me from going as low as 5%: First, there's uncertainty in the effective tariff rate - if many goods had exemptions or delays, the rate could be lower than assumed. Second, Forecaster 3's pipeline point is valid - goods shipped pre-tariff would still arrive in April, meaning the behavioral collapse in ordering hasn't fully hit yet. Third, services imports aren't affected by goods tariffs. Against going higher: The convergence of multiple independent data sources (logistics firms, port data, PMI, new orders) all showing major April declines is hard to dismiss. These aren't just forward indicators - port arrivals and container data reflect actual April activity. The front-loading in March also suggests importers successfully moved demand forward. I'm adjusting slightly down from 23% to 22% because Forecaster 2's revenue calculation is more concrete than I initially weighted, though not as far as their 5% due to the uncertainties noted.",
