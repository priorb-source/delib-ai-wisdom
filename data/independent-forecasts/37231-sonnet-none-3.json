    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Approximately 2-3 weeks. We are currently at the end of April 2025, and Mexico's National Institute of Statistics and Geography (INEGI) typically releases unemployment data for a given month around 3-4 weeks after the month ends. The data should be published and reflected on Trading Economics by late May 2025.",
    "status_quo_outcome": "Yes - Mexico's unemployment rate remains under 3%. Historically, Mexico has maintained relatively low unemployment rates, frequently below 3% in the 2022-2024 period. The country's labor market has remained tight with rates typically ranging between 2.5% and 3.5%.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "US tariffs on Mexican auto exports begin to impact manufacturing employment more severely than anticipated. The ripple effects through auto supply chains mentioned in the AP article lead to layoffs in the automotive sector and related industries. This pushes the unemployment rate to 3.0% or higher by April 2025. Even matching exactly 3.0% would result in a No outcome given the strict 'under 3%' threshold.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Mexico's labor market proves resilient despite tariff concerns. The broader economy remains strong enough to absorb any localized disruptions in the auto sector. Service sectors and other manufacturing continue to create jobs. The unemployment rate stays in the sub-3% range that has been common for Mexico in recent years, possibly around 2.6-2.9%.",
    "rationale": "This forecast requires assessing Mexico's unemployment dynamics with very limited current information since we're forecasting April 2025 data while currently at the end of April. The research assistant provided no additional data on recent unemployment trends. Key factors in my reasoning: (1) Historical baseline: Mexico has frequently maintained unemployment rates below 3% in the 2022-2024 period, suggesting the status quo favors a Yes outcome. (2) The threshold is precise at 3.0%, meaning even exactly meeting 3.0% counts as No, which adds some risk. (3) The tariff concerns mentioned could impact employment, but such macroeconomic effects typically take months to fully materialize in unemployment data, so April 2025 may not yet reflect significant impacts. (4) Without access to January-March 2025 unemployment trends, I must rely heavily on the historical pattern. My forecast is not higher (e.g., 80-90%) because: the exact 3.0% threshold creates meaningful uncertainty, tariff effects could be showing up by April, and I lack visibility into Q1 2025 trends. My forecast is not lower (e.g., 30-40%) because: Mexico's historical pattern strongly suggests sub-3% rates are common, structural labor market factors haven't fundamentally changed, and significant employment impacts from tariffs would likely take longer than a few months to materialize. I would update higher with evidence that Q1 2025 unemployment remained well below 3% (e.g., 2.5-2.7% range), or update lower with data showing rising unemployment trends in early 2025 or significant manufacturing job losses.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill Mexico's unemployment rate be under 3% in April 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nAP: [US tariffs ripple through auto supply chains into Mexico](https://apnews.com/article/mexico-stellantis-trump-tariffs-sheinbaum-569ae29d203b1997d50a3a9655c928a8)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if Mexico's unemployment rate is less than 3.0% for April 2025 according to data presented by [Trading Economics](https://tradingeconomics.com/mexico/unemployment-rate).\n\n\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nNo additional information available.\n\nToday is 2025-04-29.\n\nBefore answering you think:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n(e) You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
