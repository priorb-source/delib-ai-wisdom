    "review": "Both forecasters largely mirror my priors: short horizon, Cuomo narrowly leading, RCV as the key structural risk, and the importance of organizational/endorsement dynamics and turnout composition. New/useful emphasis from them: (1) the possibility that elite/union backing may be unusually tepid for Cuomo due to past controversies, capping his ceiling; (2) if Adams isn’t in the race, a vacuum in the moderate/outer-borough coalition that Cuomo could inherit—though that’s contingent and we lack confirming data. I also agree with their note that late-deciding, lower-information voters often gravitate to the best-known candidate, which favors Cuomo. None of their points contradict my view; they modestly sharpen the downside risk from transfers and consolidation against a polarizing frontrunner.",
    "rationale": "My base case remains a slight edge to Cuomo: he appears to lead in recent polling and benefits from name recognition, fragmented opposition, and the short runway to Election Day. RCV is the principal hazard—Cuomo’s second-choice appeal is likely weak, so a consolidated anti-Cuomo transfer stream could flip a narrow first-round lead. Countervailing factors include ballot exhaustion (which typically helps the first-round leader) and the tendency of late deciders to break toward the most familiar name. The deliberation reinforced the vulnerability on elite/union endorsements and coalition-building; given that we lack evidence of decisive establishment alignment for Cuomo, I nudge my probability down slightly to reflect capped upside and RCV exposure. Triggers I’d watch in the final stretch: credible RCV-modeled polls, endorsement cascades, and turnout signals by borough. Absent new data, a narrow Cuomo advantage remains the most likely outcome, but with considerable downside risk from transfers and late consolidation against him.",
