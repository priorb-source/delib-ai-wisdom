    "review": "Both forecasters emphasize the extremely low base rate, short timeline, and the preliminary nature of the Secret Service inquiry—points I agree with. Forecaster 2 adds a useful legal reference (Watts v. United States) alongside the true-threat standard, complementing my earlier Counterman reference; this further supports the view that the seashell post is unlikely to meet prosecutable standards. Forecaster 3 underscores procedural frictions (grand jury, approvals) and historical precedent, which align with my assessment. The only push toward a higher probability is their emphasis on the “any arrest, anywhere, any reason” clause and political tail risk—both of which I had already incorporated. I find their reasoning solid but not additive enough to move me off my prior estimate.",
    "rationale": "The status quo remains strongly in favor of no arrest: no public indication of charges, warrants, or grand jury activity; an ambiguous post that likely falls short of a true threat under Counterman/Watts standards; and very little time for an extraordinary, high-profile arrest to materialize. The broad resolution criterion slightly elevates tail risk (e.g., unrelated incidents), but for a cautious, high-profile figure like Comey, that background risk is minuscule. Political dynamics could, in theory, accelerate action, but absent concrete signs of prosecutorial movement, the best forecast remains near the floor. I would update up only on credible reporting of charges, a warrant, or imminent custodial action; I would update down as days pass with no developments or if the SS inquiry is reported closed.",
