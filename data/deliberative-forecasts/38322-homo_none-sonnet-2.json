    "review": "Both forecasters provide valuable historical context I lacked. Forecaster 2's data point that the all-time low was approximately 50.0 in June 2022 is crucial - it demonstrates that sub-54.0 readings, while extreme, have occurred in very recent history. Forecaster 3's reference to the Great Recession bottom at 55.8 provides important perspective that even severe recessions don't necessarily breach 54.0. However, June 2022's reading of ~50.0 proves it's possible. Both forecasters appropriately emphasize base rates and the stabilization principle - sentiment typically doesn't continue plummeting indefinitely after initial shocks. Forecaster 2's 18% seems to weight historical rarity heavily, while Forecaster 3's 30% matches my original forecast. The key insight is that June 2022 demonstrated sub-54.0 is achievable during severe economic stress, but it remains an extreme outcome requiring crisis-level conditions.",
    "rationale": "After reviewing the other forecasters' arguments, I'm adjusting my forecast slightly downward. The historical reference points are persuasive: while June 2022 did reach ~50.0 during peak inflation concerns, this was exceptional rather than typical. The Great Recession only reaching 55.8 suggests that even major economic crises don't reliably breach 54.0. The stabilization principle is also compelling - after initial tariff-related shocks referenced in the Axios article, sentiment is more likely to stabilize than continue deteriorating. However, I'm not moving as low as Forecaster 2's 18% because: (1) June 2022 proved sub-54.0 is achievable in modern conditions, (2) the question background explicitly references a sentiment plunge suggesting genuine deterioration, and (3) we lack current data proving we're safely above the threshold. The timing factor remains important - we're early in June, and if preliminary readings show stability above 55, the probability would drop significantly. Conversely, if May or early June preliminary data approached 54, probability would rise sharply.",
