  "information": "The government of Benin closed its land border crossings with Nigeria's Kwara state around May 6-8, 2025. The specific crossing mentioned is between Taberu village in Baruten Local Government Area, Kwara State, and the neighboring Tanu village in Benin. On May 9, 2025, Benin extended its border security operations to the Sèmè and Owode borders in Lagos State. Stated reasons for the closure include concerns over arms smuggling, the emergence of a new militant group known as 'Mahmuda', and unregulated exportation of agricultural products like soya beans and cashews. Reports mentioned intelligence regarding the illegal importation of arms and ammunition from Parakou, Benin, into Nigeria.\n\nOn May 14, 2025, the Nigerian House of Representatives passed a resolution urging the Federal Government to engage in dialogue with the Republic of Benin to resolve the blockade. The motion highlighted the strain on bilateral relations and the disruption to seasonal trade critical to the livelihood of border communities. As of late May 2025, neither the Nigerian nor the Beninese government had issued any public statements suggesting an imminent reopening. On May 30, an AFRICOM briefing noted a deteriorating security threat environment along the Benin-Nigeria frontier.\n\nHistorical data on similar situations in West Africa show that border closures motivated by security concerns often persist for many months. For example, Nigeria's border closure with Benin in 2019-2020 lasted for about 16 months. Similarly, Benin's border with Niger, closed after the 2023 coup, remained shut many months later. A review of 15 security-related border closures in the ECOWAS region since 2015 indicates that approximately 20% were reopened within 60 days. Reopenings within two months are more common when the reasons are purely commercial or administrative, rather than related to terrorism or arms smuggling.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "31 days (from May 31, 2025 to July 1, 2025)",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No - the border remains closed",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Security concerns persist or worsen. The Mahmuda militant group remains active, arms smuggling continues, and neither government feels conditions have improved sufficiently to justify reopening. Diplomatic dialogue proceeds slowly without breakthrough, and both countries prioritize security over economic considerations in the near term.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Rapid diplomatic intervention succeeds through ECOWAS mediation or bilateral talks. Both governments agree to implement immediate joint security measures (increased patrols, screening procedures, intelligence sharing) that address Benin's concerns. The Mahmuda threat is contained or downgraded, allowing a phased reopening with enhanced security protocols before July 1.",
    "rationale": "The status quo strongly favors the border remaining closed. The closure is only 23-25 days old as of today, addressing serious security concerns including terrorism and arms smuggling - not merely commercial disputes. Historical precedent is particularly unfavorable: Nigeria's previous border closure with Benin lasted 16 months (2019-2020), and only 20% of security-related border closures in ECOWAS since 2015 reopened within 60 days. Most critically, AFRICOM's May 30 briefing reported a deteriorating (not improving) security environment along this frontier. With only 31 days remaining until the July 1 deadline, there's been no credible reporting of diplomatic breakthroughs or concrete progress toward reopening. The Nigerian House of Representatives' May 14 resolution shows engagement but not results. My forecast is not lower (5-10%) because diplomatic interventions can occasionally produce rapid results, especially with ECOWAS mechanisms available and economic pressure from affected communities. However, it's not higher (30-40%) because there's zero current evidence of movement toward resolution, the stated security concerns are serious and ongoing, and the timeframe is extremely compressed. For me to revise upward, I would need to see: credible reports of high-level diplomatic meetings with positive outcomes, joint security agreements announced, or statements from either government indicating imminent reopening. For me to revise downward, further deterioration of security or explicit statements that the border will remain closed long-term would be decisive.",
