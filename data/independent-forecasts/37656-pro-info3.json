  "information": "The executive action has prompted debate in Congress. Some Republican senators, including Lisa Murkowski of Alaska, have expressed support for public media, citing the importance of local programming and emergency alerts in rural communities. Federal funding is considered crucial for many local stations, with some receiving up to 25% of their annual revenues from the federal government. According to their respective CEOs, about 15% of the public network's budget comes from public funds for PBS, while NPR receives less than 5% of its budget from the CPB.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Approximately six weeks.",
    "status_quo_outcome": "The objective's status remains 'in progress' on the spreadsheet, as the legislative or executive action required to stop funding has not been fully completed and signed into law. This would result in a 'No' outcome.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Legislation to defund the Corporation for Public Broadcasting (CPB) stalls in Congress due to a Senate filibuster or opposition from moderate Republicans. Any executive actions taken to halt funding are caught up in legal challenges and are not definitive. Consequently, the tracker's administrators do not change the status from 'in progress' by the July 1, 2025 deadline.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "In a surprise move, Republican leadership attaches the defunding of the CPB to a must-pass piece of legislation. It successfully passes both the House and the Senate and is immediately signed into law by the President. The administrators of the Project 2025 Tracker quickly update the spreadsheet to mark the objective as 'complete' before the deadline.",
    "rationale": "My forecast is heavily weighted by the status quo and the significant procedural hurdles required to achieve the 'Yes' outcome within the short, six-week timeframe. The current status of the objective is 'in progress', and changing that to 'complete' would necessitate a definitive, legally-binding action, such as a law being passed and signed. The US legislative process is deliberately slow, especially for contentious issues like federal funding for public media. The information from my research assistant is critical, as it highlights dissent within the Republican party itself. The fact that senators like Lisa Murkowski, whose rural constituents rely on public broadcasting, oppose defunding indicates that securing the necessary votes in the Senate would be extremely difficult, likely impossible to overcome a filibuster. The timeline of just six weeks is simply not realistic for navigating this complex political landscape and passing such a bill. The question is not about political will, but about the hard reality of legislative procedure and timelines. My probability is not lower than 2% because there is a small, non-zero chance that the defunding measure could be attached to an unrelated 'must-pass' bill, bypassing some of the standard debate and procedural delays. My probability is not higher because this route is still highly unlikely and would face immense political opposition and procedural challenges. I would increase my forecast if Senate leadership announced a concrete and viable plan to pass the measure with confirmed votes, and I would decrease it if a bipartisan group of senators publicly pledged to block any such attempts.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill the Project 2025 Tracker spreadsheet have the objective of stopping funding for NPR and PBS marked as complete before July 1, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nAt the time of this question, the objective was marked as \"in progress.\" The 2025 Tracker is a project of the Keep_Track subreddit and is explained [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/Keep_Track/comments/1ii7tbr/project_2025_tracker_is_now_live/).\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if the Project 2025 objective to \"stop funding for NPR and PBS\" is marked as complete according to [this spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1QGG6wNHna-1tt91yXNkOauAJJ7snobFjfEnmxlmzhl4/edit?gid=0#gid=0) before July 1, 2025. If it is anything other than complete (such as \"in progress\") when accessed by Metaculus on or after July 1, 2025, then the question resolves as **No**.\n\n\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nThe executive action has prompted debate in Congress.

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
