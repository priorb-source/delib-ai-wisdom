    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "32 days (until July 1, 2025)",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No - at least one escapee remains at large",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Even one of the 10 escapees successfully evades capture beyond July 1, 2025. This could occur if they leave the immediate area, receive outside assistance, or successfully blend into a community. The longer escapees remain free, the harder they typically become to locate, and history shows that in most large jailbreaks, at least one individual manages to evade capture for extended periods.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Law enforcement successfully locates and recaptures or kills all remaining escapees within the next 32 days. This would require sustained manhunt efforts, tips from the public, and potentially escapees making mistakes that lead to their discovery. The intensive resources typically devoted to jail escape manhunts, including state and federal assistance, could lead to rapid recaptures in the coming weeks.",
    "rationale": "The escape occurred 14 days ago on May 16, 2025. According to the article from May 19, seven escapees remained at large at that time, suggesting three had already been recaptured within the first three days. This indicates an active and somewhat successful manhunt effort. However, the critical challenge here is the all-or-nothing nature of the question requiring ALL 10 to be recaptured. Historical patterns of jailbreaks show that while most escapees are typically caught within the first few weeks, achieving 100% recapture is significantly more difficult. The easier-to-catch individuals are usually apprehended first, while those who remain at large are often more resourceful, have better support networks, or have fled farther from the area. With 32 days remaining, there is substantial time for continued manhunt operations, but also enough time for capable escapees to establish themselves in hiding. The status quo suggests at least some escapees remain free, and the longer they stay free, the lower the probability of universal recapture. The requirement for ALL 10 creates a high bar - even 90% success (9 of 10) would result in a No resolution. My forecast is not higher because complete recapture in jailbreak cases is historically uncommon within such timeframes, and not lower because there is still significant time and resources being devoted to the manhunt, with early success showing the effort is bearing fruit.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill all 10 inmates who escaped from jail in New Orleans on May 16, 2025 be recaptured before July 1, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\n[Manhunt continues Monday for 7 Orleans jail escapees as state launches investigation](https://www.fox8live.com/2025/05/19/manhunt-continues-monday-7-orleans-jail-escapees-state-launches-investigation/)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if before July 1, 2025, all 10 inmates who escaped from jail in the [2025 New Orleans jailbreak](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2025_New_Orleans_jailbreak) have been either recaptured or killed, according to [credible sources](https://www.metaculus.com/faq/#definitions). If any are still at large on July 1, 2025, then the question resolves as **No**.\n\n\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nNo additional information available.\n\nToday is 2025-05-30.\n\nBefore answering you think:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n(e) You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
