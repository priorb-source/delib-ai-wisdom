  "information": "The People's National Movement (PNM) is the incumbent party, having won the 2020 general election with 21 out of 41 seats. The main opposition, the United National Congress (UNC), won the remaining 19 seats. The country uses a first-past-the-post electoral system. Historically, the PNM has won the majority of general elections held since the year 2000.\n\nThe upcoming election on April 28, 2025, is an early election triggered by the resignation of former Prime Minister Keith Rowley. The PNM is now led by Prime Minister Stuart Young. Reports indicate that the opposition UNC has formed a coalition with the Congress of the People (COP). Among the issues raised during the campaign are high crime rates and concerns about electoral transparency, which prompted the presence of Commonwealth election observers. Former Attorney General John Jeremie has publicly endorsed the UNC.\n\nA poll conducted by Guardian TT between April 10-13, with research by pollster Hamid Ghany, indicated that the PNM was positioned to benefit from vote-splitting in Tobago's two key seats between the Tobago Progressive Democratic Patriots (TPP) and the Progressive Democratic Patriots (PDP), potentially allowing the PNM to win both. The same poll identified that 20% of the electorate was undecided or planning to split their vote. A separate poll by WIC News showed the UNC at 72% and the PNM at 18%.",

    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Approximately one week. The election is scheduled for April 28, 2025, and the outcome should be known within 24-48 hours after polls close.",
    "status_quo_outcome": "The People's National Movement (PNM), as the incumbent party that has won the majority of recent elections, retains power by winning a plurality of seats.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "The United National Congress (UNC) coalition capitalizes on public discontent with high crime rates and questions of transparency, swaying the large bloc of undecided voters and winning key marginal seats to secure a plurality.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Despite a challenging political environment, the PNM leverages the power of incumbency and its historical strongholds. The PNM benefits from opposition vote-splitting in Tobago's two key seats, allowing it to secure a narrow plurality.",
    "rationale": "My forecast is based on the significant advantage of incumbency and historical precedent, weighed against recent political developments and uncertain polling data. The People's National Movement (PNM) is the incumbent party and has a track record of electoral success, which forms a strong baseline for this forecast. The first-past-the-post system means the election will be decided in a few marginal seats. A key factor supporting the PNM is the Guardian TT poll's finding that vote-splitting between opposition parties in Tobago's two seats could hand both to the PNM, a potentially decisive advantage in a tight race. However, the political environment presents challenges for the incumbent. An early election triggered by the PM's resignation, coupled with an opposition coalition (UNC-COP) and a high-profile endorsement for the opposition, suggests momentum against the PNM. The polling data is conflicting and unreliable. The WIC News poll showing a 72% to 18% lead for the UNC is a massive outlier compared to historical election results (which are typically close) and should be heavily discounted. The Guardian TT poll's finding of a 20% undecided electorate is more credible and represents the primary source of uncertainty; the outcome likely hinges on how this group votes. I have placed the probability slightly in favor of the PNM because incumbency is a powerful force, and the most dramatic piece of evidence for an opposition landslide (the WIC poll) is not credible. The probability is not higher because the opposition coalition, negative campaign issues for the government, and the large number of undecideds create a very real path to victory for the UNC. My forecast would increase if credible, non-outlier polls showed a clear PNM lead. It would decrease if polls indicated the undecideds were breaking heavily towards the UNC-COP coalition or if a major scandal emerged affecting the incumbent party.",
