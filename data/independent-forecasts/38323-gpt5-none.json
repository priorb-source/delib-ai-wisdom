    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "About 23 days (final reading expected Friday, June 27, 2025)",
    "status_quo_outcome": "Yes — recent Michigan Consumer Sentiment readings have been in the mid-to-high 60s, above 60.0",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "June sentiment deteriorates further on negative macro news (e.g., hotter-than-expected CPI on June 12, a risk-off market drop, rising gasoline prices, tariff headlines lifting inflation expectations), pulling the final June index down into the high-50s to 60.0 range.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Sentiment holds near May’s level or stabilizes after the May ‘plunge,’ aided by benign inflation data, steady labor market prints, and calm financial markets, leaving the final June index in the mid-60s or higher.",
    "rationale": "Baseline: The latest context (Axios, May 19, 2025) highlights a notable drop in sentiment tied to tariff/inflation concerns, but the level implied is still above 60. A further month-to-month fall of 7+ points would be required to cross ≤60. Such large incremental drops do occur but are not common absent a clear shock. The labor market remains relatively solid and inflation, while sticky, is not spiking. Given mean reversion tendencies and that large follow-on declines after a sharp fall are less frequent, the status quo (mid-to-high 60s) deserves extra weight. Key upcoming movers: May CPI (June 12) and the FOMC tone could swing expectations. A hot CPI print plus risk-off markets and higher gasoline prices could push sentiment below 60; conversely, a cooler CPI or resilient markets would likely keep it safely above 60. Research assistant provided no additional data, so I lean on base rates and recent historical levels. Why not higher? There is real downside risk from tariff/inflation narratives and potential negative June macro surprises; Michigan sentiment is sensitive to inflation expectations. Why not lower? Crossing ≤60 would require another sizable monthly leg down from an already depressed level; current macro does not strongly point to a recessionary shock. What would change my view: - Downside: June preliminary reading in the low 60s/high 50s; a clearly hot CPI print with rising inflation expectations and a sharp equity selloff; a notable uptick in gas prices. - Upside: A soft CPI print, dovish Fed tone, and stable/improving markets; June prelim holding mid-to-high 60s.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill the June 2025 University of Michigan Consumer Sentiment Final Report number be greater than 60.0?\n\nQuestion background:\nAxios: [Why the consumer sentiment plunge is different now](https://www.axios.com/2025/05/19/tariffs-consumer-economy-sentiment)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if the University of Michigan's reported June Final Results of the Index of Consumer Sentiment, expected to be posted [here](https://data.sca.isr.umich.edu/reports.php) on the final Friday of June 2025, is greater than 60.0 for June 2025. Less than or equal to that amount resolves the question as **No**.\n\n\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nNo additional information available.\n\nToday is 2025-06-04.\n\nBefore answering you think:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n(e) You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
