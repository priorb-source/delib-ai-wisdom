    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Approximately 6 weeks. The question resolves on or after July 1, 2025, and today is May 21, 2025.",
    "status_quo_outcome": "Yes. As of May 21, 2025, the resolution source lists 6 direct flight destinations from Koror, Palau (ROR), which is greater than the threshold of 5.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "The number of direct flight destinations drops to 5 or fewer by July 1, 2025. This would most likely occur if one of the current operating airlines, such as Air Niugini or Nauru Airlines, suspends its route to Palau due to low profitability, reflecting the ongoing struggles in the nation's tourism sector.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "The number of direct flight destinations remains at 6 or increases. This is the status quo scenario, where all current airlines continue their service to Palau through July 1. The outcome would also be Yes if a new route is added, though this is unlikely on such a short timescale.",
    "rationale": "My forecast is based primarily on the current status quo and the short time remaining until resolution.\n\n1.  **Status Quo:** The resolution source, flightsfrom.com, currently lists 6 direct flight destinations from Koror (ROR): Taipei (TPE), Manila (MNL), Guam (GUM), Brisbane (BNE), Port Moresby (POM), and Nauru (INU). Since 6 is greater than 5, the current situation is a 'Yes'. Inertia is a strong factor in forecasting, and with only six weeks until resolution, the existing state is the most likely outcome.\n\n2.  **Short Timeframe:** International airline schedules are typically set far in advance. It is uncommon for an airline to add or cancel a route with only six weeks' notice, absent a major external shock like a geopolitical crisis or airline failure. Tickets for flights through July 1st are already on sale.\n\n3.  **Rationale for Not Being Higher (Risk of Cancellation):** The primary risk that lowers the probability from near-certainty is the potential for route cancellation. The provided background information highlights the slow recovery of Palau's tourism sector. This economic pressure could make some routes unprofitable, particularly those operated by smaller regional carriers like Nauru Airlines or Air Niugini. A decision by just one of these airlines to suspend service would change the outcome to 'No'. My 80% forecast incorporates a 20% chance of such a cancellation occurring in the next six weeks.\n\n4.  **Rationale for Not Being Lower (Stability):** The probability is not lower because the core routes operated by larger carriers (United to GUM and MNL; China Airlines to TPE) appear stable due to established traffic and geopolitical ties. Furthermore, cancelling an international route on short notice is a significant operational and commercial decision that airlines generally avoid. The likelihood of the status quo holding for a mere six weeks remains high.\n\n5.  **Updating Conditions:** I would lower my forecast significantly upon news or strong rumors of any of the six current routes being suspended before July 1. I would raise my forecast if Palau's government announced new tourism incentives or if a new airline formally confirmed a start date for a new route before the resolution date.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill there be greater than 5 direct flight destinations from Koror, Palau on July 1, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nMarketplace: [Why hasn’t tourism recovered in Palau? Flights haven’t restarted in high volume since the pandemic drop-off, and South Koreans are booking their vacations elsewhere.](https://www.marketplace.org/story/2024/04/19/palau-tourism)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if there are greater than 5 direct flight destinations listed at the [All scheduled direct (non-stop) flights from Koror (ROR)](https://www.flightsfrom.com/ROR) tracker when checked by Metaculus on or after July 1, 2025.\n\n\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nNo additional information available.\n\nToday is 2025-05-21.\n\nBefore answering you think:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n(e) You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
