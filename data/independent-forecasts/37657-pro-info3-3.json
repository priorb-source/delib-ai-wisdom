  "information": "Historically, of the approximately 50 novel bat coronaviruses described in scientific literature since 2000, only SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 have produced confirmed human cases within a year of their first description. The rate of publicly reported accidental laboratory infections for such viruses is also low, estimated at approximately one per decade worldwide.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Approximately 1.5 months, as the resolution date is July 1, 2025.",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No. As of today, there are no reported human cases of HKU5-CoV-2.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "The July 1, 2025 deadline passes without any credible public health authority, such as the WHO or CDC, confirming a human infection with HKU5-CoV-2. Biosurveillance continues, but no zoonotic spillover or laboratory-acquired infection is detected.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "A laboratory researcher studying HKU5-CoV-2 has an accidental exposure and develops a confirmed infection, which is subsequently reported. Alternatively, a person in close contact with the virus's animal reservoir becomes infected, and the case is diagnosed and publicly confirmed by a credible source before the deadline.",
    "rationale": "My forecast heavily relies on the status quo and the low base rate of zoonotic spillover for newly discovered coronaviruses. The research assistant's report indicates that of approximately 50 novel bat coronaviruses described since 2000, only two (SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2) resulted in confirmed human cases within a year of description. This suggests a low intrinsic probability for any given novel virus to make the jump to humans and be detected. The probability is further diminished by the extremely short time frame remaining until the July 1, 2025 deadline, which is only about six weeks. Rare events are even rarer in short time windows. Additionally, the rate of accidental laboratory infections is cited as being very low, at roughly one per decade worldwide for all such viruses, making this specific pathway for a 'Yes' outcome also highly improbable within the given timeframe. \n\nMy forecast is not higher because there is currently no specific evidence to suggest HKU5-CoV-2 is unusually primed for human transmission (e.g., high affinity for human ACE2 receptors) or that there is an active, uncontained outbreak in an animal population with high human contact. \n\nMy forecast is not lower (e.g., 0.1%) because spillover events and lab accidents, while rare, are stochastic and unpredictable. The history of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 demonstrates that such events, though low-probability, are not impossible. A 1% forecast acknowledges this tail risk. \n\nI would increase my forecast if genetic sequencing data showed HKU5-CoV-2 had features concerning for human transmission, or if credible reports emerged of unusual pneumonia clusters in the region where the virus was discovered.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill there be any human cases of the novel coronavirus, HKU5-CoV-2, before July 1, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\n[Discovery of HKU5-CoV-2, a Novel Coronavirus in China](https://assure-test.com/discovery-of-hku5-cov-2-a-novel-coronavirus-in-china/)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if before July 1, 2025, there are any human cases reported anywhere globally of HKU5-CoV-2.\n\nQuestion resolves according to [credible sources](https://www.metaculus.com/help/faq/#definitions), especially the World Health Organization or US Centers for Disease Control.\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nHistorically, of the approximately 50 novel bat coronaviruses described in scientific literature since 2000, only SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 have produced confirmed human cases within a year of their first description. The rate of publicly reported accidental laboratory infections for such viruses is also low, estimated at approximately one per decade worldwide.\n\nToday is 2025-05-16.\n\nBefore answering you think:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n(e) You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
