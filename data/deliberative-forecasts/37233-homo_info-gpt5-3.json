    "review": "Both forecasters emphasize timing norms and the absence of a known May RHDP event, which aligns with my prior view. New to me from Forecaster 2 is Ouattara’s January message to the diplomatic corps (healthy, ready to serve, but undecided, and stressing multiple RHDP options), which supports intentional delay past May. New from Forecaster 3 is the accumulation of elite signals (ministers saying he’ll be the candidate; a youth push in late April) that the party favors his running—this slightly increases the chance of an early lock-in, but it doesn’t by itself force a May declaration. I find the argument that third‑party endorsements don’t resolve the question compelling, and the lack of a publicized May congress remains a key constraint. Overall, I’m persuaded to nudge up slightly for intra‑party momentum, but the status quo still favors no May declaration.",
    "rationale": "- Time window: ~1 month remains, and Ivoirian/West African incumbents often declare closer to party investiture or filing deadlines. In 2020 Ouattara declared in early August.\n- Incentives: With opposition weakened (Thiam ruling; Gbagbo excluded; Soro constrained), there’s little urgency to declare early. Early declaration risks galvanizing opposition and creating lame‑duck dynamics inside government.\n- Signals: Pro‑Ouattara elite signaling (ministers and youth calls) increases the plausibility of a May move to consolidate party unity. However, Ouattara’s January remarks about not having decided and highlighting multiple RHDP candidates suggest deliberate pacing and preserved optionality. Crucially, there is no credible reporting of a May RHDP congress or investiture date that would necessitate a May declaration.\n- Net effect: Elite momentum slightly raises the chance of a May announcement, but absent a scheduled party event or publicized address, the base case is continued ambiguity into June.\nGiven these factors, I make a small upward adjustment from 27% to reflect intra‑party pressure without overriding the timing and structural incentives to wait.",
