    "review": "Forecaster 2 underscores how hard it is for any single term to appear on both front pages every day for ~35 days, and notes the EU deadline slip to July 9 reduces June’s urgency. I find this persuasive and broadly aligned with my prior view that the bar for a Yes is low. Forecaster 3 stresses the difficulty of simultaneous omission because NYT and WSJ cover different angles and WSJ’s “What’s News” often includes tariffs. That’s a good corrective—simultaneous omission is the key hurdle—but it likely overweights persistence given the long window and the literal-word requirement (synonyms like “duties/levies” won’t count). I also think correlation cuts both ways: on truly quiet tariff days, both are more likely to omit together, especially with big competing news (SCOTUS decisions, FOMC/CPI, major geopolitics) crowding the front page in June. Overall, F2’s argument about the improbability of flawless daily presence across two outlets is stronger than F3’s low estimate.",
    "rationale": "The event resolves Yes if there is a single day through June 30 when neither front page includes the literal word “tariff” or “tariffs.” The EU 50% tariff deadline is now July 9, reducing June’s deadline-driven cadence. While tariffs remain salient and WSJ’s format increases daily mention odds, the long window and synonym effect raise the chance of at least one clean day. I model a small but nontrivial per-day probability of simultaneous omission (on the order of 3–4%): 1 − (0.96^35) ≈ 76% or 1 − (0.97^35) ≈ 66%, implying a central estimate in the low 70s. I’m nudging up slightly from my prior 70% to reflect Forecaster 2’s point about the difficulty of sustained, perfect coverage and the likelihood that major June news cycles (SCOTUS rulings, macro prints) create lulls. I’m not higher because Forecaster 3’s point about simultaneous omission and WSJ’s consistent tariff coverage is real, and persistent presidential rhetoric could keep the term appearing frequently.",
