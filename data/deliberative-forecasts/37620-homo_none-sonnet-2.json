    "review": "All three forecasters have converged on remarkably similar estimates (20%, 20%, 25%), which is notable given we analyzed independently. This convergence validates the core analytical framework we're all using. The other forecasters reinforced key considerations I had identified: the compressed 20-day timeframe, the lack of evidence of actual transition procedures underway, the status quo bias in authoritarian political systems, and the gap between political statements and actual implementation. Forecaster 2 usefully emphasized the absence of reported transition procedures being initiated, while Forecaster 3 highlighted health issues as a potential accelerant. Both provided more specific update thresholds than I did. However, neither introduced fundamentally new information or arguments that challenge my reasoning. The key tension remains identical across all three analyses: a significant recent statement versus an extremely short timeframe for implementation. The convergence of independent forecasts in the 20-25% range actually increases my confidence that this probability range accurately captures the uncertainty.",
    "rationale": "Upon reviewing the other forecasters' analyses, I find my original reasoning well-supported and don't see compelling evidence to update. All three of us independently identified the same core factors: Kadyrov's May 6 statement is significant but the 20-day window is extremely compressed for a major political transition in Russia's system. We all noted the absence of concrete transition mechanisms being reported, the typical slow pace of such changes requiring Kremlin coordination, and the status quo bias favoring continuity. The convergence at 20-25% from three independent analysts suggests this range is well-calibrated given available information. No new evidence has emerged since the May 6 statement. The statement itself warrants taking this possibility seriously (hence not 5-10%), but the extreme time compression and lack of visible transition planning warrant significant skepticism (hence not 40%+). Twenty percent appropriately captures the probability that either rapid behind-the-scenes coordination has already occurred or that urgent circumstances (health, political) could force accelerated action within 20 days.",
