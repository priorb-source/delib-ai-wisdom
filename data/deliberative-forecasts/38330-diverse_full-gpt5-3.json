    "review": "Both forecasters correctly emphasize the very short window and NYT’s tendency to avoid adopting niche or state-promoted jargon. Forecaster 2 adds a useful point: if the Russian decree’s official English rendering uses “reverse purchase,” that increases replication risk in NYT coverage. Forecaster 3’s note that the trend has existed for months without NYT pickup is a solid base-rate argument against sudden adoption. One nuance not highlighted: the resolution depends on exact-string search for “reverse purchasing” or “reverse purchase.” Hyphenation (e.g., “reverse-purchasing”) or near-phrases (“reverse repurchase,” “buyback,” “reverse auction”) won’t count, further lowering odds. Overall, F2’s argument marginally raises risk via the Russia angle; F3’s base-rate and style-prefs keep the forecast low.",
    "rationale": "My prior was 7%, driven by: (1) a very narrow 21-day window; (2) NYT style and copy standards favoring clearer or established terms (“buy back,” “repurchase,” “shopping tourism”) over “reverse purchasing/purchase”; and (3) the exact-match search constraint. The added deliberation doesn’t materially change the fundamentals, but I acknowledge a small upside tail: if the Russian asset policy is formally implemented/expanded and English-language documents or wires use “reverse purchase,” NYT might mirror the term in a quote or explainer. That marginally increases the chance. Conversely, the China consumer story’s term adoption in NYT still seems unlikely; even if they cover the phenomenon, they’ll likely avoid the exact phrase or use hyphenation that wouldn’t satisfy the search. On balance, I make a slight upward adjustment to reflect the official-terminology replication risk from the Russia angle while keeping the forecast low due to timing, base rates, and style norms.",
