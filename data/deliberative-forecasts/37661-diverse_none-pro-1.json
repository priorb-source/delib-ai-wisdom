    "review": "The other forecasters provided a crucial and sobering perspective that I had undervalued in my initial analysis. I was overly optimistic, basing my forecast primarily on a year-old 'final approval'. Forecaster 2 was right to relentlessly focus on the extremely tight 6-week timeline as the dominant constraint and to list the numerous concrete, time-consuming steps (ground stations, permits, infrastructure) that happen *after* approval. Forecaster 3's reasoning was also highly convincing, particularly the distinction between a high-level political green light and the completion of all operational and licensing formalities. Their mention of specific potential friction points unique to the region, like data localization requirements, and their use of base rates from other Starlink rollouts (some fast, some slow) provided a much more nuanced framework than my own. Both analysts correctly interpreted the lack of recent news as a bearish, rather than neutral, signal.",
    "rationale": "I am significantly revising my forecast downwards from 65% to 35%. My initial reasoning was flawed; I interpreted the year-long gap since the leader's approval as a period of quiet preparation, but the other forecasters have convinced me it is more likely indicative of slow-moving bureaucracy and unresolved complexities. The most compelling argument that changed my mind is the emphasis on the short 6-week deadline. As the other analysts detailed, launching service in a new country involves a complex logistical and regulatory checklist that is highly unlikely to be completed in such a short period without prior, visible signs of progress. The status quo—Bangladesh not being listed as 'Available'—has a great deal of inertia. While the political will is a necessary condition for launch, it is not sufficient. The lack of any subsequent positive news, such as ground station construction or official license issuance from the BTRC, makes a launch before July 1st improbable. I am not lowering my forecast to zero because, as Forecaster 3 noted, Starlink can sometimes execute very quickly using regional gateways and laser links, and the top-level approval could, in theory, accelerate the final steps dramatically. However, the balance of probabilities has shifted heavily towards 'No' due to the severe time constraint.",
