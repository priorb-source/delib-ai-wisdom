    "review": "Both forecasters converge on the same core points I used: short time window, inertia favors no termination, the key risk is CFIUS/White House pressure rather than antitrust, and an outside date near late June would be the primary catalyst for a pre–July 1 termination. They add no new factual developments but reinforce process priors and the requirement that an 8‑K be filed (not merely a decision made) before July 1. One nuance I’d add is SEC timing: if an outside‑date termination occurred late on June 30, an 8‑K filed after the SEC’s same‑day timestamp cut‑off could be dated July 1, which slightly reduces the chance of meeting the resolution’s strict criterion even if the deal were terminated at month‑end.",
    "rationale": "With ~46 days left, a formal 8‑K termination before July 1 still looks less likely than continued review or an extension. The deal’s political sensitivity (USW opposition, bipartisan scrutiny) sustains nontrivial tail risk of a CFIUS/White House block or a refusal to extend an outside date. However, outright prohibitions are rare, Japan is a close ally, and parties typically extend rather than abandon if they believe a mitigation path exists. The resolution’s requirement that an 8‑K be filed before July 1 raises the bar further—especially if any outside date is June 30, where filing logistics could push the 8‑K into July even if termination occurs. Netting these, I make a small downward adjustment from my prior 25% to 24%, reflecting both consensus reasoning and the filing‑timing nuance. I would move up on credible leaks of a negative CFIUS recommendation or explicit White House intent to prohibit, or confirmation that a June 30 outside date will not be extended. I would move down on evidence of an extension beyond July 1 or concrete progress on a mitigation agreement.",
