    "review": "The other forecasters raise several important points I had not fully considered. Most significantly, Forecaster 3 introduces new information about a May 30 AFRICOM briefing noting a 'deteriorating security threat environment' - this is a critical negative indicator suggesting conditions are worsening rather than improving. Forecaster 2 highlights the extension of the closure to Lagos State borders on May 9, just days after the initial closure - this escalation signal is important evidence that Benin is expanding rather than relaxing its position. Forecaster 3 also notes the Nigerian House of Representatives resolution on May 14 urging dialogue, which represents domestic political pressure for reopening that I hadn't weighted sufficiently. However, both forecasters correctly observe there has been no public evidence of progress from these diplomatic gestures. While Forecaster 2's 25% seems somewhat optimistic given the deteriorating security situation and escalation pattern, and Forecaster 3's 18% appears well-reasoned, I find the combination of escalation (Lagos extension), deteriorating security (AFRICOM briefing), and absence of negotiation progress to be strong negative indicators that warrant staying on the lower end of these estimates.",
    "rationale": "After reviewing the other forecasters' analyses, I believe the key new evidence reinforces a conservative forecast while suggesting I was slightly too pessimistic. The escalation to Lagos State borders and the AFRICOM briefing about deteriorating security are powerful negative signals I now weight more heavily. However, the House resolution does indicate meaningful domestic pressure that could accelerate diplomatic efforts. My original 12% may have underweighted this pressure slightly. The timeframe remains extremely compressed at 31 days for addressing terrorism concerns, arms smuggling, and bilateral security coordination. The extension of the closure just days after the initial closure strongly suggests Benin views this as a serious, sustained policy rather than a temporary measure. The deteriorating security environment per AFRICOM means the underlying conditions are worsening, not improving. While economic pressure and political resolutions create some possibility of rapid resolution, the combination of escalation, deteriorating security, very recent closure, and zero evidence of progress in negotiations all point strongly toward continued closure through July 1st. I'm updating slightly upward from 12% to 15% to account for the political pressure and economic incentives, but remaining well below the other forecasters due to the compelling negative indicators.",
