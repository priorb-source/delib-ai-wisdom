    "review": "Both forecasters raise critical points I underweighted. Forecaster 3's observation about the resolution criteria is particularly important: the question requires the IMF to agree to provide money, which typically means Board approval, not just a staff-level agreement. This is a significantly higher bar than I initially considered. Both forecasters also provide crucial historical context I missed: a Staff-Level Agreement has existed since April 2022, yet Lebanon has failed to implement the required 'prior actions' for over three years. This pattern of sustained political gridlock despite an existing framework agreement is powerful evidence against optimism. The finance minister's confidence statement, which I treated as a positive signal, should indeed be heavily discounted as 'cheap talk' given this track record. Finally, both forecasters correctly emphasize that 31 days is insufficient to overcome structural political barriers (caretaker government, no president, entrenched interests blocking banking reforms) that have persisted for years. My research assistant provided no evidence of imminent breakthroughs, passed legislation, or IMF signaling—which reinforces the status quo of inaction.",
    "rationale": "Upon reflection, my initial 30% was far too optimistic. I failed to adequately account for: (1) the higher bar of Board approval versus staff-level agreement, (2) the three-year history of complete stalemate despite an existing SLA framework, (3) the absence of any concrete evidence that prior actions are being completed, and (4) the structural political impediments that remain unchanged. The minister's confidence should be discounted as political posturing rather than substantive signal. However, I don't go quite as low as 8-10% because: (1) economic crises can occasionally force rapid political shifts, (2) the IMF could theoretically approve emergency financing (RFI) with lower conditionality if circumstances warrant, (3) one month, while very short, is not zero time, and (4) there remains irreducible uncertainty about unforeseen developments. The probability should reflect that this outcome is highly unlikely but not impossible.",
