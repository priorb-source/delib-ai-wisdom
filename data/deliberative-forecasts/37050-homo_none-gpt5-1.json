    "review": "Both forecasters emphasize a lower event base rate than I initially used and highlight the recent 2024 reshuffle as a reason to expect a “settling” period. They also flag the same catalysts I considered (M&A, splits, acute crises, notably Boeing), and note announcement timing can be abrupt—which I already accounted for. The main new point is a more conservative historical cadence estimate (closer to ~0.3 events/year) than my ~0.6, which argues for a slightly lower probability in a 2‑month window.",
    "rationale": "Re-anchoring to history: From ~2010–2024 there have been roughly five change events (2013, 2015, 2018, 2020, 2024), implying ~0.33 events/year. Over ~0.18 years (67 days), a naive Poisson suggests ~6% baseline for at least one change. Given the committee can act without warning and there are plausible but not currently acute catalysts (Boeing, 3M, representational tweaks like adding Alphabet/Meta), a small premium over base is warranted. Conversely, the 2024 refresh reduces near‑term odds, and there are no visible imminent triggers (major splits, definitive M&A, or a sudden sector imbalance). Net: I slightly reduce from 10% to reflect the more conservative base rate while retaining a tail risk premium for surprise announcements.",
