  "information": "As of May 2025, the number of active destinations was estimated to be around 39, based on OAG schedule data, down from 53 in May 2024. A number of airlines that suspended routes in October 2023, including British Airways, Lufthansa Group, Saudia, EgyptAir, and Pegasus, had not fully returned. Key Gulf carriers like Kuwait Airways and Qatar Airways also remained absent. Lebanon’s tourism ministry has projected that summer arrivals for 2025 will be 30% below 2019 levels.",

    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "About 40 days (until July 1, 2025)",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Cross‑border tensions persist into June, aviation insurers keep war-risk premiums high, and suspended carriers (e.g., BA, Lufthansa Group, Saudia, EgyptAir, Pegasus, Kuwait Airways, Qatar Airways) do not return by July 1. MEA and a handful of regionals maintain a trimmed network, seasonal additions are limited, and FlightsFrom lists roughly 35–45 destinations.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "A clear de-escalation triggers rapid restorations: multiple major carriers formally reinstate BEY service for the summer season and MEA adds several seasonal Mediterranean routes. Combined seasonal and reinstated services lift listed non-stop destinations to 52+ on FlightsFrom by July 1.",
    "rationale": "Baseline: The research assistant reports ~39 active destinations in May 2025 (OAG), down from 53 in May 2024, with key carriers still absent (BA, Lufthansa Group, Saudia, EgyptAir, Pegasus; also Kuwait Airways and Qatar Airways). Lebanon’s tourism ministry expects summer 2025 arrivals ~30% below 2019, indicating muted demand. Background news points to ongoing security concerns and weak hospitality conditions. The outcome depends on the FlightsFrom BEY page on/after July 1, which generally reflects scheduled non-stop destinations for the current season. To exceed 51, BEY would need a net gain of roughly 13+ destinations within ~6 weeks. Given airline planning lead times, safety/insurance constraints, and current geopolitical risk, large-scale resumptions by multiple major carriers before July 1 look unlikely. Seasonal summer routes could add some Mediterranean leisure points, but with several Gulf and European carriers still not operating, those additions likely won’t bridge the full gap. Why not higher: There is limited time for schedule rebuilds; insurers and corporate risk policies tend to change slowly; the tourism outlook is soft; and multiple absent carriers would need to return in concert. Why not lower: A non-trivial upside exists if there is an unexpected security de-escalation plus quick reinstatements and seasonal boosts—MEA could add niche leisure points, and some regionals could re-enter. What I’d watch to update up: concrete resumptions announced by any two or more of BA/LH/Saudia/Qatar/EgyptAir/Pegasus/Kuwait Airways effective by late June; NOTAM/insurance improvements; FlightsFrom showing mid-June listings >45. To update down: renewed escalations, further suspensions, or June schedules on FlightsFrom stagnating near ~35–40.",
