  "information": "As of mid-May 2025, the Colorado Rockies held a record of 8-38, equivalent to a .174 winning percentage. Their run differential was -128. The team's pitching staff ranked last in the league with a 5.80 ERA and a 1.599 WHIP. Offensively, they had the league's worst On-base Plus Slugging (OPS), the most strikeouts at 418, a low walk rate of 7.7%, and a low home run rate of 2.3%. The next-worst team in the league at the time, the Chicago White Sox, had a winning percentage approximately 112 points higher at .286.\n\nThe Rockies' 7-36 record through their first 43 games marked one of the worst starts in Major League Baseball's modern era. The team was on pace to finish the season with a 26-136 record, which would surpass the record for most losses in a season set by the 2024 Chicago White Sox (121 losses). Notable losses included a 21-0 defeat to the San Diego Padres, part of a three-game stretch where they allowed 55 runs, the most by any MLB team in a similar span since 1950. This followed seasons with 103 losses in 2023 and 101 in 2024. Pre-season PECOTA projections had forecast a .343 winning percentage for the Rockies in 2025.\n\nDuring the season, the Rockies' manager Bud Black was fired and replaced by Warren Schaeffer. Hitting coach Jordan Pacheco was also part of the new staff. On May 18, 2025, the team achieved a 14-12 comeback win against the Arizona Diamondbacks, which was their first victory under Schaeffer. A key contributor to this win was shortstop Ezequiel Tovar, who had recently returned from injury and went 5-for-5 with his first home run of the season. The team's upcoming schedule before June 15 included games against several high-performing teams.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Less than one month. The outcome will be determined on or after June 15, 2025.",
    "status_quo_outcome": "The Colorado Rockies have the lowest winning percentage in the MLB. If current trends continue, the outcome will be Yes.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "The recent managerial change and the return of shortstop Ezequiel Tovar spark a significant turnaround. The Rockies go on an unlikely winning streak through late May and early June. Simultaneously, another bottom-tier team, like the Chicago White Sox, enters a deep slump, causing their winning percentage to drop below the Rockies' improved record by the resolution date.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "The Rockies' historically poor performance continues. The underlying issues with their pitching and offense are not resolved by the mid-season managerial change. They continue to lose at a high rate against a tough upcoming schedule, maintaining the significant gap between their winning percentage and that of the next-worst team in the league through June 15.",
    "rationale": "My forecast is heavily influenced by the Rockies' current, historically poor standing. As of mid-May 2025, their .174 winning percentage is a massive .112 points lower than the next-worst team. To close such a large gap in less than a month is highly improbable. The team's fundamental statistics support this outlook; they rank last in nearly every major pitching and offensive category, including ERA (5.80), WHIP (1.599), and OPS. Their run differential of -128 indicates they are not just losing, but are fundamentally non-competitive. While a recent managerial change and a single comeback victory offer a glimmer of hope, such events rarely reverse the course of a team with such deep-seated performance issues, especially when facing a difficult upcoming schedule. The multi-year trend of 100+ loss seasons suggests systemic problems that a few personnel changes are unlikely to fix in the short term. My forecast is not higher than 95% to account for the inherent variance in baseball over a 25-30 game stretch; an unexpected hot streak for the Rockies combined with a collapse by another team, while extremely unlikely, is not impossible. My forecast is not lower because the statistical and performance gap between the Rockies and the rest of the league is too substantial to ignore. I would lower my probability if the Rockies win their next two series while the White Sox lose theirs. Conversely, I would increase my confidence if the Rockies lose their next two series.",
