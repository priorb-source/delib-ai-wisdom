  "information": "As of March 12, 2025, BC Hydro officially excluded Tesla products, including electric vehicle chargers, energy storage batteries, and inverters, from its CleanBC and BC Hydro rebate programs. The stated reason for the policy change is to preference Canadian goods and exclude U.S.-produced goods where practicable, as part of a broader trade dispute. The EV charger rebate for single-family homes covers up to 50% of the cost, to a maximum of $350. The policy was publicly defended by B.C. Premier David Eby and Energy Minister Adrian Dix. Products purchased or pre-approved before March 12, 2025, remain eligible for the rebate.\n\nIn the Canadian market, Tesla has experienced a significant downturn in early 2025. New vehicle registrations in Québec dropped by 85-90% in the first quarter of the year. Concurrently, a J.D. Power survey indicated a shift in Canadian consumer preference, with Tesla falling from second to eighth place among most-considered EV brands. Other manufacturers, such as General Motors, surpassed Tesla as the top seller of EVs in Canada during this period. Public sentiment has also been a factor, with protests occurring at a B.C. Tesla dealership on March 23, 2025, where participants called for a boycott of the company.\n\nThe exclusion of Tesla from B.C.'s rebate program occurred within a broader context of shifting trade policies and incentives. Canada's federal iZEV rebate program, which offered up to $5,000 for EV purchases, ended on March 31, 2025. A 25% tariff on U.S.-made electric vehicles is also in effect. The B.C. government's action to preference domestic goods extends beyond the EV sector; for instance, the province has also removed U.S. liquor products from the shelves of government-run liquor stores as part of the ongoing trade friction with the United States.",

    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "About 32 days (until July 1, 2025)",
    "status_quo_outcome": "Yes",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "BC Hydro keeps the exclusion policy but edits the home-charger rebate page to use generic language (e.g., excluding U.S.-made chargers) without explicitly naming Tesla; or the province reverses/exempts Tesla prior to July 1, removing the Tesla-ineligible wording from that specific page.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "BC Hydro maintains the current policy and the home-charger rebate page continues to explicitly state that Tesla products are not eligible as of July 1 (or later when checked).",
    "rationale": "- Baseline: As of March 12, 2025, BC Hydro and CleanBC explicitly exclude Tesla products (chargers, storage, inverters) from rebate programs to preference Canadian goods and, where practicable, exclude U.S.-produced goods. Premier and Energy Minister have publicly defended the policy, and related actions (e.g., removing U.S. liquor from provincial stores) signal a broader, politically salient stance unlikely to reverse quickly. With only about a month to go, the status quo strongly favors persistence. \n- Resolution nuance: The question resolves Yes only if the specific BC Hydro home charger page still explicitly says Tesla is not eligible when checked on/after July 1. If the policy persists but the page stops naming Tesla (shifts to brand-neutral wording), the question resolves No. This communication-risk is the main downside. \n- Factors supporting Yes: Short time horizon; policy is new and high-profile; provincial objective to preference Canadian goods; Tesla’s weakened Canadian market momentum reduces political pressure to re-include; no clear signal of imminent trade détente or legal compulsion to reverse in the next month. Government pages often leave such notices in place for months for clarity. \n- Factors supporting No: Web content could be tidied to generic eligibility criteria or moved to a different page/FAQ, removing the explicit Tesla mention; or an unexpected policy adjustment/legal challenge leads to re-inclusion or more neutral wording. \n- Why not higher: Material resolution risk from a communications change that drops the explicit Tesla reference on that specific page even if the exclusion continues. \n- Why not lower: Reversal of the underlying policy in the next month is unlikely; the government has doubled-down in public comments; and clarity for consumers typically argues for keeping explicit brand guidance through at least early summer. \n- What would raise my forecast: New BC statements reaffirming the Tesla exclusion and/or seeing the page retain the explicit Tesla language in late June; escalation of trade tensions keeping the stance hardened. \n- What would lower my forecast: BC Hydro revising the page to brand-neutral language; reports of legal or intergovernmental pressure to remove brand-specific exclusions; signs of a negotiated trade thaw prompting a shift in messaging.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill BC Hydro still exclude Tesla from its EV charger rebate program for single-family homes in July 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nAccording to the resolution source, \"The Government of B.C. and BC Hydro are taking action to preference Canadian goods in our rebate programs going forward and to exclude, where practicable, U.S. produced goods. As of March 12, 2025, Tesla products (electric vehicle chargers, energy storage batteries and inverters) are not eligible for CleanBC and BC Hydro rebates. If you purchased or have received pre-approval for your Tesla product before March 12, 2025, it can still qualify for rebates and will be processed as normal.\"\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if BC Hydro at [this page](https://www.bchydro.com/powersmart/electric-vehicles/rebates-incentives/rebates-home-chargers.html) when checked by Metaculus on or after July 1, 2025, says that Tesla products are not eligible for the EV charger at home program. If it does not mention Tesla being ineligible, then this question resolves as **No**.\n\n\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nAs of March 12, 2025, BC Hydro officially excluded Tesla products, including electric vehicle chargers, energy storage batteries, and inverters, from its CleanBC and BC Hydro rebate programs.

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
