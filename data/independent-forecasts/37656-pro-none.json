    "status_quo_outcome": "The objective's status will remain 'in progress' in the spreadsheet, resulting in a 'No' outcome for this question.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "The US legislative process, with its multiple procedural hurdles in both the House and Senate, moves too slowly to pass a bill defunding NPR and PBS and have it signed into law by the July 1, 2025 deadline. The objective's status in the tracker remains 'in progress'.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "A new administration and its congressional allies successfully attach the defunding measure to an urgent, must-pass piece of legislation (e.g., a government funding bill). They use expedited procedures and maintain strong party discipline to pass the bill and have it signed into law just before the deadline, leading the tracker's maintainers to mark the objective as 'complete'.",
    "rationale": "My forecast is based primarily on the extreme difficulty of enacting significant and controversial legislation within the U.S. political system in a very short timeframe. The deadline is less than two months away. The status quo, which my forecasting methodology weights heavily, is that the objective is 'in progress'. To change this to 'complete' would require a bill to successfully pass both the House and the Senate and be signed by the President. This process is typically measured in months, not weeks, especially for a contentious issue like defunding public broadcasting which would likely face a filibuster in the Senate, requiring a 60-vote supermajority. My research assistant found no information to suggest such a legislative push is currently underway or has an unusually high chance of success. The probability is not zero, as a determined and unified government could theoretically use a must-pass bill as a vehicle. However, the procedural and political barriers are immense. I would increase my forecast if a specific bill containing this provision cleared key committees and was scheduled for a floor vote. I would decrease it as the deadline approaches with no significant legislative progress.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill the Project 2025 Tracker spreadsheet have the objective of stopping funding for NPR and PBS marked as complete before July 1, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nAt the time of this question, the objective was marked as \"in progress.\" The 2025 Tracker is a project of the Keep_Track subreddit and is explained [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/Keep_Track/comments/1ii7tbr/project_2025_tracker_is_now_live/).\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if the Project 2025 objective to \"stop funding for NPR and PBS\" is marked as complete according to [this spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1QGG6wNHna-1tt91yXNkOauAJJ7snobFjfEnmxlmzhl4/edit?gid=0#gid=0) before July 1, 2025. If it is anything other than complete (such as \"in progress\") when accessed by Metaculus on or after July 1, 2025, then the question resolves as **No**.\n\n\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nNo additional information available.\n\nToday is 2025-05-16.\n\nBefore answering you think:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n(e) You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
