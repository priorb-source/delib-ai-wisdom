  "information": "Mahmoud Khalil, a lawful permanent resident and Palestinian activist, was detained by Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) in March 2025. An immigration judge subsequently ruled that he can be deported, concluding that the government had met its burden to prove grounds for deportation based on national security and foreign policy concerns. Khalil's legal team is appealing this decision to the Board of Immigration Appeals (BIA) and has also filed a separate habeas corpus petition in federal court, arguing that the government's actions violate his First Amendment rights.\n\nOn May 11, 2025, a federal judge in New Jersey extended a temporary restraining order (TRO) that bars ICE from deporting Mahmoud Khalil. The extension was granted because the court found Khalil’s First-Amendment and Administrative Procedure Act claims to be “plausible.” Further legal briefings have been scheduled, and TROs that are extended typically remain in effect until a court rules on a motion for a preliminary injunction.\n\nThe case occurs within a broader context of the Trump administration's actions against individuals involved in pro-Palestinian activism. Reports indicate that since January 2025, the administration has revoked visas for over 1,000 foreign university students. Additionally, the Zionist organization Betar US announced it is working with the administration to help deport demonstrators it considers a threat, and has publicly named Mahmoud Khalil in its statements. U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio has also written that allowing Khalil to remain in the country would create a “hostile environment for Jewish students.”",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Approximately 1.5 months, until July 1, 2025.",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No. Mahmoud Khalil is currently in the U.S., and his deportation is barred by a federal court's temporary restraining order (TRO).",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "The federal court's TRO remains in effect or is converted into a preliminary injunction that extends beyond July 1, 2025. The legal processes, including the appeal to the Board of Immigration Appeals and the federal habeas petition, are not resolved in the government's favor in time for ICE to carry out a deportation before the deadline.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "The federal judge quickly dissolves the TRO and denies a preliminary injunction. The Board of Immigration Appeals also swiftly rules against Khalil. ICE then acts immediately on the pre-existing deportation order to remove him from the United States before July 1, 2025.",
    "rationale": "The primary factor driving this forecast is the existence of an extended temporary restraining order (TRO) from a federal court, which currently prevents the government from deporting Mahmoud Khalil. The judge extended the TRO after finding Khalil's First Amendment claims 'plausible,' indicating the court sees a substantive legal issue that requires careful consideration, not a quick dismissal. The U.S. legal system, particularly federal courts and appellate bodies like the Board of Immigration Appeals (BIA), generally moves slowly. With less than seven weeks until the July 1, 2025 deadline, it is highly probable that these legal proceedings will not be fully resolved in the government's favor in time for a deportation to be executed. The status quo is that he cannot be deported, and legal processes tend to have significant inertia.\n\nThe probability is not lower than 15% because there is significant political will from the executive branch to deport Khalil. High-level pressure from the Secretary of State, activist groups, and the administration's broader actions against pro-Palestinian activists indicate this case is a priority. This could lead the government to dedicate maximum resources to expediting legal arguments and to act with extreme speed if the TRO were to be lifted.\n\nThe probability is not higher than 15% because the legal barriers are substantial and the timeline is very short. Overcoming a federal judge's order that is based on plausible constitutional claims is a high hurdle. The schedule for legal briefings and hearings on a preliminary injunction could easily extend past the resolution date on its own, regardless of the separate BIA appeal.\n\nI would update my forecast towards 'Yes' if the federal court schedules an emergency hearing and lifts the TRO in the next few weeks. Conversely, I would update towards 'No' if the court sets a briefing or hearing schedule that extends into late June or beyond.",

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
