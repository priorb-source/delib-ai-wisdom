    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Approximately 33 days from May 29, 2025 to July 1, 2025",
    "status_quo_outcome": "Given the short timeframe, the most likely outcome is that the relative ranking between Sánchez and Erdoğan remains stable from the January 2025 baseline through July 1, 2025",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Erdoğan maintains his approval rating advantage over Sánchez through July 1, 2025. This could occur if Turkey's economy remains relatively stable, no major political scandals emerge, and Erdoğan's base remains solid. Meanwhile, Sánchez continues facing challenges common to European leaders including coalition management and economic pressures.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Sánchez's approval rises or Erdoğan's falls sufficiently that Sánchez has a higher rating by July 1. This could happen if Spain experiences positive economic news, Sánchez successfully navigates political challenges, or if Turkey faces economic crisis, political turmoil, or a major scandal affecting Erdoğan's standing.",
    "rationale": "This forecast faces significant uncertainty due to lack of baseline data. The research assistant provided no information about the actual January 2025 approval ratings that would serve as our starting point. With only 33 days until resolution, the status quo typically dominates - approval ratings rarely shift dramatically in such short timeframes absent major events. Historically, both leaders have experienced fluctuating approval ratings, with Erdoğan often maintaining relatively stronger domestic support (40-50% range) compared to Sánchez (30-40% range), though both vary significantly. The lack of information about major upcoming events in either country supports a status quo bias. My forecast is not higher because: (1) I cannot confirm Sánchez currently leads in the January baseline, (2) the short timeframe makes reversals unlikely, (3) historically Erdoğan has maintained competitive approval. My forecast is not lower because: (1) significant uncertainty exists without current data, (2) both leaders face volatility, (3) 5-6 months (Jan to July) allows some movement. I would update upward if shown January data revealing Sánchez already leads, or if major negative news emerges from Turkey. I would update downward if shown large gaps favoring Erdoğan in January, or positive Turkish economic/political developments.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill Spanish Prime Minister Pedro Sánchez have a higher approval rating than Turkey's President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan on July 1, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nResolution source updates monthly. According to Morning Consult for January 2025: \"The latest approval ratings are based on data collected from Jan. 21-27, 2025. Ratings reflect a trailing seven-day simple moving average of views among adults in each country surveyed.\"\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if Pedro Sánchez has a higher approval rating than Recep Tayyip Erdoğan according to [Morning Consult](https://pro.morningconsult.com/trackers/global-leader-approval) when checked by Metaculus on or after July 1, 2025. If this not the case (including due to a tie), this resolves as **No**.\n\n\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nNo additional information available.\n\nToday is 2025-05-29.\n\nBefore answering you think:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n(e) You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
