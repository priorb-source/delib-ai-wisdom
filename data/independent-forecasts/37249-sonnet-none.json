    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "2 months (May and June 2025)",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No - Labour and Conservatives maintain their positions as the top two polling parties, with Reform UK remaining in third or lower position",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Reform UK continues polling in the 15-25% range but fails to overtake both Labour and Conservatives. Even if they make gains, they either don't reach #1 or don't achieve the required 4+ percentage point lead over the second place party. The major parties stabilize or recover support before July 1st.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "A perfect storm hits the major parties: Labour's government faces a major scandal or policy crisis, the Conservative Party continues its internal divisions, and Reform UK capitalizes on issues like immigration or economic discontent. Nigel Farage's media presence drives a surge that pushes Reform UK to 32-35% while Labour and Conservatives drop to 25-28%, achieving the required 4+ point lead in Politico's poll of polls.",
    "rationale": "This forecast requires Reform UK to achieve something historically unprecedented in UK politics: leading national polls as a populist third party by a clear 4+ point margin. While Reform UK has shown surprising strength recently (winning parliamentary seats for the first time in 2024 and being described as 'upending British politics'), several factors make this outcome unlikely within the 2-month window:\n\nKey constraints: (1) UK third parties have rarely led national polls, and never by substantial margins for sustained periods; (2) The 4-point margin requirement is stringent - it's not enough to narrowly lead; (3) Labour recently won a large majority and governments typically enjoy honeymoon periods; (4) Only 60 days for such a dramatic shift is a very short timeframe.\n\nHowever, this isn't impossibly low because: (1) Reform UK has already broken historical patterns; (2) European populist parties have shown they can surge quickly; (3) Farage is skilled at capitalizing on political moments; (4) UK politics has been volatile; (5) An unexpected crisis could rapidly shift public opinion.\n\nWithout current polling data from my research assistant showing Reform UK's proximity to the threshold, I must rely on base rates. The status quo strongly favors 'No' as major parties typically maintain polling leads. I would update higher if I saw Reform UK already polling above 25% and within 5 points of the leader. I would update lower if current polls showed them stagnant below 20% with major parties stable above 30%.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nBefore July 1, 2025, will Reform UK be the highest polling party in the UK by at least 4 points, according to Politico?\n\nQuestion background:\nThe Hill: [Nigel Farage’s Reform UK is upending British politics](https://thehill.com/opinion/international/5163853-how-nigel-farages-reform-uk-is-upending-british-politics/) | Wikipedia: [Reform UK](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reform_UK)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if Reform UK reaches #1 in the polling averages, exceeding the 2nd place by 4 or more percentage points [according to Politico](https://www.politico.eu/europe-poll-of-polls/united-kingdom/), after April 30, 2025 and before July 1, 2025.\n\n\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nNo additional information available.\n\nToday is 2025-05-01.\n\nBefore answering you think:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n(e) You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
