    "review": "Both forecasters largely mirror my base reasoning: Level 4 is typically reserved for nationwide, acute crises, while Mozambique’s risk remains geographically concentrated. They add a few useful nuances I hadn’t explicitly cited: the waning cyclone season (reducing a potential non-security trigger), the LNG corridor remaining a bellwether, and concrete tripwires like attacks on provincial capitals/critical infrastructure and an Embassy ordered departure. I agree with their emphasis on the short time window and the State Department’s pattern of handling Mozambique-like risk profiles with regional Level 4s rather than a nationwide upgrade. I don’t see compelling counterevidence for a higher probability than my prior; if anything, their arguments support a slight downward adjustment.",
    "rationale": "The probability of a nationwide Level 4 by July 1 remains low given (1) the State Department’s high threshold for Level 4 and preference for regional Do Not Travel designations when threats are localized; (2) current signals of risk escalation (Niassa incidents, Embassy alerts) being notable but still geographically bounded; and (3) the short ~60‑day window, which typically requires a conspicuous inflection (major urban attacks, widespread unrest, kidnappings of foreigners, or an Embassy ordered departure). I retain tail risk for a step-change if insurgent activity spreads into major population centers or if the Embassy takes evacuation-related measures, but absent that, the base rate argues against a national upgrade. I’m nudging my estimate down modestly to reflect the deliberators’ strong base-rate case and the lack of new indications of imminent nationwide deterioration.",
