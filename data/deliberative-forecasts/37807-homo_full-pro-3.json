    "review": "The other two forecasters and I have reached a strong consensus. We all agree that the short timeframe (under six weeks) makes any formal legislative or regulatory change to SNAP eligibility impossible by the resolution date. Therefore, the status quo is the overwhelmingly likely outcome. We all identify the sole, low-probability path to a 'No' resolution: a quick, top-down, cosmetic change to the website's text by the new administration to signal policy intent. The only difference is the weight we assign to this possibility. Both other forecasters assigned it a 15% probability, while I assigned it a 10% probability. Their reasoning was sound, particularly in highlighting the new administration's motivation and willingness to challenge norms.",
    "rationale": "After reviewing my peers' analyses, I am maintaining my forecast of 90%. Their arguments, while leading them to a slightly more conservative 85%, have reinforced my conviction in the higher probability of a 'Yes' outcome. The core of all our analyses is the power of bureaucratic inertia over this very short timeframe. A formal change to the Food and Nutrition Act or a USDA rulemaking process cannot be completed by July 1, 2025. The key debate is the likelihood of a purely symbolic edit to the webpage.\n\nForecaster 3 made an excellent point that government agencies are typically very cautious about changing official public guidance if it does not reflect an underlying change in law or regulation. Doing so would create a confusing and problematic discrepancy between the website's advice and the rules enforced at checkout, causing chaos for recipients, retailers, and state agencies. The career staff at the USDA would almost certainly advise strongly against such a move.\n\nFurthermore, Forecaster 2 noted that the new USDA leadership is currently focused on substantive, high-level issues like a departmental reorganization and processing major state-level waiver requests. This suggests their attention and political capital are directed at larger structural changes, making it less likely they would be focused on orchestrating a minor, purely cosmetic website update in the immediate future.\n\nWhile the new administration is clearly motivated, these two factors—the institutional resistance to creating confusing guidance and the leadership's focus on more significant initiatives—convince me that the risk of a symbolic website change is closer to 10% than 15%. Therefore, I will hold my forecast.",
