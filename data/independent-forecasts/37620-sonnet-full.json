  "information": "On May 6, 2025, Ramzan Kadyrov publicly stated that he was asking to be relieved of his duties, expressing a hope that his request would be supported to allow for new leadership in the region. He subsequently clarified on his Telegram channel that the final decision rests solely with Russian President Vladimir Putin, stating, \"I do not decide whether I will remain as the head of the Chechen Republic or not.\" By May 12, Kadyrov again addressed the rumors, attributing his recent serious demeanor not to a potential resignation, but to the ongoing special military operation in Ukraine, in which he said 11,000 Chechen troops were involved.\n\nMultiple media outlets, including Novaya Gazeta Europe, The Insider, and the Kyiv Independent, have reported on Kadyrov's deteriorating health, with some specifying conditions such as pancreatic necrosis and kidney problems. In parallel, reports indicate Kadyrov is engaged in succession planning. He has promoted his 17-year-old son, Adam Kadyrov, to several high-ranking positions, including secretary of the republic's security council and head of his own security department. Kadyrov's 26-year-old daughter, Aishat, also holds the position of vice-president of the Chechen government.\n\nRamzan Kadyrov met with Russian President Vladimir Putin on May 7, 2025. Following the meeting, Kadyrov stated he received \"full understanding and support,\" and Russian state media reported that Putin praised the Chechen Republic's achievements. This is not the first time Kadyrov has publicly discussed stepping down; similar statements were made in 2016, 2020, and 2022, none of which resulted in his departure. The authority to appoint or dismiss the Head of the Chechen Republic rests exclusively with the President of Russia. Kadyrov has held the position since April 2007.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Approximately 19-20 days until June 1, 2025",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No - Kadyrov remains head of the Chechen Republic through June 1, 2025",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Putin does not accept Kadyrov's request to step down within the next 19 days. The May 6 statement is revealed to be another political gesture similar to those made in 2016, 2020, and 2022. Kadyrov continues to fulfill his duties, and by May 12 his focus has already shifted back to the military operation in Ukraine rather than resignation. He remains in his position which he has held for 18 years.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Kadyrov's health deteriorates rapidly due to reported pancreatic necrosis and kidney problems, forcing an immediate transition. Putin accepts his resignation request and quickly appoints a successor, possibly Adam Kadyrov or another family member who has been positioned for succession. The transition happens within the next 19 days before June 1, 2025.",
    "rationale": "The status quo strongly favors a No outcome. Kadyrov has held power for 18 years and has made similar public statements about stepping down at least three times before (2016, 2020, 2022) without any actual departure. Most critically, he met with Putin on May 7, 2025 - just one day after his resignation statement - and received 'full understanding and support' rather than acceptance of his resignation. By May 12, Kadyrov was already downplaying resignation rumors and focusing on military operations. The historical pattern is clear: these statements have been political theater rather than genuine resignation plans. However, several factors prevent me from assigning a near-zero probability. Multiple credible media outlets report serious health issues including pancreatic necrosis and kidney problems. Observable succession planning is occurring with his 17-year-old son Adam receiving key security positions and his 26-year-old daughter Aishat as vice-president. The current statement appears somewhat more specific than past instances. The critical constraint is time - only 19 days remain until June 1. For a Yes outcome, we would need either a sudden health crisis or a very rapid political decision by Putin. There are no signs of concrete transition steps being taken. Why not higher: The historical base rate is decisive. Three previous false alarms, recent Putin support, extremely short timeframe, and Kadyrov's May 12 deflection all point strongly to continuation. Why not lower: Genuine multi-source health reporting, active succession positioning, and the non-zero possibility of a rapid health emergency keep this above negligible. For me to update higher, I would need: concrete announcement of a successor, Kadyrov ceasing public duties, or credible reports of hospitalization. To update lower: Kadyrov making robust public appearances, explicit denial of resignation, or Putin publicly stating Kadyrov will continue.",
