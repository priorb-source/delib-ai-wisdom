    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Approximately 42 days from May 20, 2025 to July 1, 2025",
    "status_quo_outcome": "Yes - the page remains online",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "The Trump administration issues an executive order suspending the Diversity Visa program and the State Department removes the registration page, or Congress passes emergency legislation eliminating the program, or the State Department reorganizes its website and removes or relocates the page without a proper redirect",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "The Diversity Visa program continues operating normally without legislative or executive interference, and the State Department maintains its current website structure with the DV program registration page at the same URL through July 1, 2025",
    "rationale": "The status quo strongly favors a Yes outcome. The DV program is established by statute in the Immigration and Nationality Act, meaning elimination would require congressional action. While President Trump has historically opposed the program (as evidenced by his 2017 tweet), the program continued throughout his first term despite this opposition. The 42-day timeframe is very short for major policy changes. Even if the Trump administration wanted to eliminate or suspend the program, such actions would face legal challenges and implementation delays. The 2020 article about court orders shows the program operates within a legal framework that provides some stability. Government websites typically exhibit strong inertia - pages that have existed for years don't disappear quickly without substantive policy changes. The most likely path to a No outcome would be an executive action attempting to suspend the program, but even then, the State Department might maintain the informational page pending legal resolution. Website reorganizations are possible but typically announced in advance and occur on longer timescales. I'm not forecasting higher (95%+) because: political volatility exists, executive actions are possible even if legally questionable, and technical issues could theoretically occur. I'm not forecasting lower (70% or below) because: the timeframe is too short for legislative action, executive actions face legal barriers and implementation challenges, status quo bias is strong for government websites, and there's no indication of imminent changes. I would update higher with news of stable program operations or explicit commitments to maintain the website. I would update lower with announcements of executive actions against the program or planned website restructuring",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill the US State Department's Diversity Visa page still be online on July 1, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\n[Federal judge’s order leaves many visa lottery winners out of luck](https://www.siliconvalley.com/2020/10/01/judges-order-leaves-many-visa-lottery-winners-out-of-luck/) | [Donald Trump's 2017 tweet discussing the DV program](https://x.com/realDonaldTrump/status/925684982307348480)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if the Step 1 Submit an Entry page with instructions for registering for the Diversity Immigrant Visa (DV) Program is at [this location](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/us-visas/immigrate/diversity-visa-program-entry/diversity-visa-submit-entry1.html) when attempted to be accessed by Metaculus on or after July 1, 2025.\n\n\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nNo additional information available.\n\nToday is 2025-05-20.\n\nBefore answering you think:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n(e) You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
