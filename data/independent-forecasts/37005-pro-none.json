    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Approximately 6 months. The election is mandated to occur on or before October 20, 2025.",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No. Current polling averages and projections, such as those from 338Canada, indicate a substantial lead for the Conservative Party. If an election were held today, the Liberals would win significantly fewer than 172 seats, and the Conservatives would be favoured to win a majority government.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "The Conservative Party maintains its polling momentum throughout the campaign, successfully focusing on issues of affordability, housing, and inflation. Voter fatigue with the long-serving Liberal government remains high, and the Liberals' campaign messaging fails to resonate with or persuade swing voters. This results in the Conservatives winning a majority or strong minority government, with the Liberal seat count falling well below the 172-seat threshold.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "The Liberal Party orchestrates a significant political comeback. This could be driven by a rapid improvement in economic conditions for which voters credit the incumbents, a major policy or campaign blunder by the Conservatives that alienates moderate voters, or an exceptionally effective Liberal campaign that shifts the national conversation. A late surge in strategic voting in key battleground ridings could also narrowly push the Liberals over the 172-seat majority mark.",
    "rationale": "My forecast is anchored in the consistent and substantial lead the Conservative Party has maintained over the incumbent Liberals in public opinion polls for more than a year. Projections from models like 338Canada, which aggregate polling and demographic data, reflect this reality and currently place the probability of a Liberal majority as extremely low. The core issues driving voter sentiment are economic—cost of living and housing affordability—where the incumbent government is perceived unfavorably. Weighting the status quo heavily, the current political environment is highly adverse for the Liberals. Overcoming such a wide polling deficit so close to an election is historically rare in Canadian politics.\n\nMy probability is not higher because the scale of the required turnaround is immense. The Liberals don't just need to close a double-digit gap; they need to build a lead of several points to secure a majority. The fundamental drivers of their unpopularity appear deeply entrenched.\n\nMy probability is not lower because outcomes are not certain six months out from an election. An unforeseen event, a major opposition gaffe, or an unexpectedly resonant Liberal campaign could shift the political landscape. The Liberal party has a history of running effective campaigns. I would increase my forecast if there were a sustained, significant narrowing of the polling gap over several consecutive months. I would decrease it if the gap widens or if key Liberal figures choose not to run for re-election.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill the Liberal Party win 172 or more seats in the 2025 Canadian federal election?\n\nQuestion background:\n[338Canada Federal Projection](https://338canada.com/federal.htm): \"The 338Canada project is a statistical model of electoral projections based on opinion polls, electoral history, and demographic data. This web site is a creation of Philippe J. Fournier, physics and astrophysics professor at Cégep de Saint-Laurent in Montreal.\"\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if the Liberal Party of Canada wins greater than or equal to 172 seats in the [2025 Canadian federal election](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2025_Canadian_federal_election).\n\n\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nNo additional information available.\n\nToday is 2025-04-21.\n\nBefore answering you think:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n(e) You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
