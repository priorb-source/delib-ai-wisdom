    "review": "All three forecasters converged independently on nearly identical probabilities (28-30%) using strikingly similar reasoning. This convergence is notable and validates the core analytical framework. We all identified the same key tension: the unfavorable 4-8 month base rate for African rollouts versus the 2.5-month window available, weighed against the Bangladesh precedent showing rapid deployment is technically possible. The convergence suggests we're appropriately weighting the evidence rather than introducing individual biases. Forecaster 3's emphasis on 'Good forecasters weight status quo heavily' is particularly apt here - after 1 month post-licensing with no movement from 'Not Available,' the burden of proof shifts toward the slower timeline. No forecaster raised substantively new evidence I hadn't considered, though Forecaster 2's explicit mention of countries stuck in 'Coming Soon' for months (Zambia, India, Vietnam) reinforces the downside risk. The key insight from this deliberation is that three independent analyses using the same evidence base arrived at the same narrow probability range, which increases confidence that 25-30% is the appropriate range rather than being too high or too low.",
    "rationale": "After reviewing the other forecasters' analyses, I maintain that the evidence supports a forecast in the 28-30% range. The convergence strengthens confidence in this estimate rather than suggesting a need for update. The core logic remains: Somalia needs to be in roughly the fastest 20-25% of African Starlink rollouts to meet the July 1 deadline, given the 4-8 month median timeline and only 2.5 months available. The current status quo after 1 month - still showing 'Not Available' - is particularly informative and weighs against YES. However, the Bangladesh precedent (2 weeks) and high-level government/diplomatic support create meaningful upside risk that prevents this from being a lower probability. With 46 days remaining and no signals of imminent activation, the window is narrowing rapidly. The probability should reflect: (1) strong base rate evidence against meeting the deadline, (2) status quo inertia after 1 month, (3) Somalia's operational challenges, but (4) acknowledgment that rapid deployment remains technically feasible if prioritized. I'm maintaining my 30% forecast as it represents a reasonable central estimate within the consensus range of 28-30%.",
