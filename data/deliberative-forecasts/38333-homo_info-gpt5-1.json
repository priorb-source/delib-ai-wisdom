    "review": "Both forecasters add useful nuance. Forecaster 2’s points about Florida’s political committee system reducing end-of-quarter pressure and the Miami City Commission’s potential election-date change (which could extend Suarez’s term) are important and slightly lower the urgency to announce in June. The JMI poll showing Suarez at 5% also undercuts near-term momentum. Forecaster 3 convincingly emphasizes the absence of normal pre-launch signals (staff/vendor leaks, event holds, filings) with less than a month remaining, while fairly noting that a pre–June 30 launch could still be spun up quickly for fundraising optics. I find the reduced fundraising pressure (given Florida PCs) and the low early polling particularly persuasive in nudging the probability down a bit from my prior. The counterpoint—prime announcement window and potential Q2 optics—keeps the probability from falling too far.",
    "rationale": "With ~3.5 weeks left, the default is no announcement absent strong imminence cues. Since early June brings: (1) no credible launch-date reporting or staff/vendor leaks; (2) a Trump-endorsed GOP rival (Donalds) already in; (3) a weak 5% early poll for Suarez; and (4) Florida’s PC structure dampening the need to announce before June 30, the incentives for a June launch look limited. The potential Miami election-date change could also lessen any urgency to move now. A last-minute press-release announcement remains possible—especially to claim Q2 fundraising optics—but without the usual pre-launch smoke, that path seems sub-20%. I’m nudging down slightly from 17% to 15% to reflect the added considerations that reduce near-term pressure while keeping a non-trivial tail for a swift, optics-driven June announcement.",
