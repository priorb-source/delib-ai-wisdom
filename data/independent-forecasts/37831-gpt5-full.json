  "information": "On May 13, 2025, Mali's military junta, led by General Assimi Goïta, issued a presidential decree dissolving all political parties and organizations. The government justified the decision by citing the need to rationalize the political landscape, which includes around 300 parties, and to preserve national unity and stability. The decree followed national consultations held in April 2025. Preceding the decree, the National Transitional Council (CNT) voted 130-2 to repeal the law governing the charter of political parties and the statute of political opposition. The government has stated its intention to draft a new legislative framework to regulate the political sector in the future.\n\nIn response to the dissolution decree, Malian political parties have initiated legal challenges, filing lawsuits in six courts in Bamako and a separate appeal to the administrative section of the Supreme Court. They argue the decree infringes on their rights to association, assembly, and participation in public life. On May 3, 2025, prior to the decree, hundreds of people attended a protest in Bamako organized by the parties. Following the decree, Malian intellectuals, including writers and lawyers, signed a statement denouncing the regime's actions. Reports indicate at least three opposition members have been arrested.\n\nThe international community has widely condemned the dissolution of political parties in Mali. The UN High Commissioner for Human Rights, Volker Türk, publicly called on the Malian authorities to reverse the decision. Both Amnesty International and the United Nations have characterized the junta's actions as an attack on freedom of expression and association. The African Union (AU) has been called upon to mediate and support dialogue to restore democratic processes, in line with the African Charter on Democracy, Elections and Governance. This international pressure comes after Mali previously announced its withdrawal from the regional bloc ECOWAS.",

    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "About 40 days (until 2025-07-01)",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No — the junta keeps the May 13 decree in force and does not generally reinstate political parties before July 1.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Courts delay or dismiss challenges; the junta reiterates plans to draft a future party law but takes no concrete step to rescind the decree by July 1; limited protests are contained and international pressure has little leverage given Mali’s break with ECOWAS and reliance on security partners.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Facing escalating protests, elite pressure, or an adverse Supreme Court administrative ruling, the junta issues a new decree rescinding the May 13 order and announces a framework that again allows parties to (re)form and register broadly, even if under stricter rules.",
    "rationale": "- Baseline: The trajectory is toward consolidation, not liberalization. The junta previously suspended political activity (2024) and escalated to dissolving all parties (May 13, 2025) after the CNT repealed the party and opposition laws. This pattern, plus control over institutions, makes a quick reversal unlikely.\n- Time constraint: Fewer than six weeks remain. Drafting and promulgating a new party law and explicitly reversing the decree within this window would require both political will and administrative speed that the junta has not shown.\n- Limited external leverage: While the UN, Amnesty, and others condemned the move, Mali has distanced itself from ECOWAS and leans on alternative partners, reducing susceptibility to near-term pressure or sanctions.\n- Judiciary and repression: Legal challenges have been filed, but Mali’s judiciary is not clearly independent, and opposition figures have been arrested—signals that the regime is confident in repression over accommodation.\n- Why not lower: A non-trivial chance exists for a face-saving partial retreat: the junta could quickly rescind the decree while imposing a stringent new registration regime that still “generally allows” party formation, satisfying the resolution criteria. A surprising Supreme Court decision or significant, sustained protests could also force a tactical reversal.\n- Why not higher: There is scant evidence of internal splits, and the government has explicitly framed dissolution as necessary for unity and stability, implying resolve rather than wavering.\n- Key update signals:\n  • Up: credible reports of draft legislation restoring multiparty status imminently; Supreme Court signals against the decree; large, sustained protests or elite defection; AU-mediated deal.\n  • Down: intensified crackdown, arrests of legal challengers, or junta statements doubling down on a lengthy “restructuring” period without timelines.\n\nAssistant’s report highlights informing this view: the May 13 decree dissolving parties; CNT repeal of the party/opposition law; stated intent to draft a new framework; legal challenges in multiple courts and the Supreme Court; arrests of opposition figures; broad but low-leverage international condemnation; Mali’s prior withdrawal from ECOWAS.",

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower.
