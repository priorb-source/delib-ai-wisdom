    "review": "All three forecasters have converged remarkably at 4-5%, indicating strong agreement on the core analysis. Forecaster 3 raises an excellent point I underweighted: the NATO Article 5 implications. If Russia invaded Lithuania or Poland (the specific countries Zelensky mentioned), this would trigger Article 5 collective defense - an existential escalation Russia would almost certainly avoid. However, this doesn't fully resolve the question since Russia could theoretically target non-NATO countries like Moldova or Georgia. Forecaster 2's point about Zelensky's incentives to maintain Western support is well-taken and appropriately skeptical of the 150,000 troops claim. All forecasters correctly emphasize the US policy shift (voting against UN resolutions, avoiding language about Russian aggression), which I noted but perhaps didn't weight heavily enough. This shift suggests the US might be reluctant to publicly accuse Russia even if some military action occurred. The convergence around 4-5% reflects the appropriate balance: extraordinarily unlikely due to military constraints, time limitations, lack of intelligence corroboration, and US policy direction, but not zero given Russia's history of surprising military actions.",
    "rationale": "After reviewing the other analyses, I remain confident in the 4% forecast. The NATO Article 5 argument strengthens the case for No but doesn't fundamentally change the calculation since Russia could theoretically target non-NATO post-Soviet states. The key factors remain: (1) Russia's military is heavily committed in Ukraine with no credible intelligence of buildups elsewhere, (2) the US has demonstrated an active policy shift away from condemning Russian aggression, making accusations less likely even if something occurred, (3) only 2 months remain, insufficient for planning and executing a major invasion, and (4) historical base rates suggest multi-year gaps between Russian military operations. The 4% acknowledges that geopolitical surprises occur and Russia has defied expectations before, but the converging evidence from military constraints, intelligence assessments, time pressure, and US policy all point decisively toward No.",
