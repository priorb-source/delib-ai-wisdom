    "review": "The other forecasters raise several important points I hadn't fully considered. Forecaster 2 confirms Niger is currently NOT at Level 4 and that Mali and Burkina Faso (neighbors) already have this designation - this is crucial contextual information. Forecaster 3 identifies that the advisory hasn't been updated since March 2023, BEFORE the July 2023 coup, suggesting it may be overdue for review. Both note that parts of Niger already have Level 4 sub-regional designations. These are valuable data points. However, I find the competing interpretations equally compelling: Forecaster 2 emphasizes that the State Department has deliberately maintained Niger at a lower level than neighbors despite ample opportunity to escalate, suggesting meaningful policy distinction. Forecaster 3 emphasizes the 2+ years of stability at Level 3 despite persistent problems, highlighting bureaucratic inertia. The forecasts cluster tightly (18-28%), indicating broad agreement on base rates and mechanisms.",
    "rationale": "After deliberation, I'm making a modest upward adjustment from 20% to 22%. The key new information that shifts my forecast is that the advisory predates the July 2023 coup and hasn't been reviewed in over 2 years - this increases the probability that a formal review could occur in the next 2 months. Additionally, the confirmation that neighboring Mali and Burkina Faso already have Level 4 advisories while Niger does not suggests the State Department sees Niger differently, but also shows regional precedent. However, I'm not moving as high as Forecaster 2's 28% because the core logic remains compelling: (1) the 2-month window is genuinely short for major policy shifts, (2) despite the coup and persistent security problems, Niger has remained at Level 3 for over 2 years, demonstrating strong status quo bias, and (3) the existence of sub-regional Level 4 designations suggests the State Department has calibrated their approach with granular warnings rather than escalating to a blanket Level 4. The outdated review date is the strongest argument for a higher probability, but bureaucratic systems move slowly and there's no indication an imminent review is scheduled.",
