  "information": "The final University of Michigan Consumer Sentiment index for May 2025 was 52.2, an improvement from the preliminary reading of 50.8, but a decline from 57.0 in March and 64.7 in February. The index has fallen nearly 30% since January 2025. Within the May report, the Current Economic Conditions Index decreased to 58.9 points from 59.8 in April, while the Economic Expectations Index increased to 47.9 points from 47.3. In a separate survey, the Conference Board's consumer confidence index rose to 98 in May from a revised 85.7 in the prior month. Other economic indicators showed soft growth signals, with the ISM services index at 49.9 and the manufacturing index at 48.5.\n\nInflation expectations remain a significant concern for consumers. The May University of Michigan survey showed consumer expectations for inflation over the next year increased to 7.3% from 6.5% in April, while long-term inflation expectations rose to 4.6% from 4.4%. Trade policy is also a major factor; according to the survey's director, Joanne Hsu, nearly three-quarters of consumers mentioned tariffs and trade policies as a source of uncertainty. Recent policy actions include the doubling of US steel tariffs. Federal Reserve governor Christopher Waller has outlined a potential path to interest rate cuts later in the year but noted this depends on how trade negotiations unfold and on progress toward the Fed's 2% inflation goal.\n\nAmerican consumers are exhibiting cautious behavior. Personal spending rose by only 0.2% in the last reported month, while the savings rate surged to 4.9% in March, the highest level in almost a year. Consumers are reportedly focusing more on essential goods and services. This caution is reflected in the performance of discount retailers like Dollar General, which recently hiked its sales forecast. Household finances are also under pressure from debt; following the end of the pandemic-era payment pause, student loan delinquencies jumped to 7.74% from 1%.",

    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Approximately 23 days until June 27, 2025, when the final Friday report for June 2025 is expected to be released",
    "status_quo_outcome": "Yes - the index remains below 54.0",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Consumer sentiment improves by at least 1.8 points from May's 52.2 level to reach 54.0 or higher. This could occur if tariff concerns ease through successful trade negotiations, inflation expectations moderate, positive economic data emerges, or the Federal Reserve signals imminent rate cuts that boost confidence",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Consumer sentiment remains at or near current levels below 54.0. The persistent headwinds continue: tariff uncertainty remains elevated with three-quarters of consumers citing trade policy concerns, inflation expectations stay high at 7.3% for the year ahead, economic indicators remain soft, and cautious consumer behavior persists with high savings rates and weak spending growth",
    "rationale": "The May 2025 final reading of 52.2 is already 1.8 points below the 54.0 threshold, establishing a strong status quo baseline. The index has experienced a dramatic decline of nearly 30% since January 2025, falling from 64.7 in February to 57.0 in March to 52.2 in May. This sharp downward trajectory reflects substantial structural headwinds rather than temporary volatility. Key factors driving low sentiment include: elevated inflation expectations (7.3% one-year, 4.6% long-term), widespread tariff concerns cited by 75% of consumers, weak economic indicators (ISM services at 49.9, manufacturing at 48.5), cautious consumer behavior evidenced by weak spending growth (0.2%) and elevated savings rates (4.9%), and rising financial stress with student loan delinquencies at 7.74%. For the index to reach 54.0 or higher, sentiment would need to reverse course and gain at least 1.8 points within approximately three weeks. While the May preliminary-to-final adjustment showed a 1.4-point improvement, this still left the reading well below threshold and doesn't represent a trend reversal. The Conference Board's improvement to 98 suggests some mixed signals, but the Michigan index has been consistently weak. I'm not assigning higher probability because: unexpected positive developments could occur, there's natural month-to-month volatility, sentiment could bounce from depressed levels, and trade negotiations could yield positive surprises. I'm not assigning lower probability because: the current reading already satisfies the Yes condition, major headwinds show no signs of abating in the near term, and the trend has been persistently negative. I would update toward No if trade policy clarity emerges, inflation expectations drop significantly, or major positive economic data releases occur in the next few weeks",
