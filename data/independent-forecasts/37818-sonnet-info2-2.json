  "information": "According to news reports, Florida ranks among the top three US states for total UFO sightings, with 8,623 reported cases documented by the National UFO Reporting Center (NUFORC). On March 28, 2025, a US military aircraft encountered a large group of unidentified objects described as glowing spheres in the sky over Florida. A leaked audio recording of the pilot's radio conversation with an air traffic controller indicated the pilot saw several high-speed objects, experienced communication disruptions, and observed an unusual glow around the plane. A Lockheed AC-130 Spectre gunship was reportedly dispatched to the area in response to the incident.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Approximately 6 weeks. The outcome will be determined when Metaculus accesses the NUFORC database on or after July 1, 2025. Today is May 21, 2025.",
    "status_quo_outcome": "Uncertain/Unknown. While Florida ranks in the top 3 US states for overall UFO sightings, we lack specific historical data on pilot sightings by state. The status quo would likely reflect typical monthly distributions of pilot encounters, which are relatively rare events compared to general public sightings.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Another state such as California, Texas, Arizona, or New York registers more pilot sightings than Florida in June 2025. This could occur if these larger aviation states have their own unusual aerial phenomena encounters, or if Florida simply has a quiet month with few pilot reports despite its historical UFO activity.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Florida records the highest number of pilot UFO/UAP sightings in June 2025. This could result from continued unusual aerial activity in Florida following the March 2025 military incident, heightened pilot awareness leading to more reports, or Florida's combination of high aviation traffic and historical UFO activity concentrating pilot encounters in the state.",
    "rationale": "This forecast requires careful consideration of several factors. The research assistant notes Florida's strong position as a top-3 state for overall UFO sightings (8,623 reports) and highlights a significant March 2025 incident involving a military pilot encountering multiple unidentified objects. However, several key uncertainties limit confidence:\n\n1. **Specificity gap**: The question asks about PILOT sightings specifically, not general sightings. Pilots represent a tiny fraction of total observers, and their reporting patterns may differ significantly from the general public.\n\n2. **No baseline data**: We lack historical data showing whether Florida typically leads in pilot sightings versus other major aviation states like California, Texas, or New York.\n\n3. **Time lag**: The March 2025 incident occurred 3 months before the target month of June. While it may increase awareness, the direct causal link to June reporting is uncertain.\n\n4. **Monthly volatility**: Looking at a single month creates high variance. Pilot sightings are rare events, and monthly distributions can be highly random.\n\n5. **Competition**: Other states with major aviation hubs, military installations, and high air traffic could easily surpass Florida in any given month.\n\nThe March incident does provide modest upward pressure on this forecast, as it demonstrates unusual aerial activity in Florida and could increase pilot vigilance. Florida's strong overall UFO reporting history is also supportive.\n\nHowever, the status quo principle suggests caution. Without evidence that Florida typically dominates pilot sightings, assuming it will lead in June 2025 requires strong justification. The forecast is not higher because we lack baseline data showing Florida's typical dominance in this specific category. It's not lower because Florida's documented UFO activity and the recent pilot incident provide plausible pathways to a Yes outcome.\n\nTo update upward, I would need: evidence of continued unusual activity in Florida through May, historical data showing Florida typically leads in pilot sightings, or reports of increased pilot encounters. To update downward: evidence of unusual activity in other states, or data showing Florida doesn't typically lead in this category.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill Florida have the most pilot sightings of UFOs of any US state in March 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nAccording to the [National UFO Reporting Center](https://nuforc.org/about-us/): \"The National UFO Reporting Center was founded in 1974 by noted UFO investigator Robert J. Gribble. The Center’s primary function over the past five decades has been to receive, record, and to the greatest degree possible, corroborate and document reports from individuals who have been witness to unusual, possibly UFO-related events. Throughout its history, the Center has processed over 180,000 reports, and has distributed its information to thousands of individuals.\"\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if The National UFO Reporting Center posts more pilot reports of a UFO/UAP having occurred in the state of Florida than any other state, for the month of June 2025 at [this link](https://nuforc.org/subndx/?id=x) when accessed by Metaculus on or after July 1, 2025.\n\nIf Florida is tied with another state, resolves as No.\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nAccording to news reports, Florida ranks among the top three US states for total UFO sightings, with 8,623 reported cases documented by the National UFO Reporting Center (NUFORC).

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
