    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Less than one month. The summit is scheduled for June 2025, and the current date is June 3, 2025.",
    "status_quo_outcome": "President Zelenskyy attends the G7 summit in person, continuing his established pattern of direct, high-level diplomacy to secure ongoing international support for Ukraine.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "A sudden and severe escalation in the war, such as a major new Russian offensive that threatens a key Ukrainian city, forces President Zelenskyy to cancel his travel for security reasons and remain in Ukraine to manage the crisis.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "The military situation remains manageable, allowing for secure travel. President Zelenskyy attends the summit in Kananaskis to personally lobby G7 leaders for more advanced weaponry, financial aid, and stronger sanctions against Russia.",
    "rationale": "My forecast is anchored in the strong precedent of President Zelenskyy attending key international summits in person since 2022, including the G7 summits in 2023 and 2024. The status quo is that he and his allies view his personal presence as critical for diplomacy. He has a clear and powerful motivation to attend: to secure the vital military and financial support necessary for Ukraine's survival and defense. The host nation, Canada, has already extended an invitation, indicating that his presence is expected and desired. The primary risk factor is the volatile security situation in an active warzone. A sudden military crisis or a specific credible threat could force a last-minute cancellation. However, such travel has become a routine, albeit high-risk, part of his wartime presidency, with sophisticated security protocols in place. The probability is not higher than 90% to account for this non-trivial 'fog of war' risk, which could materialize with little warning. The probability is not lower because the diplomatic imperative is immense, the precedent is strong, and declining the invitation would be a strategic loss he would be highly motivated to avoid. I would decrease my forecast upon credible reports of a major Russian military breakthrough or significant political instability in Kyiv. I would increase it if there were reports of a specific, major aid package being announced at the G7 that requires his personal presence.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill Volodymyr Zelenskyy attend the G7 Summit in June 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nCalgary Herald: [Prime Minister Carney invites Ukrainian President Zelenskyy to G7 summit in Kananaskis](https://calgaryherald.com/news/local-news/pm-mark-carney-invites-ukrainian-president-volodymyr-zelenskyy-g7-summit-kananaskis)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if Ukrainian President Volodymyr Oleksandrovych Zelenskyy attends in person a G7 summit held in June 2025.\n\n\"In person\" is defined as occupying the same physical space closely enough at the G7 Summit that he can see and hear other heads of state through direct un-intermediated exchange of photons and sound waves.\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nNo additional information available.\n\nToday is 2025-06-03.\n\nBefore answering you think:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n(e) You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
