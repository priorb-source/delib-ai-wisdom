    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "42 days (from May 20, 2025 to July 1, 2025)",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No - the site remains offline",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "The Trump administration continues its policy of removing climate-related content from federal websites. The climate.mil portal remains offline through July 1, 2025, as the administration maintains its stance on deprioritizing climate initiatives within the federal government, including the military.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Legal challenges, Congressional pressure, or internal military advocacy lead to the restoration of the portal. Alternatively, the administration reverses its policy in response to operational concerns from military leadership about climate resilience planning, or technical issues (if they were the real cause) get resolved and the site is brought back online.",
    "rationale": "The status quo strongly favors the site remaining offline. As of May 5, 2025, climate.mil has been down for at least 15 days, and The Guardian article indicates this is part of a broader Trump administration initiative to purge climate mentions from federal websites. This appears to be a deliberate policy decision rather than a technical glitch. The Trump administration has demonstrated consistency in its approach to climate policy, making a quick reversal unlikely. However, several factors prevent me from forecasting lower than 25%: (1) There are still 6 weeks until resolution, which provides time for circumstances to change through legal challenges, Congressional action, or internal military pushback; (2) The military's climate resilience planning has operational importance that might generate resistance from military leadership; (3) Public or legal pressure could mount over this period. I'm not forecasting higher because the political environment is clearly unfavorable, the site has already been down for weeks suggesting this is intentional policy, and 6 weeks is relatively short for major policy reversals. I would update higher if there were reports of legal challenges being filed, Congressional hearings scheduled, or military officials publicly pushing back. I would update lower if the administration made explicit statements about permanently removing climate resources or if more time passes without any movement toward restoration.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill the US military's climate resiliance portal be back online on July 1, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nThe Guardian [Scientists brace ‘for the worst’ as Trump purges climate mentions from websites](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/feb/04/trump-climate-change-federal-websites)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if climate.mil is online according to [Is It Down Right Now?](https://www.isitdownrightnow.com/climate.mil.html) when accessed by Metaculus on or after July 1, 2025.\n\nAs of May 5, 2025, the resolution source returns the message, \"Climate.mil is DOWN for everyone.\"\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nNo additional information available.\n\nToday is 2025-05-20.\n\nBefore answering you think:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n(e) You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
