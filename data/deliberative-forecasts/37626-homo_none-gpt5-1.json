    "review": "Both forecasters emphasize the series’ low month-to-month volatility and that $0.6300 is toward the lower end of the recent range—points I share. Forecaster 2 adds a useful leading-indicator angle (USDA AMS wholesale prices) and a concrete decision rule keyed to the April BLS print; Forecaster 3 similarly anchors on sticky retail pricing and small typical moves. Neither introduces hard new data (e.g., April print or May wholesale quotes), but their emphasis on volatility and the threshold placement is sound. I find their reasoning broadly convincing and consistent with my prior, with one incremental consideration: late-spring promotions and some easing in logistics constraints could slightly tilt the downside tail, warranting a small upward nudge to the Yes probability.",
    "rationale": "Time left is about a month until the May average price is published (mid-June). Baseline remains low-to-mid $0.60s with small monthly moves. The hurdle is strict (<$0.6300), so a Yes requires either April to already be very low or a modest but nontrivial May dip. Upward pressures cited (supplier price hikes, past logistics costs) keep the center of the distribution above $0.63, but potential easing in shipping constraints, a relatively firm USD, and typical spring retail promotions add some downside risk. Without April’s print or wholesale indications, the base case is still No, but the chance of a sub-$0.6300 outcome is meaningfully above zero. Incorporating the peers’ focus on volatility and the threshold’s placement, and acknowledging plausible late-spring softness, I make a slight upward adjustment from my prior 27% to 29%. I would revise materially if April prints ≤$0.632 (up) or ≥$0.645 (down), or if AMS wholesale prices in May show a sustained drop vs. April (up).",
