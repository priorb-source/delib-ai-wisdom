  "information": "Since April 2025, the United States and Iran have engaged in multiple rounds of indirect negotiations, mediated by Oman. The talks have been held in Muscat, Oman, and Rome, Italy, with the most recent fourth round taking place in Muscat on May 11. A fifth round of negotiations has been agreed upon. Both sides have described the discussions with terms such as 'constructive,' 'productive,' and 'difficult but useful,' with an Iranian official stating that the parties' positions have 'converged' and 'progress has been made.' In parallel, Iran is also scheduled to hold talks with the 'Euratrium'—the UK, France, and Germany—in Istanbul. The negotiations are proceeding under a deadline reportedly set by President Trump in March, which gave Iran two months to reach an agreement.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Approximately 46 days until July 1, 2025",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No deal announced - the default outcome if negotiations fail to produce an agreement",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Negotiations break down over core issues such as uranium enrichment levels, sanctions relief sequencing, verification mechanisms, or regional security concerns. Either the US or Iran walks away from talks, or discussions extend beyond the July 1 deadline without a formal announcement. Domestic political pressures (Iranian hardliners or Trump administration hawks) could derail progress despite diplomatic momentum.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "The ongoing indirect talks through Oman achieve breakthrough compromises on key technical and political issues. The fifth round of negotiations or subsequent meetings produce a framework agreement that both sides can announce before July 1. The existing JCPOA framework provides a foundation for faster negotiation. Deadline pressure from Trump's ultimatum and mutual economic/security interests drive both parties to finalize terms quickly.",
    "rationale": "The research assistant's report reveals significant positive momentum: four negotiation rounds completed with a fifth scheduled, positive diplomatic language ('constructive,' 'productive,' 'positions have converged'), and progress acknowledged by both sides. This suggests genuine engagement rather than performative diplomacy. However, several factors temper optimism. First, the timeline is extremely compressed - roughly 46 days to finalize one of the most complex international agreements possible. The original JCPOA took nearly two years to negotiate. While this negotiation builds on that framework and isn't starting from scratch, nuclear deals involve intricate technical details around enrichment levels, centrifuge numbers, inspection regimes, and sanctions relief sequencing. Second, Trump's reported two-month deadline from March theoretically expired around May, and we're still in negotiations, suggesting either deadline flexibility or slippage. Third, the language 'difficult but useful' indicates substantial hurdles remain despite progress. Fourth, deep structural mistrust between the parties, domestic political constraints (Iranian hardliners, potential Israeli opposition, Trump's unpredictability), and regional tensions create multiple veto points. The status quo heavily favors no deal - most negotiation rounds historically fail, and dramatic diplomatic breakthroughs are rare. However, the convergence language, multiple completed rounds, and continued engagement suggest this isn't going nowhere. The probability should be elevated above a baseline 15-20% but remains below 50% given the compressed timeline and complexity. For me to update higher (60%+): specific reports of draft text agreements, both sides indicating imminent announcement, or resolving core technical issues publicly. To update lower (20%): talks suspended, either party threatening withdrawal, or reports of fundamental disagreements on enrichment/sanctions. My forecast balances genuine diplomatic progress against historical difficulty and time constraints.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill the United States and Iran announce a new nuclear deal before July 1, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nIsraeli media (Hebrew): [Senior ministers were informed: There is a high chance that the US and Iran will reach an agreement](https://www.kan.org.il/content/kan-news/politic/895178/)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if the US and Iran sign or announce an agreement with respect to Iran's nuclear program.\n\n\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nSince April 2025, the United States and Iran have engaged in multiple rounds of indirect negotiations, mediated by Oman.

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
