    "review": "The other forecasters raised several critical pieces of information I underweighted or missed. Most importantly, Executive Order 14172 was signed approximately 3.5 months ago, and major U.S. federal agencies (National Hurricane Center, Coast Guard) have actually adopted the new name. Google has also adopted it for US users. These are concrete developments, not just hypothetical scenarios. Forecaster 2 and 3 correctly emphasize that WorldAtlas has already acknowledged the alternative name in their article title, which signals editorial awareness and some willingness to accommodate the change. However, all three of us recognize the crucial distinction between the article title (already updated) and the North America overview page map (what matters for resolution). The fact that 3.5 months have passed since the executive order with only the article title updated, not the main map, is a strong signal of editorial caution. Forecaster 2's 40% seems too optimistic given this inaction period. Forecaster 3's reasoning about cartographic conservatism and waiting for international consensus is sound, though their 25% may still be slightly high given the elapsed time without change.",
    "rationale": "I need to significantly update upward from my initial 10%. The executive order and federal agency adoption create real pressure that I initially underweighted. Google's adoption shows commercial entities can and will make this change. WorldAtlas's acknowledgment in the article title demonstrates they're not categorically opposed. However, the 3.5-month window of inaction on the main North America page is highly informative - if they were going to make this change quickly, they likely would have done so already. The lack of international recognition, Mexican opposition, and non-adoption by National Geographic and Apple all suggest that WorldAtlas is taking a measured, conservative approach to their primary map. With 54 days remaining, there's still time for an update, but no clear catalyst or deadline pressure. The most likely scenario remains that they continue their current compromise: acknowledging the alternative name in specific contexts (article title) while maintaining the internationally recognized name on primary reference maps. I'm updating to 20% - double my initial forecast to account for the real executive order and federal adoption, but still well below the middle forecasts because the 3.5 months of selective updating strongly suggests they're waiting for broader international consensus before changing their main map.",
