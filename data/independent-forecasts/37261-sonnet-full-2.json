  "information": "The '50501' movement, a decentralized organization originating from a Reddit forum, planned nationwide protests on May 1, 2025, coinciding with International Workers' Day. The protests were organized to oppose the Trump administration's policies on immigration and labor. The movement's website listed over 1,000 events across all 50 states, with major demonstrations expected in Washington D.C., Chicago, Denver, Seattle, and Los Angeles. Organizations supporting the protests included the Political Revolution PAC and the Service Employees International Union. News reports following the event stated that over 1,100 protests took place under the '50501' banner across the U.S. and worldwide.\n\nOn April 5, 2025, demonstrations under the \"Hands Off!\" campaign occurred across all 50 U.S. states and in several international cities. A coalition of over 150 groups, including Indivisible and MoveOn, organized the events in response to administration policies such as federal layoffs, rising tariffs, and civil rights rollbacks. Participation estimates varied: one report cited over 1,400 events with nearly 600,000 attendees, while another stated over 600,000 people participated in more than 1,200 rallies. Solidarity protests were also held in cities like Berlin, London, and Paris.\n\nData from the Crowd Counting Consortium from early 2025 showed a notable trend in protest activity. The consortium recorded 2,085 protests nationwide in February 2025, more than double the 937 recorded in February 2017. However, the data also indicated that the average size of these events had decreased to an estimated 60-88 participants per protest. In separate protest movements, over 300 actions were reported on university campuses related to the conflict in Israel.",

    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Approximately 2 months remain until July 1, 2025. The outcome depends on whether the Global Protest Tracker reports any qualifying protests that have already occurred or will occur in the next two months.",
    "status_quo_outcome": "Yes - Large-scale protests have already occurred in the United States in April and May 2025, and the political climate suggests continued protest activity is likely.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "The Global Protest Tracker does not report any single protest location in the US reaching 10,000+ participants. This could occur if the recent large protests were too dispersed across multiple cities with none exceeding the threshold individually, if the GPT methodology doesn't capture these events, or if the remaining two months see only smaller demonstrations continuing the trend of numerous but smaller protests averaging 60-88 participants each.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "The Global Protest Tracker reports at least one US protest with 10,000+ participants. Given that April 5 protests involved 600,000+ total participants across the country and May 1 saw over 1,100 coordinated protests, major cities like Washington DC, Chicago, Seattle, or Los Angeles likely had individual gatherings exceeding 10,000. Additionally, the remaining two months could see further large-scale demonstrations given the active political climate.",
    "rationale": "The research assistant's report indicates two major protest movements have already occurred: the April 5 'Hands Off!' campaign with 600,000+ participants across 1,200-1,400 events, and the May 1 '50501' movement with 1,100+ protests nationwide. With 600,000 total participants on April 5 alone, even if distributed across many cities, it's highly probable that at least one major city (DC, Chicago, LA, Seattle) exceeded 10,000 participants. The critical uncertainty is whether the Global Protest Tracker will report these events with sufficient detail to confirm individual protest sizes. The Crowd Counting Consortium data showing average protest size of 60-88 participants suggests most protests are small, but the April and May events appear to be exceptional mobilizations. With two months remaining, additional large protests are plausible given the organized opposition to administration policies from coalitions of 150+ groups. However, I'm not assigning higher probability because: (1) uncertainty about GPT's reporting methodology and whether it captures individual location-level participation, (2) possible lag time in GPT reporting, and (3) the trend toward more numerous but smaller protests. I'm not going lower because the sheer scale of recent protests makes it statistically likely at least one location reached the 10,000 threshold. I would update higher with confirmation that GPT has reported or typically reports US protests at city level with detailed participant counts. I would update lower if analysis showed the April/May protests were highly dispersed with no single location reaching 10,000.",
