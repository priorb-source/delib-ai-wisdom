    "review": "Forecaster 2 raises the most critical new information: specific March 2025 data showing unemployment at 2.2%, down from 2.5% in February 2025. If accurate, this fundamentally changes the analysis, providing a much larger 0.8 percentage point buffer rather than the 0.2pp I was working with based on the 2.8% baseline. This would make an April spike to 3%+ highly unlikely. Both forecasters also emphasize that we're at April 29th, meaning the outcome is essentially determined and no major disruptions have been reported. However, I'm somewhat cautious about Forecaster 2's specific data claims without independent verification. Forecaster 3's reasoning aligns closely with mine but doesn't incorporate the March 2025 data point. The timing argument is compelling across all analyses - tariff impacts on unemployment typically manifest over months, not weeks, and we're measuring very early in this timeline. If March really showed 2.2%, the required 0.8pp jump would be unprecedented.",
    "rationale": "Upon reflection, the timing dynamics are more favorable than I initially weighted. We're at April 29th, so April 2025 has essentially concluded. The absence of reported major layoffs or labor market disruptions during April is meaningful evidence. Even if I'm skeptical of the precise 2.2% figure, the directional evidence suggests Mexico's unemployment was tracking low entering April. For unemployment to reach or exceed 3.0% would require either: (1) a sharp deterioration from a low base, or (2) the March baseline was already near 3%. The latter seems inconsistent with Mexico's recent history and the lack of crisis reporting. The former would require an economic shock that hasn't been documented. While US tariffs will eventually impact Mexican employment, the transmission mechanism through supply chain disruptions, hiring freezes, and eventual layoffs typically takes quarters, not weeks. April 2025 is too early for the full impact. I'm updating upward moderately - not to 93% because I want to maintain epistemic humility about data uncertainty and the narrow margin, but significantly higher than 65% given the timing evidence and lack of reported disruptions.",
