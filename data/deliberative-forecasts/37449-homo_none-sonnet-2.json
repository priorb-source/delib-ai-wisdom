    "review": "The other forecasters provide excellent analyses that closely align with my own reasoning. All three of us independently converged on 3-4%, which increases my confidence that this range is appropriate. Key points of agreement include: the extremely short 8-week timeframe, absence of current crisis indicators, strong status quo bias, and the historical rarity of such dramatic escalations. Forecaster 3 makes a particularly strong point about blockades being 'tantamount to acts of war' and emphasizes that multiple steps must occur sequentially - Chinese decision, implementation, AND US accusation. This sequential requirement does argue for the lower end of our range. However, Forecaster 3 also notes that the question only requires a US accusation rather than a verified comprehensive blockade, which could lower the bar slightly. Forecaster 2's observation that China has never blockaded Taiwan in modern history provides useful historical context. The absence of any mentioned intelligence or warning indicators is indeed significant evidence in itself, as all forecasters note. The convergence of independent forecasts at 3-4% suggests we're appropriately calibrated on this low-probability but non-zero tail risk.",
    "rationale": "After reviewing the other analyses, I find no compelling reason to significantly adjust my forecast. The strong consensus at 3-4% validates the core reasoning: absent any current crisis indicators, military mobilization, or diplomatic breakdown, the base rate for such a dramatic event within 8 weeks is very low. The timeframe is simply too compressed for normal escalation patterns. While Forecaster 3's 3% has merit given the multiple sequential requirements, I maintain that 4% appropriately accounts for: (1) the lower evidentiary bar of US accusation versus verified blockade, allowing for potential mischaracterization or political rhetoric; (2) genuine ongoing Taiwan Strait tensions that could produce unexpected incidents; (3) the possibility of gray-zone operations being labeled as blockades. The forecast would increase substantially with reports of unusual Chinese naval deployments, breaking diplomatic relations, or ultimatums to Taiwan. It would decrease with positive bilateral summits or explicit de-escalation commitments. Given the strong analytical agreement and absence of new information that challenges the core assumptions, I'm maintaining my original assessment.",
