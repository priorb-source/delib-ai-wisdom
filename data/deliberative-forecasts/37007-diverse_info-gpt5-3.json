    "review": "- Forecaster 2 adds two concrete claims: (a) a Guardian TT poll showing a close race with ~20% undecided and (b) a likely anti-opposition vote split in Tobago between TPP and PDP that benefits PNM. The Tobago split mechanism is plausible and important; it would help PNM hold both Tobago seats, which are pivotal in a tight map. The WIC News 72–18 poll is almost surely an outlier and should be heavily discounted, so I agree with Forecaster 2 on that.\n- Forecaster 3 leans on incumbency and historical strength but misstates the 2020 result (it was 22–19, not 21–19), which slightly lowers my confidence in their precision. Their general point about incumbency is valid but may be attenuated by the leadership change from Rowley to Young and the early-election context.\n- I find the Tobago-split argument the strongest incremental insight. However, since PNM already held both Tobago seats in 2020, the split primarily preserves an existing advantage rather than creating new gains. The large undecided share (if accurate) raises volatility and does not automatically accrue to the incumbent; in many contexts, late undecideds can break for change.\n- Net: I modestly update toward PNM on the Tobago-specific mechanism while keeping a sizable uncertainty band given leadership transition, crime salience, and limited high-quality polling.",
    "rationale": "My baseline (52%) leaned slightly to PNM on structural factors (recent plurality, seat geography, opposition coordination questions). New input strengthens one specific pathway: a split opposition in Tobago likely helps PNM retain both seats, shoring up the ceiling on UNC’s pickup opportunities. That said, this is more about preserving the 2020 map than creating new advantages. The leadership change and early-election trigger could blunt incumbency benefits, and crime remains a salient anti-incumbent issue. With a purported 20% undecided (if the Guardian TT poll is accurate), outcome sensitivity remains high, and undecideds may not favor the incumbent.\nGiven these cross-currents, I nudge my forecast up slightly from 52% to 54%, reflecting the Tobago dynamic while respecting continued uncertainty. I would move higher with credible constituency-level signs of PNM strength in key marginals or evidence that Tobago’s opposition is consolidating poorly; I would move lower with reliable polling showing UNC leads where it needs them, further elite defections from PNM, or late-breaking negative news tied to governance or crime.",
