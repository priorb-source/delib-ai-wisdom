    "review": "Both other forecasters provide compelling and well-reasoned analyses that align with my initial assessment but add crucial nuances. I find their arguments highly convincing. Forecaster 2 correctly emphasizes the importance of the most recent late-May polling data (Ishiba 32%, Starmer 28%) as the 'status quo' from which we must project. This 4-point gap is the most significant piece of recent evidence. Forecaster 3 introduced a critical point I had not explicitly weighted: the resolution criterion that a tie resolves as 'No'. This raises the bar for a 'Yes' outcome, as Starmer cannot simply match Ishiba but must definitively surpass him. Forecaster 3 also provides a sharp analysis of the forthcoming drivers, correctly identifying Starmer's June 11 spending review (with planned civil service cuts) as a significant short-term political risk with a high probability of suppressing his approval rating. Conversely, Ishiba's main challenge is to avoid new scandals, which would allow his ratings to stabilize or recover from their recent lows. The consensus view is that the current data and the balance of near-term risks favor a 'No' outcome.",
    "rationale": "After reviewing the other experts' analyses, I am revising my forecast downward. My initial 45% was too optimistic. The two key factors driving this change are points strongly made by my colleagues. First, the resolution criterion that a tie results in a 'No' outcome is a structural disadvantage for 'Yes' that I had underweighted. In a race this close, the possibility of a tie or a one-point difference is material. Second, the consensus on the likely negative short-term impact of Starmer's upcoming spending review on June 11 solidifies the view that momentum is not on his side. Announcing significant job cuts is rarely a path to immediate popularity. While Ishiba's approval is low, the fading of his recent scandal creates a plausible path for stabilization or a modest recovery, whereas Starmer faces a clear and imminent political headwind. The late-May data showing Ishiba with a 4-point lead is the strongest signal we have. Overcoming that deficit and winning outright in just one month, against these headwinds, is less likely than I initially assessed. Therefore, I am lowering my forecast by 5 percentage points to better reflect these risks and the structural nature of the resolution criteria.",
