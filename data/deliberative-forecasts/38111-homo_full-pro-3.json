    "review": "The deliberation reveals a strong consensus among all three forecasters. We independently identified the same core arguments: the June UN conference is a major action-forcing event, the 2024 recognitions created significant momentum, and there are specific, credible reports about Malta's and France's intentions. We also unanimously identified the primary counter-force as diplomatic pressure from the United States and Israel. There were no new pieces of evidence introduced, but the other analyses reinforced the key pillars of the forecast. The narrow range of forecasts (80%-85%) indicates high agreement on the interpretation of the available information.",
    "rationale": "My initial forecast was 80%. After reviewing the analyses of my fellow forecasters, which align closely with my own, I am slightly increasing my confidence. Forecaster 3's characterization of this diplomatic effort as a concrete, G7-led initiative with a specific event, distinct from past 'vague calls for peace,' was particularly persuasive. This structured momentum makes it more probable that leaders' stated intentions will translate into action. The resolution criteria are met if just a single country acts. With multiple strong candidates—most notably Malta, based on a specific Axios report, and France, the conference co-chair—the probability that all of them are successfully deterred or delayed is low. The combination of public commitment, diplomatic prestige on the line for France, and several potential actors reinforces the likelihood of a 'Yes' outcome. I am increasing my forecast to reflect a slightly higher conviction that the existing momentum will overcome the anticipated counter-pressure.",
