    "review": "The other two forecasters and I are in strong agreement on the fundamental drivers of this question. We all identify the extremely compressed timeline (less than two months) and the multi-step administrative process—specifically the verification of approximately 177,000 signatures by Elections Alberta—as the primary and most formidable barriers to a 'Yes' outcome. Forecaster 2's reasoning aligns perfectly with my own, leading to an identical 5% probability. Forecaster 3 also shares this core reasoning but assigns a higher 10% probability based on a greater weighting of 'political volatility.' While I agree that the political environment is a factor, I was not persuaded to double my forecast. I find the hard, logistical constraint of the signature verification process to be a more powerful and concrete factor than a general sense of political unpredictability, especially given that no petition has even been formally submitted yet.",
    "rationale": "After reviewing my peers' analyses, I am maintaining my forecast of 5%. The deliberation has reinforced my initial assessment. The consensus among all three forecasters is that the timeline is the critical variable, and the bureaucratic process of submitting and verifying a citizen petition is highly unlikely to be completed before the July 1, 2025 deadline. The key bottleneck remains the signature verification by Elections Alberta, a logistical task that would almost certainly take longer than the few weeks remaining. Forecaster 3 made a valuable point that Premier Smith may be using the *threat* of a referendum as political leverage against the federal government; I find this argument compelling, and it actually strengthens the case for a 'No' resolution, as officially scheduling a referendum would start a clock and diminish that leverage. While Forecaster 3 assigned a higher probability (10%) to account for political volatility, I believe the specific, sequential, and time-consuming administrative steps required provide a strong anchor against such an outcome in this short timeframe. A 'Yes' resolution would require not just political will but an unprecedented and highly improbable acceleration of a formal bureaucratic process. Therefore, my 5% forecast remains unchanged.",
