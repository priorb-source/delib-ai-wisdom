    "review": "Forecaster 2 highlights concrete drags I agree with: multi-state and mixed retail/foodservice distribution, substantial volume, and especially very long use-by dates that can stretch effectiveness checks. I’m less convinced by the claim that such recalls “often” take 6–12 months; some do, but that feels too pessimistic for a single two-day production window without illnesses or scope expansions so far. Forecaster 3’s key new input is the assertion this is a Class III recall. If accurate, that materially shifts the base rate toward quicker closure (median ≈90 days), making a pre–July 1 closure plausible. However, 85% seems too high given known friction points: the product mix, institutional channels, and long shelf life can still push closure past the deadline even for low-risk recalls. Overall, I find F2 directionally persuasive on tail risks, and F3 persuasive that the class likely isn’t severe—netting to modestly below even odds rather than strongly one-sided either way.",
    "rationale": "We are ~40 days post-initiation with ~55 days to the July 1 cutoff (≈95 days total). For lower-severity FSIS recalls, median closure around ~90 days suggests roughly even odds by this timeline. Offsetting factors that nudge later: multi-state distribution, substantial volume, mixed retail and foodservice channels, and reported long shelf lives (into 2026) complicate effectiveness verification and reconciliation. Offsetting that are positives: a narrow production window (Mar 12–13), a clearly identified unapproved substance (sodium hypochlorite), no reported illnesses, and a large, capable firm (Cargill) that can execute and document quickly. If the recall is indeed Class III, that supports faster closure; but given the logistics and the agency’s verification requirements, there’s meaningful risk of slippage just past July 1. Balancing these, I nudge my prior 40% slightly up to reflect the likely low-risk classification, but stay below 50% due to the distribution/long shelf-life headwinds and potential administrative backlog. I would move up on any FSIS/Cargill indication that effectiveness checks are complete with no expansion; I would move down if there’s a scope expansion or no substantive update by mid-June.",
