    "review": "All three of us independently arrived at 87%, which provides validation through convergent reasoning. We identified the same key evidence: the exceptional 2025 trend (517 monthly average with every month exceeding 400), strong historical June performance (3 of last 4 years above 400, likely 5 of last 6), and 28+ consecutive months above the threshold. Forecaster 2 raised a valid point about summer weather increasing outdoor activity and visibility, which I hadn't explicitly mentioned but supports the historical June strength. Forecaster 3's framing of '5+ years of June data' is slightly overstated (it's 4-5 years), but doesn't materially change the analysis. All three of us appropriately acknowledged the same risks: reporting system failures and unprecedented behavioral shifts. The convergence at 87% suggests we're correctly weighting the very strong empirical evidence against the inherent uncertainty in forecasting human behavior and rare but possible disruptions.",
    "rationale": "After reviewing the other forecasters' analyses, I find no compelling reason to adjust my forecast. We all examined the same robust evidence and arrived at identical conclusions through independent analysis. The 87% probability appropriately balances the overwhelming trend data (28+ consecutive months above 400, 2025 averaging 517, June historically strong) against legitimate uncertainties (month-to-month variation, system risks, unpredictable events). The threshold of 400 sits 117 points below the 2025 average, requiring approximately a 23% drop to miss. A 13% probability of such a drop or system failure seems well-calibrated given the consistency of recent data. No new information from the deliberation warrants updating this forecast. The convergence across three independent forecasters strengthens my confidence that 87% captures the appropriate level of certainty for this question.",
