    "review": "Both forecasters reinforce the key headwinds I already emphasized: national Tory weakness, Reform UK’s vote-splitting threat on the right, Lib Dem targeting, boundary changes, and leadership turnover. However, there are factual issues that reduce the weight of their incremental evidence: (1) The Wellingborough by-election was in North Northamptonshire, not West Northamptonshire—useful as a nearby signal, but not direct evidence about this council. (2) Forecaster 3 cites an 11-point national gap to Reform; the cited late-April figures are much closer (Reform ~25, Labour ~24, Conservatives ~22). Neither forecaster addresses the crucial uncertainty of Reform’s local candidate coverage and campaign effectiveness, which is pivotal for translating vote share into seats, especially if new boundaries create mostly single-member wards where splits can be decisive. Their arguments generally align with my priors but don’t provide new, decisive local data to shift my view.",
    "rationale": "Core view unchanged: Conservatives are underdogs to finish with the most seats given national headwinds, Reform’s rise (especially damaging under likely single-member FPTP wards), Lib Dem targeting in Tory-leaning areas, and the loss of the council leader’s incumbency. Boundary changes add variance that typically harms the dominant status quo. Offsetting factors remain: historically stronger Conservative local organization, incumbency at ward level, and the possibility Reform’s slate/ground game is patchy—limiting their ability to siphon enough votes in enough wards to push Conservatives below Labour or the Lib Dems seat-wise. The misinterpretation of the Wellingborough signal and the uncertain Reform local presence keep me from moving further down. With no fresh local candidate/ground intel, I maintain a modestly sub-50 view on a Conservative plurality rather than change materially.",
