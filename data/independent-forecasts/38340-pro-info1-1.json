  "information": "As of early June 2025, Sudan has not ratified the AfCFTA agreement nor submitted its Provisional Schedule of Tariff Concessions. The country is in an ongoing civil war, resulting in fragmented government, the absence of a functioning legislature, and suspension from the African Union (AU). Despite the conflict, a draft national AfCFTA implementation strategy for Sudan was previously reviewed and validated by stakeholders in a process supported by the Intergovernmental Authority on Development (IGAD).",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Less than one month. The deadline is July 1, 2025, and today's date is June 6, 2025.",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "The ongoing civil war continues, preventing the formation of a stable, unified government with a functioning legislature capable of ratifying international treaties. The de facto authorities remain focused on the conflict, and Sudan's suspension from the African Union remains in place. The July 1, 2025 deadline passes without the instrument of ratification being deposited.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "A sudden and comprehensive peace agreement is signed between the warring factions within the next week. A transitional government of national unity is immediately formed and internationally recognized, and a provisional legislature is convened. As a symbolic act of re-engagement with the continent, this new body makes ratifying AfCFTA its first priority, completes the entire legal and parliamentary process, and deposits the instrument of ratification with the AU Commission just before the July 1, 2025 deadline.",
    "rationale": "The basis for my forecast is the overwhelming political and institutional reality in Sudan. The country is in the midst of a devastating civil war, which has led to a complete breakdown of normal state functions. Treaty ratification is a formal legislative process that requires a legitimate, recognized, and functioning legislative body. According to the research, Sudan currently has no such body. Furthermore, Sudan is suspended from the African Union, the very organization overseeing the AfCFTA, which presents a significant political and procedural barrier to depositing an instrument of ratification.\n\nThe timeline is the final prohibitive factor. With less than a month until the deadline, the sequence of events required for a 'Yes' outcome—a lasting peace deal, the formation of a new government, the convening of a parliament, and the completion of the ratification process—is virtually impossible to achieve. While there was earlier technocratic work on an implementation strategy, the subsequent conflict has rendered that progress moot for the time being.\n\nMy forecast is not lower than 1% because forecasting absolutes (0% or 100%) is unwise. An unforeseen 'black swan' event, such as a sudden military victory by one side followed by a bid for international legitimacy via treaty ratification, is not metaphysically impossible, merely extraordinarily improbable.\n\nMy forecast is not higher because the combined obstacles of a civil war, the absence of a legislature, AU suspension, and the extremely short time frame create an almost insurmountable barrier to ratification.\n\nTo increase my forecast, I would need to see evidence of an imminent and comprehensive peace deal and the immediate formation of a functioning, recognized government with AfCFTA ratification on its urgent agenda.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill Sudan ratify AfCFTA (the pan-African free trade agreement) before July 1, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\n[Draft National AfCFTA Implementation Strategy for Sudan Reviewed and Validated by Stakeholders](https://igad.int/draft-national-afcfta-implementation-strategy-for-sudan-reviewed-and-validated-by-stakeholders/)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if Sudan ratifies the African Continental Free Trade Area (AfCFTA) Agreement before July 1, 2025.\n\n\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nAs of early June 2025, Sudan has not ratified the AfCFTA agreement nor submitted its Provisional Schedule of Tariff Concessions.

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
