    "review": "The deliberation provided valuable points for consideration. Forecaster 3's analysis strongly aligns with my own, emphasizing the established precedent of in-person attendance (2023, 2024) and the high strategic stakes, correctly identifying the key risks as a military crisis or security threat. Forecaster 2 introduced two key arguments: the precedent of virtual participation and the logistical challenges of travel to Canada. The point on logistics is valid and a factor I had not explicitly weighed. However, the premise regarding a 'mixed precedent' was based on a factual error, as President Zelenskyy attended the 2024 G7 summit in Italy in person, not virtually. Correcting this fact significantly weakens the argument for a lower probability and instead strengthens the case for 'Yes' by establishing a clear two-year pattern of in-person attendance.",
    "rationale": "After reviewing the other forecasts, I will not be changing my initial probability of 90%. My confidence is primarily rooted in the combination of President Zelenskyy's explicit and public statement of intent ('And I will be') and the concrete security preparations being made by the host nation, Canada. These are very strong positive indicators.\n\nThe deliberation helped me refine my thinking. Forecaster 3's point about the specific strategic importance of lobbying for sanctions in person reinforces the high incentive for Zelenskyy to attend. Forecaster 2's point about the increased logistical complexity and distance of traveling to Canada versus Europe is a valid consideration that slightly increases the risk of cancellation. However, I believe these two new points largely offset each other. \n\nThe central argument against a higher probability remains the inherent volatility of a nation at war. A sudden, major battlefield escalation or a specific, credible security threat could force a cancellation. My 90% forecast already allocates a 10% probability to such a disruptive event occurring in the roughly 12 days before the summit. Given the very strong positive evidence, I believe this allocation of risk is appropriate and does not need adjustment based on the new arguments presented.",
