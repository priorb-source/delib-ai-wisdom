    "review": "Forecaster 2 adds a concrete claim that there were ~8 new signatories in the first 4.5 months of 2025 and translates that into a monthly Poisson rate implying >75% chance in any given month. That’s a useful quantitative anchor and suggests current momentum is elevated. However, treating signings as a stationary Poisson process is a strong assumption; diplomatic signings are lumpy, tied to events, and momentum can be front‑loaded. Forecaster 3 appropriately contrasts the long‑run base rate (~0.9/month since 2020) with recent acceleration and emphasizes timing noise in a narrow 30‑day window. Their caution on timing is well‑taken, but relying too much on the long‑run average likely underweights the current year’s push. Overall, F2 nudges me slightly up due to the YTD pace; F3’s arguments reinforce keeping the estimate below the pure Poisson implied probability because of timing uncertainty and potential saturation effects.",
    "rationale": "We are forecasting a Yes if at least one country signs after May 30 and before July 1, 2025. Recent cadence is strong: Bangladesh (Apr 8) and Norway (May 15), and plausibly ~8 signings YTD by mid‑May, implying an elevated short‑term hazard (roughly 1.5–2 signings/month). June also often features aerospace/diplomatic events that can serve as announcement venues, which modestly boosts odds. Countervailing factors: signings cluster and are not time‑homogeneous; many likely candidates have already joined; and we lack any public, credible pre‑signal for a June signing, so exact‑month timing risk is real. Balancing the higher 2025 momentum (pushing the monthly chance well above 50%) against timing lumpiness and diminishing‑returns saturation keeps me from going as high as the Poisson‑implied ~80%. I move slightly up from my prior to reflect the additional weight on YTD pace while still discounting for timing uncertainty.",
