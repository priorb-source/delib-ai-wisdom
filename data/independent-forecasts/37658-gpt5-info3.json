  "information": "Several activist investors have taken positions in U.S. Steel. Third Point, a hedge fund, disclosed ownership of 12.2 million shares at the end of the first quarter of 2025, with its leader, Daniel Loeb, expressing optimism that the merger can be completed. Another firm, Toms Capital Investment Management, held 4.9 million shares during the same period. U.S. Steel's stock has been volatile, rising 2.5% on May 9, 2025, after reports of progress in merger talks. However, market analysis has noted the stock trading at $44 per share, a significant discount to Nippon Steel's $55 per share offer.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "~46 days (until July 1, 2025)",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No — the parties do not file an 8‑K terminating the deal by July 1, and the transaction continues pending regulatory review/negotiations or an extension.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "CFIUS/antitrust review continues into July; parties signal progress or simply run the clock while negotiating mitigation; any outside date is extended; no termination 8‑K is filed before July 1.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "A clear blocking event occurs on or before July 1 (e.g., a presidential order following a negative CFIUS recommendation) or one party walks due to inability to secure approvals/accept mitigation, and an SEC Form 8‑K is filed announcing termination or abandonment before July 1.",
    "rationale": "- Time horizon: Only ~1.5 months remain. Even deals under serious pressure often drift rather than terminate within such a tight window, especially if regulatory processes are ongoing and extensions are available.\n- Status quo bias: The default is continued pendency. A formal termination requires a decisive trigger (e.g., presidential prohibition) or a strategic choice to walk away. Absent that, inertia favors “No.”\n- Signals from price and news: The stock trading around $44 vs the $55 offer implies substantial risk of delay/failure, but not necessarily failure in the next 46 days. The May 9 report of progress in talks and activist positions (Third Point’s 12.2m shares; Toms Capital’s 4.9m) suggest informed investors see a path to completion and prefer extension over abandonment. That lowers near-term termination odds.\n- Political/regulatory risk: Opposition from political figures and national-security sensitivities keep a real possibility of a block. If a presidential order arrives by late June, a termination 8‑K would likely follow promptly. That is the main pathway to a “Yes.”\nWhy not higher: A near-term formal collapse needs a specific, time-bounded event (e.g., an adverse CFIUS outcome or refusal to extend). With “progress in talks” reported and activists signaling optimism, the probability that such a definitive action occurs within 46 days is limited.\nWhy not lower: The wide spread to $55 implies material risk remains. Both political parties have previously voiced skepticism about foreign ownership of U.S. Steel, so a near-term adverse CFIUS outcome or political intervention can’t be ruled out.\nUpdate triggers up: Credible reports of (a) CFIUS recommending prohibition to the President, (b) the President preparing or issuing a block, (c) either party signaling no extension/willingness to terminate, or (d) leaks of termination fee discussions.\nUpdate triggers down: Reports of a CFIUS mitigation agreement nearing completion, formal extension of the outside date, supportive public statements from key decision-makers, or union endorsements that ease political pressure.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill the US Steel/Nippon Steel merger collapse before July 1, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nWikipedia: [Proposed acquisition of U.S. Steel by Nippon Steel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proposed_acquisition_of_U.S._Steel_by_Nippon_Steel)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question will resolve as **Yes** if, before July 1, 2025, either U.S. Steel or Nippon Steel files an SEC Form 8-K announcing the merger agreement's termination or abandonment.\n\n\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nSeveral activist investors have taken positions in U.S. Steel.

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
