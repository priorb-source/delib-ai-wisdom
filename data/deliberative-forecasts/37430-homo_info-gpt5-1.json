    "review": "Forecaster 2 adds a key claim I hadn’t incorporated: that the House has already passed the Tax Reform Bill and the Senate is next, with a July 1 implementation target. If accurate, that materially improves odds by reducing the remaining steps to Senate passage, any harmonization, and presidential assent. However, I don’t yet have independent confirmation of House passage; if it was only a second reading or committee stage, the uplift is smaller. Forecaster 3’s points about labor pushback on the broader package, mid‑year timing being atypical for major tax changes, and the possibility of decoupling the exemption are consistent with my original caution. I also agree with both that executive prioritization can compress timelines when leadership wants it done, but slippage is common and VAT revenue sharing with states creates resistance to exemptions.",
    "rationale": "I’m nudging my forecast up modestly to reflect the possibility that one chamber has already passed the bill and that the administration is signaling a July 1 start date, which suggests active prioritization. That said, I remain below even odds because: (1) time is tight for Senate passage, harmonization (if texts differ), enrollment, and presidential assent before July 1; (2) the bill is multi‑pronged, inviting amendments or delay; (3) VAT exemptions affect FAAC distributions, so governors and revenue stakeholders may push back, risking either dilution of the exemption or slower movement; (4) Nigeria often clusters tax enactments in year‑end Finance Acts, and slippage from a Q1 target has already occurred. If House passage is definitively confirmed with the real estate VAT exemption intact and the Senate schedules swift second/third readings, I’d move toward ~50–55%. Absent that confirmation, the base case remains that timelines slip past July 1 or the exemption is pared back. My update is therefore a cautious increase rather than a jump.",
