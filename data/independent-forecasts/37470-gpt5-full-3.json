  "information": "On April 29, 2025, Egypt's Minister of Youth and Sports, Dr. Ashraf Sobhy, met with Gilberto Gartner, a Brazilian national who is the President of the International Traditional Karate Federation (ITKF). The purpose of the meeting was to discuss Egypt's bid to host the 2026 World Traditional Karate Championship. Dr. Sobhy stated that Egypt has organized over 440 sports events in recent years, citing its modern sports infrastructure. President Gartner expressed confidence in Egypt's ability to host the championship successfully, noting he had witnessed a high level of organization at the World Gymnastics Championship in Egypt and that the country has a large base of karate practitioners.\n\nEgypt has a recent history of hosting major international sporting events. In April 2025, the country hosted the World Karate Premier League in Cairo, which involved 384 players from 67 countries. In May 2025, Egypt hosted the Pharaohs' Championship for Rhythmic Gymnastics with 18 participating countries, the African Championship for Rhythmic Gymnastics with 8 participating countries, and the 25th World Military Equestrian Championship with 20 participating nations. Egypt is also scheduled to host the Senior World Karate Championships (an event of the separate World Karate Federation) in November 2025.\n\nAnalysis of the International Traditional Karate Federation (ITKF) indicates a pattern of announcing World Championship hosts 24 to 36 months prior to the event. As of mid-May 2025, there is no mention of Egypt's 2026 bid, nor any related bid documentation, on the ITKF's official website. There have been no public reports of other nations submitting competing bids for the 2026 championship. Egypt previously hosted an ITKF event in 2014.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "About 7 weeks (≈54 days)",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Talks continue without a formal ITKF decision or the ITKF delays/defers 2026 host selection until after July 1, 2025, or selects another country but does not announce before the deadline.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "The ITKF executive body approves Egypt’s bid at a late-spring/early-summer meeting and issues an official announcement via its website or official channels before July 1, 2025.",
    "rationale": "- Current state: As of mid-May 2025 there is no ITKF announcement about the 2026 host on official channels. Egypt’s sports minister met the ITKF president on April 29 to discuss hosting, and the ITKF president voiced confidence in Egypt’s capability. Egypt has strong recent hosting credentials (multiple international events; WKF Senior Worlds in Nov 2025). No public competing bids are evident.\n- Timing pattern: Your assistant notes ITKF typically announces World Championship hosts 24–36 months in advance. If accurate, 2026’s host should already have been named. That makes a new announcement before July 1 a deviation from past practice and therefore less likely absent special circumstances.\n- Status-quo weight: In most cases, no news continues to be no news within short windows. With only ~7 weeks left, the default is no announcement by the deadline.\n- Path to Yes: Small federations can be flexible, and the April 29 meeting plus Egypt’s proven capacity could accelerate a decision. A June executive meeting or congress alongside a continental event could produce a quick approval and public announcement. Lack of visible rival bids modestly helps Egypt.\n- Why not higher: (1) The purported 24–36 month lead-time norm argues host decisions are usually made earlier; (2) No bid materials or ITKF references yet; (3) The resolution requires an ITKF announcement (not just Egyptian media), narrowing the ways the criterion can be met; (4) Limited time window.\n- Why not lower: (1) Clear political and organizational momentum with ITKF leadership engagement; (2) Egypt’s strong hosting track record and infrastructure; (3) Smaller federations can compress timelines, and an urgent need to fix the 2026 host could prompt a near-term decision; (4) No public evidence of competing hosts.\n- What would move me up: Verified notice of an imminent ITKF board/congress meeting in May/June with host selection on the agenda; ITKF publishing a shortlist or bid confirmation naming Egypt; credible leaks or joint ITKF–Egypt statements signaling pending approval.\n- What would move me down: ITKF signals that 2026 host selection is postponed or tied to a later event; reports of another country’s bid being favored; internal ITKF governance delays; Egypt indicating preference to focus on the Nov 2025 WKF Worlds or facing logistics/political headwinds.",

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
