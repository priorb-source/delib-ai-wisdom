  "information": "The potential purchase is part of Vietnam's broader effort to diversify its arms suppliers, moving away from its traditional reliance on Russian equipment. The deal is situated within a complex regional security environment, particularly Vietnam's ongoing territorial disputes with China in the South China Sea. Hanwha Aerospace, the manufacturer of the K9, has been actively securing defense contracts globally, with significant sales to Poland, Australia, and Egypt. The company reported a substantial increase in its first-quarter 2025 sales, driven by exports of the K9, and noted expectations for more orders in the second half of the year.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Approximately 2 months (61 days) from May 1, 2025 to July 1, 2025",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No. Currently there is no announced agreement, only reported ongoing negotiations. If nothing changes, the status quo of no formal announcement would continue through the resolution date.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Negotiations continue but fail to reach final agreement by July 1, 2025 due to complex technical specifications, financing terms disagreements, or political sensitivities regarding China. Alternatively, the deal is agreed in principle but bureaucratic processes or scheduled diplomatic events push the formal announcement beyond July 1.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "The reported negotiations conclude successfully within the next two months, with Vietnam and South Korea announcing the K9 howitzer purchase agreement (20 units for approximately $300 million) at a bilateral summit or through official government channels, marking South Korea's first major defense export to Vietnam.",
    "rationale": "This forecast weighs several competing factors. On the positive side: (1) Specific deal parameters are already public (20 K9 units, $300 million), suggesting negotiations are substantive and advanced rather than speculative; (2) Strong strategic rationale exists for both parties - Vietnam needs to diversify from Russian suppliers while South Korea seeks to expand defense exports; (3) Recent elevation to 'comprehensive strategic partnership' creates favorable political conditions; (4) Hanwha Aerospace has proven global success with K9 exports. However, significant headwinds exist: (1) The 2-month timeline is tight for finalizing a $300 million defense deal, which typically involve complex technical, financial, and political negotiations; (2) The phrase 'reportedly in negotiations' indicates the deal isn't finalized; (3) Vietnam must carefully manage China sensitivities given South China Sea disputes - a major defense deal with a U.S. ally could complicate this; (4) The Korea Herald article notes relationships 'need more detailed road map,' suggesting frameworks aren't fully concrete; (5) Status quo bias strongly favors 'No' since no agreement currently exists and the world changes slowly. Defense procurement typically takes 6-12+ months from advanced negotiations to announcement. While the specificity of reporting and strategic alignment suggest this is a serious initiative, the compressed timeline makes it more likely than not that either negotiations extend beyond July 1 or an announcement is delayed for diplomatic scheduling reasons. My forecast would increase significantly (to 60-70%) with reports of imminent high-level visits or official government statements about near-term signing ceremonies. It would decrease (to 20-25%) if reports emerged of stalled talks or competing bids gaining traction.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill Vietnam and South Korea announce an agreement for South Korea to export self-propelled howitzers to Vietnam?\n\nQuestion background:\nThe Korea Herald: [South Korea-Vietnam ties enter new strategic terrain, but need more detailed road map: Seoul envoy](https://www.koreaherald.com/article/10464718) \"Vietnam is reportedly in negotiations to import 20 units of K9 self-propelled howitzers from Korea in a deal valued at $300 million. If finalized, it would mark Korea’s first defense arms sale to the country.\"\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if, before July 1, 2025, the governments of Vietnam and/or South Korea announce an agreement for South Korea to export 2 or more self-propelled howitzers to Vietnam. If no such agreement is announced after the launch of this question and before July 1, 2025, this question resolves as **No**.\n\n\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nThe potential purchase is part of Vietnam's broader effort to diversify its arms suppliers, moving away from its traditional reliance on Russian equipment. The deal is situated within a complex regional security environment, particularly Vietnam's ongoing territorial disputes with China in the South China Sea.

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
