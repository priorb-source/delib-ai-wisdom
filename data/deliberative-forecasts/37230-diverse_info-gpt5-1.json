    "review": "Forecaster 2 adds useful, concrete catalysts I hadn’t explicitly enumerated: the May 7 FOMC, a dense earnings calendar (incl. remaining mega-caps), and PCE as a key pivot. I agree those are the primary drivers. I’d add that while the Fed can sound hawkish, an actual hike is very unlikely; the risk is guidance that leans “higher-for-longer,” which would pressure equities if inflation data run hot. F2’s balance and probability are close to my prior. \n\nForecaster 3 emphasizes tariff-driven EPS downgrades (Goldman’s 1–2%) and recession risk. I’m skeptical that a 1–2% EPS trim is decisive for a one-month horizon, especially with these tariff narratives largely known and plausibly partly priced. F3 rightly notes one-month randomness and that markets rise slightly more often than not, but I think they overweight the tariff angle relative to near-term rate/inflation and earnings catalysts that are more likely to move May’s tape. \n\nNet: F2’s calendar-focus is compelling and increases my attention to the timing of PCE on May 31 (month-end), which specifically matters for resolution. F3 doesn’t provide enough new, time-specific risk to push me below 50%, but the elevated hurdle from late-April’s rally and final-day data risk argue for a small downward nudge from my prior.",
    "rationale": "Starting from the historical base rate (roughly 55–60% of months finish higher), I see a balanced but event-heavy May. Supportive forces: resilient earnings (especially mega-cap tech/AI), a low probability of Fed hikes (even if guidance is hawkish-leaning), and typical positive monthly drift. Headwinds: the late-April surge raises the April close and thus May’s hurdle; VIX elevated implies larger swings; 10y yield sensitivity remains high; and critically, the April PCE release on May 31 could swing the final day’s close—the metric that decides resolution. Nvidia and a few remaining mega-cap reports late in the month are likely supportive on average, but the asymmetry around inflation surprises remains a risk. \n\nCompared to my initial 56%, I’m trimming a bit to reflect the higher bar set by April’s rally and the specific end-of-month PCE event risk that could flip the outcome on the final day. I don’t adopt the more bearish tilt from tariff-related EPS concerns given the modest magnitude and likelihood of partial pricing. Overall, modestly-above-coinflip remains appropriate, with a slight downgrade.",
