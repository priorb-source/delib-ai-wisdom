    "review": "All three forecasters agree on the fundamental evidence: multiple, high-level confirmations from the White House and allied nations, coupled with strong policy incentives for President Trump to attend, make 'Yes' the clear status quo outcome. The primary difference lies in the weight assigned to the remaining uncertainty—specifically, the tail risks of a last-minute cancellation. Forecaster 2 (87%) and Forecaster 3 (92%) place significant emphasis on Trump's personal history of unpredictability and the possibility of unforeseen crises or health issues. Their arguments are convincing in that my initial 2% probability for a 'No' outcome was likely too low and did not sufficiently account for the specific risk profile of this particular president. They rightly highlight that factors like age-related health risks and a penchant for dramatic, last-minute decisions warrant more consideration than a generic baseline risk. However, I believe their forecasts may over-weight the 'unpredictability' factor in this specific context. The high-profile, public nature of the confirmations from multiple governments creates a significant political cost for a cancellation that isn't forced by a major, verifiable event (like a health emergency or national crisis), thus constraining his flexibility more than usual.",
    "rationale": "I am slightly revising my forecast downward from 98% to 96%. The core of my high confidence remains unchanged: the official confirmations from the White House, the Dutch Prime Minister, and the Polish Foreign Minister are the strongest possible evidence short of the event itself. President Trump's strong policy interest in the summit's agenda, particularly on defense spending, provides a powerful incentive for him to be physically present to negotiate and lead. His scheduled attendance at the G7 summit the preceding week further reinforces that he is committed to this period of international engagement.\n\nThe deliberation with my colleagues prompted me to reconsider the small probability of a 'No' outcome. I am adjusting my forecast to better reflect the combined low-probability risks they highlighted. I am now allocating a 4% chance to a cancellation, up from 2%. This 4% encompasses the possibility of a sudden health issue, a major domestic or international crisis demanding his presence at home, a significant security threat, or a last-minute reversal driven by Trump's characteristic unpredictability. While I believe the high political cost of canceling a confirmed NATO summit attendance mitigates the 'unpredictability' risk, the other forecasters have persuaded me that it, combined with other tail risks, warrants more weight than I initially gave it. I am not lowering my forecast to their levels (92% or 87%) because I maintain that the public, multi-national confirmations create a powerful commitment device that makes a voluntary cancellation highly improbable.",
