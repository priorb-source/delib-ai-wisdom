    "review": "The other forecasters raised critical information I had not fully considered. Forecaster 2 highlights that the Supreme Court ruling was *unanimous* and that there is active district court supervision with specific deadlines - this is stronger legal pressure than I initially weighted. The fact that a judge is demanding documentation and can escalate to contempt/sanctions is significant. However, they also note the missed April 7 deadline, which is concerning evidence of persistent obstacles.\n\nForecaster 3 introduces what may be the most critical information: Garcia is allegedly in a maximum-security prison in El Salvador, with President Bukele publicly calling him a 'terrorist' and vowing not to release him. If true, this represents a fundamentally different and much more severe obstacle than U.S. bureaucratic resistance alone. Getting a foreign head of state to reverse a public hardline position within 2 months would be extraordinarily difficult, regardless of U.S. court orders.\n\nHowever, there's tension between these analyses. Forecaster 2 seems to frame this as primarily a U.S. government cooperation issue, while Forecaster 3 frames it as El Salvador refusing to release him. Trump's comment about making 'a single phone call' suggests U.S. control, but Bukele's alleged imprisonment of Garcia would override that.\n\nThe key uncertainty is whether Garcia is actually imprisoned by El Salvador or simply in El Salvador awaiting U.S. facilitation of return. This fundamentally changes the problem.",
    "rationale": "After reviewing both analyses, I need to weigh two scenarios: (1) Garcia needs U.S. government cooperation to return, facing political resistance but strong court pressure, or (2) Garcia is imprisoned in El Salvador by Bukele, creating a diplomatic/sovereignty obstacle that courts cannot directly overcome.\n\nThe unanimous Supreme Court ruling and active judicial oversight are stronger factors than I initially credited - courts can impose meaningful sanctions and escalate pressure. Operationally, returns can happen quickly once authorized. This pushes probability higher.\n\nHowever, the imprisonment claim, if accurate, is an enormous obstacle. Even with court orders, the U.S. cannot simply compel a foreign government to release someone from prison within 2 months, especially when that government has taken a public hardline stance. The missed April 7 deadline and reported lack of embassy instructions suggest this is not currently being prioritized.\n\nGiven the 2-month timeline, I'm updating downward from my initial 12%. While court pressure is real, the combination of: (1) demonstrated administration resistance, (2) potential El Salvador imprisonment obstacle, (3) missed deadlines, and (4) very tight timeframe makes a return increasingly unlikely. However, I'm not going as low as 2% because the legal pressure and operational possibility of quick action if priorities shift keeps some probability alive.",
