    "review": "Forecaster 2 and Forecaster 3 provided critical arguments that I had overlooked. I found their reasoning highly convincing. Forecaster 2's distinction between an 'initiative' and an 'imminent announcement' correctly tempers my initial optimism, highlighting that diplomatic processes take time, especially within a narrow 30-day window. Forecaster 3 introduced a decisive piece of information: the UK general election on July 4 and the associated 'purdah' period. This is a critical constraint that makes a major UK foreign policy announcement in June extremely unlikely. This new information fundamentally undermines my initial thesis, which was heavily predicated on the potential for an immediate, joint Franco-British recognition. My initial forecast was clearly overconfident and missed this key political context.",
    "rationale": "I am making a substantial downward revision to my forecast based on the compelling arguments and new information provided by the other forecasters. My initial 75% forecast was based on the assumption that a joint UK-France initiative announced in late May would lead to a rapid recognition in June.\n\nHowever, Forecaster 3's point about the UK's July 4th general election and the pre-election 'purdah' period is a game-changer. This convention severely restricts the incumbent government from making major policy announcements, which would almost certainly include the recognition of a new state. This effectively removes the UK as a potential actor for June, and with it, the possibility of the joint action that I had anticipated.\n\nThe focus now shifts to whether another country might act alone in June. France is the most likely candidate from the 'initiative', but as both other forecasters noted, Paris typically prefers coordinated, sequenced diplomatic moves over unilateral ones. While possible, it's less probable they would rush to act alone in June when a coordinated move with a new UK government might be possible later in the summer. Other smaller European states like Malta or Belgium could potentially move, but there is no specific information signaling their intent for June. \n\nTherefore, while the general momentum towards recognition among European states has clearly increased, the specific constraints on the primary actor (the UK) and the diplomatic preferences of the other (France) make the narrow June 2025 window much less likely to see an announcement. My initial forecast was flawed by missing key context. I now believe a 30% probability more accurately reflects the situation: a non-trivial chance given the overall momentum, but far from the most likely outcome due to specific, short-term political and diplomatic hurdles.",
