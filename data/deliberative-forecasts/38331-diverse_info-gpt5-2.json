    "review": "Both analyses correctly emphasize the short time horizon and the durability of censorship in these regimes, which supports a Yes outcome. Forecaster 3’s point about seven independent failure points is apt, and their mention of Wikipedia process risk is important. However, neither puts enough weight on the specific Wikipedia-classification risk (as opposed to policy changes) for Russia and especially Venezuela, where blocking has historically been intermittent and subject to measurement-based reclassification. Forecaster 2 seems overconfident at 98% and cites Pakistan (which isn’t relevant here and appears mismatched to the provided RA note), and does not grapple with Wikipedia’s tendency to adjust entries based on OONI/NetBlocks updates. Forecaster 3’s 88% is closer to my view and appropriately notes Wikipedia unpredictability, though I’d still explicitly flag Venezuela and, to a lesser extent, Myanmar and Russia, as the main reclassification risks.",
    "rationale": "In the next ~26 days, true policy reversals in China, Iran, North Korea, Turkmenistan, or Myanmar are highly unlikely. Russia also shows no credible signs of imminent unblocking. The dominant path to a No is a Wikipedia reclassification, most plausibly for Venezuela (where blocking has often been event-driven and ISP-specific) and secondarily Russia (due to evolving accessibility workarounds or reinterpretation by editors). I also include a small tail for Myanmar reclassification and a minor probability for page-structure/editorial noise or brief consensus churn near the resolution date. Roughly: Venezuela reclassification 6–8%, Russia 2–3%, Myanmar ~1%, all others combined ~1%, plus ~1% for Wikipedia/process noise. That aggregates to ~13% risk of No, implying ~87% Yes. The other forecasters’ arguments about inertia nudge me slightly upward from my prior, but the Venezuela/Russia classification risks keep me below ~90%.",
