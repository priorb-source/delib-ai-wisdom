    "review": "Both forecasters make compelling arguments that I initially underweighted. Forecaster 2 correctly emphasizes that TROs can be obtained very rapidly - sometimes within days - in cases with clear irreparable harm, which 6,800 students facing loss of legal status certainly represents. The legal arguments under the APA (arbitrary and capricious) and potential First Amendment violations are stronger than I initially credited, especially given the revocation's apparent retaliatory nature. Forecaster 3 provides important counterbalances, noting judicial deference on immigration matters and the risk of government seeking appellate stays to block any restoration order. However, both forecasters may be slightly optimistic. While the TRO pathway is real, the administration has demonstrated extraordinary commitment by pulling $4 billion in funding, suggesting they'll fight emergency relief aggressively at every level. The 34-day window, while not impossible for emergency proceedings, remains very tight when accounting for potential appeals and stays. I was too pessimistic at 18% by not fully accounting for emergency relief mechanisms, but 47-60% may underweight the obstacles.",
    "rationale": "I'm updating significantly upward from 18% based on three key insights from the other forecasters: (1) Emergency TROs can be granted within days when irreparable harm is clear and immediate, making the 34-day timeline more feasible than I initially thought, (2) Harvard's legal case appears quite strong - the revocation is transparently retaliatory, affects thousands of students immediately, and may violate APA standards for arbitrary/capricious action, (3) Federal courts have shown willingness to check executive overreach in high-profile cases, especially when academic freedom is at stake. However, I'm not updating as high as 47-60% because significant obstacles remain: the Trump administration has shown extreme commitment (having already pulled $4 billion), immigration/national security matters receive substantial judicial deference, even a favorable TRO could be stayed by appellate courts before July 1, and we're starting from a status quo of decertification just 6 days old. The path exists but faces real headwinds.",
