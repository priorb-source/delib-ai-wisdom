    "review": "Forecaster 3 raises the most critical evidence I failed to consider: the historical base rate of 94% (16 of 17 plenaries since 2018) resulting in grey list changes, with the sole exception being October 2020's COVID-affected virtual meeting. This is far more powerful predictive evidence than focusing primarily on individual country situations. Forecaster 2 provides valuable complementary intelligence about removal candidates (Nigeria targeting end of May, Mozambique with positive April on-site visit feedback, South Africa having addressed 20 of 22 items) that strengthens the case beyond just my BVI addition focus. Both forecasters correctly emphasize that with 25 jurisdictions and active monitoring, the statistical likelihood of at least one change is high. I was anchoring too heavily on diplomatic complexity and specific country uncertainty rather than properly weighting the strong historical pattern of regular changes at plenaries.",
    "rationale": "I am updating my forecast significantly upward based on the compelling historical base rate evidence. The 94% historical frequency of changes at FATF plenaries since 2018 should be my primary anchor, not specific country intelligence. The single exception occurred under extraordinary COVID circumstances that don't apply to June 2025. February 2025's changes (Philippines removed, Laos/Nepal added) confirm normal operations continue. The combination of (1) extremely strong historical precedent, (2) multiple specific removal candidates with concrete progress (Nigeria, Mozambique, South Africa), (3) strong addition candidate in BVI with expired grace period, and (4) 25 jurisdictions providing many opportunities for at least one change, all point to a much higher probability than my initial 72%. However, I'm not going to the full 92% because some prudent discounting is warranted for: uncertainty about whether countries targeting June will fully complete requirements in time, South Africa explicitly targeting October rather than June, and inherent execution risks in international processes. My updated forecast of 83% reflects strong weight on historical patterns while maintaining modest conservatism for timing and procedural uncertainties.",
