    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Less than 2 months.",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Beyond Meat manages its cash reserves and debt obligations effectively enough to avoid a liquidity crisis through the second quarter, pushing any potential filing beyond the July 1, 2025 deadline. This could be achieved through continued cost-cutting, inventory management, and potentially securing waivers from creditors.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "A severe liquidity event occurs. For example, cash reserves dwindle faster than anticipated, a major creditor calls a loan due to a covenant breach, or a critical financing deal falls through, forcing management to seek bankruptcy protection to continue operations.",
    "rationale": "My forecast is based on the very short time horizon of this question. While Beyond Meat is in significant financial distress, with a history of substantial losses, filing for bankruptcy is a drastic step that companies typically postpone as long as possible. The status quo for a financially distressed company is often to continue operating and attempting a turnaround, not immediate collapse. The timeframe of less than two months makes this status quo outcome the most probable one. Companies can often manage cash and negotiate with creditors to survive for short periods, even in dire circumstances. The company's management is actively pursuing cost reductions and operational changes aimed at survival. A bankruptcy filing within the next 53 days would likely require an acute, unforeseen catalyst such as a sudden acceleration of cash burn or a creditor forcing the issue, which is possible but not the most likely scenario. My probability is not lower because the company's financial position is genuinely precarious; their significant operating losses and negative cash flow represent a real and present danger of insolvency. A forecast closer to 0% would improperly discount this risk. My probability is not higher because a bankruptcy filing in any given two-month period is a low base-rate event, and there is no public information suggesting an immediate, precipitating crisis that would make a filing imminent. I would increase my forecast probability of a 'Yes' outcome if reports emerge that the company has hired restructuring advisors, if they violate debt covenants without receiving a waiver, or if they announce a sudden inability to meet payment obligations. Conversely, I would lower the probability if they announce new financing or report quarterly results showing a significant improvement in cash burn.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill Beyond Meat file for bankruptcy before July 1, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nBeyond Meat has had several years of losses and in the most recent quarter it [posted](https://investors.beyondmeat.com/news-releases/news-release-details/beyond-meatr-reports-fourth-quarter-and-full-year-2024-financial) a loss from operations of almost $38 million.\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question will resolve as **Yes** if Beyond Meat, Inc., files any petition for bankruptcy protection in the United States, under any chapter of the United States Bankruptcy Code, before July 1, 2025. The question will resolves on the filing of such a petition, not on whether any bankruptcy protection is granted by a court. If no such petition is filed by that date, this question will resolve as **No**.\n\n\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nNo additional information available.\n\nToday is 2025-05-08.\n\nBefore answering you think:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n(e) You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
