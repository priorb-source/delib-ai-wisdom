    "review": "The other two forecasters and I have independently arrived at the same 35% probability, suggesting a strong consensus. Their analyses introduced new, valuable information that I had not considered, specifically the May 5 Kremlin comments describing a potential meeting as \"certainly necessary\" but requiring significant \"adequate preparation at various expert levels.\" They also brought up reports of Trump floating a mid-May meeting, which the Kremlin subsequently downplayed. Forecaster 2's point that leader meetings are often preceded by a call is a strong argument for 'Yes', but this is effectively countered by their own point, and the Kremlin's statement, that the required groundwork suggests a longer timeline than the one specified. Both forecasters also rightly emphasized the strict resolution criterion that *both* sides must acknowledge the call, which adds a significant hurdle that I had not weighed heavily enough. Their reasoning is highly convincing and serves to strengthen the case for the 35% forecast rather than shift it.",
    "rationale": "After reviewing the other analyses, I am maintaining my forecast of 35%. The deliberation has solidified my confidence in this probability rather than changing it. The new information regarding the Kremlin's May 5th statements provides a crucial push-and-pull dynamic. On one hand, the fact that a high-level meeting is considered \"certainly necessary\" confirms that channels are open and dialogue is a priority, which prevents the forecast from being lower. On the other hand, the emphasis on a lengthy, staff-led preparation process and the downplaying of an imminent meeting strongly suggest that a leader-to-leader call is more likely to occur outside the narrow May 12-June 15 window.\n\nThe other forecasters' focus on the mutual-acknowledgment requirement is a key point. This criterion introduces another potential point of failure; a call could occur, but if it serves one side's interest to remain silent or ambiguous, the question would resolve as 'No'.\n\nTherefore, the 35% forecast remains a robust estimate. It correctly prices in the established precedent for communication and the ongoing discussions about a future meeting, while also being appropriately constrained by the short timeframe, the official statements indicating a slow preparatory process, and the strict resolution criteria.",
