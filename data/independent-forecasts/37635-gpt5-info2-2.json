  "information": "A survey in Argentina conducted between April 28 and 30, 2025, by D'Alessio IROL/Berensztein indicated growing wear on Javier Milei's government. The survey showed his positive image has decreased to 44%, while his negative image has increased to 52%, for a net differential of -8%. 52% of respondents believe the economic situation is worse than the previous year. The evaluation of his government is divided, with 50% rating it as good and 48% as bad. Security Minister Patricia Bullrich has the highest positive image in the cabinet at 47%, as insecurity is the main social concern for 72% of respondents.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "About 45 days (until June 28, 2025)",
    "status_quo_outcome": "Yes (Milei 61% vs Sheinbaum 60% per the background at question time)",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "By late June, Morning Consult shows Sheinbaum at ~60–63% while Milei has slipped to the mid–50s to ~58%, or even a tie. Any Sheinbaum honeymoon persistence plus modest deterioration in Argentine sentiment pushes her at/above Milei. A tie resolves No.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Milei sustains or regains a clear edge (e.g., 60–62% vs Sheinbaum ~58–60%) due to visible economic stabilization headlines (inflation deceleration, FX stability, reform passage/market rally), while Sheinbaum dips on a security/energy/governance stumble that briefly knocks a few points off her approval.",
    "rationale": "- Arbiter: Morning Consult global leader approval. A single comparison when Metaculus checks on/after June 28; ties count as No.\n- Status quo: Milei holds a 1-pt edge (61 vs 60). Good practice is to overweight the status quo. However, the margin is razor-thin and ties go to No, so the bar for a Yes is effectively “Milei strictly above Sheinbaum on that check.”\n- Trend signals: The assistant’s cited Argentina poll (D’Alessio IROL/Berensztein, Apr 28–30) shows Milei’s image weakening (44% positive, 52% negative, net -8). That is not Morning Consult, but it aligns with plausible headwinds from austerity and social costs. Morning Consult’s series tends to move slowly but can reflect medium-term sentiment shifts.\n- Mexico baseline: New presidents often enjoy a honeymoon. AMLO’s Morning Consult numbers were persistently high; Sheinbaum’s have been robust so far (background puts her at 60%). It’s reasonable she stays near 60 through late June absent a shock.\n- Argentina baseline: Milei’s approval has been comparatively high at times, but 2025 brings trade-offs as stabilization pain bites. A modest downtrend into the high-50s by late June seems more likely than an uptick.\n- Net: With a 1-point starting edge for Milei but headwinds and a tie counting as No, the balance favors No. Still, a Yes is very plausible if June headlines favor Milei (reforms/inflation) or if Sheinbaum hits a transient rough patch.\n- Why not higher: Tie-to-No rule, Milei’s recent negative momentum, and Sheinbaum’s likely honeymoon stability.\n- Why not lower: Morning Consult can keep leaders’ approvals quite sticky; Milei could hold ~60 if macro indicators improve. Small week-to-week noise could keep him a tick ahead.\n- Updates:\n  • Upward (toward Yes): Clear Argentine macro wins (notably visible in headlines), legislative victories, an uptick in MC showing Milei > Sheinbaum by ≥2 pts in mid-June; or a Mexico shock (security/blackouts/scandal) that knocks Sheinbaum below 60.\n  • Downward (toward No): Continued Argentine social unrest or worsening living-standards data; MC prints Milei ≤ Sheinbaum or a tie in early/mid-June; Sheinbaum holding steady ≥60.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill Javier Milei have a higher approval rating than Claudia Sheinbaum on June 28, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nAt the time of this question, Sheinbaum is at 60% as compared with Milei at 61%.\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if Javier Milei has a higher approval rating than Claudia Sheinbaum at [Morning Consult](https://pro.morningconsult.com/trackers/global-leader-approval) when checked by Metaculus on or after June 28, 2025. A tie or a lead by Sheinbaum resolves the question as **No**.\n\n\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nA survey in Argentina conducted between April 28 and 30, 2025, by D'Alessio IROL/Berensztein indicated growing wear on Javier Milei's government.

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
