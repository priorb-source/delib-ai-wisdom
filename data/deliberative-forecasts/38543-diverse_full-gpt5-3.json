    "review": "Both forecasters emphasize the same core constraint I weighed: the compressed timeline and lack of visible advance work. They add useful clarity on the two narrow travel windows (Jun 19-23 and Jun 26-30) and the improbability of staging a complex, protocol-heavy China visit without detectable prep. They also sharpen the point that, while urgency exists around the trade framework, the tariff deadline is after July 1, slightly biasing a leaders’ meeting into early July or via a third country/virtual option. I find their reasoning generally convincing and appropriately base-rate driven. I don’t see new factual information, but their framing nudges me to weight the logistics and protocol norms even more heavily and to discount the “surprise visit” tail a bit further for China specifically (as opposed to warzone/base visits).",
    "rationale": "Time left is 16 days, with Trump locked into G7 (Jun 16-18) and NATO (Jun 24-25), and Xi in Kazakhstan Jun 16-18. The feasible windows are Jun 19-23 and Jun 26-30. There are no public signs of advance teams or security preparations, which are typically visible weeks in advance for a China visit. The political incentive is real: an announced invitation/acceptance, a reported trade framework awaiting leaders’ sign-off, and a tariff pause expiring July 9. However, because the key tariff date is after July 1, the modal timing for any in-person meeting skews to early July or a third-country venue—neither of which resolves this question as Yes. China’s preference for choreography and domestic propaganda value also argues against an impromptu, minimally prepared late-June visit. Trump’s penchant for unpredictability keeps a non-zero tail, and a short, highly controlled trip in the Jun 26-30 window remains imaginable, but the absence of prep signals and the tight schedule dominate. I previously held 12%; after weighing Forecasters 2 and 3’s base-rate emphasis and the July 9 tariff timing (which reduces the necessity of a pre–July 1 meeting), I’m trimming to 8%. I would move up quickly on credible reports of advance teams or official guidance hinting at a late-June China stop; I would move down if we approach Jun 23 with no prep signals or if a third-country/early-July meeting is reported.",
