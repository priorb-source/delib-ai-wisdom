  "information": "According to U.S. government data, 757 Unidentified Aerial Phenomena (UAP) incidents were reported between May 2023 and June 2024, with 708 of these occurring in the air. One notable incident from January 2023 involved a U.S. Air Force F-16 fighter jet colliding with an unidentified object over Arizona, resulting in damage to the aircraft's canopy.",

    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "About 40 days (until Metaculus checks on/after 2025-07-01)",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "June 2025 sees either no NUFORC pilot-category reports at all, or any pilot reports are from outside Africa, or African June sightings exist but are not tagged as pilot reports on NUFORC (e.g., civilian witnesses), or the location is over international waters rather than an African country.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "An airline or GA pilot flying within the airspace of, say, South Africa, Egypt, Kenya, Nigeria, Morocco, etc., has a June 2025 UAP sighting, submits to NUFORC, and NUFORC lists it under the pilot reports subindex with the occurrence date in June and the location clearly in an African country. The entry is visible on the pilot-reports page when checked after July 1, 2025.",
    "rationale": "Baseline reasoning: NUFORC’s “pilot reports” are a small subset of total reports and appear disproportionately US/Western. Africa accounts for a small share of global air traffic and NUFORC submissions, and awareness of NUFORC outside the US is limited. Even if pilots in or over Africa observe UAP, multiple gates must be passed for a Yes: a pilot must report to NUFORC (not a local authority or social media only), NUFORC must publish and tag it as a pilot report, the sighting must have occurred in June 2025, and the location must be an African country (not international airspace). This multiplicative chain keeps the probability modest. \n\nEvidence and anchors: The background example shows NUFORC does post African sightings (e.g., Rwanda, Jan 2025), so the probability is not near zero. However, that example is not necessarily a pilot report. My rough base-rate intuition is that NUFORC gets only a handful to perhaps low tens of pilot-tagged reports per month globally, with Africa likely representing a very small fraction (on the order of 1–3%). Under a Poisson-like view, that implies roughly a mid-single-digit probability in any given month of at least one African pilot report. Allowing for increased global attention to UAP and the fact that resolution does not require posting before July 1 (backfilled June occurrences still count when checked later), I shade slightly upward from the absolute floor. \n\nResearch assistant input: They cited 757 UAP incidents in USG data (May 2023–June 2024) and a reported Jan 2023 F-16 collision claim. This indicates ongoing reporting volume but is not specific to NUFORC or Africa and thus carries limited weight for this particular question. \n\nWhy not higher: NUFORC’s pilot category is niche; Africa is underrepresented in NUFORC submissions; classification as a “pilot report” is uncertain; and location must be explicitly within an African country. These constraints make a June event from Africa unlikely in any single month. \n\nWhy not lower: NUFORC does accept and post international reports, including from Africa. Airline traffic over Africa is nontrivial, and heightened interest in UAP could modestly increase reporting likelihood. The resolution allows for later posting as long as the occurrence date is June, which slightly boosts chances versus a cutoff tied to posting date. \n\nWhat would move me up: Early signs in June of multiple pilot-category postings; evidence that NUFORC recently increased pilot-report curation; any June pilot sighting in African airspace reported publicly or to NUFORC. \n\nWhat would move me down: Observing that NUFORC’s pilot subindex has had very sparse activity in recent months, especially zero non-US entries; indications that NUFORC is behind on or has paused category tagging; or any change implying that the pilot subindex is not being maintained.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill a pilot report of UFOs come from a country in Africa in June 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nFor example, the resolution source [reports](https://nuforc.org/sighting/?id=186297) a 4 craft inline formation of UFOs having been sighted on January 1, 2025 in Rwanda.\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if The National UFO Reporting Center posts a pilot report of a UFO/UAP having occurred in a country on the African continent, during the month of June 2025 at [this link](https://nuforc.org/subndx/?id=x) when accessed by Metaculus on or after July 1, 2025.\n\n\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nAccording to U.S. government data, 757 Unidentified Aerial Phenomena (UAP) incidents were reported between May 2023 and June 2024, with 708 of these occurring in the air. One notable incident from January 2023 involved a U.S. Air Force F-16 fighter jet colliding with an unidentified object over Arizona, resulting in damage to the aircraft's canopy.\n\nToday is 2025-05-22.\n\nBefore answering you think:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n(e) You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
