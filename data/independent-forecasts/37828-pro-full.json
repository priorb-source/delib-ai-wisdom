  "information": "In May 2025, HR tech firm Rippling raised $450 million in a Series G funding round, which increased its valuation to $16.8 billion. As part of this event, the company also committed to a tender offer to repurchase up to $200 million in equity from current and former employees. Reports indicate Rippling has surpassed $100 million in annual recurring revenue and doubled it to over $350 million by the end of 2023. The company serves over 20,000 customers and the new funds are intended for enhancing its workforce management products and expanding global revenue.\n\nIn multiple interviews in May 2025, following the company's Series G funding round, Rippling CEO Parker Conrad stated that the company has \"no specific plans to go public\" and an IPO is \"not imminent.\" He emphasized that Rippling would need to be profitable before going public, stating, \"in order to be successful in the public markets, your growth rates have to come down so that you can be profitable.\" Conrad also mentioned that the company plans to conduct annual secondary liquidity programs, such as tender offers, for employees and investors.\n\nThe broader market for tech IPOs in May 2025 is described as thawing but selective. Several other fintech companies have recently been active in financing and potential public listings. Airwallex closed on $300 million, Chime has filed to go public, and Klarna filed an amended prospectus. In other company news, Rippling is involved in a high-profile legal battle with its rival Deel, involving accusations of corporate espionage. The company is also focused on operational growth, including international office expansion, such as a recent lease in Bengaluru.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Approximately 5 weeks. The question resolves on July 1, 2025.",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Rippling's CEO's recent statements hold true. The company uses its new Series G funding to focus on growth and product development, forgoing an IPO in the near term. The July 1, 2025 deadline passes without an S-1 filing or a formal announcement.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Despite the CEO's public statements, the company was secretly preparing for a rapid IPO. A sudden and exceptionally favorable shift in the market for HR tech stocks prompts the board to capitalize on the opportunity, leading to a surprise S-1 filing or announcement before July 1, 2025.",
    "rationale": "My forecast is based primarily on the recent and direct statements from Rippling's CEO, Parker Conrad. In May 2025, following a major funding round, he explicitly stated the company has 'no specific plans to go public' and that an IPO is 'not imminent.' Given the very short timeframe before the question's deadline of July 1, 2025, a complete reversal of this public stance is extremely unlikely. Such a reversal would require an S-1 filing or a formal announcement within approximately five weeks, which contradicts the CEO's messaging and could harm management's credibility.\n\nThree additional factors support a 'No' outcome. First, the company just raised $450 million in a Series G round, providing it with substantial capital and reducing the immediate need for an IPO to fund operations. Second, by committing to a tender offer and planning annual secondary liquidity programs, Rippling is addressing employee and investor desire for liquidity, a common driver for IPOs. Third, the CEO has set profitability as a precondition for going public, implying the company, which is focused on growth, has not yet met this milestone.\n\nMy probability is not lower than 2% because unforeseen events, such as a dramatic and sudden improvement in the public markets for HR tech, could cause a rapid change in strategy. The CEO's statements could also be a strategic misdirection, although this is a low-probability scenario.\n\nMy probability is not higher because the CEO's statements are very strong, recent, and specific evidence against a near-term IPO. To ignore them would be to bet against the most direct information available. I would increase my forecast if credible news outlets reported on an imminent filing or if key public company-focused executives were hired. I would decrease it further if the general tech IPO market worsened.",

These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question will resolve as **Yes** if Rippling, Inc., announces before July 1, 2025, that it is planning an initial public offering. In order to streamline the resolution of this question, there are two resolution sources for the IPO announcement: 1) The company filing an [SEC Form S-1](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/sec-form-s-1.asp) or 2) An announcement at the [news](https://www.rippling.com/blog) section of its website.

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
