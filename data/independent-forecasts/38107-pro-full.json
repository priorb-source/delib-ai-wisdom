  "information": "Former FBI Director James Comey is under investigation by the Department of Homeland Security and the Secret Service after posting a photo on Instagram showing seashells arranged to spell '86 47'. The number '86' can be slang for 'kill' or 'remove,' and Donald Trump is the 47th president. Following the post, Comey was interviewed by the Secret Service but was not arrested. He later deleted the post, stating, 'I didn't realize that some people associate these numbers with violence. I oppose all forms of violence, so I deleted the post.' Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem confirmed the investigation.\n\nSeveral public figures have called for legal action against James Comey. General Michael Flynn predicted that Comey will be indicted. The InfoWars platform cited alleged Department of Justice sources claiming Comey's indictment is 'imminent.' Fox News Legal Analyst Gregg Jarrett stated that Comey could be prosecuted for the post. Current FBI Director Chris Wray reported that the agency has faced a surge in threats against Donald Trump following Comey's post, requiring agents to be diverted from other cases.\n\nAs of late May 2025, no charges have been filed against James Comey, nor have any warrants or subpoenas been issued in relation to the social media post. Legal experts suggest a prosecution faces significant hurdles due to First Amendment protections and a 2023 Supreme Court ruling that requires prosecutors to prove a subjective intent to threaten. Historically, arresting former FBI directors or other ex-cabinet-level officials is extremely rare in the United States.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Approximately one month, until July 1, 2025.",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No. James Comey is not arrested.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "The investigation by the Secret Service and DHS continues past the July 1, 2025 deadline or is quietly closed. Prosecutors determine that Comey's social media post does not meet the high legal standard for a 'true threat,' particularly the requirement to prove subjective intent, and no arrest is made.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Intense political pressure leads the Department of Justice to swiftly secure an arrest warrant for James Comey in relation to the social media post, despite the significant First Amendment hurdles. Alternatively, Comey is arrested for an entirely separate and unforeseen reason before the deadline.",
    "rationale": "My forecast is heavily weighted towards the status quo, as arresting a former FBI director is an extremely rare event in US history. The legal bar for prosecuting Comey for the social media post is very high due to First Amendment protections and a 2023 Supreme Court ruling that requires proving subjective intent to threaten. Comey's public denial and the ambiguous nature of the post make this a difficult case for prosecutors. Furthermore, he has already been interviewed by the Secret Service and was not arrested, suggesting the evidence was not immediately compelling. The primary factor favoring a 'Yes' outcome is the intense political pressure and rhetoric from figures allied with the current administration. However, the timeframe of only one month is very short for such a complex and high-profile case to proceed from investigation to arrest. While an arrest on an unrelated charge is possible, it is a low-probability wildcard. Therefore, the combination of strong legal protections, historical precedent, and the short timeline makes an arrest highly unlikely. My probability is not lower than 4% because the confirmed investigation and intense political climate create a non-zero chance of a politically motivated arrest. I would increase my forecast if credible reports emerged of a grand jury being convened or a warrant being issued. I would decrease it if the DOJ or DHS officially announced the closure of the investigation.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill James Comey be arrested before July 1, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\n[Secret Service Is Asking Comey About a Photo of Seashells Spelling ‘86 47’](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/16/us/politics/secret-service-comey-social-media-trump.html)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if former FBI director James Comey is arrested before July 1, 2025, according to [credible sources](https://www.metaculus.com/faq/#definitions).\n\nIn order to streamline this question's resolution, please note that an arrest anywhere in the world, for any reason, will resolve this question as Yes. For purposes of this question, we define \"arrest\" using the definition [posted at Nolo](https://www.nolo.com/legal-encyclopedia/justifies-arrest-probable-cause.html): \"An arrest requires taking someone into custody, against that person's will, in order to prosecute or interrogate. It involves a physical application of force, or submission to an officer's show of force. In sum, the arrestee must not be free to leave. Whether the act by the police is termed an arrest under state law is not relevant. When deciding whether someone has been arrested, courts apply the 'reasonable man' standard. This means asking whether a reasonable person, in the shoes of the defendant, would have concluded that he or she was not free to leave.\"\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nFormer FBI Director James Comey is under investigation by the Department of Homeland Security and the Secret Service after posting a photo on Instagram showing seashells arranged to spell '86 47'.

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any).
