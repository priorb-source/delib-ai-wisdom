  "information": "Historical data shows that Senate exploratory committees often last three to six months before a formal campaign launch. Many candidates for the 2026 cycle in other states, such as Andy Barr in Kentucky and Haley Stevens in Michigan, announced their candidacies in April 2025. In his previous 2024 Senate run, Osborn formally announced his candidacy in July 2023, approximately 16 months before the election. A similar timeline for the 2026 race would place his announcement in June or July of 2025. Osborn himself has publicly stated that he will \"decide by early summer.\"",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Approximately 39 days (from April 23, 2025 to June 1, 2025)",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No - Dan Osborn has not announced his candidacy; he is currently only exploring a potential bid",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Osborn continues his exploratory phase through May and makes his announcement in June or July, consistent with his stated timeline of deciding by 'early summer' and his historical pattern of announcing in July for his 2024 race. This would mean he misses the June 1 deadline.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Osborn accelerates his decision-making timeline and formally announces his candidacy in late April or May 2025, possibly influenced by pressure to establish his campaign earlier than other candidates, fundraising considerations, or political circumstances requiring a quick decision.",
    "rationale": "The key consideration is the interpretation of Osborn's stated timeline of deciding by 'early summer' relative to the June 1 cutoff date. Summer solstice occurs around June 20-21, making June 1 technically still in late spring. 'Early summer' most naturally refers to June through early July, which would be AFTER the resolution date. Supporting evidence for a later announcement: (1) Osborn's 2024 race announcement came in July 2023, 16 months before the election - a similar timeline for 2026 would place his announcement in June-July 2025; (2) Exploratory committees typically last 3-6 months, and he only recently began exploring; (3) His own public statement about 'early summer' suggests June-July timing. Evidence for an earlier announcement: (1) Other 2026 Senate candidates like Andy Barr and Haley Stevens announced in April 2025, showing some candidates are moving quickly; (2) Approximately 38 days remain, giving him time to make a decision; (3) 'Early summer' is imprecise language that could potentially include late May. I'm not forecasting higher (45-55%) because the 'early summer' timeline and historical pattern strongly suggest June-July, and June 1 precedes the typical summer timeframe. I'm not forecasting lower (15-20%) because there's meaningful uncertainty in timeline interpretation, political circumstances could force acceleration, and some comparable candidates have already announced. To update higher, I would need to see: signals of imminent announcement, campaign infrastructure being built, or Osborn clarifying that he'll decide before June. To update lower, I would need explicit statements pushing his timeline to mid-summer or later.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill Dan Osborn announce his candidacy for US Senator from Nebraska before June 1, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nNebraska Examiner: [Nebraska’s Dan Osborn exploring midterm bid against U.S. Sen Pete Ricketts](https://nebraskaexaminer.com/2025/04/03/nebraskas-dan-osborn-exploring-midterm-bid-against-u-s-sen-pete-ricketts/)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if Dan Osborn announces his candidacy for US Senator from Nebraska before June 1, 2025.

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
