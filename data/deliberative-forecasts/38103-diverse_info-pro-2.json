    "review": "My initial forecast was far too high, as it failed to consider a key vulnerability identified by Forecaster 3. Forecaster 2 provided compelling new evidence about Tesla's declining market share and negative public sentiment, which strengthens the argument that the core policy of exclusion is highly unlikely to be reversed. This evidence, on its own, would have pushed my forecast even higher. However, Forecaster 3's analysis of the resolution criteria was a game-changer. They correctly pointed out that the resolution hinges on the *explicit mention* of Tesla on the webpage. A simple wording change to brand-neutral language (e.g., excluding 'U.S-made chargers') would cause the question to resolve as No, even if the policy's effect on Tesla remains unchanged. This introduces a significant path to a 'No' outcome that I had completely overlooked, and I find their reasoning highly convincing.",
    "rationale": "I am significantly updating my forecast downwards from 97% to 78%. My initial analysis focused only on the high inertia of the politically-motivated trade policy, making a reversal seem nearly impossible in the short, one-month timeframe. The evidence provided by Forecaster 2 reinforces this conclusion; with Tesla's market position weakening in Canada, the political pressure to reverse the policy is likely decreasing, not increasing. However, Forecaster 3's insight into the specific resolution criteria forces a major reassessment. The risk is not just a policy reversal, but a communications update. It is a plausible scenario that BC Hydro's legal or communications team could revise the webpage to use more generic, legally defensible language that avoids singling out a specific company, while keeping the exclusionary policy in place. Such a change would cause a 'No' resolution. I estimate the probability of such a wording change before July 1st to be approximately 20%. Combining this with a very low (roughly 2%) probability of an actual policy reversal, the total probability of a 'No' outcome rises to about 22%. Therefore, the probability of the explicit exclusion remaining on the page ('Yes' outcome) is now 78%.",
