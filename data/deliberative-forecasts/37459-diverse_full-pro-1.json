    "review": "The other two forecasters provided compelling arguments that I had not fully weighted. Forecaster 2 correctly identified that the major market selloff, which would have created the most attractive buying opportunity, occurred in April, after the Q1 reporting period ended. This weakens the 'fat pitch' rationale for a Q1 purchase. Forecaster 3 introduced a crucial procedural point: Berkshire would likely request confidential treatment from the SEC if it were building a new, large position, meaning the purchase would not appear on the public Q1 13F. Since the question resolves based on the public filing, this introduces a significant structural barrier to a 'Yes' outcome. Both arguments are highly persuasive and highlight weaknesses in my initial analysis.",
    "rationale": "After reviewing the other analyses, I am lowering my forecast. My initial 15% probability was based on the possibility that a market dip in Q1 would be a sufficient catalyst for Berkshire to deploy its massive cash hoard, likely via its investment managers. However, the other forecasters have convinced me this was unlikely for two main reasons. First, the most significant market downturn occurred in early Q2, not Q1, making a major opportunistic buy during the relevant period less probable. Second, as Forecaster 3 noted, a new, sizable position would almost certainly be filed confidentially to avoid front-running, which would lead to a 'No' resolution for this question. This procedural detail significantly narrows the path to a 'Yes' outcome, which would now likely require a smaller, non-market-moving starter position that Berkshire chose not to make confidential. Given these stronger arguments for 'No', I am reducing my forecast from 15% to 7%.",
