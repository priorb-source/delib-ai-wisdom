    "review": "Both forecasters make compelling arguments that I underweighted in my initial analysis. Forecaster 3's evidence of ongoing operations is particularly valuable - the February 2025 Max camera upgrade, May 2025 Hero13 launch, and renewed Freeride World Tour sponsorship are concrete indicators that GoPro is functioning normally, not in emergency mode. Forecaster 2's emphasis on the extremely low base rate for bankruptcy filings in any 2-month period is a crucial outside view consideration. Most importantly, Forecaster 3's point about the convertible note maturing in November 2025 - AFTER the July 1 deadline - is significant. Companies don't typically file preemptively months before debt maturity unless facing acute crisis, and there's no evidence of such acute crisis (no covenant violations, credit downgrades, restructuring advisors, or supplier payment issues mentioned). Both forecasters correctly emphasize that 53 days is an extremely short window for such a dramatic corporate action.",
    "rationale": "Upon reflection, my initial 20% forecast overweighted the severity of financial distress while underweighting three critical factors: (1) the extremely low base rate for bankruptcy in a 2-month window, even among distressed companies; (2) the very short 53-day timeframe, which makes dramatic corporate action less likely; and (3) concrete evidence of normal ongoing operations. The financial situation remains dire with the catastrophic loss margin, 0.5 current ratio, and penny stock status. However, bankruptcy is typically preceded by clear warning signs - covenant violations, restructuring advisor hiring, credit facility withdrawals, supplier payment failures - none of which are present. The Q1 results on May 12 could reveal problems, but even if negative, translating that into a bankruptcy filing by July 1 requires an extremely rapid deterioration. I'm updating downward to 9%, which acknowledges the low base rate and short timeframe while still accounting for genuine financial distress, information uncertainty about exact cash position and covenant compliance, and the possibility of unexpected acute developments revealed in the imminent Q1 report.",
