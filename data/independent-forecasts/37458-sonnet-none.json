    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Approximately 38 days - 5 days until the resolution window opens on May 12, 2025, then 33 additional days until June 15, 2025 when the question closes",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No mutually acknowledged phone call. The background information indicates Trump claims to have talked with Xi about tariffs, but China has denied talks are taking place. This discrepancy suggests the status quo is no verified, mutually acknowledged communication.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Trump and Xi do not speak on the phone during the May 12-June 15 window, or they speak but one or both governments fail to publicly acknowledge the conversation occurred. Given current US-China tensions and China's denial of recent talks, diplomatic channels remain frozen or communications occur through backchannel means that aren't publicly confirmed by both sides.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "As tariff tensions escalate or require urgent resolution, both leaders agree to a phone call between May 12-June 15. The call takes place and both the White House and Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs issue statements or confirmations acknowledging that Trump and Xi spoke by phone. This could be motivated by trade negotiations, crisis management, or diplomatic necessity.",
    "rationale": "The status quo strongly suggests no mutually acknowledged call is imminent. The background reveals China is actively denying that talks with Trump are occurring, which is a significant signal of diplomatic distance. The requirement that BOTH sides must acknowledge the call creates substantial friction - even if a call occurs, political considerations might prevent one side from confirming it publicly. The 34-day window (May 12-June 15) provides a reasonable timeframe, but high-level diplomatic calls typically require advance preparation and coordination. Factors supporting a higher probability include: Trump's history of direct leader-to-leader communication, the pressing nature of tariff issues that might necessitate dialogue, and precedent from Trump's first term when he and Xi spoke multiple times. Factors supporting a lower probability include: China's current denial of talks, elevated US-China tensions, the high bar of requiring public acknowledgment from both sides, and the short timeframe which may not allow for diplomatic protocol completion. For me to revise upward, I would need evidence of: diplomatic preparation activities, softening rhetoric from either side, or reports of backchannel negotiations advancing. To revise downward, I would need: escalating tensions, explicit Chinese statements ruling out near-term leadership communication, or major diplomatic incidents. Given the strong status quo signal of denial and the requirement for mutual acknowledgment, but balanced against the reasonable possibility over 34 days and potential trade imperatives, I assess this at 40%.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill Donald Trump and Xi Jinping speak on the phone with each other before June 15, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nCBS News: [Trump says he's talked with Xi about tariffs. China has denied talks are taking place](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/trump-xi-china-tariffs/)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if, after May 12, 2025 and before June 15, 2025, Donald Trump and Xi Jinping speak on the phone with each other, according to [credible sources](https://www.metaculus.com/faq/#definitions).\n\nBoth sides must acknowledge the phone call took place for it to count. \"Speak on the phone with each other\" is defined as both individuals, from different physical spaces, orally uttering words intended for the other individual into a telephone or equivalent device, those words being converted into electrical or digital signals in real time, and then transferred to the other individual via telecommunications links, where they are reconverted into sound waves at the other individual's listening device.\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nNo additional information available.\n\nToday is 2025-05-07.\n\nBefore answering you think:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n(e) You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
