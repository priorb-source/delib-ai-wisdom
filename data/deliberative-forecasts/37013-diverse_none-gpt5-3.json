    "review": "Forecaster 2’s framing is largely sound: they correctly note the 2021 baseline (Conservatives 47, Lib Dems ~13) and the sizable Independent presence as a complicating factor. However, their 25% seems to underweight two key points: (1) the Conservatives’ wipeout in Cornwall at the 2024 general election (0/6 MPs), which is a strong signal of vulnerability in rural divisions where Lib Dems are best placed; and (2) that being the largest party only requires a plurality amid fragmentation, plausibly in the high-20s/low-30s seats. Forecaster 3’s analysis contains major factual errors: the Liberal Democrats were not the largest party in 2021 (the Conservatives were), and Independents did not hold 32 seats (they were in the mid-teens). These errors substantially undermine their 70% assessment. Overall, F2’s caution is useful but seems too low; F3’s confidence rests on incorrect premises.",
    "rationale": "Time left is short (~10 days). Baseline from 2021 is a Conservative majority and Lib Dem third, but the 2024 general saw Conservatives lose every Cornwall seat, with Lib Dems and Labour dividing the county. That, plus Lib Dem rural strength and fragmentation (Independents, MK, Greens, Labour) lowers the bar for the Lib Dems to finish first. Countervailing risks: Independents can siphon anti-Conservative votes in many divisions; Labour may consolidate town seats; and first-year local elections under a new Labour government could give Conservatives some relative bounce versus 2024. There’s no fresh local polling or slate-quality data in this discussion to shift materially. Forecaster 2’s arguments were already in my base; Forecaster 3’s are factually flawed. Net, I maintain a slight Lib Dem edge due to the Conservatives’ severe local vulnerability and the Lib Dems’ structural positioning in rural divisions, with high uncertainty from Independents and Labour. I keep my forecast unchanged.",
