  "information": "The process for triggering a referendum requires a successful citizen petition. The petition must gather at least 177,000 signatures, which then must be officially verified by Elections Alberta before the government can formally schedule a vote. As of early May 2025, a group named 'Project for Alberta Prosperity' announced its intention to organize a signature collection campaign. Its president claimed they had already exceeded the required signature threshold, while other unverified reports mentioned 80,000 signatures being collected in 36 hours. However, no petition had been formally submitted or certified by Elections Alberta.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "About 55 days (until July 1, 2025)",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "The citizen-initiative petition is not submitted or verified by Elections Alberta before July 1, or it is found insufficient. Without verified signatures, the government declines to act, or it opts to keep the issue at the consultation/advocacy stage. No Order in Council is issued and no referendum date is announced before July 1.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "The Alberta cabinet (Lieutenant Governor in Council) announces a referendum date—possibly months away—before July 1, either in response to a validated petition or unilaterally for political reasons. Even if Ottawa objects, a provincial announcement suffices for this market’s criteria.",
    "rationale": "Baseline: As of May 7, no referendum has been scheduled. The research assistant reports that a citizen petition must meet a signature threshold (stated as ~177,000), then be verified by Elections Alberta before the government can formally schedule a vote. A group claims rapid progress (80,000 in 36 hours; even claims of surpassing the threshold), but no petition has been formally submitted or certified.\n\nTiming and process headwinds: Verification by Elections Alberta typically takes weeks to months, not days. With ~55 days left, a path that relies on petition verification is unlikely to conclude before July 1—even if signatures are gathered quickly—because (a) formal submission has reportedly not occurred, and (b) administrative verification windows are usually lengthy. Even after verification, cabinet must still choose to schedule a vote.\n\nPolitical incentives: The Alberta government can, in theory, schedule a referendum without a petition. However, calling an independence referendum would be a major, risky escalation. Polling historically shows support for outright independence well below a likely-win threshold, making it improbable the government would set a date imminently. Premier Smith has emphasized “sovereignty within a united Canada” more than secession; a sudden pivot to scheduling an independence referendum before July 1 would be surprising absent a galvanizing event.\n\nWhy not higher: Short timeline; bureaucratic verification likely exceeds the window; no official submission or certification; significant political downside to announcing a date now.\n\nWhy not lower: Tail risks exist. If the petition is rapidly submitted and Elections Alberta expedites verification unusually quickly, cabinet could ride the momentum and announce a future date before July 1. Alternatively, the government could, for strategic reasons, announce a date without waiting for verification.\n\nWhat would move me up: (1) Confirmation that the petition was officially submitted; (2) Elections Alberta publicly committing to an expedited verification timeline (e.g., within weeks); (3) Credible reporting that cabinet is considering or drafting an Order in Council to call a referendum; (4) Strong public signals from the Premier or UCP caucus endorsing an independence vote timeline.\n\nWhat would move me down: (1) No petition submission by mid-May; (2) Elections Alberta indicating a lengthy (e.g., 60–90 day) verification; (3) The Premier explicitly ruling out scheduling an independence referendum in 2025; (4) Fundraising/organizational setbacks for the petition campaign.\n\nGiven today’s facts and the status-quo bias (world changes slowly), the base case is no date announced before July 1.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nBefore July 1, 2025, will the government of Alberta officially announce a date for an independence referendum?\n\nQuestion background:\nPolitico: [The quiet threat to Canadian unity isn’t Quebec — it’s Alberta](https://www.politico.com/news/2025/04/27/the-quiet-threat-to-canadian-unity-isnt-quebec-its-alberta-00311719)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if, before July 1, 2025, a referendum on the independence of Alberta from Canada is officially scheduled. If this does not occur before that date, this question resolves as **No**.\n\nFor purposes of this question, the referendum will be considered \"officially scheduled\" when it is announced by a person or entity with the authority to do so within Alberta. Please note that broader legality, such as within Canada, will be considered irrelevant for this question, so if the federal government declared the referendum illegal, the question would still resolve as Yes.\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nThe process for triggering a referendum requires a successful citizen petition.

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
