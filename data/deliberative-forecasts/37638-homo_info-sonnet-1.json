    "review": "Both forecasters raised critical information I had not considered. Most significantly, Forecaster 2 provided concrete evidence that the House committee adopted a SUBSTITUTE version of SB 3 that explicitly does NOT ban THC, instead creating a regulatory framework. This is far more telling than mere inaction - the House actively rejected the ban approach when given the opportunity. Additionally, the House's 118-16 vote to expand medical cannabis access demonstrates overwhelming support for the opposite policy direction. Forecaster 3's point about Governor Abbott not prioritizing a ban is crucial, as only the Governor can call a special session and set its agenda - Lt. Gov. Patrick's enthusiasm alone is insufficient. The extremely tight timeline (12 days remaining) combined with these political realities makes passage highly unlikely. The public opinion data (62% support legalization, 79% support medical marijuana) and $8 billion hemp industry opposition create additional insurmountable barriers. My original 45% forecast significantly overweighted Senate passage and underestimated House opposition and the Governor's lack of engagement.",
    "rationale": "I am updating my forecast substantially downward from 45% to 10%. The House committee's substitution of SB 3 with a non-ban regulatory framework is decisive evidence that the House will not pass a full THC ban. This isn't speculation about what might happen - it's what already happened when the bill reached the House. Combined with the 118-16 vote for cannabis expansion, the Governor's lack of prioritization, extreme time constraints, and strong economic and public opposition, the path to enactment has essentially closed. I'm not going lower than 10% only because political outcomes occasionally defy structural expectations, unexpected last-minute deals can emerge, and we may lack complete information about private negotiations. However, the weight of evidence strongly indicates this will resolve as No. I would need to see Governor Abbott suddenly prioritize this issue or dramatic House leadership reversals to update higher.",
