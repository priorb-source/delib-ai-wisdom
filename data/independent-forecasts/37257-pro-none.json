    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Approximately 2 months (resolves July 1, 2025).",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No. The government of Republika Srpska, led by Milorad Dodik, will continue its long-standing pattern of using secessionist threats for political leverage but will not take the concrete step of officially announcing a referendum date.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Despite heightened rhetoric, the leadership of Republika Srpska is ultimately deterred by the credible threat of crippling economic sanctions from the US and EU, as well as a lack of concrete support from neighboring Serbia. The threat remains a tool for domestic political consumption and negotiation with Sarajevo and the international community, and the July 1, 2025 deadline passes without an official announcement.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "A new, severe political crisis erupts, possibly triggered by a decision from the High Representative or the Bosnian state court that Dodik perceives as an existential threat to RS's autonomy. Feeling cornered and potentially encouraged by Russia, Dodik makes a high-stakes gamble to force the issue, officially announcing a referendum date to consolidate his power and rally his nationalist base.",
    "rationale": "My forecast is heavily weighted by the strong historical precedent. For over a decade, Milorad Dodik has repeatedly threatened an independence referendum without ever following through. This serves as a powerful political tool to mobilize his base, extract concessions, and challenge the authority of the central government, all without incurring the catastrophic costs of actual secession. The status quo of perpetual crisis has proven politically beneficial for him.\n\nThe disincentives for officially scheduling a referendum are immense. It would trigger severe, likely crippling, economic and political sanctions from the United States and the European Union, isolating Republika Srpska. Furthermore, Serbia, RS's key ally, is unlikely to support such a move as it would torpedo its own EU accession goals and destabilize the region. The short timeframe of under two months also makes a sudden, decisive move of this magnitude less probable without a major, unforeseen catalyst.\n\nMy forecast is not lower than 10% because Dodik is a volatile political actor, and the possibility of a severe miscalculation or a desperate gambit in response to mounting legal and political pressure cannot be entirely dismissed. A significant escalation in the broader geopolitical environment, such as a direct instruction from Moscow, could also precipitate such an announcement.\n\nMy forecast is not higher because the costs of this action appear to far outweigh the benefits for the RS leadership. The current strategy of brinkmanship achieves many of Dodik's political goals without the severe consequences that announcing a referendum date would entail. I would update my forecast higher if a major, unprecedented crisis unfolded (e.g., the High Representative attempting to remove Dodik from office) or if Serbia explicitly endorsed the move. Conversely, I would update lower as the deadline approaches with no significant political escalation.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nBefore July 1, 2025, will the government of Republika Srpska officially announce a date for an independence referendum?\n\nQuestion background:\nFair Observer: [Balkan Tinderbox: How Russia’s Moves Could Reignite Bosnia](https://www.fairobserver.com/politics/balkan-tinderbox-how-russias-moves-could-reignite-bosnia/)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if, before July 1, 2025, a referendum on the independence of Republika Srpska from Bosnia and Herzegovina is officially scheduled. If this does not occur before that date, this question resolves as **No**.\n\nFor purposes of this question, the referendum will be considered \"officially scheduled\" when it is announced by a person or entity with the authority to do so within Republika Srpska. Please note that broader legality, such as within Bosnia and Herzegovina, will be considered irrelevant for this question, so if the Bosnian government declared the referendum illegal, the question would still resolve as Yes.\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nNo additional information available.\n\nToday is 2025-05-02.\n\nBefore answering you think:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n(e) You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
