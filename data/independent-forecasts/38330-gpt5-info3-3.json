  "information": "The term 'reverse' is used in various financial contexts. A New York Fed statement on June 3, 2025, noted that its System Open Market Account (SOMA) net income could be impacted by interest expenses on 'reverse repurchase agreements.' On June 3, 2025, the Mexican government announced it had saved 12 billion pesos in the purchase of medicines through a 'reverse auction mechanism.' Additionally, the company Worldline launched a cash tender offer for its bonds on June 4, 2025, using a 'reverse book-building procedure.'",

    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "About 26 days (until July 1, 2025)",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Through June 10–30, 2025, the NYT covers Chinese consumption trends and finance using other terms—e.g., “reverse shopping,” “repurchase/buybacks,” or “reverse repurchase (repo)”—and never prints the exact strings “reverse purchasing” or “reverse purchase.”",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "A NYT China/Business desk piece, newsletter, or column (e.g., on Chinese consumer trends) explicitly cites the People’s Daily translation and uses the exact phrase “reverse purchasing,” or a business/real estate item happens to use the exact wording “reverse purchase” (e.g., an unusual phrasing like “reverse purchase mortgage”) during June 10–30, 2025.",
    "rationale": "The window is short (21 days of eligible publication) and the trigger is very specific: the NYT must use the exact phrase “reverse purchasing” or “reverse purchase.” Historically, NYT style favors established English terms—“reverse repurchase (agreements)” in finance, “reverse auction,” “reverse book-building,” “buyback/repurchase,” or a more natural consumer phrasing like “reverse shopping.” The People’s Daily coinage could be covered, but NYT is more likely to render it as “reverse shopping/consumption” rather than the somewhat awkward “reverse purchasing.” The research assistant’s items (NY Fed reverse repos, Mexico’s reverse auction, Worldline’s reverse book-building) illustrate that related “reverse X” terms are in the news, but none match the two exact phrases that count for resolution. That keeps the base rate low. Why not higher: The requirement for an exact string in a narrow time window sharply limits hits; editorial style and existing preferred terminology make the precise phrasing unlikely. Why not lower: There is a plausible path via a China trend piece (e.g., Li Yuan or business coverage) that quotes or translates People’s Daily and reproduces “reverse purchasing,” or an idiosyncratic usage of “reverse purchase” appears in business/real estate copy. What would move me up: Early signals that English-language outlets (AP/Reuters/Bloomberg/FT) adopt “reverse purchasing” as the translation; a visible NYT newsletter teaser or reporter thread referencing the term; broader Anglophone social media discussion using that exact phrase. What would move me down: Continued absence of the phrase in major English outlets through mid-June; NYT coverage of the trend using alternative wording; confirmation that NYT style guidance avoids that translation.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill the New York Times mention \"reverse purchasing\" before July 1, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nPeople's Daily: [“Reverse purchasing” reflects the vitality of the Chinese market](http://finance.people.com.cn/n1/2025/0430/c1004-40471159.html)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if the NY Times mentions \"reverse purchasing\" in any of its content items as found through [this search](https://www.nytimes.com/search?dropmab=false&lang=en&query=%22reverse%20purchasing%22&sort=best), dated after June 9, 2025 and before July 1, 2025. This question will also count \"reverse purchase,\" which can be found through [this link](https://www.nytimes.com/search?dropmab=false&lang=en&query=%22reverse%20purchase%22&sort=best).\n\n\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nThe term 'reverse' is used in various financial contexts.

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
