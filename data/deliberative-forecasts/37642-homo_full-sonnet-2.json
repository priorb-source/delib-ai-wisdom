    "review": "Both forecasters arrived independently at 20% using essentially identical reasoning to mine. They identified the same key factors: Fed's explicit 'not in a hurry' messaging, major financial institutions pushing forecasts to July or later (Goldman to December, BoA and Morgan Stanley to July), inflation at 2.7% above target, strong labor market data with 4.2% unemployment, market pricing showing low June probability, and approximately 1-2 FOMC meetings remaining before July 1. Neither forecaster raised new evidence or arguments I hadn't already considered. The convergence of all three analyses in the 18-20% range is reassuring and suggests we're appropriately weighing the same factors. The status quo strongly favors no cut, but we all maintain non-trivial probability for unexpected developments or the June FOMC meeting.",
    "rationale": "Upon review, I find my initial analysis well-supported by the other forecasters' reasoning. No new information was presented that would warrant a significant update. The consensus clustering around 18-20% reflects appropriate consideration of: (1) Strong status quo bias from explicit Fed communication and institutional forecasts pointing to July or later, (2) Economic conditions (inflation above target, strong labor market) not supporting urgency, (3) One remaining FOMC meeting before deadline providing technical opportunity, (4) Small but non-zero probability of unforeseen economic shocks. The fact that both other forecasters independently arrived at exactly 20% while I was at 18% suggests there may be slight wisdom of crowds benefit, but the 2 percentage point difference is marginal given forecast uncertainty. I'm making a minor upward adjustment to 19% to acknowledge this convergence, but not a dramatic change since the core reasoning and evidence base remains identical. The 18-20% range appropriately captures the low but non-zero probability that the Fed announces a cut before July 1, 2025.",
