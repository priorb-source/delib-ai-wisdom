    "review": "Both forecasters largely mirror my initial take: the key regulatory hurdle appears cleared (license on Apr 14, 2025), the remaining window (~55 days) is within Starlink’s common 1–3 month post-license activation cadence, and typical residual risks (type approval, e-commerce, import/logistics, internal prioritization) could still push beyond July 1. They add examples (Zimbabwe, Botswana, Zambia) and note laser backhaul reduces the need for local gateways—points consistent with my assumptions. No new contrary evidence surfaced (e.g., conditional licensing, explicit LCA/type-approval delays), and no concrete signal of imminent availability either. Overall, their arguments reinforce a modestly-above-even stance rather than shifting it.",
    "rationale": "Time remaining is adequate for a fast-follow launch but not generous. The historical base rate for Starlink to flip to “Available” within 1–3 months post-approval supports slightly >50%. Lesotho’s small size and technical feasibility (ISL coverage) help, and an end-of-Q2 push is plausible. Offsetting that are administrative and operational steps (type approval, payments/tax, checkout enablement, local distribution) that have, in some African markets, stretched beyond two months. With no fresh signals of acceleration or delay, I keep my prior balance of factors. I would move up on any Starlink/X announcement, LCA type-approval confirmation, or checkout/pricing pages going live; down on indications of conditional licensing, import/type-approval holdups, or a map roadmap pushing Lesotho to H2. No change to the point estimate.",
