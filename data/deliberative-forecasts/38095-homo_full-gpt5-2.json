    "review": "Both forecasters largely align with my initial view that the threshold (>2) is very low given an active clemency pipeline. New/useful nuances they raised: (1) the public-disclosure requirement likely isn’t a binding risk because this White House has consistently publicized clemencies; (2) month-to-month lumpiness is the main downside, with a plausible July 4–themed batch risk; (3) a potential Juneteenth-themed tranche is an upside catalyst I hadn’t explicitly considered. I find their reasoning convincing and consistent with observed behavior and institutional setup this term. The main disagreement is just calibration around the month-specific timing risk; I still assign nontrivial probability to a June lull followed by early July actions, but the added point about regular publicity and possible June hooks nudges me slightly higher.",
    "rationale": "- Base case: The administration has demonstrated both appetite and capacity for frequent clemency, including a late-May spree and dedicated personnel. Clearing >2 in June requires only a minimal continuation of normal operations or a small themed tranche. Blanket actions, if used, would instantly satisfy the criterion.\n- Downside scenarios (No): a deliberate pause to bunch for a July 4 package; a short-term internal process slowdown; or an unexpected crisis that delays announcements. Of these, the July 4 clustering risk is the most material, but even then, a complete June freeze is less likely given the recent cadence and signaling of “more to come.” The public-disclosure requirement appears low risk given past practice.\n- Upside catalysts (Yes): incremental drip announcements, a Juneteenth angle, or follow-ons from the late-May pipeline.\nGiven the low threshold and strong institutional momentum, I edge my forecast up slightly to reflect the low disclosure risk and plausible June hooks while retaining some caution for a July 4 bunching scenario.",
