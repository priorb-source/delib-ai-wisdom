    "review": "My initial forecast was critically flawed. I assumed the meeting was scheduled for June 12, 2025, and only analyzed the probability of its successful completion. Forecaster 3 appears to have made a similar assumption. Forecaster 2 provided the most crucial piece of analysis: the lack of any official confirmation of this date. With only 16 days remaining, the absence of a definitive proxy statement (DEF 14A filing), which is the standard way companies announce annual meetings, is extremely strong evidence that the meeting is not, in fact, scheduled for June 12. This single point, which I completely missed, is the dominant factor in this forecast. Forecaster 2’s reasoning is therefore highly convincing and fundamentally reframes the problem from one of execution risk to one of scheduling fact.",
    "rationale": "I am drastically updating my forecast downwards from 95% to 19%. My initial reasoning was predicated on a false premise. The probability of the 'Yes' outcome is a product of two distinct probabilities: P1, the probability that the meeting is actually scheduled for June 12, and P2, the probability that the meeting, if scheduled, completes successfully.\n\nMy initial forecast of 95% was really an estimate of P2. I stand by that reasoning: having failed in 2024, GameStop and its vendors would be under immense pressure to ensure technical success, making a repeat failure unlikely. Forecaster 3’s analysis supports this view.\n\nHowever, Forecaster 2 correctly points out that P1 is very low. Public companies are required to file definitive proxy materials with the SEC to announce their annual meeting, typically 30-60 days in advance. That no such filing exists by May 27 for a June 12 meeting is a powerful signal that June 12 is not the correct date. While the date is plausible due to its proximity to last year's meeting, the lack of official documentation is far more significant evidence. I estimate the probability that June 12 happens to be the correct date, despite the unusually late announcement, to be around 20%. \n\nTherefore, my updated forecast is the product of these two probabilities: P(Yes) = P1(Date is June 12) * P2(Completes | Date is June 12) = 0.20 * 0.95 = 0.19.",
