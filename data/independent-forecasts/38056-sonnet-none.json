    "status_quo_outcome": "No - the fight not taking place as specified at UFC 316, either because it was never scheduled, was cancelled, or Walker fought someone else",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "The fight between Walker and Murzakanov is not scheduled for UFC 316, gets cancelled due to injury, or Walker is matched against a different opponent. Alternatively, the fight happens but Murzakanov wins by decision, submission, or knockout.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Walker and Murzakanov are confirmed to fight at UFC 316, both fighters make weight and avoid injury, the fight proceeds as scheduled, and Walker wins by decision, submission, or knockout.",
    "rationale": "This forecast requires careful consideration of multiple conditional probabilities. The research assistant found no additional information, which is concerning for a question about a specific matchup. While there's a UFC Stats reference with a fight ID suggesting some official connection, the lack of confirmatory information about this fight being scheduled for UFC 316 is a red flag. For a Yes outcome, several things must occur: (1) The fight must be officially scheduled for UFC 316 (uncertain - perhaps 50-60% likely given the stats page reference but lack of confirmation), (2) Both fighters must make it to fight night without withdrawing (~85-90% typical for UFC fights once scheduled), (3) Walker must win the fight. Without current information on fighter rankings, recent performance, fighting styles, or odds, and given both are light heavyweight competitors with varied UFC records, I'd estimate roughly even chances or slightly favoring one fighter if the bout occurs. The resolution criteria specifically state this resolves as No if Walker doesn't fight at UFC 316 or fights someone else, making the default outcome No unless all conditions align. Combining these factors: ~0.55 (scheduled for UFC 316) × ~0.87 (fight happens) × ~0.50 (Walker wins) ≈ 24%. My forecast would be higher if there were confirmation the fight is officially booked for UFC 316, or if Walker had clear advantages in the matchup. It would be lower if there were reports of injuries, scheduling conflicts, or if Murzakanov had significant competitive advantages.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill Johnny Walker defeat Azamat Murzakanov at UFC 316?\n\nQuestion background:\nPlease see [UFC Stats](http://ufcstats.com/fight-details/dab807a99d295832) for statistical details of the two opponents.\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if Johnny Walker defeats Azamat Murzakanov at [UFC 316](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UFC_316).\n\nIf Walker does not fight anyone at UFC 316 or fights someone else, this resolves as No.\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nNo additional information available.\n\nToday is 2025-05-26.\n\nBefore answering you think:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n(e) You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
