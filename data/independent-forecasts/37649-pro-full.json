  "information": "On March 13, 2025, the government of Chad officially granted Starlink an operating license. The stated goal is to enhance internet connectivity, particularly in remote areas where the existing 6,000 km of fiber optic infrastructure is insufficient, and to support educational and healthcare institutions. Government officials have stated that negotiations were conducted to ensure affordable pricing for the service.\n\nThe time between Starlink receiving a license and its service becoming 'Available' on its map varies in other African nations. For the Democratic Republic of Congo, the process took approximately 10 weeks in 2025. For Malawi and Zambia, it was about 16 weeks, and for Benin, it was 24 weeks. Niger's service was officially launched on March 13, 2025, the same day Chad's license was announced. In May 2025, a pan-African partnership between SpaceX and Airtel was announced to potentially accelerate kit distribution.\n\nStarlink's expansion faces both technical advantages and logistical challenges. The use of optical inter-satellite links reduces the need for local ground stations in every country. However, high demand has led to service pauses and waiting lists in other regions, including some African countries like Nigeria and Kenya. For Chad specifically, potential obstacles include its landlocked geography, limited retail infrastructure, and the need to finalize details such as import rules and spectrum fees.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Approximately 6.5 weeks, as the question resolves on July 1, 2025.",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No. The Starlink map currently shows Chad as a future service area, not as 'Available'. If this status does not change by the deadline, the question resolves to No.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Logistical challenges related to Chad's landlocked geography, coupled with minor bureaucratic delays in finalizing import rules and spectrum fees, push the service activation date just past the July 1, 2025 deadline.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Following the official license grant on March 13, 2025, SpaceX prioritizes the region, and the final regulatory and logistical steps are completed swiftly, potentially aided by the new pan-African partnership with Airtel. The service status for Chad is updated to 'Available' on the Starlink map sometime in June 2025.",
    "rationale": "My forecast is based primarily on the timeline from license approval to the resolution date, benchmarked against similar rollouts in other African nations. The total time available for Chad, from its license grant on March 13, 2025, to the July 1, 2025 deadline, is approximately 15.5 weeks. This is a very tight but plausible timeframe when compared to precedents: it is longer than the Democratic Republic of Congo's rollout (~10 weeks) but slightly shorter than Malawi and Zambia's (~16 weeks), and significantly shorter than Benin's (~24 weeks). This places the outcome on a knife's edge based on historical data.\n\nThe probability is not higher than 60% due to significant, tangible risks. Chad is a landlocked country, which presents inherent logistical difficulties for importing and distributing hardware. Furthermore, the need to finalize details like import rules and spectrum fees represents a potential source of bureaucratic delay that could easily consume the little buffer in the timeline. Finally, high global demand for Starlink services has caused delays and waitlists in other countries, and any such constraints could impact the Chad launch.\n\nThe probability is not lower than 60% because of several strong positive indicators. The primary hurdle, official government licensing, has been cleared. The concurrent launch in neighboring Niger on the very day Chad's license was announced suggests a coordinated regional push and an existing operational capacity by SpaceX that could accelerate Chad's activation. The recent partnership with Airtel may also serve to mitigate some of the on-the-ground distribution and logistics challenges.\n\nI would increase my forecast probability upon seeing reports of Starlink hardware arriving in Chad or an official launch date announcement from either SpaceX or the Chadian government. Conversely, I would decrease the probability if reports emerge of specific delays in regulatory negotiations or of Starlink deprioritizing new activations due to hardware shortages.",

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
