    "review": "Both forecasters present essentially the same strong reasoning I initially considered, but they weight the evidence slightly more heavily toward the base rate pattern. Their arguments are sound and well-supported. They correctly emphasize that: (1) the pattern of false alarms (2016, 2020, 2022) is remarkably clear and consistent, (2) the 20-day timeframe is genuinely extraordinary for such a major political transition in Russia's system, (3) Putin's 'full understanding and support' sounds like encouragement to continue rather than acceptance of resignation, and (4) Kadyrov's May 12 walkback is significant. Forecaster 3's framing of these statements as potential 'loyalty displays to Putin' is insightful. Their forecasts of 7-8% reflect greater confidence in the base rate continuing. However, I believe there's slightly more residual uncertainty than 7-8% would suggest, primarily due to the specific nature of the health reports (pancreatic necrosis and kidney problems being more concrete than vague ailments) and the more substantive succession planning this time. While sudden incapacitation remains possible, their emphasis on how rushed a 20-day transition would be for Russia's political machinery is compelling and well-taken.",
    "rationale": "After deliberation, I'm updating my forecast downward from 12% to 10%. The other forecasters make a strong case that the base rate pattern is extremely powerful here - three previous instances of similar statements, all resulting in continued service, combined with Putin's supportive response and Kadyrov's own walkback by May 12, heavily indicate this is another instance of political theater. The 20-day constraint is genuinely binding for Russia's typically deliberate political processes, especially for such a strategically important region during wartime. However, I'm maintaining slightly higher probability than their 7-8% range because: (1) the health reports appear more specific and credible than in previous episodes, (2) the succession planning with family promotions is more concrete, and (3) true medical incapacitation could force rapid action despite normal political timelines. The 10% forecast acknowledges the overwhelming likelihood of status quo while preserving appropriate uncertainty around health-driven scenarios.",
