  "information": "China's Consumer Price Index (CPI) has registered three consecutive months of year-on-year deflation: -0.7% in February, -0.1% in March, and -0.1% in April 2025. The Producer Price Index (PPI), a measure of factory-gate prices, has also shown sustained deflationary pressure, declining for 31 consecutive months. In April, the PPI fell by 2.7% year-on-year, the largest decline in six months. Core CPI, which excludes food and energy, has remained positive but low, at around +0.5% year-on-year.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "About 1–3 weeks (NBS May CPI likely around mid-June; FRED typically updates a few days after).",
    "status_quo_outcome": "Yes — another small negative y/y print (around -0.2% to -0.0%), extending the deflation streak.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "May headline CPI turns slightly positive (0.0% to +0.2% y/y), driven by holiday-related services strength and a stabilization or rebound in pork/food prices, with energy not dragging.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Food prices (especially pork) remain soft, goods demand stays weak, and energy doesn’t lift the headline, keeping headline CPI modestly negative y/y (e.g., -0.1% to -0.2%).",
    "rationale": "Recent prints: Feb -0.7%, Mar -0.1%, Apr -0.1% y/y; PPI -2.7% y/y in April (largest drop in six months); core CPI roughly +0.5% y/y. The status quo points to continued mild headline deflation, but only just below zero. May includes the Labor Day holiday, which tends to buoy services prices; with core positive, a small positive headline is plausible if food/energy drags ease. Key swing factor is food (notably pork): after a prolonged downcycle, any stabilization or rebound could tip the headline to zero or slightly positive. On the other hand, weak domestic demand, property-sector stress, and entrenched PPI deflation argue for continued price softness. I give extra weight to the recent run of negative prints (world changes slowly), but the proximity to zero and supportive services seasonality keep me below 50% for another negative. Not higher: persistent PPI deflation, weak goods demand, property downturn, and potential continued food disinflation. Not lower: core CPI is positive, May holiday services strength, and possible pork stabilization. I would update higher if high-frequency pork prices and May food basket indicators showed further declines, or if crude prices softened; I would update lower if Ministry of Agriculture data showed pork price rebounds, travel/services indicators beat expectations, or energy rose y/y enough to offset food.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill China experience a 4th month in a row of deflation in its May CPI report?\n\nQuestion background:\nSCMP: [China’s consumer prices fall in April, fuelling fears of deflation](https://www.scmp.com/economy/economic-indicators/article/3309834/chinas-consumer-prices-fall-april-fuelling-fears-deflation)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if the \"Percent Change from Year Ago, Not Seasonally Adjusted\" data presented at [FRED Consumer Price Indices (CPIs, HICPs), COICOP 1999: Consumer Price Index: Total for China (CHNCPIALLMINMEI)](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/CHNCPIALLMINMEI#) is negative for May 2025.\n\n\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nChina's Consumer Price Index (CPI) has registered three consecutive months of year-on-year deflation: -0.7% in February, -0.1% in March, and -0.1% in April 2025. The Producer Price Index (PPI), a measure of factory-gate prices, has also shown sustained deflationary pressure, declining for 31 consecutive months. In April, the PPI fell by 2.7% year-on-year, the largest decline in six months. Core CPI, which excludes food and energy, has remained positive but low, at around +0.5% year-on-year.\n\nToday is 2025-06-02.\n\nBefore answering you think:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n(e) You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
