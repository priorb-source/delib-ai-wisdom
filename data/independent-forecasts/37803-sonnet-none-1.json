    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Approximately 6 weeks until July 1, 2025",
    "status_quo_outcome": "The site remains offline. As of May 5, 2025, climate.mil has been down, and without intervention, it would likely stay down given the current political environment.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "The Trump administration continues its policy of removing or suppressing climate-related content from federal websites. Climate.mil remains offline through July 1, 2025, as part of a broader effort to downplay climate change across government agencies. No sufficient pressure from military leadership, Congress, or courts materializes to force its restoration within the 6-week timeframe.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Military operational needs prevail, as climate resilience planning is crucial for protecting bases from extreme weather and planning operations. Either military leadership successfully argues for restoration based on national security grounds, congressional pressure forces action, a court order requires it to be brought back online, or the administration reverses course. The site is restored before or on July 1, 2025.",
    "rationale": "The status quo strongly favors the site remaining down. It has been offline for at least two weeks (since before May 5), and The Guardian article indicates this is part of a deliberate Trump administration policy to purge climate mentions from federal websites. With only 6 weeks until resolution, bureaucratic inertia and political resistance make restoration within this timeframe challenging. However, several factors prevent this from being a near-certainty that it stays down: (1) Climate resilience has genuine military operational value - extreme weather, sea level rise, and climate impacts affect military bases and strategic planning; (2) The military has some institutional independence and may push back on purely ideological decisions that harm readiness; (3) There could be congressional pressure, even from defense-focused Republicans concerned about military preparedness; (4) Six weeks, while short, is technically sufficient time to restore a website if prioritized. My forecast is not higher because the political environment is clearly hostile to climate information, the status quo is down, and 6 weeks is a short timeframe for bureaucratic reversal. It's not lower because military operational necessity provides a legitimate non-political justification for restoration, and the military has shown institutional resistance to purely political interference in the past. I would update higher if there were reports of active restoration efforts, congressional hearings pressuring for restoration, or court challenges. I would update lower if there were explicit directives to keep climate sites offline indefinitely.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill the US military's climate resiliance portal be back online on July 1, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nThe Guardian [Scientists brace ‘for the worst’ as Trump purges climate mentions from websites](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/feb/04/trump-climate-change-federal-websites)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if climate.mil is online according to [Is It Down Right Now?](https://www.isitdownrightnow.com/climate.mil.html) when accessed by Metaculus on or after July 1, 2025.\n\nAs of May 5, 2025, the resolution source returns the message, \"Climate.mil is DOWN for everyone.\"\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nNo additional information available.\n\nToday is 2025-05-20.\n\nBefore answering you think:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n(e) You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
