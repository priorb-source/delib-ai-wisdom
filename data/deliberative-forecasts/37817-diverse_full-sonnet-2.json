    "review": "Both forecasters make compelling points that expose weaknesses in my initial analysis. Forecaster 3's mention of Yap as a potential United destination is new information I hadn't considered - if Yap is currently scheduled, that could add to the count. However, Forecaster 3 also expresses important skepticism about the Brisbane service being a genuine Qantas scheduled route versus a subsidized/charter arrangement, noting it's 'atypical for Qantas.' This is crucial because my baseline assumed Brisbane was confirmed.\n\nForecaster 2's emphasis on the 6-week timeline constraint is well-taken. International route launches typically require months of advance planning, regulatory approval, and marketing. With no announced routes starting before July 1 (United's Narita is October 29), adding 2+ new destinations is highly improbable.\n\nBoth forecasters are also more precise about the resolution source - what FlightsFrom.com will actually list on July 1, not theoretical service existence. This matters because charters, government-subsidized flights, or announced-but-not-yet-operating routes won't count.\n\nThe key insight is uncertainty about the current baseline. If Brisbane is questionable and Manila's current status is unconfirmed, we might only have 3 solid destinations (Guam, Taipei, possibly Manila), not 4-5. To reach 6+, we'd need 3 new routes in 6 weeks, which is extremely unlikely. Even in the optimistic scenario where we currently have 5 (including Yap, Hong Kong, or Brisbane), we'd still need 1 more route with no announcements on the horizon.\n\nMy 28% was too optimistic. Forecaster 2's 5% might be slightly too pessimistic given genuine uncertainty about what's currently listed, but Forecaster 3's 15% reasoning is sound.",
    "rationale": "After reviewing both analyses, I'm updating significantly downward. The critical factors are: (1) The current baseline is likely 3-4 destinations, not 4-5, given skepticism about Brisbane and uncertainty about Manila/Yap/Hong Kong; (2) To exceed 5 requires 6+ destinations, meaning we need 2-3 new routes in just 41 days; (3) No airlines have announced new routes starting before July 1 (United's Narita is October); (4) International route planning typically requires months of lead time.\n\nThe small remaining probability accounts for: (a) Possibility that current count is already at 5 if multiple uncertain routes (Yap, Hong Kong, Brisbane) are actually scheduled and listed; (b) Unreported developments or expedited launches driven by government tourism subsidies; (c) Resolution source potentially listing routes we haven't identified.\n\nHowever, these scenarios stack multiple low-probability conditions. The aviation industry moves slowly, and Palau's tourism recovery is gradual. With only 6 weeks until resolution and no concrete announcements, reaching 6+ destinations is highly unlikely.",
