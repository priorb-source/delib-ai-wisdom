    "review": "Forecaster 2 rightly emphasizes baseline uncertainty and the risk of front-loaded progress, but their near-coin-flip seems to underweight how close the threshold may already be if recent counts are high. Forecaster 3 adds crucial, concrete data (105 Done as of Apr 16; 100 on Apr 8; 44 In Progress) and a pace analysis. If accurate, those numbers materially change the outlook: only 15 more Done are needed over ~2.5 months from Apr 16 (or ~6.5 weeks from today), which is a modest bar given observed rates. The main caveats to Forecaster 3’s approach are (a) potential slowdown as low-hanging fruit is exhausted, (b) possible reclassification or reversals (e.g., injunctions) that could reduce the Done count by July 1, and (c) a small chance the cited counts are mistaken or not comparable due to changing methodology. Still, even with a significant slowdown, the gap of 15 looks small. Overall, I find Forecaster 3’s evidence persuasive and more informative than Forecaster 2’s general reasoning, though I discount slightly for verification risk and potential reclassifications.",
    "rationale": "My prior (30%) was driven by uncertainty over the current Done count. If the tracker indeed showed 105 Done on Apr 16 and 100 on Apr 8, then the required increment to 120 by July 1 is just +15. From Apr 16 to Jul 1, that’s ~76 days (0.2/day), and from today (~46 days) it’s ~0.33/day. The observed April rate (~0.625/day) comfortably exceeds what’s needed. The report of 44 objectives ‘in progress’ also suggests a pipeline that can plausibly deliver 15 completions. I still haircut for: (1) diminishing returns as the easier items are done; (2) potential reclassifications or legal reversals that could subtract from the Done tally by the check date; and (3) a nonzero chance the April numbers are off or the site’s taxonomy changes. The “on or after July 1” clause adds a bit of cushion if the threshold is crossed in early July. Balancing these, I substantially raise my estimate but stop short of Forecaster 3’s 90% given the residual risks and lack of direct verification today.",
