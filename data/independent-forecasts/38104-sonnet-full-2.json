  "information": "The escape from the Orleans Justice Center on May 16, 2025, involved ten inmates and went undetected for seven hours. The inmates created a hole in a wall behind a toilet, climbed out through a maintenance area, and used a mattress to get over a barbed-wire fence. An investigation revealed significant security flaws, including chronic understaffing, with the prison at only 60% of required staffing at the time. A federal monitor's report had previously warned of a deteriorated security situation, citing inmates' ability to manipulate cell locks. At least three jail employees have been arrested in connection with the escape, which the Orleans Parish Sheriff believes was an 'inside job' aided by staff.\n\nA multi-agency manhunt is underway, involving over 200 officers from local, state, and federal bodies, including the FBI, U.S. Marshals, and the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives (ATF). The reward for information leading to the capture of the two remaining fugitives has been increased to $50,000 per person, with funds contributed by Crimestoppers, the FBI, and the ATF. As of late May 2025, law enforcement had received nearly 700 tips from the public. In connection with the escape and subsequent aid to the fugitives, at least 14 accomplices have been arrested, including family members of one of the escapees.\n\nAs of May 30, 2025, eight of the ten escapees have been recaptured. Some captures occurred out of state, including two inmates who were apprehended in Walker County, Texas, after a high-speed chase. The two fugitives still at large are Antoine Massey, 33, and Derrick Groves, 27, who are both considered armed and dangerous. Groves is a convicted murderer awaiting sentencing for a double homicide. Massey is described as a 'serial escapee' with three prior escapes from custody and was also being sought for kidnapping and rape. A former federal warden noted that Massey's housing in a first-floor cell was a significant security risk.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Approximately 32 days until July 1, 2025",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No - two inmates remain at large as of May 30, 2025",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Antoine Massey and/or Derrick Groves successfully evade the manhunt for another month. Given Massey's history as a 'serial escapee' with three prior escapes, he may have developed effective evasion tactics. They could receive help from accomplices not yet identified, flee to Mexico or another country, or simply remain hidden in remote areas or with sympathetic contacts despite the intensive search.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "The massive multi-agency manhunt with 200+ officers, federal resources (FBI, U.S. Marshals, ATF), and $100,000 in combined rewards successfully tracks down both remaining fugitives within 32 days. The 700+ tips received lead investigators to their locations. The systematic arrest of 14 accomplices cuts off their support network, making it increasingly difficult for them to evade capture.",
    "rationale": "This forecast weighs several competing factors. Supporting recapture: The successful capture of 8 out of 10 escapees within two weeks demonstrates effective law enforcement response. The massive resource commitment (200+ officers, federal agencies, $100,000 rewards) is substantial. Nearly 700 tips show strong public engagement, and the arrest of 14 accomplices suggests their support network is being systematically dismantled. With 32 days remaining, there's considerable time for an intensive manhunt. Against recapture: The two remaining fugitives are likely the most difficult to catch - a classic selection effect. Massey's designation as a 'serial escapee' with three prior escapes is particularly concerning, suggesting he has developed effective evasion skills. Both face extremely serious charges (murder, kidnapping, rape), providing powerful motivation to remain free. They've already evaded capture for about two weeks. Historical data on prison escapes suggests recapture rates above 90% eventually, but individuals with prior escape history take longer to catch. The status quo baseline (two still at large) weighs against resolution as Yes. The forecast is not higher because the remaining two are demonstrably harder to catch and Massey's track record is worrying. It's not lower because the resources deployed are exceptional and the time window is sufficient. I would update higher with news of either fugitive being located or cornered, and lower if they remain at large past mid-June without significant leads.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill all 10 inmates who escaped from jail in New Orleans on May 16, 2025 be recaptured before July 1, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\n[Manhunt continues Monday for 7 Orleans jail escapees as state launches investigation](https://www.fox8live.com/2025/05/19/manhunt-continues-monday-7-orleans-jail-escapees-state-launches-investigation/)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below.

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower.
