  "information": "The U.S. Supreme Court unanimously ruled that Kilmar Abrego Garcia's deportation was unlawful and ordered the Trump administration to 'facilitate' his return. Subsequently, U.S. District Judge Paula Xinis ordered the administration to explain its diplomatic efforts with El Salvador regarding his return and set deadlines for the government to provide information and documents. An earlier court-ordered deadline for Garcia's return of April 7, 2025, passed without compliance.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "About 61 days (until July 1, 2025)",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "The administration continues to slow-walk compliance, citing diplomatic/administrative hurdles (e.g., travel documents, parole processing). The district court escalates but either grants brief extensions, or the government secures a stay on any coercive order. July 1 arrives without his re-entry.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Judge Xinis imposes coercive measures (e.g., contempt sanctions, firm, short deadlines) and denies extensions; DHS approves advance authorization for parole and coordinates with El Salvador to issue travel documents and transport. Credible reporting confirms Garcia’s arrival at a U.S. port of entry in June.",
    "rationale": "The Supreme Court’s unanimous ruling and directive to “facilitate” return, plus active district court oversight, materially raise the chance of a return. Logistically, a return can be arranged within weeks if the executive cooperates (parole under INA 212(d)(5), travel docs, flight). However, the missed April 7, 2025, court-ordered deadline indicates meaningful resistance or foot-dragging by the administration. With only ~2 months left, the status quo path is continued delay while demonstrating minimal efforts, which courts often press but sometimes tolerate via rolling deadlines. Political incentives in the current administration likely favor delaying an optics-heavy repatriation, and the “facilitate” language is weaker than an unambiguous mandate to ensure return by a date certain. That said, courts can escalate: credible threats of contempt or personal sanctions historically spur compliance, and El Salvador is unlikely to be the principal blocker if the U.S. decides to move. This pushes the probability above a low baseline but still leaves “No” as the modal outcome by July 1. Not higher because we already have one missed deadline and signs of resistance; two months is short for litigated compliance under adversarial politics. Not lower because the Supreme Court posture, ongoing district court involvement, and practical feasibility keep a June return plausible. Upward updates: (1) court issues a coercive order/contempt with near-term deadlines; (2) DHS grants parole-in-advance or issues a carrier letter; (3) El Salvador issues/validates travel documents; (4) reporting of a booked itinerary or scheduled port-of-entry processing. Downward updates: (1) any stay from the Fourth Circuit or Supreme Court on enforcement; (2) new court deadlines slip into July or later; (3) credible reports of El Salvador declining travel docs despite U.S. requests; (4) signals DHS is pursuing further procedural delays.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill Kilmar Abrego Garcia return to the United States before July 1, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nWikipedia: [Deportation of Kilmar Abrego Garcia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deportation_of_Kilmar_Abrego_Garcia)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if Kilmar Abrego Garcia after the launch of this question and before July 1, 2025 enters territory of the United States according to [credible sources](https://www.metaculus.com/help/faq/#definitions).\n\nSubsequently leaving the United States, such as a deportation, will not cause this question to re-resolve.\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nThe U.S. Supreme Court unanimously ruled that Kilmar Abrego Garcia's deportation was unlawful and ordered the Trump administration to 'facilitate' his return.

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
