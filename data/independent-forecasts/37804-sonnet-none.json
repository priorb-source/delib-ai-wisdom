    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "42 days until July 1, 2025",
    "status_quo_outcome": "Yes - the CDC currently recommends 0.7 mg/L fluoride as the optimal level",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "HHS and CDC complete their review within the next 6 weeks and either lower the recommended fluoride level below 0.7 mg/L, eliminate the recommendation entirely, or remove the guidance page without replacement",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "The CDC maintains its current recommendation of 0.7 mg/L (or recommends a higher level) through July 1, 2025. The review process continues but no changes are implemented by the deadline",
    "rationale": "The status quo strongly favors a Yes outcome. The CDC has recommended 0.7 mg/L since 2015, and government agencies typically move slowly on major public health guidance changes. The key challenge is the 6-week timeframe. For a No outcome, HHS would need to: (1) complete its review, (2) make a determination to change policy, (3) have CDC update its recommendation, and (4) modify the website - all within 42 days. This is extraordinarily fast for federal bureaucracy. The NPR article from April 10, 2025 indicates the review was just announced, making a complete policy reversal in under 3 months unlikely. However, the political context introduces uncertainty. The mention of HHS reviewing fluoride guidance suggests potential political pressure, possibly from figures skeptical of water fluoridation. The question also resolves as No if the page is simply taken offline, which could happen faster than a formal recommendation change. This probability is not higher (85-90%) because: real political pressure exists, the page could be removed relatively quickly, and we're in a potentially volatile political environment. This probability is not lower (60-65%) because: bureaucratic inertia is powerful, 6 weeks is very short for major policy changes, and changing long-standing public health guidance requires substantial process even under political pressure. I would update higher with news of the review being postponed or CDC reaffirming current guidance. I would update lower with announcements of imminent policy changes or expedited review timelines.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill the CDC still recommend 0.7 mg/L fluoride as the optimal level in community water supplies on July 1, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nNPR: [HHS will review guidance on the addition of fluoride to drinking water](https://www.npr.org/2025/04/10/g-s1-59452/hhs-rfk-fluoride-drinking-water-epa)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if the CDC's [Community Water Fluoridation Recommendations](https://www.cdc.gov/fluoridation/about/community-water-fluoridation-recommendations.html) recommends greater than or equal to 0.7 mg/L as the concentration that maximizes fluoride's oral health benefits while minimizing potential harms. If a lesser amount is recommended or if there is no longer any recommendation at all, then the question resolves as **No**.\n\nIf the page is pulled offline with no replacement, this question also resolves as **No**.\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nNo additional information available.\n\nToday is 2025-05-20.\n\nBefore answering you think:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n(e) You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
