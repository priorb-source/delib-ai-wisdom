  "information": "Multiple U.S. officials and intelligence reports have pointed to 2027 as a key year for China's military readiness regarding Taiwan. In February 2023, CIA Director Bill Burns stated that Chinese leader Xi Jinping had ordered the military to be prepared for an invasion by 2027. This timeline is consistently referenced by U.S. military leaders as a target for the PLA to complete its preparations. Chinese activities preceding this date include intensified propaganda, such as a March 2025 video showing large-scale landing ships, and the use of 'grey zone' military exercises to test Taiwan's defenses.",

    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "About 57 days (until July 1, 2025)",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "PLA continues gray-zone pressure, air/naval exercises, and coercion (possibly even blockade-like moves or missile tests), but does not land ground troops on Taiwan-controlled territory; and/or the U.S. avoids using the word “invasion” or does not publicly accuse China of having landed ground forces.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "PLA conducts an amphibious/airborne landing that puts identifiable PLA ground units on Taiwan-controlled territory (main island or outlying islands such as Kinmen/Matsu/Pratas) and the U.S. government publicly states that China has invaded Taiwan by landing ground forces.",
    "rationale": "- Baseline and inertia: The world changes slowly. With only ~8 weeks left, the base rate for a large, complex amphibious operation beginning suddenly—and being labeled an “invasion” by Washington—is extremely low. Most historical cross-strait crises have featured coercive shows of force short of an outright landing.\n- Lead indicators: A ground-force landing would likely be preceded by unmistakable mobilization (amphibious assets massing in Fujian, large-scale logistics staging, civilian shipping requisition, intensified air/missile preparations, political signaling, evacuations). There are no widely reported indicators of that magnitude at present.\n- US language requirement: The resolution requires the U.S. government to publicly accuse China of invading Taiwan by sending ground forces. Even if a limited seizure of an outlying islet occurred, Washington might choose phrasing like “attack” or “assault on Taiwan-controlled territory,” rather than “invasion of Taiwan,” to manage escalation. This linguistic hurdle further reduces odds.\n- Assistant’s inputs: Multiple U.S. officials have highlighted 2027 as a key PLA readiness date; that pushes expectations away from 2025. The noted uptick in propaganda (e.g., March 2025 landing-ship video) and grey-zone activity signal pressure and preparation but do not themselves imply an imminent landing within weeks.\n- Why not higher: The operational, political, and economic costs for Beijing are massive; surprise is difficult; and the U.S. wording requirement is strict. Also, a blockade or missile strike scenario—arguably more plausible in the short term—would not resolve this market to Yes.\n- Why not lower: A tail-risk remains that China could attempt a fait accompli against a lightly defended outlying island, and the U.S. could choose to characterize that as an invasion involving ground forces. While I expect more cautious wording, it is not impossible.\n- What would move me up: Credible reporting of PLA amphibious/airborne mobilization (ships massing, civilian RO-RO requisition, fuel and ammunition staging), sudden PRC domestic war-prep measures, evacuation advisories, a formal PRC quarantine/blockade announcement plus signs of imminent landing, and U.S. intelligence leaks warning of near-term assault.\n- What would move me down: Clear de-escalatory steps (e.g., resumed cross-strait exchanges), PLA exercise tempo easing, or explicit senior-level statements signaling no near-term military action.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill the United States accuse the People's Republic of China of invading Taiwan before July 1, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nCFR: [Why China-Taiwan Relations Are So Tense](https://www.cfr.org/backgrounder/china-taiwan-relations-tension-us-policy-trump)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if, before July 1, 2025, the US government publicly accuses the People's Republic of China of invading Taiwan by sending its ground military forces into Taiwan without consent from the Taiwanese government in Taipei.\n\n\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nMultiple U.S. officials and intelligence reports have pointed to 2027 as a key year for China's military readiness regarding Taiwan.

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
