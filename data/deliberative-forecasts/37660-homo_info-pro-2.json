    "review": "My initial forecast was 20%. I find Forecaster 3's analysis (85%) unconvincing as it misses the critical recent reports of delays and regulatory hurdles that both I and Forecaster 2 have noted. Their conclusion that there are 'no reports of outstanding issues' is factually incorrect. Forecaster 2's analysis (35%) is much more compelling and introduced two crucial pieces of new information I had not considered: 1) A previously expected launch date of April 2025 was missed, which is a strong negative indicator for a launch happening within the next six weeks. 2) The Sri Lankan regulator (TRCSL) has actively denied rumors that the service has been suspended, which is a positive indicator of continued commitment from the government. Forecaster 2's reasoning is sound, though I believe they may slightly underweight the powerful negative signal sent by a missed deadline.",
    "rationale": "I am updating my forecast from 20% to 25%. Forecaster 2's analysis has persuaded me to adjust my forecast slightly upwards. My initial forecast was based on a significant national security hurdle that seemed to be in the early stages of negotiation. Forecaster 2's report provides more texture: the issue is a 'dashboard system,' and crucially, the TRCSL has publicly denied that the project is suspended. This denial of suspension shows active political will to complete the process, which I had not previously factored in and which raises the probability of a resolution. However, the other key piece of information from Forecaster 2—that an April 2025 launch deadline was already missed—is a very strong signal that the remaining hurdle is substantial and not easily resolved. This concrete evidence of delay prevents a larger update and keeps my forecast low. The new information confirms the existence of a serious delay while also providing evidence of continued commitment to overcome it. The slight upward revision reflects that the deal is confirmed to be active, but the short timeframe and missed deadline mean the probability of resolution before July 1 remains low.",
