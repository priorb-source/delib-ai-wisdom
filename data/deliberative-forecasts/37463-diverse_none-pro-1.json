    "review": "I have reviewed the analyses from two other forecasters. Forecaster 2's reasoning aligns closely with my own, emphasizing Berkshire Hathaway's recent trend as a net seller of equities, its cautious posture, and the high valuation of Amazon. This reinforces my initial low-probability assessment. Forecaster 3's analysis, however, appears to be based on a critical factual error. They argue that the historical position was ~10.7M shares, meaning the status quo would resolve as 'Yes'. Public 13F filings, including the source provided in the prompt, clearly show that Berkshire has held exactly 10,000,000 shares for multiple quarters. This means Forecaster 3's entire high-confidence rationale is based on a false premise. The status quo outcome is 'No', and an active purchase would be required for a 'Yes' resolution.",
    "rationale": "After deliberation, I am maintaining my original forecast. My initial analysis correctly identified that Berkshire Hathaway's holding in Amazon has been stable at exactly 10,000,000 shares. Therefore, for this question to resolve as 'Yes', the company must have been a net purchaser of Amazon stock during Q1 2025. This is a high bar for action, not a continuation of the status quo. Forecaster 3's analysis was unconvincing because its central premise—that the existing stake was over 10M shares—was incorrect. Forecaster 2's analysis corroborated my own line of reasoning: Berkshire's recent pattern of net selling equities, building its cash hoard, and trimming other large technology holdings (like Apple) makes a new-found appetite for significantly increasing its Amazon stake unlikely. The core of my argument remains unchanged: inertia and Berkshire's current macro posture strongly favor inaction or selling over buying. The probability remains at 20% to account for the possibility that investment managers Todd Combs or Ted Weschler saw a specific, compelling value opportunity in Amazon during the quarter, but this remains the less likely scenario.",
