    "review": "All three analyses converged on similar reasoning: Florida has competitive aviation characteristics (major airports, military presence, favorable weather) but lacks historical data showing it typically leads in pilot UFO reports. Forecaster 3 made an important methodological contribution by starting from a uniform 2% baseline (1/50 states) and adjusting upward for Florida's specific factors. This is more rigorous than my intuitive approach of identifying 5-8 competitive states. Both forecasters emphasized California's likely superior total aviation activity, which is a significant competitive concern I underweighted. Forecaster 2's slightly higher estimate (22%) reflects more optimism about Florida's military aviation assets and monthly randomness, while Forecaster 3's conservative 12% reflects appropriate caution given the lack of supporting data. The 12-22% range represents reasonable disagreement about how much Florida's specific characteristics should boost it above the uniform baseline, given California's probable aviation dominance.",
    "rationale": "Upon reflection, I find Forecaster 3's baseline methodology more compelling than my original approach. Without any historical data showing Florida leads in pilot UFO sightings, anchoring near a uniform baseline and adjusting upward for known factors is more defensible than assuming Florida is one of a small set of highly competitive states. California's aviation market is larger than Florida's - it has more airports, more total flights, and comparable military presence. This suggests Florida should not be heavily favored. However, Florida's combination of factors (3rd largest population, multiple major hubs, significant military aviation, year-round operations, extensive airspace) does justify a meaningful premium above 2%. The tie-breaks-to-No rule and single-month volatility add uncertainty. Balancing these considerations, I'm adjusting downward from my initial 17% to account for California's likely dominance and the methodological strength of starting closer to the baseline. A forecast around 15% reflects that Florida is plausibly competitive but not demonstrably advantaged over other major aviation states.",
