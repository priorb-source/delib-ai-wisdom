  "information": "In early 2025, GoPro announced it was named the official camera of the 2025 Freeride World Tour for the 12th consecutive year. The company also released a minor upgrade to its GoPro Max panoramic camera in February 2025. Reports in May 2025 also noted the release of a new GoPro Hero13 camera featuring an anamorphic lens. The company's most significant debt maturity is a convertible note due in November 2025.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Less than 2 months - the question resolves on July 1, 2025, and today is May 9, 2025.",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No - GoPro does not file for bankruptcy. Companies rarely file for bankruptcy protection unless facing immediate financial crisis, and the default assumption is continued operations.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "GoPro continues normal operations through July 1, 2025. The company maintains sufficient liquidity to meet near-term obligations, continues product releases and marketing activities, and addresses its November 2025 convertible note maturity through refinancing, extension, or conversion without requiring bankruptcy protection.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "GoPro experiences a sudden liquidity crisis in the next 6-7 weeks, possibly due to unexpected creditor demands, inability to meet immediate obligations, covenant violations, or operational collapse. The company exhausts alternatives and files for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection before July 1 to restructure its debts and operations.",
    "rationale": "The evidence strongly favors a No outcome for several reasons. First, the timeframe is extremely short - less than 2 months. Bankruptcy filings typically occur after extended financial distress becomes acute. Second, GoPro shows signs of ongoing operations: they released a Max camera upgrade in February 2025, announced a Hero13 with anamorphic lens in May 2025, and renewed their Freeride World Tour sponsorship for the 12th year. These activities suggest the company is functioning normally. Third, their major debt obligation (convertible note) doesn't mature until November 2025, after the resolution date. Companies don't typically file preemptively months before a debt maturity unless in severe distress. The research assistant's report contains no red flags like credit downgrades, covenant violations, mass layoffs, or liquidity warnings. However, I cannot assign extremely low probability because: (1) we have limited information about GoPro's current financial position, (2) the company has faced historical challenges in the competitive action camera market, and (3) unexpected events can occur rapidly. For probability to increase, I would need evidence of: credit facility withdrawals, inability to pay suppliers, emergency restructuring advisors hired, or covenant violations. For probability to decrease further, I would need: successful debt refinancing announcements, strong cash position disclosures, or positive earnings surprises. The status quo heavily favors continued operations, but acknowledging information limitations and GoPro's past struggles, I assign a low but non-trivial probability.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill GoPro file for bankruptcy before July 1, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\n[GoPro Announces Fourth Quarter and 2024 Results](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1500435/000150043525000003/gpro2024-12x31exh991xer.htm)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question will resolve as **Yes** if GoPro, Inc., files any petition for bankruptcy protection in the United States, under any chapter of the United States Bankruptcy Code, before July 1, 2025. The question will resolves on the filing of such a petition, not on whether any bankruptcy protection is granted by a court. If no such petition is filed by that date, this question will resolve as **No**.\n\n\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nIn early 2025, GoPro announced it was named the official camera of the 2025 Freeride World Tour for the 12th consecutive year.

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
