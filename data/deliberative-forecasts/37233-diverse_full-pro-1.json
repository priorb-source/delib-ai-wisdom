    "review": "My initial forecast was similar to Forecaster 2's, focusing on the strong signals from President Ouattara's party (RHDP) pointing toward an imminent declaration. Forecaster 2 added the useful point that Ouattara has already delayed his decision for several months, suggesting he is in firm control of the timeline. However, I found Forecaster 3's analysis particularly compelling and persuasive. They introduced two critical arguments I had under-weighted: 1) The precedent set in 2020, when Ouattara declared his candidacy much later in the year (August). 2) The strategic reality that with major opposition figures facing eligibility challenges, there is significantly less urgency for Ouattara to declare early. These points provide a strong, historically-grounded rationale for why a delay beyond the June 1 deadline is not just possible, but strategically advantageous.",
    "rationale": "I am significantly updating my forecast downward based on the deliberation. My initial analysis over-weighted the very public and coordinated statements from RHDP ministers as a signal of *imminent* timing. I now believe I misinterpreted the signal; while these statements almost certainly confirm his *intent* to run, they don't necessarily dictate the *timing* of his personal, formal declaration. The arguments from Forecaster 3, especially the 2020 precedent of an August declaration and the reduced competitive pressure from a weakened opposition, have convinced me that a later announcement is the more likely scenario. Incumbents often delay declarations to maintain strategic flexibility and control the political narrative, and Ouattara has every reason to do so here. The party is building a sense of inevitability, but the president himself can wait for a more opportune moment, likely a summer party congress. I am therefore shifting my forecast from 65% to 40%, moving from believing a 'Yes' outcome is likely to believing a 'No' outcome is more probable.",
