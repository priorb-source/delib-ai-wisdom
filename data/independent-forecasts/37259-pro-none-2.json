    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Less than two months, with a deadline of July 1, 2025.",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No. The government of Greenland does not announce a date for an independence referendum, and the current political and constitutional relationship with Denmark continues without this specific development.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "The ruling Siumut-led coalition government, which favors a gradual path to independence, continues to focus on economic development and constitutional preparations. The short timeframe to the July 1 deadline passes without the political consensus or will to take the definitive step of officially scheduling a referendum vote.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "An unexpected political event, such as a crisis in the governing coalition or a surge in public pressure, forces the Greenlandic government to act decisively. In a bid to consolidate support or respond to the crisis, the Premier officially announces a future date for an independence referendum before July 1, 2025.",
    "rationale": "My forecast is heavily influenced by two key factors: the current political landscape in Greenland and the very short time remaining until the question resolves. The March 2025 election resulted in a victory for the 'gradualist' Siumut party, which, while supporting eventual independence, prioritizes achieving economic self-sufficiency first. This political stance strongly suggests that rushing to schedule a referendum is not on their immediate agenda. The status quo, in which no referendum is scheduled, is therefore a powerful predictor of the outcome. The timeframe of less than two months is extremely compressed for such a momentous political decision, which would typically involve extensive parliamentary debate and coalition negotiation. The research assistant's report indicating no additional information reinforces this, as a move toward scheduling a referendum would likely generate significant political chatter and media coverage, none of which is present. My probability is not lower than 5% because the desire for independence is a core issue in Greenlandic politics, and unexpected events or political calculations could always lead to a surprise announcement. For instance, the government might announce a referendum for a date far in the future as a strategic move. I would raise my forecast if the ruling coalition became unstable, if prominent leaders began signaling an announcement was imminent, or if a major external event (e.g., related to Arctic resources) accelerated the independence debate. Conversely, I would lower it if the government explicitly stated its focus for the coming months was on other issues like the annual budget.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nBefore July 1, 2025, will the government of Greenland officially announce a date for an independence referendum?\n\nQuestion background:\nReuters: [Greenland's independence gradualists win election amid Trump control pledge](https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/greenland-election-tests-independence-ambitions-us-interest-looms-2025-03-11/)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if, before July 1, 2025, a referendum on the independence of Greenland from the Denmark is officially scheduled. If this does not occur before that date, this question resolves as **No**.\n\nFor purposes of this question, the referendum will be considered \"officially scheduled\" when it is announced by a person or entity with the authority to do so within Greenland. Please note that broader legality, such as it being overturned by the government of Denmark, will be considered irrelevant for this question.\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nNo additional information available.\n\nToday is 2025-05-02.\n\nBefore answering you think:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n(e) You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
