    "review": "All three forecasters are grappling with the identical fundamental challenge: complete absence of race-specific information about opponents, polling, endorsements, or current standings. We all acknowledge Jones is a credible candidate (former delegate, Washington Post coverage) but face extreme epistemic uncertainty. Forecaster 2's emphasis on the status quo principle and caution without strong evidence is compelling - their 30% reflects appropriate conservative positioning when lacking data. Forecaster 3's reasoning about establishing bounds (not above 50% without frontrunner evidence, not below 30% given credibility) provides a useful framework. The convergence of forecasts in the 30-45% range suggests this captures the reasonable uncertainty band. My initial 45% may have been slightly optimistic given the complete information vacuum. Without evidence distinguishing Jones as a frontrunner versus one of several credible candidates, a more neutral position seems warranted.",
    "rationale": "Upon reflection, I'm updating my forecast downward from 45% to 40%, aligning with Forecaster 3's reasoning. This adjustment acknowledges that my initial forecast may have implicitly assumed Jones has a slight edge without sufficient evidence. In a multi-candidate Democratic primary where we know nothing about the field composition or current dynamics, 40% better reflects epistemic humility while still recognizing Jones's credibility as a former elected official with major media coverage. This probability suggests Jones has real but highly uncertain chances - roughly equivalent to being one credible candidate among 2-3 serious contenders. The 5-point reduction incorporates Forecaster 2's valid caution about status quo assumptions and Forecaster 3's sound boundary reasoning. I remain open to substantial revision in either direction if actual race information emerges, but 40% appropriately captures our current state of profound uncertainty while avoiding both unwarranted optimism and excessive pessimism.",
