    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Less than two months, as the deadline is July 1, 2025.",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No. South Sudan has signed but not ratified the AfCFTA agreement. Without a concerted and rapid effort to complete the ratification process, the status quo will hold, and the deadline will pass.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "The South Sudanese government continues to be preoccupied with its significant internal challenges, including managing the fragile political situation, ongoing security issues, and preparations for the now-postponed general elections. The legislative and administrative capacity required to prioritize and finalize the AfCFTA ratification is not mobilized, and the July 1, 2025 deadline passes without action.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Seeking a positive signal to the international community and potential investors, the government of South Sudan makes a high-level political decision to expedite the ratification. The necessary approvals are fast-tracked through the relevant legislative and executive bodies, and the country successfully deposits its instrument of ratification with the African Union Commission before July 1, 2025.",
    "rationale": "My forecast is based on the strong probability of the status quo persisting. South Sudan has not ratified the AfCFTA in the nearly seven years since signing it, which indicates a low level of political priority amidst more pressing domestic issues. The country faces immense challenges, including political instability related to its transitional government, severe security concerns, and a humanitarian crisis. These factors consume the state's limited institutional capacity and political attention. With less than two months until the deadline, completing a multi-stage legislative and executive ratification process is highly unlikely for a country in this situation. The research provided mentions an economic summit but offers no specific evidence of an active push towards ratification. The probability is not lower because there remains a small chance that a political leader could champion the cause for a quick foreign policy 'win', or that an external body could provide a strong incentive to finalize the process. The probability is not higher because the systemic, long-standing obstacles and the extremely short timeline make a 'No' outcome the most probable result. My forecast would increase upon specific news of the ratification bill being tabled in parliament or a definitive statement of intent from the President's office. It would decrease further if any new domestic crisis were to emerge.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill South Sudan ratify AfCFTA (the pan-African free trade agreement) before July 1, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nThe Star Worldwide via MSN: [World Chambers Africa Summit maps economic path for South Sudan](https://www.msn.com/en-xl/africa/other/world-chambers-africa-summit-maps-economic-path-for-south-sudan/ar-AA1CTigs?ocid=BingNewsVerp)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if South Sudan ratifies the African Continental Free Trade Area (AfCFTA) Agreement before July 1, 2025.\n\n\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nNo additional information available.\n\nToday is 2025-05-02.\n\nBefore answering you think:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n(e) You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
