  "information": "As of May 2, 2025, Tanzania holds a Level 2: Exercise Increased Caution travel advisory from the US State Department, last updated on September 9, 2024. The advisory cites crime, terrorism, and the targeting of LGBTQI+ persons as primary concerns. While the country is at Level 2 overall, specific regions such as Mtwara have a higher, Level 3 warning. In March 2025, the US Embassy issued an alert regarding coastal security.\n\nSeveral other countries in the region or with similar risk profiles have recently been elevated to Level 3. Uganda's advisory was raised due to terrorism risks, political demonstrations, and discriminatory laws. Burundi's Level 3 advisory cites violent crimes like grenade attacks and armed robbery targeting foreigners. The State Department also reissued a Level 3 alert for Bangladesh due to civil unrest, crime, and terrorism, and issued a Level 3 warning for Trinidad and Tobago following a surge in violent crime and a declared state of emergency.\n\nThe US State Department's travel advisory system consists of four tiers: Level 1 (Exercise Normal Precautions), Level 2 (Exercise Increased Caution), Level 3 (Reconsider Travel), and Level 4 (Do Not Travel). Advisories are regularly reviewed and can be upgraded due to factors like a significant deterioration in security, increased terrorist activity, political instability, or civil unrest. A notable security concern for Tanzania is the insurgency in Mozambique's Niassa Reserve, which borders the country. Terrorist activity linked to Islamic extremism was reported in the area as recently as April 2025, creating potential spillover risks.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Approximately 2 months, until July 1, 2025.",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No. The US State Department's travel advisory for Tanzania remains at 'Level 2: Exercise Increased Caution'.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "The security situation in Tanzania, particularly in major tourist areas, remains stable without significant deterioration. The existing concerns regarding crime, terrorism, and the insurgency spillover from Mozambique do not escalate into major incidents that would trigger a country-wide re-evaluation. The State Department continues to manage higher-risk zones with targeted regional advisories, deeming a nationwide 'Level 3' unnecessary.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "A significant security incident occurs, such as a large-scale terrorist attack in a major city or tourist hub (e.g., Dar es Salaam, Arusha, Zanzibar), a notable spillover of the insurgency from Mozambique into southern Tanzania impacting civilian areas, or a sharp increase in violent crime explicitly targeting U.S. citizens or Western travelers. This event would compel the State Department to quickly upgrade the advisory to 'Level 3: Reconsider Travel' to reflect the heightened risk.",
    "rationale": "My forecast of 25% is based on the principle that while travel advisories possess bureaucratic inertia and tend to change only in response to significant events, there are tangible and escalating risks concerning Tanzania. The status quo is that Tanzania is at Level 2, and in a short two-month timeframe, this is the most likely outcome. However, several factors introduce a non-trivial chance of an upgrade. The research highlights an active insurgency on the Mozambique border with recent activity and potential for spillover, a primary catalyst for a heightened threat level. This risk is underscored by the March 2025 US Embassy alert regarding coastal security, suggesting official, current concern. Furthermore, the State Department has recently elevated nearby countries like Uganda and Burundi to Level 3 for similar reasons (terrorism, crime, instability), demonstrating a low threshold for such upgrades in the region when conditions warrant. My forecast is not higher because the timeframe is short, reducing the window for a triggering event to occur and be processed. The State Department has also shown a preference for targeted warnings, already applying a Level 3 to the Mtwara region, which might be seen as a sufficient warning without a country-wide escalation. My forecast is not lower because ignoring the active insurgency, the specific embassy alert, and regional precedents would understate the real possibility of a rapid deterioration. I would increase my forecast if a credible, high-casualty attack occurs in a tourist area. I would decrease it if Tanzania and Mozambique announced a successful joint operation that significantly degrades the insurgency's capabilities near the border.",
