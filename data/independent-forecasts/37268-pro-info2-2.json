  "information": "The Iraqi government has set November 11, 2025, as the date for the parliamentary elections. The Independent High Electoral Commission (IHEC) announced that the registration period for political alliances would run from April 15 to May 4, 2025. The political landscape is marked by significant divisions within the Shia bloc. The Shiite Coordination Framework, a major coalition, plans to participate in the election with at least six separate lists, though they are in discussions to form a post-election coalition. The electoral law remains a point of contention among political blocs.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Less than 2 months (resolves July 1, 2025).",
    "status_quo_outcome": "Muqtada al-Sadr's Alliance Towards Reforms party will not announce participation in the 2025 parliamentary election, continuing its boycott of the formal political process.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Muqtada al-Sadr maintains his position that the current political system is corrupt and dominated by his rivals. The July 1, 2025 deadline passes without any announcement of his coalition's participation, solidifying his role as a powerful opposition figure outside of parliament.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Recognizing an opportunity in the fragmentation of his rivals in the Shiite Coordination Framework, or having secured significant concessions regarding the electoral law or government formation, Sadr makes a surprise reversal. He announces that his Alliance Towards Reforms will contest the elections to break the political deadlock and serve the Iraqi people.",
    "rationale": "My forecast is strongly anchored in the status quo of Muqtada al-Sadr's consistent and publicly reaffirmed boycott of the Iraqi political process since his bloc's withdrawal from parliament in 2022. He has framed this as a principled stand against a corrupt system dominated by his rivals, the Iran-backed Shiite Coordination Framework. The most critical piece of information influencing my forecast is the imminent deadline from the Independent High Electoral Commission (IHEC), which stated the registration period for political alliances ends on May 4, 2025. With today being May 3, 2025, the window for a formal announcement is virtually closed. It is highly improbable that Sadr would reverse a years-long strategy without any preceding signals or political breakthroughs, especially at the eleventh hour. While Sadr is known for his political unpredictability, a reversal at this stage with no apparent concessions from his rivals would appear erratic and undermine the credibility of his opposition movement. The probability is not lower than 5% because Sadr's history includes abrupt strategic shifts, and the noted fragmentation of the Coordination Framework presents a tempting tactical opportunity. A secret last-minute deal or a sudden change of heart, while unlikely, cannot be completely ruled out with an actor like Sadr. The probability is not higher than 5% because all public evidence, his stated positions, and the logistical timeline for election registration point overwhelmingly towards continued non-participation. For me to increase my forecast, I would need to see credible evidence of high-level negotiations between the Sadrists and the Coordination Framework or an unexpected extension of the IHEC registration deadline. Conversely, my forecast would move closer to 0% after the May 4 deadline passes without an announcement.",

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
