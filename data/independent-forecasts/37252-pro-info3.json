  "information": "Multiple civic and political groups have been actively organizing demonstrations. The Korean Confederation of Trade Unions (KCTU) and the Democratic Labor Union held rallies for Labor Day on May 1. The KCTU has also announced its intention to organize a general strike in July. Groups such as 'Free Korea' and 'Candlelight Action' have consistently held rallies and counter-rallies in response to political developments. Conservative groups have also planned a rally for May 18th in Gwangju.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "The outcome will be determined by events occurring between May 1, 2025, and July 1, 2025, a period of two months.",
    "status_quo_outcome": "Yes. The political environment in South Korea remains highly charged following the December 2024 martial law declaration. The status quo involves frequent, large-scale demonstrations organized by a mobilized civil society and powerful unions, making another 10,000+ participant protest likely.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Political tensions de-escalate unexpectedly, leading to a period of calm. Planned major rallies, such as those by labor unions or civic groups, are either cancelled, postponed beyond the deadline, or fail to attract more than 10,000 participants. A protest might also occur but not be reported by the Global Protest Tracker, although this is less likely.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "At least one of the multiple planned or spontaneous protests in May or June 2025 crosses the 10,000 participant threshold. For instance, the KCTU's May Day rally, a 'Candlelight Action' protest against the government, or a conservative counter-protest successfully mobilizes a large crowd, which is then recorded by the Global Protest Tracker.",
    "rationale": "My forecast of 80% is based on the extremely high political tension in South Korea, which serves as a powerful catalyst for mass mobilization. The background information on the 'surge in anti-government protests following the martial law declaration' in late 2024 establishes a clear precedent and a high-energy status quo. The research assistant's report confirms that this momentum continues, with multiple capable actors actively organizing events. The Korean Confederation of Trade Unions (KCTU) is a key player, and their May 1 rally or other actions in the period are highly likely to meet the 10,000-person threshold, which is a relatively low bar for major national protests in Seoul. The existence of other active groups like 'Candlelight Action' and their conservative counterparts creates multiple independent possibilities for a 'Yes' outcome within the two-month timeframe. My probability is not higher than 80% because the timeframe is short, and the outcome is dependent on a single source, the Global Protest Tracker, which may have reporting lags or specific counting methodologies. A sudden de-escalation of political conflict, while unlikely, cannot be entirely ruled out. My probability is not lower because ignoring the powerful combination of a major political crisis, the proven capacity of protest organizers, and specific planned events would be to underweight the clear evidence. I would raise my forecast upon media confirmation that today's May 1 rally exceeded 10,000 participants. I would lower it if there were a significant political truce or if several scheduled events were observed to have weak turnouts.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill the Global Protest Tracker report any protests in South Korea with 10,000+ participants, before July 1, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nACLED December 2024: [South Korea: Anti-government protests surge following martial law declaration](https://acleddata.com/2025/01/15/asia-pacific-overview-january-2025/#keytrends6)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if the [Global Protest Tracker](https://carnegieendowment.org/features/global-protest-tracker?lang=en) reports a protest in South Korea with 10,000 or more participants with a start date after the launch of this question and before July 1, 2025.\n\n\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nMultiple civic and political groups have been actively organizing demonstrations.

Groups such as 'Free Korea' and 'Candlelight Action' have consistently held rallies and counter-rallies in response to political developments.

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
