    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Less than one month, as the G7 summit is scheduled for June 2025 and the current date is June 3, 2025.",
    "status_quo_outcome": "Yes. President Zelenskyy has been formally invited and has a consistent track record of attending key international summits in person to advocate for Ukraine's interests during the war.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "A sudden and severe escalation in the war, such as a major Russian offensive on a strategic target like Kyiv, requires President Zelenskyy to remain in Ukraine for operational and leadership reasons. He may attend virtually, but this would not meet the 'in person' criteria for a 'Yes' outcome.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Security arrangements between Ukraine and Canada are finalized, and the situation on the front lines remains stable enough to permit travel. President Zelenskyy attends the summit in Kananaskis in person to directly engage with G7 leaders, securing further commitments for military and financial aid.",
    "rationale": "My forecast is based heavily on precedent and strategic necessity. President Zelenskyy has attended previous G7 summits in person (Japan 2023, Italy 2024), establishing a clear pattern of personal, high-stakes diplomacy. The G7 is the most critical forum for coordinating support for Ukraine, and a personal appearance is significantly more impactful than a virtual one for building relationships and securing concrete commitments. The invitation from Canada has already been extended. Therefore, there is immense motivation for him to attend. \n\nThe probability is not higher than 90% due to the inherent unpredictability of an active war zone. A significant military crisis, a specific and unmanageable security threat against his person, or an unexpected health issue are low-probability but high-impact events that could prevent his travel. These factors introduce a non-trivial level of uncertainty that must be accounted for.\n\nThe probability is not lower than 90% because the strategic importance of this summit for Ukraine's survival and success is paramount. All parties have a strong incentive to make the visit happen. The security and logistical challenges, while significant, have been successfully managed for similar trips in the past. Barring an acute crisis, his attendance should be considered the default and overwhelmingly likely outcome. I would lower my forecast upon news of a major new Russian offensive or credible intelligence of a high-level security threat. I would raise it if there were a significant de-escalation or a confirmed ceasefire, though this is highly unlikely.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill Volodymyr Zelenskyy attend the G7 Summit in June 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nCalgary Herald: [Prime Minister Carney invites Ukrainian President Zelenskyy to G7 summit in Kananaskis](https://calgaryherald.com/news/local-news/pm-mark-carney-invites-ukrainian-president-volodymyr-zelenskyy-g7-summit-kananaskis)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if Ukrainian President Volodymyr Oleksandrovych Zelenskyy attends in person a G7 summit held in June 2025.\n\n\"In person\" is defined as occupying the same physical space closely enough at the G7 Summit that he can see and hear other heads of state through direct un-intermediated exchange of photons and sound waves.\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nNo additional information available.\n\nToday is 2025-06-03.\n\nBefore answering you think:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n(e) You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
