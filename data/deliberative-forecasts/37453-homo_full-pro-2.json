    "review": "The deliberation revealed a strong consensus among all three forecasters. We all identified the extremely compressed timeline and the multi-step bureaucratic process—specifically, petition submission and signature verification by Elections Alberta—as the primary obstacle to a 'Yes' resolution. The other two forecasters' analyses were highly convincing in their emphasis on this administrative drag as being nearly insurmountable in under two months. Forecaster 3 raised an argument I had not sufficiently weighted: that Premier Danielle Smith has publicly indicated a potential referendum would be held in 2026. This piece of evidence strongly suggests there is no political will to rush the process, making my initial concern about 'political volatility' forcing an early announcement less relevant. Their collective reasoning convinced me that I had overestimated the small chance of a political 'black swan' event and underestimated the concrete, time-consuming nature of the required procedures.",
    "rationale": "I am updating my forecast downward from 10% to 5%. The deliberation with my peers solidified the central argument against a 'Yes' outcome: the timeline is simply too short for the required administrative procedures to be completed. The arguments from the other forecasters were convincing, particularly the point that Premier Smith's own stated timeline for a potential referendum is 2026. This indicates a clear lack of political desire from the government to fast-track this process to meet a pre-July 1, 2025 deadline. My initial forecast of 10% assigned too much weight to the possibility of a political event overriding the concrete, procedural reality of signature verification. The other forecasters correctly identified this bureaucratic step as the primary bottleneck, a hurdle that is almost certain to take more than the 55 days remaining. Adopting a 5% forecast aligns my position with theirs, acknowledging the immense logistical challenges while still accounting for a very remote 'tail risk' of an unprecedented and unexpected political maneuver.",
