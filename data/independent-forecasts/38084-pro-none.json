    "no_outcome_scenario": "The 2024-2025 winter rainy season was wetter than average, building on the surplus from the previous two very wet winters. This kept reservoir levels high and soil moisture sufficient, preventing major population centers from entering 'Moderate Drought' (D1) conditions. As a result, the population in drought remains below the 20 million threshold.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "The 2024-2025 winter was average or, more likely, drier than average. This depleted the water surplus gained in previous years. A warm and dry spring has accelerated the onset of drought conditions, particularly in populous Southern California and the Bay Area, pushing them into the D1 'Moderate Drought' category and driving the total affected population above 20 million.",
    "rationale": "My forecast is based on an assessment of California's volatile hydroclimate, with a one-month horizon until resolution. The outcome on June 28, 2025, is almost entirely dependent on the conditions established by the end of the 2024-2025 winter rainy season.\n\nThe key piece of context is the SF Gate article from May 2024, which indicated a rapid return to drought conditions even after two historically wet years. This suggests an underlying fragility in the system and a low resilience to even short dry periods. No information was provided on the actual outcome of the 2024-2025 winter, which is the primary source of uncertainty.\n\nMy reasoning leans towards a 'Yes' outcome. The 20 million resident threshold is significant, requiring large metropolitan areas to be in at least D1 (Moderate) drought. However, protracted droughts affecting the majority of the population have been common in the last decade. Two consecutive wet winters were beneficial but were anomalies against the backdrop of a longer-term aridification trend. A third consecutive wet winter would be a statistical outlier. Therefore, it is more probable that the 2024-2025 winter was average or dry.\n\nA dry winter would be sufficient to return large portions of Southern California (home to over 20 million people in its main counties) to D1 drought status. The status quo, assuming such a winter has just passed, would therefore be a 'Yes'.\n\nWhy my forecast is not higher: The back-to-back wet winters of 2022-23 and 2023-24 created a substantial water buffer in reservoirs and groundwater. This resilience could slow the return to official drought classifications, even after a moderately dry winter. It's possible that while conditions are worsening, they have not yet crossed the D1 classification threshold for the most populous areas.\n\nWhy my forecast is not lower: A return to a dry pattern is more aligned with California's recent climatic trends. The provided article reinforces the idea that drought returns quickly. Relying on an anomalous third straight wet winter to keep the numbers down would be imprudent forecasting.\n\nI would update my forecast significantly with definitive data on the Sierra Nevada snowpack, statewide reservoir levels, and current Drought Monitor classifications for May 2025.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill California have 20.0 million or more residents living in drought on June 28, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nSF Gate: [California's drought has returned — and it's already bad](https://www.sfgate.com/bayarea/article/california-drought-problem-20271547.php)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if Drought Monitor at [this link](https://www.drought.gov/states/california) lists greater than or equal to 20.0 million California residents in areas of drought, when the link is accessed by Metaculus on or after June 28, 2025. If the number is below that, this question resolves as **No**.\n\nThe question will resolve as soon as the page is accessed by Metaculus Admins on the resolution date. However, if there are issues accessing the page, then resolution will wait up until the end of the tournament's scoring at which point if Metaculus has still not been able to access the resolution source, this question will be **annulled**.\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nNo additional information available.\n\nToday is 2025-05-29.\n\nBefore answering you think:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n(e) You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
