    "review": "Forecaster 2's analysis closely mirrors my original reasoning, emphasizing frontrunner advantage and the limited two-week timeframe. However, Forecaster 3 raises a critical factor that both Forecaster 2 and I substantially underweighted: New York City's Ranked Choice Voting system. This is a major oversight that fundamentally changes the dynamics. In RCV, a polarizing candidate like Cuomo - who carries significant scandal baggage from his resignation - may struggle to receive second-choice rankings even if leading in first-choice votes. If Mamdani consolidates the progressive lane and receives most second-choice transfers from other progressive candidates, he could win in later rounds despite trailing initially. This dynamic explains why a narrowing lead could be more dangerous for Cuomo than in a traditional plurality system. Forecaster 3's emphasis on transfer dynamics, progressive consolidation potential, and Cuomo's polarizing profile under RCV is persuasive. However, 42% seems slightly too pessimistic given that Cuomo is still reportedly the frontrunner with superior name recognition and establishment connections.",
    "rationale": "After reviewing the other forecasters' analyses, I need to significantly account for NYC's Ranked Choice Voting system, which I inadequately considered initially. Cuomo's polarizing nature post-scandal makes him vulnerable to poor performance in transfer rounds even if he leads in first preferences. Progressive voters are unlikely to rank him at all, and even moderate voters may skip him if they prefer other centrist candidates first. The narrowing trend suggests real momentum for Mamdani, who could consolidate progressive second-choice votes. However, I'm not dropping as low as 42% because: (1) Cuomo still appears to lead according to available information, (2) his universal name recognition is a powerful advantage in a short timeframe, (3) we lack specific polling data showing he's actually behind or in a statistical tie, and (4) overcoming an established frontrunner in 15 days requires exceptional circumstances. The RCV dynamics create meaningful uncertainty that pushes my forecast down from 65%, but Cuomo's existing advantages prevent me from rating him as more likely to lose than win.",
