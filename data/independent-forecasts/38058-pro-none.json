    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Approximately five weeks, until July 1, 2025.",
    "status_quo_outcome": "The word 'tariff' continues to feature regularly on the front pages of one or both newspapers due to its central role in the current administration's economic policy, leading to a 'No' resolution.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "The Trump administration's focus on trade policy continues to generate daily headlines. Ongoing negotiations with trade partners like China or the EU, threats of new tariffs, or retaliatory measures from other countries ensure the topic is mentioned on the front page of either The New York Times or the Wall Street Journal every day through June 30, 2025.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "A major, non-economic breaking news story—such as a large-scale natural disaster, a significant international conflict escalation, or a major domestic political event unrelated to trade—dominates the news cycle for at least one day, pushing any mention of tariffs off the front pages of both newspapers simultaneously. This could also occur on a particularly slow news day, such as a holiday or weekend.",
    "rationale": "My forecast is based on the high likelihood that tariffs will remain a persistent front-page topic, balanced against the statistical chance of a quiet news day over the 42-day resolution period. The primary factor supporting a 'No' vote is the status quo: the question background indicates that tariffs are a central and active policy of the sitting US President. Major presidential policies are a constant source of news, analysis, and debate, making them highly prevalent on the front pages of national newspapers like the NYT and the business-focused WSJ. The resolution criteria are broad, counting any mention of 'tariff(s)' anywhere on the page, including the WSJ's 'What's News' summary section, which makes avoiding the word very difficult. The status quo strongly suggests the topic will appear daily. However, for the question to resolve 'No', this must happen every single day for 42 consecutive days. The primary factor supporting a 'Yes' vote is this long duration, which provides many opportunities for an anomaly. The news cycle is volatile. A single day dominated by a different, massive breaking story could be enough to clear both front pages of the word. My probability of 19% reflects that the 'Yes' outcome is unlikely but certainly not impossible. My forecast is not lower because a 42-day period provides a reasonable chance for a random event to interrupt the normal news cycle. It is not higher because the 'tariff' topic is a core, ongoing policy of the administration and the bar for its appearance is very low, making its complete absence from two major front pages on the same day a rare event.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill the word \"tariff\" disappear from the front pages of The New York Times and Wall Street Journal before July 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nWhether reading the newspaper or social media or watching the news, it is highly likely you are going to see something about tariffs - mainly due to US President Donald Trump's [renewed love](https://www.france24.com/en/live-news/20250401-tariff-man-trump-s-long-history-with-trade-wars) for this somewhat antiquated form of taxation.\r\n\r\nThe New York Times and the Wall Street Journal are two of the largest print newspapers in the US. Before July, will we see tariffs wiped from the front pages of both papers?\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question will resolve as **Yes** if, on any single day after May 19, 2025 and before July 1, 2025, the words \"tariff\" or \"tariffs\" appear on neither the digital version of the front page of The New York Times nor the Wall Street Journal. The following URLs will be used to resolve the question:\r\n\r\n* The New York Times: [https://www.nytimes.com/section/todayspaper](https://www.nytimes.com/section/todayspaper)\r\n* Wall Street Journal: [https://www.wsj.com/print-edition/20250515/frontpage](https://www.wsj.com/print-edition/20250515/frontpage)\r\n\r\n***\r\n\r\n<sup>Note: WSJ front page URL for May 15, 2025. Format is: yyyy-mm-dd.</sup>\n\n* Grammar or spelling will not prevent a **No** resolution.\r\n* \"Tariff(s)\" must be omitted from both papers' front pages on the same day.\r\n* \"Tariff(s)\" can appear anywhere on the page, including \"Pages A2-A3 and Corrections\", \"What's News: Business & Finance\" not just the initial section at the top. The only sections that do not qualify are those that do not change between different front pages such as the \"Most Popular News\" or \"Recommended Videos\" sections on WSJ.\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nNo additional information available.\n\nToday is 2025-05-26.\n\nBefore answering you think:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n(e) You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
