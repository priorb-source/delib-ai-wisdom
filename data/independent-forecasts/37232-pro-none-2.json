    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Approximately one month, with the outcome determined on June 1, 2025.",
    "status_quo_outcome": "Yes. The company's last news post was three months ago on January 30, 2025. If this period of no communication continues, there will be no post in May.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "As a publicly-traded company, Virgin Galactic releases quarterly financial results. Following its established historical pattern, it will post its Q1 2025 earnings announcement to its News page in early or mid-May 2025.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Virgin Galactic breaks from its typical schedule and delays its Q1 2025 earnings announcement until June, or it changes its website strategy and no longer posts financial results on its general News page, and no other newsworthy events occur during the month.",
    "rationale": "The primary factor in this forecast is Virgin Galactic's obligation as a publicly-traded company to report quarterly financial results. Historically, the company announces its first-quarter results in early May (the Q1 2024 results were released on May 7, 2024) and posts the official press release on the News page in question. This creates a very strong, time-bound forcing function for a news post in May 2025, which would result in a 'No' outcome. While the current three-month gap in posts represents the status quo and points towards 'Yes', this reflects a lack of discretionary news, not the highly regular cadence of mandatory financial reporting. My forecast is not higher because the quarterly reporting cycle is one of the most predictable events in corporate communications. My forecast is not lower than 10% to account for the small but real possibility of an unexpected delay in the earnings release into June, or a sudden change in their web strategy where financial news is no longer posted to this specific page. My forecast would increase with any news suggesting the earnings call is scheduled for June or later. Conversely, it would decrease upon confirmation of a May date for the earnings release.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill Virgin Galactic fail to make any new posts on its News page in May 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nAs of April 19, 2025, Virgin Galactic's most recent post was timestamped January 30, 2025. The most recent one before then was December 12, 2024.\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if no new posts appear at Virgin Galactic's News page, which can be accessed at [this address](https://www.virgingalactic.com/news), timestamped after April 30, 2025 and before June 1, 2025. If there is a new post, then this question resolves as **No**.\n\n\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nNo additional information available.\n\nToday is 2025-04-29.\n\nBefore answering you think:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n(e) You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
