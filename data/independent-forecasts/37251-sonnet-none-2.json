    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "2 months (from May 1, 2025 to July 1, 2025)",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No - negotiations continue without reaching an announced agreement by the deadline",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Defense negotiations extend beyond July 1, 2025 due to their complexity, geopolitical sensitivities regarding China's potential concerns, financing complications, or Vietnam exploring alternative suppliers. The deal requires extensive technical and legal review that cannot be completed within the 2-month window.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "The negotiations that are reportedly already underway reach a successful conclusion within the next 2 months. Both governments, eager to mark this milestone as South Korea's first defense sale to Vietnam and showcase their upgraded strategic partnership, make a formal announcement of the K9 howitzer export agreement before July 1, 2025.",
    "rationale": "The Korea Herald reports negotiations are already underway for 20 K9 howitzers valued at $300 million, suggesting this isn't starting from zero. Both countries have clear strategic incentives: South Korea seeks to expand its defense export market, while Vietnam wants to modernize its military capabilities. This would be a milestone first defense sale between these nations. However, my research assistant found no additional information, suggesting no recent progress. Major defense deals typically involve complex technical, financial, and political negotiations that often extend beyond initial timelines. A $300 million first-of-its-kind agreement requires careful vetting, parliamentary or governmental approvals, and consideration of regional sensitivities (particularly China's potential reaction to Vietnam's military modernization). While 2 months isn't impossibly short for concluding negotiations already in progress, it's a tight timeline for such a significant agreement. The status quo bias strongly suggests that without evidence of negotiations being near conclusion, most deals don't finalize within any given 2-month window. The forecast isn't higher because we lack evidence of how advanced negotiations are or any momentum toward conclusion. It isn't lower because negotiations are explicitly reported as active, both sides have strong incentives, and the deal parameters appear defined. I would revise upward with news of imminent signing ceremonies, high-level diplomatic visits focused on defense cooperation, or statements indicating agreement is close. I would revise downward if negotiations stall, alternative suppliers emerge, or geopolitical complications arise.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill Vietnam and South Korea announce an agreement for South Korea to export self-propelled howitzers to Vietnam?\n\nQuestion background:\nThe Korea Herald: [South Korea-Vietnam ties enter new strategic terrain, but need more detailed road map: Seoul envoy](https://www.koreaherald.com/article/10464718) \"Vietnam is reportedly in negotiations to import 20 units of K9 self-propelled howitzers from Korea in a deal valued at $300 million. If finalized, it would mark Korea’s first defense arms sale to the country.\"\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if, before July 1, 2025, the governments of Vietnam and/or South Korea announce an agreement for South Korea to export 2 or more self-propelled howitzers to Vietnam. If no such agreement is announced after the launch of this question and before July 1, 2025, this question resolves as **No**.\n\n\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nNo additional information available.\n\nToday is 2025-05-01.\n\nBefore answering you think:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n(e) You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
