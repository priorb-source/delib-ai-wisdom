    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Approximately 26 days until July 1, 2025, when the question resolves",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No announcement. Based on the March 2025 reporting that Uruguay's participation was 'still up in the air' and the apparent absence of any announcement through early June, the status quo suggests continued uncertainty trending toward non-announcement",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Uruguay decides not to attend the BRICS summit or simply fails to announce a decision before July 1. This could occur due to domestic political concerns about appearing aligned with BRICS, Uruguay's traditional pro-Western foreign policy orientation, internal government disagreements about diplomatic implications, or the government simply running out of time to make a decision",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Uruguay announces President Orsi will attend the summit, likely in late June. This would occur if Uruguay decides the diplomatic and economic benefits of engaging with BRICS members outweigh concerns, particularly given pressure from Brazil (a major trading partner and neighbor) and President Lula's personal invitation. The announcement could come at the last minute as Uruguay balances various domestic and international considerations",
    "rationale": "Several factors inform this forecast. First, timing is critical - we're now in early June with only 26 days until the resolution deadline, yet no announcement appears to have been made since the March reporting indicated uncertainty. This suggests significant hesitation or lack of commitment. Second, Uruguay historically maintains a cautious, pro-Western foreign policy stance, and attending a BRICS summit could signal an unwanted geopolitical shift. Third, the status quo bias strongly favors the current state of non-announcement, as the world changes slowly and three months of uncertainty suggest inertia. However, I cannot go too low because: (1) there's still sufficient time for a last-minute announcement; (2) Brazil's diplomatic influence as Uruguay's major neighbor and trading partner is substantial; (3) the Frente Amplio government under Orsi might be more open to BRICS engagement than previous administrations; and (4) governments often delay sensitive foreign policy announcements until necessary. The lack of information from the research assistant reinforces the status quo interpretation - if something significant had occurred, we'd likely know. For me to revise upward, I'd need evidence of positive momentum toward attendance or diplomatic signals suggesting an imminent announcement. To revise downward, I'd need explicit statements declining the invitation or clearer signs that the window has effectively closed. Given the narrow remaining timeframe, traditional policy caution, and lack of movement over three months, I assess this as unlikely but not implausible",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill the government of Uruguay announce that its president, Yamandú Orsi, will attend the BRICS summit in July 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\n[Lula invites Mexico, Colombia, and Uruguay to BRICS Summit](https://en.mercopress.com/2025/03/04/lula-invites-mexico-colombia-and-uruguay-to-brics-summit#google_vignette) | [Uruguay’s participation at the BRICS summit still up in the air](https://www.plenglish.com/news/2025/03/02/uruguays-participation-at-the-brics-summit-still-up-in-the-air/)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if before July 1, 2025 the government of Uruguay, or anyone speaking on its behalf, issues any sort of public communication (written or oral) confirming its acceptance of the invitation for President Yamandú Orsi to attend in person the BRICS Summit scheduled to take place in Rio de Janeiro in July 2025.\n\nSince the summit will be held after this question resolves, actual attendance is not required, merely the announcement of plans to attend.\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nNo additional information available.\n\nToday is 2025-06-05.\n\nBefore answering you think:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n(e) You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
