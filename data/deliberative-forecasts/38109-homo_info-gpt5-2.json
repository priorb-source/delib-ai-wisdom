    "review": "Both forecasters added helpful context I underweighted. Forecaster 2’s point that Kalshi has been posting daily MLB since mid‑April and that sports are now a core volume driver strengthens the continuity baseline. Forecaster 3’s emphasis on automation and pre-scheduling makes an uninterrupted daily cadence more plausible, and the observation that the active litigation focus is on elections (not sports) reduces the likelihood of a June sports-specific halt. I still think both may be a bit light on the risk that any adverse legal signal (Nevada ruling, broader CFTC posture) could prompt a short, platform-wide pause affecting all sports for at least a day; and the strict “every day” criterion keeps compounding/operational tail risk nontrivial. But their arguments justify moving up from my initial conservatism.",
    "rationale": "Updating upward for: (1) two months of demonstrated daily MLB listings and sports focus implying strong incentives to maintain continuity; (2) feasibility of pre-listing all June games, which materially reduces operational/day-of listing risk; (3) likely ability to geofence Nevada if needed rather than pausing nationally. Remaining discount for: (a) small but real chance of a platform-wide precautionary pause triggered by a legal development in June; (b) low-probability, high-impact outage covering an entire day; (c) residual CFTC rulemaking/enforcement uncertainty around sports contracts. Net effect: raise from 58% to 74%.",
