  "information": "Zimbabwe faces significant economic and political challenges that could affect the compensation timeline. The government allocated $10 million in its 2025 national budget for the payments, leaving a balance of $6.9 million after the April disbursement. The country is grappling with a severe economic crisis, including a poor 2024/25 agricultural season due to drought, which has worsened food insecurity. While the country experienced a slight deflation in March 2025, it continues to face liquidity issues. There is also opposition to the compensation plan; a majority of former farmers have reportedly not signed the agreement and still hold their title deeds. Furthermore, a government proposal to raise funds through a US$500 per hectare levy on current land beneficiaries has been rejected by groups such as the Zimbabwe People's Revolutionary Army (ZPRA) ex-combatants.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Approximately 39 days (from April 23, 2025 to June 1, 2025)",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No additional payment is made. The status quo is that Zimbabwe continues to face economic constraints and does not make another disbursement beyond the April 9 payment before the deadline.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Zimbabwe's severe economic crisis, liquidity issues, and drought-induced agricultural failures prevent the government from making another payment despite the allocated budget. Political opposition from farmers who haven't signed the agreement and rejection of funding mechanisms delay or halt additional disbursements.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Zimbabwe leverages the remaining $6.9 million from its allocated $10 million budget to make another payment within the next 5-6 weeks, continuing the momentum from the April 9 payment and demonstrating sustained commitment to the 2020 Global Compensation Deed as part of its debt sustainability strategy.",
    "rationale": "Key considerations favor a moderate probability for Yes. Zimbabwe made a $3.1 million payment just 14 days ago (April 9), immediately followed by a reaffirmation of commitment on April 10. This very recent activity suggests this is an active policy priority, not a dormant issue. The government allocated $10 million for 2025, leaving $6.9 million available, and the timing suggests they may be planning staged payments rather than a one-time disbursement. However, several factors constrain the probability from being higher: Zimbabwe faces severe economic crisis with liquidity issues, a poor agricultural season due to drought, and food insecurity concerns. Opposition remains significant—most former farmers haven't signed the agreement, and funding mechanisms (like the proposed levy) have been rejected. The short timeframe (39 days) means bureaucratic processes must move quickly. While status quo bias typically favors no change, the extremely recent payment activity (within 2 weeks) is a strong counter-signal that work is actively ongoing. For me to revise upward, I would need evidence of: specific plans for additional payments, further budget releases, or public statements about near-term disbursements. For a downward revision, I would need signs of worsening economic conditions, political instability, or explicit delays announced. Balancing the recent momentum against economic constraints and typical government payment cadences, I estimate a 35% probability.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill the Zimbabwe, before June 1, 2025, make another payment to white farmers whose property was seized?\n\nQuestion background:\n[Zimbabwe reaffirms commitment to land compensation to spur growth, debt sustainability](https://www.thestar.com.my/news/world/2025/04/10/zimbabwe-reaffirms-commitment-to-land-compensation-to-spur-growth-debt-sustainability)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if, according to [credible sources](https://www.metaculus.com/faq/#definitions) the government of Zimbabwe after the launch of this question and before June 1, 2025 makes an additional payment to former farmers covered under the 2020 Global Compensation Deed.\n\nOn April 9, 2025, Zimbabwe [was reported](https://nehandaradio.com/2025/04/09/zimbabwe-pays-us3-1m-to-former-white-farmers-as-part-of-land-compensation-deal/) to have made its first compensation payment, of USD $3.1 million. Additional such disbursements made after the launch of this question and before June 1, 2025 would count.\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nZimbabwe faces significant economic and political challenges that could affect the compensation timeline.

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower.
