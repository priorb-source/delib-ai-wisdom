  "information": "On January 20, 2025, U.S. President Donald Trump signed Executive Order 14172, ordering the renaming of the U.S. continental shelf off the coasts of Texas, Louisiana, Mississippi, Alabama, and Florida to the 'Gulf of America'. Subsequently, he declared February 9 as the 'Day of the Gulf of America'. In response, several U.S. federal agencies have begun using the new name. The National Hurricane Center (NHC) updated its website graphics and tropical weather bulletins to use 'Gulf of America', and the U.S. Coast Guard has used the term in an official press release.",

    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "54 days until July 1, 2025",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No - WorldAtlas.com continues displaying 'Gulf of Mexico' on their North America page",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "WorldAtlas.com maintains the internationally recognized name 'Gulf of Mexico' on their maps, treating the U.S. executive order as a political designation that doesn't override established geographic naming conventions. As a private entity with international readership, they prioritize globally accepted nomenclature over U.S.-specific terminology.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "WorldAtlas.com updates their North America page to reflect current U.S. government usage, either replacing 'Gulf of Mexico' with 'Gulf of America' or displaying both names (e.g., 'Gulf of America (formerly Gulf of Mexico)'). They do this to acknowledge the significant U.S. government policy change and maintain relevance with American users.",
    "rationale": "The key evidence is that President Trump's executive order from January 20, 2025, has led several U.S. federal agencies to adopt 'Gulf of America' in official materials. However, approximately 3.5 months have passed since the order, and WorldAtlas.com has not yet updated their North America map page, though their article title shows awareness of the alternate name. Critical factors favoring No: (1) WorldAtlas is a private commercial entity with no legal obligation to follow U.S. executive orders, (2) 'Gulf of Mexico' remains the internationally recognized name, particularly by Mexico and international hydrographic organizations, (3) sufficient time has elapsed without change despite their awareness. Factors favoring Yes: (1) WorldAtlas.com has already acknowledged the alternate name in article titles, suggesting some editorial flexibility, (2) as a U.S.-based website, they may prioritize U.S. government usage, (3) the question allows for dual naming, which would be an easy compromise. The fact that no change occurred in 3.5 months is strong evidence for maintaining the status quo, but their acknowledgment in article titles and 54 remaining days leave room for a last-minute update. I forecast 25% probability - not higher because the lengthy inaction suggests editorial resistance to the change and preference for international standards; not lower because their article titles show awareness and willingness to acknowledge the controversy. I would update higher if evidence emerges of WorldAtlas updating other maps, or lower if they make a statement supporting traditional naming conventions.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill WorldAtlas.com display the body of water northwest of the Caribbean Sea as the Gulf of America before July 1, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nWorld Atlas article: [Gulf Of Mexico (Gulf of America)](https://www.worldatlas.com/gulfs/gulf-of-mexico.html)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if, before July 1, 2025, the World Atlas website at its [North America](https://www.worldatlas.com/webimage/countrys/na.htm) page displays the body of water west of Florida, south of Louisiana and north of the Yucatán Peninsula as the Gulf of America. (At the time of this question, the name displayed is the Gulf of Mexico.)\n\nIn case both names are used, for example \"Gulf of America formerly known as Gulf of Mexico,\" this question resolves as Yes. Note that verification will be from Metaculus admins accessing the webpage from the United States and that therefore resolution will be based on how the page appears when accessed from that location.\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nOn January 20, 2025, U.S. President Donald Trump signed Executive Order 14172, ordering the renaming of the U.S. continental shelf off the coasts of Texas, Louisiana, Mississippi, Alabama, and Florida to the 'Gulf of America'.

The National Hurricane Center (NHC) updated its website graphics and tropical weather bulletins to use 'Gulf of America', and the U.S. Coast Guard has used the term in an official press release.\n\nToday is 2025-05-08.\n\nBefore answering you think:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n(e) You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
