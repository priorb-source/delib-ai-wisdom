  "information": "Several DJIA components have experienced recent negative performance and events. UnitedHealth Group's stock dropped 22%, causing a record 805-point single-stock decline in the DJIA. In March 2025, Nike's stock dropped 20.1%, Walt Disney's fell 13.3%, and Nvidia's declined 13.2%. IBM shares fell 7.6% after the company announced the cancellation of 15 government contracts. IBM (-6.6%) and Procter & Gamble (-3.7%) have also experienced recent losses.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "About 67 days (until July 1, 2025)",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No change announced; all current 30 companies remain in the DJIA through June.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "The S&P Dow Jones Indices committee makes no press release about constituent changes before July 1, 2025. Short-term stock volatility (e.g., in UNH, NKE, DIS, NVDA, IBM, PG) does not trigger action, and there are no major corporate actions (splits, spin-offs, mergers) that force a rebalance.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "S&P Dow Jones Indices announces a swap such as: Boeing being replaced due to protracted operational crises; Verizon being replaced to boost Communication Services exposure with a higher-priced name; 3M being replaced by a more representative industrial; or any other constituent removed to address sector balance or after a large corporate action. Any official announcement before July 1 resolves the question as Yes regardless of the effective date.",
    "rationale": "Base rate: Over the past decade the DJIA has seen changes in 2015 (1), 2018 (1), 2020 (3), and 2024 (2) — roughly 0.7 changes per year. Over a ~0.18-year window (Apr 25–Jul 1), a simple Poisson approximation implies about a 12% chance of at least one change (1 − e^(−0.7*0.18) ≈ 0.12).\n\nContextual factors: The committee does not operate on a fixed schedule; changes are typically catalyzed by notable corporate actions (e.g., stock splits that alter sector weightings) or a judgment that a company no longer well represents its sector. While several current components have seen negative headlines or declines (UNH −22% on a day; NKE −20%; DIS −13%; NVDA −13%; IBM −7.6%; PG −3.7%), these are largely short-term moves and, by themselves, are not typical triggers for removal. Recent substantial refreshes (two changes in 2024) modestly reduce near-term likelihood of further tweaks, absent a clear catalyst.\n\nWhy not higher: The window is short (about two months), DJIA changes are infrequent and often tied to specific catalysts (splits, mergers, spin-offs) or prolonged deterioration in representation, not brief price moves. No widely telegraphed corporate actions among constituents currently demand a rebalance.\n\nWhy not lower: There are plausible candidates and rationales (e.g., Boeing’s ongoing operational crisis; potential desire to adjust Communication Services or Industrial exposure; replacement of a low-price, low-weight component like Verizon with a higher-priced, more representative name). The committee has shown willingness to act when representation is judged suboptimal, and multiple changes occurred as recently as 2024.\n\nUpdate triggers upward: - Credible reporting or S&P DJI hints of a review; - Major corporate action by a constituent (large split, spin-off, merger) that distorts sector weights; - A severe, reputation-damaging event for a component (e.g., Boeing) or sustained collapse suggesting it no longer represents its sector.\n\nUpdate triggers downward: - Explicit statements from S&P DJI indicating no near-term changes; - Stabilization and positive news flow for most-likely candidates; - Passing key dates with no announcements.\n\nResearch assistant input: The noted price declines (UNH, NKE, DIS, NVDA, IBM, PG) inform awareness of potential candidates, but these are insufficient on their own to expect a change; hence they exert only a small upward nudge from a pure base-rate estimate.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill any of these companies get dropped from the Dow Jones Industrial Average before July 1, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nOregon Business: [Intel Ousted From Dow Jones By Rival Nvidia](https://oregonbusiness.com/intel-ousted-from-dow-jones-by-rival-nvidia/)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if before July 1, 2025, there is any official announcement or confirmation (or credible source reporting) that any of the following companies will no longer be a component of the Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA) either on the official announcement or that the company has been or will be removed from the index: Amazon.com Inc, American Express Co, Amgen Inc, Apple Inc, Boeing Co, Caterpillar Inc, Cisco Systems Inc, Chevron Corp, Goldman Sachs Group Inc, Home Depot Inc, Honeywell International Inc, International Business Machines Corp, Johnson & Johnson, Coca-Cola Co, JPMorgan Chase & Co, McDonald’s Corp, 3M Co, Merck & Co Inc, Microsoft Corp, Nike Inc, Procter & Gamble Co, Sherwin-Williams Co, Travelers Companies Inc, Unitedhealth Group Inc, Salesforce Inc, NVIDIA Corp, Verizon Communications Inc, Visa Inc, Walmart Inc, Walt Disney Co.\n\nAlthough removals from the index are generally effective immediately in order to forestall frontrunning, this is not a requirement for this question. All that is required is for there to be an announcement or confirmation before the resolution date about the removal from the DJIA at any point in time. Therefore this question will resolve based on the announcement or confirmation, not on the actual removal date.\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nSeveral DJIA components have experienced recent negative performance and events. UnitedHealth Group's stock dropped 22%, causing a record 805-point single-stock decline in the DJIA. In March 2025, Nike's stock dropped 20.1%, Walt Disney's fell 13.3%, and Nvidia's declined 13.2%. IBM shares fell 7.6% after the company announced the cancellation of 15 government contracts. IBM (-6.6%) and Procter & Gamble (-3.7%) have also experienced recent losses.\n\nToday is 2025-04-25.\n\nBefore answering you think:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n(e) You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
