    "review": "Both analyses are well-reasoned and broadly consistent with my initial take. They emphasize the 7-day SMA damping, short runway, base-rate levels (Ishiba likely in high-30s/low-40s; Starmer mid-to-high 30s), and the tie-resolves-No rule. The incremental arguments I hadn’t foregrounded were a bit more specificity on near-term event risk in Japan (yen/BoJ dynamics, lingering LDP funding issues) that could nick Ishiba a few points. I find their reasoning credible; however, neither provides concrete evidence that Starmer is already close or ahead, so I still weight the status quo slightly more. Their slightly higher probabilities (41–42%) suggest a narrower assumed gap than I had. I accept some of that and make a modest upward adjustment.",
    "rationale": "Time remaining is about one month, and Morning Consult’s 7-day SMA implies limited volatility. The most plausible status quo is Ishiba narrowly ahead of Starmer. If nothing meaningful changes, that resolves to No, and ties also resolve to No. That said, downside risk for Ishiba over the next month (yen weakness/BoJ tightening narrative, LDP controversies) is somewhat higher than upside risk for Starmer, and only a small swing may be needed. I therefore modestly raise my estimate to reflect a non-trivial chance of Ishiba erosion or a small Starmer uptick being enough to flip the ordering, while still keeping No as the base case given inertia and the tie rule.",
