  "information": "National polling data shows support for Reform UK at approximately 23-25%. A March MRP poll by The Telegraph provided data for the region. The party has confirmed it is running a full slate of candidates across Derbyshire. Political scientist Professor John Curtice has noted that Reform UK's voter support may be more geographically concentrated than widely distributed.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "About 10–14 days (election on 1 May 2025; results likely by 2–3 May).",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No — Labour (or possibly the Conservatives) wins the most seats; Reform UK does not.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Labour becomes the largest party on the council, with Conservatives second. Reform UK fields a full slate and lifts its vote share but converts few votes into seats due to first-past-the-post, incumbency, and weaker local organisation, ending with only a small handful of divisions (or none).",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Reform UK’s support proves highly concentrated in ex‑industrial and outer‑urban divisions (e.g., parts of Bolsover, Amber Valley, North East Derbyshire, Erewash). In a three‑way split, Reform edges ahead with pluralities across many such divisions, winning on low-30s vote shares and surpassing both Labour and the Conservatives to become the largest group.",
    "rationale": "Baseline: Derbyshire County Council (64 single‑member divisions) has historically been contested mainly between Labour and the Conservatives; the latter currently control the council after a strong 2021 result. Under FPTP, translating national vote share into county seats requires concentrated support and local organisation. Reform UK starts from a very low base of councillors and relatively limited local infrastructure.\n\nEvidence: The research assistant notes Reform polling c.23–25% nationally, a Telegraph MRP showing regional strength, and a full slate in Derbyshire. John Curtice’s observation that Reform’s vote may be geographically concentrated is relevant, as concentration can improve seat efficiency. However, MRPs are built for Westminster constituencies and are a weak guide to single‑member county divisions. Historical precedent also matters: at its peak, UKIP posted strong national shares in county elections and won some seats, but it did not become the largest party in county councils. Recent local by‑election performance for Reform has generally shown vote gains but limited seat wins, consistent with difficult seat conversion.\n\nStatus quo pull: In local elections, established parties with incumbents, name recognition, and ground game usually dominate. Given national Conservative weakness, Labour is favored to be the largest party in Derbyshire; Reform’s pathway to topping the seat count would require an unusually efficient, locally concentrated surge across many divisions simultaneously.\n\nWhy not higher: Lack of proven local seat‑winning capability, FPTP inefficiency for new parties, incumbency advantages for Labour/Conservatives, and the rarity (near absence) of insurgent right parties becoming the largest group on a county council.\n\nWhy not lower: Current Reform polling is historically high; a full slate maximizes opportunities; Derbyshire has multiple working‑class areas where Reform could top tight three‑way contests if its support concentrates and turnout patterns favor them. A late campaign momentum or unusual vote-splitting could yield more seats than typical models expect.\n\nWhat would move me up: Credible ward‑level polling/canvass data showing Reform leads across a wide swath of divisions; strong, widespread local endorsements/defections; consistent eve‑of‑poll evidence (or early counts) of Reform topping multiple Derbyshire divisions.\n\nWhat would move me down: Continued evidence from contemporaneous local by‑elections or early 1 May results elsewhere showing Reform underperforming in seat conversion; indications of organisational shortfalls (missing leaflets, low canvass volumes) or candidate issues in key divisions.",

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower.
