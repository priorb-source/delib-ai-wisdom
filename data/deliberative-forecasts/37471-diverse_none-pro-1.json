    "review": "All three forecasters correctly identify that reaching 550,000 units by May 2025 requires a historically rapid 10% increase (+50k units) in just three months from the 500k February baseline. I found Forecaster 3's analysis particularly convincing. They raised two crucial points I had not sufficiently weighted: 1) The required average monthly increase (~17k) is exceptionally large compared to the series' typical low single-digit thousand monthly changes. 2) The argument for a seasonal spring inventory build-up is weak; in fact, Forecaster 3 notes the spring selling season can draw down inventory, a point supported by FRED data for this period in 2023 and 2024. Forecaster 2's reasoning was similar to my initial take but, like me, seemed to overweight the general upward momentum without scrutinizing the historical month-to-month volatility and recent seasonal patterns.",
    "rationale": "I am significantly lowering my forecast from 35% to 15%. My initial analysis was too heavily influenced by the narrative of a 'surge' in new homes for sale. While the year-over-year trend is strong, the deliberation highlighted that the month-to-month changes required to reach 550k are an order of magnitude larger than what is typical for this data series. The most compelling new evidence brought up by Forecaster 3 is the recent seasonal pattern. In both 2023 and 2024, inventory levels actually decreased between February and May. This runs directly counter to a primary argument for the 'Yes' scenario. This new information, combined with the reinforced argument that rational home builders will actively manage their inventory pipeline to prevent a glut, makes a 50,000-unit increase in a single quarter appear far less likely. The 'Yes' outcome is still possible, but would likely require a significant negative demand shock that overwhelms both builder reactions and typical seasonal sales patterns.",
