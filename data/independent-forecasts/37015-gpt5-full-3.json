  "information": "Han Duck-soo is required by law to resign from his post as acting president by May 4, 2025, to be eligible for the presidential election. He has already missed the April 15 deadline to register for the People Power Party (PPP) primary. Consequently, PPP leadership has publicly stated he will not be included in their primary process. South Korean constitutional norms and historical precedent discourage caretaker heads of state from running for office.\n\nMultiple polls conducted in April 2025 show Han Duck-soo's public support ranging between 2% and 12%. Lee Jae-myung of the opposition Democratic Party leads in polls with approximately 46% support. One poll from April 20 indicated that 66% of respondents found Han's potential candidacy 'unacceptable'. Despite low public support, a faction within the People Power Party, with reports of over 50 lawmakers and a 'National Candidate Support Committee', are actively urging him to run.\n\nIn multiple public statements and interviews with news outlets such as the Financial Times and Yonhap in late April 2025, Han Duck-soo has consistently maintained that he 'has not yet decided' on a presidential run. His stated immediate priority is the US-South Korea trade negotiations scheduled for April 24. No visible campaign infrastructure or preparations for a presidential bid have been observed.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "About 13 days (until May 5, 2025)",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Han maintains his caretaker role, does not resign by May 4, reiterates that he remains undecided or rules out a run, and the PPP proceeds with its primary nominees. No formal candidacy announcement is made before May 5.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "A late pivot by PPP leaders and lawmakers coalesces around drafting Han as a unity candidate. He announces his candidacy publicly (press conference or formal statement) by May 3–4 and likely resigns that day to meet eligibility rules.",
    "rationale": "Baseline favors inaction. He has missed the PPP primary registration (Apr 15) and party leaders say he will not be included. As acting president, running violates norms and would require a high-cost resignation by May 4 to be eligible. Polls show weak support (roughly 2–12%) and a large share (about two-thirds in one poll) view his potential bid as unacceptable. He has repeatedly said he has not decided and there is no visible campaign infrastructure. These factors make a near-term announcement unlikely and point to a No by default. Countervailing factors: a meaningful PPP faction (reports of 50+ lawmakers and a National Candidate Support Committee) is urging him to run, and media coverage suggests momentum to draft him. If party elites decide their alternatives are weaker against Lee Jae-myung and move to rapidly anoint Han—overriding earlier process statements—he could announce and resign at the last minute. Why not higher: legal and temporal constraints (must resign by May 4), missed primary, weak polls, strong public resistance, and the reputational costs of a caretaker running all inhibit a decision in the next ~13 days. Why not lower: the coordinated draft effort and fluidity of a crisis election create a nontrivial tail where elites engineer a fast pivot and Han accepts. What would move me up: concrete signs of party rule-bending or endorsement, creation of campaign infrastructure, scheduling of a resignation, or Han shifting language from “undecided” to signaling intent. What would move me down: PPP consolidating around another candidate, explicit denial from Han, or reaffirmation of procedural barriers by party leadership or the election commission.",

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
