  "information": "In late April 2025, during a series of town hall meetings, Beto O'Rourke stated that he would consider running for the U.S. Senate if it aligns with the desires of Texas voters. Quoted in multiple outlets such as Fox News, The Hill, and Yahoo, he said, 'If it comes to pass that this is what the people of Texas want, that it's the highest and best use of what I can give to you, then yes, I will.' As of late May 2025, O'Rourke had not filed any formal candidacy papers with the FEC and no campaign infrastructure or exploratory committee was visible. He continues his work with the voter mobilization organization 'Powered by People,' which he founded in 2019.\n\nThe 2026 Texas U.S. Senate election features incumbent Republican Senator John Cornyn seeking a fifth term. Cornyn faces a primary challenge from Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton, who has already announced his campaign. On the Democratic side, while O'Rourke is publicly considering a run, other figures like former Congressman Colin Allred have also been mentioned as potential candidates, though none had formally entered the race as of late May 2025.\n\nHistorical timelines for major Texas campaigns show variation. For the 2024 Senate race, Democrat Colin Allred announced his candidacy in May 2023, 17 months before the election. Beto O'Rourke's own record includes announcing his 2018 Senate bid 20 months early (March 2017) and his 2022 gubernatorial run 12 months early (November 2021). The question's deadline of July 1, 2025, is approximately 16 months prior to the November 2026 general election.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Approximately 1 month. The question resolves on July 1, 2025.",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No. As of today, May 22, 2025, Beto O'Rourke has not announced a candidacy for the US Senate. If nothing changes by the deadline, the outcome will be No.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "O'Rourke continues to gauge support through his 'Powered by People' organization but concludes that either the enthusiasm or fundraising potential isn't strong enough for another statewide run. He may also be deterred by another strong Democrat signaling a run. The July 1, 2025 deadline passes without any formal announcement.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Seeing a divisive Republican primary battle between John Cornyn and Ken Paxton as a key opportunity, O'Rourke capitalizes on the positive feedback from his recent town halls. He makes a formal announcement in June 2025, seeking to consolidate Democratic support and begin fundraising early, consistent with his past campaign timelines.",
    "rationale": "My forecast leans towards 'Yes' based primarily on the alignment of historical precedent with the current timeline. The deadline of July 1, 2025, is approximately 16 months before the November 2026 election. O'Rourke's previous Senate and Gubernatorial campaign announcements were made 20 and 12 months out, respectively, placing this timeframe squarely within his established pattern for major race entries. His recent public statements ('if the people of Texas want... then yes, I will') are a classic political trial balloon, strongly signaling that a run is under active and serious consideration. The divisive nature of the Republican primary offers a tangible political opportunity that a seasoned candidate like O'Rourke would recognize as advantageous.\n\nHowever, the probability is not higher because the status quo is that he has not yet announced, and there are significant countervailing factors. The research indicates no visible campaign infrastructure (like an exploratory committee or key staff hires) is yet in place, which is a notable omission for a campaign that would need to launch within 40 days. Furthermore, O'Rourke is coming off several high-profile losses, which could lead to donor fatigue and a personal decision that he is not the party's best option. His language, while suggestive, is still conditional and provides a clear off-ramp.\n\nMy forecast is not lower because the timing is simply too compelling. For a Texas-sized campaign, waiting past the summer of 2025 would be a strategic disadvantage. His public posturing is a much stronger indicator of intent than silence would be. I would increase my forecast upon news of him hiring campaign staff or filing FEC paperwork. Conversely, I would decrease my forecast if another major Democrat like Colin Allred were to announce their candidacy before him, as this would significantly complicate his path to the nomination.",
