    "review": "Both forecasters emphasize the strong inertia of the FATF black list and the very high bar for changes. Forecaster 3 adds a concrete and recent data point: the February 2025 plenary made no black list changes, which is informative given the short interval to June. Both note Russia as a theoretical tail risk but highlight the lack of procedural/consensus signals and FATF’s preference (so far) for suspension over listing. They also correctly argue that the research assistant’s Pakistan/IMF notes are more indicative of potential grey-list dynamics than imminent blacklisting. I find these points persuasive and broadly aligned with my prior, with the February-2025-no-change detail nudging me slightly lower.",
    "rationale": "The question resolves Yes if any jurisdiction is added or removed from the FATF call-for-action list after the June 2025 plenary. The status quo is North Korea, Iran, and Myanmar. Removals look highly unlikely: DPRK and Iran lack credible, sustained remediation; Myanmar’s political/security environment remains adverse. Additions are rare and usually preceded by grey-listing and clear signaling of non-cooperation; nothing public suggests an imminent escalation. Russia remains a low-probability tail risk given its suspension, but two years without listing and high political costs suggest consensus is lacking. The February 2025 plenary made no black list changes, reinforcing the base-rate expectation over a short time horizon. India’s intent to provide intelligence on Pakistan and IMF pressure on Pakistan might matter for scrutiny but fit a grey-list pathway rather than a direct blacklisting. Given these factors and the new reminder about the recent plenary outcome, I trim my forecast slightly from 12% to 10%.",
