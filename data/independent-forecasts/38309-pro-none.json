    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "14 days. The primary is scheduled for June 17, 2025.",
    "status_quo_outcome": "Jerrauld 'Jay' Jones, as the only prominent and early-announced candidate, faces no significant primary opposition and is considered the presumptive nominee heading into the election.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "A lesser-known opponent who qualified for the ballot capitalizes on low primary turnout or a last-minute controversy involving Jones, staging a major upset victory.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Jones leverages his early start, fundraising advantage, and support from the party establishment to win the Democratic primary on June 17, 2025, either unopposed or by a large margin against token opposition.",
    "rationale": "My forecast is based primarily on the timeline. With the primary scheduled for June 17, 2025, we are only two weeks away from the election. The provided background information mentions Jay Jones ramping up his bid in November 2024, but critically, it mentions no other credible Democratic challengers. At this late stage in an election cycle, the field of candidates is firmly set. The absence of information about any opponent strongly suggests that Jones has successfully cleared the field or faces only nominal opposition. As a former delegate, he possesses the political experience and network to mount a formidable campaign, likely deterring serious challengers early on. The status quo is that he is the only major candidate, making him the overwhelming favorite.\n\nMy probability is not higher than 95% because there remains a small chance of a major upset, which is always possible in a low-turnout primary election. A hyper-local issue, a sudden scandal, or an unknown opponent catching fire with a specific segment of the electorate could theoretically lead to a surprise loss. The provided research report stating 'No additional information available' means I cannot be 100% certain he is unoppposed.\n\nMy probability is not lower because that would understate the massive advantage Jones holds as the only named candidate just weeks before the election. For him to lose, a challenger would have had to mount a credible campaign that would have likely generated news discoverable by a research assistant. The lack of such news points overwhelmingly to a Jones victory.\n\nI would update my forecast lower upon learning of a credible, well-funded primary opponent who is actively campaigning. I would update it higher upon receiving confirmation that Jones is running unopposed.",

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
