    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "14 days until the Democratic primary scheduled for June 17, 2025",
    "status_quo_outcome": "Insufficient information to determine current race dynamics or frontrunner status with confidence",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Jones loses the Democratic primary to another candidate who has superior name recognition, fundraising, endorsements, or grassroots organization. This could occur if there is a well-established Democratic politician in the race or if the Democratic vote splits favorably for a competitor.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Jones wins the Democratic primary on June 17, 2025, by successfully leveraging his experience as a former Delegate, building a strong campaign organization across Virginia, securing key endorsements, and either facing weak opposition or successfully consolidating the Democratic vote in a multi-candidate field.",
    "rationale": "With only 14 days until the primary, the race dynamics should be largely set. However, I face extreme uncertainty due to complete lack of information about: (1) other candidates in the race, (2) polling data, (3) fundraising comparisons, (4) endorsements, or (5) Jones's current position as frontrunner or underdog. The fact that Jones warranted Washington Post coverage in November 2024 suggests he is a credible candidate with some political profile, given his history as a Delegate from Norfolk and having a Wikipedia entry. However, the absence of any information about competitors, polling, or race dynamics makes this highly uncertain. In Virginia Democratic primaries for statewide office, typical factors include name recognition, geographic support base, party endorsements, and campaign resources. Without data on these factors or knowledge of how many serious candidates are competing, I must assign significant uncertainty. Base rate reasoning suggests that in a multi-candidate Democratic primary with 2-4 serious contenders, each candidate might have 25-50% probability depending on the field size. The status quo principle suggests outcomes are largely determined this close to election day, but I cannot assess what the status quo is. My forecast would be higher if: polling showed Jones leading, he had major endorsements, or limited serious opposition. My forecast would be lower if: strong polling for competitors emerged, he faced well-funded opposition, or there were signs of campaign struggles. The 45% probability reflects Jones being a serious candidate worthy of major media coverage while acknowledging substantial uncertainty about the competitive landscape.",

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any).
