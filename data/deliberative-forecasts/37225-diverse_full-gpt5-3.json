    "review": "Both forecasters lean on the April 22 poll showing VHP ahead (29% vs 24%) and argue that NDP’s post‑Bouterse disarray plus opposition fragmentation make a VHP plurality likely, with the short time to election limiting reversals. They flag the new PR system as a source of uncertainty and the stark dissatisfaction/approval numbers as headwinds. I find their emphasis on the short timeline and the plausibility that PR plus fragmentation advantages the leading party useful. However, they largely accept the April poll at face value without probing polling quality in Suriname, the comparability to the January poll, or the mechanics of the new PR law (e.g., thresholds, allocation method) that could shift seat projections. The disconnect between a reported 3% approval and 29% support remains a warning sign of measurement issues or volatility.",
    "rationale": "Baseline: My prior was 56%, reflecting a modest edge to VHP given the latest poll and opposition fragmentation, offset by very high dissatisfaction, uncertain polling, and first‑use PR risks. The other forecasters convincingly stress two points: (1) time to election is short, reducing the window for a reversal; (2) NDP’s leadership vacuum makes rapid consolidation less likely. Both push me to weight the April lead a bit more. Counterpoints that keep me cautious: polling in Suriname is sparse and volatile (January vs April swing); the extreme dissatisfaction and ultra‑low approval could express in late deciders or turnout asymmetries; first‑time PR introduces model risk. Net: I nudge up, acknowledging the structural and temporal advantages for VHP to hold a narrow plurality, but stay below their 65% given lingering measurement and systemic uncertainties. I would move higher with another independent poll confirming a VHP lead or clearer evidence that PR mechanics/thresholds don’t disadvantage them; lower if credible polling shows NDP recovery or a meaningful opposition consolidation.",
