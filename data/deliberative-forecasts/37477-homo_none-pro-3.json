    "review": "My initial forecast of 68% was overly optimistic and based on a simplistic model. The other two forecasters provided crucial insights that caused me to significantly revise my estimate. Forecaster 2 introduced a superior quantitative model, differentiating the daily probability of a 'Yes' outcome between weekdays and weekends/holidays. This is a much more realistic approach than my initial flat-rate probability, as the news cycle changes significantly during these periods. Forecaster 3’s analysis, while less quantitative, compellingly argued for the 'stickiness' of a core policy issue like tariffs. This topic is not just a daily headline; it's a fundamental part of the administration's platform, likely to be referenced in other front-page stories on the economy or foreign policy, making it resilient to being pushed off the page. I found both arguments highly convincing. My initial model was flawed because it didn't account for the much lower probability of a 'clean' day during the business week and underestimated the persistence of such a central policy theme.",
    "rationale": "I am significantly updating my forecast downward from 68% to 33%. The core reason for this large shift is my adoption of the more sophisticated modeling approach suggested by Forecaster 2, tempered by the qualitative insights from Forecaster 3. My new model assumes a different probability for a 'clean' day (no mention of 'tariff(s)' on either front page) on weekdays versus weekends/holidays. I estimate the probability of a 'clean' day on a weekday is very low, around 1%, given the high relevance of tariffs to the WSJ's daily financial coverage and the NYT's political coverage. Drawing on Forecaster 3's argument about the resilience of a core policy issue, I am more pessimistic than Forecaster 2 about the chances on a weekend or holiday. I estimate the probability of a 'clean' day rises to only 3% (instead of 5%) on these days. Over the 23-day period (approx. 15 weekdays, 8 weekend/holiday days), this revised model yields a cumulative probability of a 'Yes' outcome around 33%. (Calculation: P(No) = (0.99^15) * (0.97^8) ≈ 0.86 * 0.78 ≈ 0.67. Thus, P(Yes) = 1 - 0.67 = 0.33). This new forecast balances the high daily likelihood of a mention against the reasonable chance that a volatile news cycle over a 23-day window provides at least one exception.",
