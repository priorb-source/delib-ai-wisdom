    "review": "Forecaster 3 provides critical information I missed: the March 2025 reading was 503k, not 500k. This means we need a 47k increase over just 2 months (April-May), not 3 months as I calculated. That's roughly 4.7% monthly growth for two consecutive months - about 8x the 0.6% growth we just saw from February to March. Forecaster 3's historical point is also crucial: levels above 550k occurred only during the 2006-2007 bubble peak, making this a very high bar. Forecaster 2 raises a valid point about rising mortgage rates (6.65% to 6.83%) potentially slowing demand and causing inventory accumulation. However, at 55%, they appear too optimistic given the steep acceleration required and the weak leading indicators. The March data shows housing starts down 14.2%, permits down 2%, and builder confidence at 42 - all pointing toward deceleration, not the acceleration needed. Forecaster 2's argument about rate-induced inventory buildup has merit but likely can't overcome the pipeline constraints shown in starts and permits data on such a short timeframe.",
    "rationale": "I significantly overestimated the probability due to a calculation error. With only 2 months remaining and starting from 503k, we need approximately 4.7% monthly growth for two consecutive months to exceed 550k. The recent March increase of just 3k (0.6%) demonstrates the baseline is far below what's needed. The leading indicators strongly suggest continued deceleration: housing starts plunged 14.2%, permits fell 2%, and builder confidence at 42 indicates pessimism. While Forecaster 2 correctly identifies rising mortgage rates as a demand headwind that could cause some inventory accumulation, the supply-side constraints from collapsing starts make the required 9.3% two-month surge highly improbable. Historical context reinforces this: 550k+ levels haven't occurred since the 2006-2007 peak. However, I'm not going as low as Forecaster 3's 2% because there's a non-trivial tail risk: if April data shows an unexpected surge to ~530k (perhaps from a backlog of completions or measurement quirk), one more strong month could push us over. Additionally, if sales crater due to rate increases while completions from earlier starts continue, some accumulation is possible. But the most likely path is continued modest growth or even leveling off.",
