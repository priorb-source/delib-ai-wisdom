    "review": "Forecaster 2 adds a crucial, concrete data point I hadn’t explicitly incorporated: as of the Feb 6, 2025 results, GoPro reported ~$217M cash/cash equivalents and no debt. That dramatically lowers near-term bankruptcy risk. Forecaster 3’s base-rate and short-horizon arguments are consistent with my own, but their emphasis on how rare a filing is within a 53‑day window without clear distress signals is persuasive. Together, these arguments strengthen the case that a filing before July 1 would require an extreme, unforeseen shock, not just ongoing operating challenges.",
    "rationale": "The combination of substantial cash, no debt, absence of public distress indicators (defaults, forbearances, going-concern flags), and a very short remaining window makes a pre–July 1 bankruptcy highly unlikely. My prior 4% allowed for small-cap volatility and potential hidden catalysts; the balance-sheet detail (cash-rich, unlevered) meaningfully reduces those tail risks because the typical bankruptcy trigger—immediate debt-service failure—doesn’t apply here. While non-debt shocks (e.g., catastrophic litigation, fraud) are possible, they are rare and would need to materialize and force a filing within seven weeks. Given the new evidence, I’m lowering my forecast to reflect a very low, residual tail risk.",
