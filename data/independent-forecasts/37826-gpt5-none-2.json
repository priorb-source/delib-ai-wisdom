    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "About 40 days total (≈9 days until the window opens on June 1, then a 30‑day window until June 30).",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No kinetic attack by the Indian Armed Forces on targets inside Sindh, Baluchistan, Punjab, or Khyber Pakhtunkhwa in June 2025.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Ceasefire and deterrence largely hold; any incidents remain limited to the LoC within the Kashmir theater or are non-kinetic/covert. No mass-casualty attack in India traceable to Pakistan-based groups occurs in June, or if something occurs, New Delhi responds with diplomatic pressure or actions short of overt kinetic strikes in Pakistan proper.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "A high-profile attack in India in June is credibly attributed to a Pakistan-based group, prompting the Indian government to authorize a retaliatory kinetic strike by the Air Force or Army on a target in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa or Punjab (e.g., a camp or logistics site), or a significant cross-border artillery/missile/drone strike by the Indian Armed Forces hits targets in Pakistan’s Punjab/KP/Sindh/Baluchistan and is credibly reported.",
    "rationale": "Baseline risk is low. Since 2021, the India–Pakistan border has generally been quieter under a renewed ceasefire, and cross-border strikes into Pakistan proper are exceedingly rare. The notable modern precedent is the February 2019 Balakot airstrike in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa following the Pulwama attack—demonstrating that such actions are possible but require a major trigger and careful escalation management. Absent a catalytic event, Indian leadership tends to avoid overt kinetic operations inside Pakistan proper due to escalation risks, international pressure, and the nuclear backdrop. The window here is only one month, which further suppresses odds. Factors nudging the probability above near-zero: summer infiltration season, standing Indian doctrine allowing limited punitive actions, and the existence of a recent (2019) precedent. Factors keeping it low: no current indication of crisis escalation, the high political and military threshold for crossing into Pakistan proper (as opposed to LoC-limited actions or operations in PoK), and the likelihood that any response to smaller provocations would remain deniable or confined to the LoC. Research assistant provided no new information, so this forecast leans on base rates and structural considerations. I would raise the probability if there were credible reports of: a mass-casualty attack in India with attribution to Pakistan-based groups; Indian cabinet-level crisis meetings and forward deployment of IAF assets; formal public threats of retaliation; sustained breakdown of the 2021 ceasefire across the IB/LoC; NOTAMs or airspace closures suggestive of imminent strikes; or strong US/third-party warnings of imminent escalation. I would lower it if June begins with continued calm, active India–Pakistan diplomatic engagement, third-party mediation signals de-escalation, or if any incidents are clearly contained to the LoC/PoK and treated as routine violations rather than casus belli.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill the Indian Armed Forces execute a kinetic attack in Pakistan proper in June 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nWikipedia: [2025 India–Pakistan conflict](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2025_India%E2%80%93Pakistan_conflict)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if after May 31, 2025 and before July 1, 2025 the Indian Armed Forces execute a kinetic attack on targets in one of the following provinces of Pakistan: Sindh, Baluchistan, Punjab, or Khyber Pakhtunkhwa.\n\nTo count, an attack must be [kinetic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kinetic_military_action), using explosive weaponry or physical violence. Non-kinetic actions such as a cyberattack would not count, even one resulting in deaths.\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nNo additional information available.\n\nToday is 2025-05-22.\n\nBefore answering you think:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n(e) You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
