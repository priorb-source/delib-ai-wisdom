    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "16 days (from June 15, 2025 to July 1, 2025)",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No - Trump has not visited China and no visit has been announced",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Trump does not travel to China in the remaining 16 days. No visit is announced or planned, and the deadline passes without any presidential trip to China taking place.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Trump makes a surprise or hastily arranged visit to China before July 1, 2025, possibly for emergency diplomatic talks or an unexpected summit with President Xi Jinping.",
    "rationale": "With only 16 days remaining until the July 1 deadline, the probability of Trump visiting China is extremely low. Presidential visits to major powers like China typically require extensive advance planning - often weeks or months - including security arrangements, diplomatic preparations, advance teams, and public announcements. The research assistant provided no information suggesting any planned visit, and the background materials only reference past positive communications with Xi, not any imminent travel plans. The status quo heavily favors a 'No' outcome: no visit has occurred yet, none has been announced, and there's insufficient time for standard diplomatic planning. For this to resolve as 'Yes,' we would need either: (1) a secret diplomatic mission with no public announcement, which is highly irregular for presidential travel, or (2) an emergency summit announced in the next few days with extraordinarily rapid execution. While not impossible, both scenarios are extremely unlikely given normal protocols and the absence of any crisis warranting such urgency. My forecast is not lower (closer to 0%) because unexpected diplomatic developments can occasionally occur, though the 16-day window makes even surprise visits nearly impossible to execute properly. My forecast is not higher because there is simply no evidence of any planned visit and insufficient time remains for normal visit planning. I would update significantly higher only with concrete announcements of travel plans or credible reports of advance preparations.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill Donald Trump visit China before July 1, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nFox News: [Trump touts 'very positive' breakthrough with Xi after slamming China for trade violation](https://www.foxnews.com/politics/trump-touts-very-positive-breakthrough-xi-after-slamming-china-trade-violation) | Wikipedia: [List of international presidential trips made by Donald Trump](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_international_presidential_trips_made_by_Donald_Trump)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if, after this question opens and before July 1, 2025, President Donald Trump personally visits China.\n\n\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nNo additional information available.\n\nToday is 2025-06-15.\n\nBefore answering you think:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n(e) You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
