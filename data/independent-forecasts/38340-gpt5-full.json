  "information": "As of early June 2025, Sudan has not ratified the AfCFTA agreement nor submitted its Provisional Schedule of Tariff Concessions. The country is in an ongoing civil war, resulting in fragmented government, the absence of a functioning legislature, and suspension from the African Union (AU). Despite the conflict, a draft national AfCFTA implementation strategy for Sudan was previously reviewed and validated by stakeholders in a process supported by the Intergovernmental Authority on Development (IGAD).\n\nAcross Africa, 47 of the 54 signatory nations had ratified the AfCFTA agreement as of July 2024. However, overall implementation of the trade area since its 2021 launch has been described as sluggish. According to trade policy analysts, key impediments include production-related challenges like low industrial output, poor infrastructure, and non-tariff barriers. The original goal of removing tariffs on 90% of goods has been pushed back to 2034.\n\nA recent UN Economic Commission for Africa (ECA) report highlighted the AfCFTA's potential to boost trade-led growth and increase Africa's GDP by 1.2% by 2045 with full implementation. Other regional developments include a forum in Zambia focused on digital trade integration, an emphasis on arbitration for resolving trade disputes, and the promotion of the Pan-African Payment and Settlement System (PAPSS) to facilitate transactions in local currencies. Meanwhile, Nigeria has ratified the agreement, and South Africa and Lesotho are strengthening bilateral trade ties to advance AfCFTA goals.",

    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "About 25 days (until July 1, 2025)",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No — Sudan remains unratified by the deadline.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "The civil war continues, the internationally recognized authorities lack a functioning legislature and bandwidth, no domestic ratification instrument is issued, and nothing is deposited with the AU Commission before July 1.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "The SAF-led authorities push through an executive decree or equivalent to ratify, the Foreign Ministry promptly deposits the instrument of ratification with the AU Commission, and the AU accepts it before July 1, 2025.",
    "rationale": "Baseline: As of early June 2025, Sudan has not ratified AfCFTA or filed a tariff schedule. The country is in an ongoing civil war with fragmented authority, no functioning legislature, and AU suspension. These are strong structural headwinds against quickly completing a formal treaty ratification and deposit within ~3.5 weeks.\n\nProcess/feasibility: In principle, a de facto executive could attempt ratification by decree and deposit the instrument with the AU Commission. The AU typically records deposit without adjudicating a state’s internal constitutional compliance, so this is not impossible. However, Sudan’s suspension and contested governance reduce incentives and practical capacity. Preparing and clearing the necessary paperwork amidst the conflict, especially absent prior movement on schedules and with low bureaucratic focus, is unlikely on very short notice.\n\nRegional context: Most AU members have already ratified (47/54 by July 2024), but overall AfCFTA implementation has been slow. Sudan’s lack of progress to date—despite having a draft implementation strategy—signals low prioritization under current conditions. The assistant’s report that Sudan hasn’t even submitted a provisional tariff schedule further supports a low near-term probability.\n\nWhy not higher: The combination of war, governance fragmentation, AU suspension, and no visible preparatory steps makes a rapid ratification/deposit by July 1 improbable.\n\nWhy not lower: A narrow path exists—an executive-led, symbolic ratification aimed at signaling engagement or legitimacy, with a fast deposit accepted by the AU Commission. Ratification does not strictly require prior submission of tariff schedules, so a procedural sprint is conceivable.\n\nUpdates that would move the forecast up: credible reports of a cabinet/Sovereign Council decree, Foreign Ministry statements about imminent deposit, AU/AfCFTA Secretariat scheduling or listing Sudan as pending deposit, or a political breakthrough/pressure tied to AU engagements in June. Down: escalation further disrupting ministries, explicit AU indications they would not accept a deposit while Sudan is suspended, or statements from Sudanese authorities deprioritizing AfCFTA.",

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
