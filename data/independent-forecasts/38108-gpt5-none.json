    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "~31 days until July 1, 2025 (Metaculus will check on or after that date)",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No — absent a large, sudden update to DOGE’s running total, the claimed savings will remain below $200B at the first check on/after July 1.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "DOGE’s public savings total remains well under $200B through late June; the site either doesn’t update before early July or posts only incremental additions (e.g., single-digit to low tens of billions), leaving the total below the threshold when Metaculus checks.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "DOGE publishes a mid-year update around late June/early July that aggregates multiple initiatives and/or uses expansive accounting (e.g., multi‑year projected savings, recovered/averted fraud, rescissions) to leap past $200B; Metaculus checks after that update.",
    "rationale": "Time is short and the world usually changes gradually. With roughly a month left, the base case is that DOGE’s current claimed total is below $200B and won’t jump enough before the first post–July 1 check. The referenced Feb 25 article frames “over $100B” as wasted/stolen taxpayer money — an estimate of potential losses, not confirmed savings — which suggests the public narrative was around the $100B scale earlier in the year. To reach $200B by early July would likely require either (a) a very large, coordinated tranche of new claims rolled up at once or (b) a shift to more expansive counting. Both are possible but not the norm for government reporting cadence. Political incentives could push a headline-grabbing mid‑year update, so I allow meaningful probability for a last‑minute jump. However, without concrete evidence that DOGE’s current tally is already near the threshold, the status quo (no) deserves extra weight. Why not higher: very limited time; historically slow update cycles; $200B is a very large number to newly claim in a single month absent prior signaling. Why not lower: the criterion is about a claim, not realized savings; DOGE could aggregate multi‑program ‘estimated’ or multi‑year savings to cross the line, and there may be incentive to do so around mid‑year. What would change my view: • Upward: confirmation that the site total is already ≥$150B, an announced Q2/mid‑year savings report, or evidence DOGE counts multi‑year projections. • Downward: current total < $100B as of mid‑June, indications of delayed reporting, or pushback leading to more conservative counting. Research assistant input: none beyond the article; no direct current total provided, increasing uncertainty and pushing me to rely on base rates and status‑quo weighting.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill Doge claim a total savings of $200 billion or more on July 1, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nNY Post: [Tech guru admired by Elon Musk estimates ‘over $100 billion’ in taxpayer money is being wasted or stolen](https://nypost.com/2025/02/25/us-news/tech-guru-admired-by-elon-musk-estimates-over-100-billion-in-taxpayer-money-is-being-wasted-or-stolen/)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if the Department of Government Efficiency [claims](https://doge.gov/savings) a total estimated savings of greater than or equal to $200 billion when checked by Metaculus on or after July 1, 2025.\n\n\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nNo additional information available.\n\nToday is 2025-05-31.\n\nBefore answering you think:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n(e) You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
