    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "23 days. The outcome will be determined by reviewing the newspaper front pages published from May 9, 2025, through May 31, 2025.",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No. Given that tariffs are a central and ongoing policy focus of the current US administration, the status quo is that the word 'tariff(s)' will continue to appear on the front page of at least one of the two major newspapers on any given day, meaning there will be no single day where both are free of the term.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "A 'No' outcome occurs if, on every single day between now and June 1, 2025, the word 'tariff' or 'tariffs' appears on the front page of either The New York Times, the Wall Street Journal, or both. This would likely be fueled by ongoing trade negotiations, economic impact reports, or new policy announcements.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "A 'Yes' outcome occurs if there is at least one day before June 1, 2025, where the front pages of *both* The New York Times and the Wall Street Journal do not contain the word 'tariff' or 'tariffs'. This could happen on a day dominated by major, non-economic breaking news, or during a slow news period like a holiday weekend.",
    "rationale": "My forecast is 43%. The status quo strongly favors a 'No' outcome. With tariffs being a signature policy of the Trump administration, the topic is persistently newsworthy. The Wall Street Journal's economic focus and the low bar for inclusion—a single mention anywhere on the page—make it highly probable that at least one paper will feature the word on any given day. This forecast is based on the question's context, as my research assistant's report provided no additional information.\n\nHowever, the probability is not close to zero for three main reasons. First, the question resolves to 'Yes' with just a single 'clean' day out of the 23 days remaining. Second, the period includes the Memorial Day holiday weekend, a time when hard news cycles often slow, increasing the chance that non-economic stories lead the front pages. Third, news is inherently unpredictable; a major, non-trade-related breaking news event could easily monopolize front-page real estate for a day in both papers.\n\nTo quantify this, I estimate the daily probability of both papers omitting the word is low, perhaps 1% on a typical weekday but rising to around 5% on a weekend or holiday. Compounding these daily probabilities over the 23-day period (15 weekdays, 8 weekend/holiday days) yields a cumulative probability of approximately 43% for a 'Yes' outcome.\n\nMy forecast is not higher because the persistence of the tariff issue and the low threshold for its inclusion make a 'clean' day a rare event. It is not lower because the 23-day window provides several opportunities for a volatile news cycle to push the topic off both front pages simultaneously. I would increase my forecast if a major, non-economic crisis emerged, and decrease it if a new, significant tariff-related development were to occur.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill the word \"tariff(s)\" disappear from the front print pages of The New York Times and Wall Street Journal by June 1, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nWhether reading the newspaper or social media or watching the news, it is highly likely you are going to see something about tariffs - mainly due to US President Donald Trump's renewed love for this somewhat antiquated form of taxation.\n\nThe New York Times and the Wall Street Journal are two of the largest print newspapers in the US. When, if ever, will we seen tariffs wiped from the front pages of both papers?\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question will resolve to \"Yes\" if, after \\[OPEN DATE] and before June 1, 2025, the words, \"tariff\" or \"tariffs\", do not appear on the print front page of The New York Times and the Wall Street Journal. The following URLs will be used to resolve the question:\n\n* The New York Times: [https://www.nytimes.com/section/todayspaper](https://www.nytimes.com/section/todayspaper)\n* Wall Street Journal:\t [https://www.wsj.com/print-edition/20250414/frontpage](https://www.wsj.com/print-edition/20250414/frontpage)\n\n***\n\n<sup>Note: WSJ front page URL for April 14, 2025. Format is: yyyy-mm-dd.</sup>\n\nGrammar is not relevant (e.g. \"TARIFF\" will suffice to prevent a \"No\" resolution).\n\n\"Tariff(s)\" must be omitted from both papers' front pages on the same day.\n\n\"Tariff(s)\" can appear anywhere on the page, it does not have to be in a title.\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nNo additional information available.\n\nToday is 2025-05-09.\n\nBefore answering you think:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n(e) You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
