    "review": "I find the convergence among all three forecasters remarkably strong - we've all independently arrived at essentially the same forecast (30-32%). This consensus is reassuring because our reasoning follows similar logical paths: acknowledging Trump's opposition to the program while recognizing the significant evidence against action (4 months passed, no signals of preparation, specific terminology requirement, competing priorities). Forecaster 2 makes an excellent point that Trump could address the program using different terminology like 'visa lottery,' which wouldn't satisfy the resolution criteria. Forecaster 3's emphasis on the research assistant providing zero information about pending actions is particularly important - if something were being prepared, we might expect some signal. All three of us correctly identified that status quo bias is strong here: things that haven't happened in 4 months often continue not happening, especially with only 6 weeks remaining.",
    "rationale": "After reviewing the other analyses, I maintain my forecast. The key factors remain: (1) Four months have elapsed without action, which is a strong negative signal since early-term actions typically address top priorities; (2) The research assistant explicitly states 'No additional information available' - if draft orders existed or officials were discussing this, we'd likely have some indication; (3) The exact phrase requirement is highly restrictive - Trump could address visa lottery concerns without using 'Diversity Visa' specifically; (4) Six weeks is theoretically sufficient time, but coupled with zero evidence of preparation, the probability remains moderate at best; (5) Border security and enforcement likely dominate immigration bandwidth. The convergence of three independent forecasters around 30% strengthens my confidence that this range appropriately balances Trump's known opposition (preventing a lower forecast) against the momentum of inaction and lack of evidence (preventing a higher forecast). I see no compelling reason to deviate from 30%.",
