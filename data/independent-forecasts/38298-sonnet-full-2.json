  "information": "According to NOAA data cited in reports, the warmest May on record was in 2020 with a temperature anomaly of +0.95°C versus the 1901-2000 mean, followed by 2016 at +0.93°C. For the current year, preliminary data showed January 2025 was the hottest January on record, March 2025 ranked first or tied for first, and April 2025 ranked as the second warmest. The first three months of 2025 were the second-warmest first quarter recorded. The strong El Niño event that persisted from May 2023 to April 2024 has transitioned to a neutral ENSO (El Niño–Southern Oscillation) state.\n\nSeveral regional weather events were reported globally during May 2025. In Ahmedabad, India, the month was one of the coolest in recent years, with an average maximum temperature 3.3 degrees Celsius below normal due to record rainfall. In contrast, Europe experienced several heat events. On May 1, the UK recorded its warmest start to May on record with temperatures reaching 28°C. Scotland saw its hottest day of the year so far on May 13, reaching 25.4°C. On May 30, a heatwave in Brittany, France broke local heat records for May, reaching 31.1°C in La Noë-Blanche. In the United States, International Falls, Minnesota, recorded temperatures around +32°C in early May.\n\nThe U.S. National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's (NOAA) Climate Prediction Center released an outlook stating that the summer of 2025 was expected to be 'overwhelmingly above normal' across the United States. The forecast indicated that nearly all states were favored to see a warmer-than-average summer, with the highest probabilities for extreme heat in the West and Southwest. The outlook also noted an increased risk of drought and wildfires. Separately, Roman Vilfand, the scientific director of the Russian Hydrometeorological Center, stated that preliminary forecasts suggested 2025 could rank among the top three or five hottest years on record.",

    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Approximately 2-3 weeks. NOAA typically releases its monthly global climate reports within the first few weeks of the following month, so the official May 2025 data should be available by mid-to-late June 2025.",
    "status_quo_outcome": "May 2025 is NOT the hottest May on record. The current record holder is May 2020 with a temperature anomaly of +0.95°C above the 1901-2000 mean, which represents a high bar to surpass. Most months do not break all-time records.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "May 2025's global temperature anomaly remains below +0.95°C. The transition to neutral ENSO conditions reduces warming potential compared to the El Niño-influenced records of 2020 and 2016. Regional cooling signals, such as the significantly below-normal temperatures in Ahmedabad, India (3.3°C below normal), balance out the heat events observed in Europe and North America, resulting in a global anomaly that falls short of the record.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "May 2025's global temperature anomaly exceeds +0.95°C, continuing the exceptional warming trend from early 2025. The multiple heat records reported across Europe (UK, Scotland, France) and North America, combined with elevated ocean heat content persisting from the 2023-2024 El Niño, drive global temperatures above the 2020 record. The underlying long-term warming trend from climate change provides additional upward pressure.",
    "rationale": "The status quo strongly favors a No outcome, as most months do not break all-time records and the bar is exceptionally high at +0.95°C from May 2020. However, several factors provide meaningful evidence for a potential record: (1) 2025 has started extraordinarily warm, with January being the hottest January on record, March ranking first or tied for first, and April ranking second—three of the first four months in the top 2 positions; (2) Multiple regional heat records were reported for May 2025 across Europe (UK's warmest start to May on record at 28°C, Scotland's hottest day at 25.4°C, France's heat records in Brittany at 31.1°C) and North America (Minnesota reaching 32°C); (3) The long-term warming trend from climate change continues to elevate baseline temperatures. Working against a record: (1) The current neutral ENSO state is less favorable than the El Niño conditions that influenced the 2020 and 2016 records; (2) Significant regional cooling was observed in parts of India (Ahmedabad 3.3°C below normal); (3) The historical base rate shows records are rare. Balancing these factors, the exceptional momentum from early 2025 and widespread May heat signals justify meaningful probability above the base rate, but the neutral ENSO and high bar to beat prevent this from being the favored outcome. I estimate 38% probability. This is not higher because neutral ENSO conditions typically don't favor extreme records and most months simply don't break all-time highs. It's not lower because the 2025 year-to-date performance is exceptional and multiple regions reported significant May heat. I would update higher with preliminary data showing anomalies near or above +0.95°C, or evidence that ocean heat is sustaining warming despite neutral ENSO. I would update lower with preliminary data showing moderate anomalies or reports of widespread cooling in additional major regions beyond India.",
