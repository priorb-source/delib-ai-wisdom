    "review": "Both forecasters present compelling evidence that I did not have in my initial analysis. Forecaster 2 cites recent reporting from April 19 (just 2 days ago) from credible outlets like Politico stating Stevens is 'widely expected to declare her Senate candidacy as early as next week' - this is crucial timing information that directly addresses the May 1 deadline. Forecaster 3 provides concrete evidence of preparation: $1.2M raised in Q1 2025, $1.6M in campaign funds, expanded staff, and most tellingly, contacting potential replacements for her House seat. These are not speculative indicators but documented actions that strongly suggest imminent candidacy announcement. My initial analysis was based on the absence of FEC paperwork, but I failed to consider that: (1) candidates can announce before formally filing paperwork, (2) the recent reporting suggests the decision has already been made, and (3) the concrete fundraising and staffing moves are more predictive than FEC filing timing. The combination of recent credible reporting explicitly mentioning timing that aligns with the May 1 deadline, plus documented preparation activities, creates a substantially higher probability than my initial 8% forecast.",
    "rationale": "I am significantly updating my forecast upward based on new evidence. The key factors driving this update are: (1) Recent, specific reporting from April 19 stating Stevens is expected to announce 'as early as next week' - this timeline fits squarely within the May 1 deadline; (2) Concrete preparation indicators including $1.2M Q1 fundraising, $1.6M cash on hand, staff expansion, and contacting House seat replacements - these are actions that precede announcements; (3) The political context where top Democrats have withdrawn creates urgency and opportunity for Stevens. However, I'm not going quite as high as Forecasters 2 and 3 (70-72%) because: (1) 'Widely expected' and 'as early as next week' still contain hedging language - announcements can and do slip; (2) With only 10 days remaining, she could strategically choose to announce just after May 1; (3) The base rate of 'expected' political announcements not happening on predicted timelines is non-trivial. Balancing the strong preparation signals and recent reporting against the remaining uncertainty about exact timing, I forecast 68%.",
