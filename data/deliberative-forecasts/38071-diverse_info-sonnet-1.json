    "review": "Forecaster 2 introduces critical new information I hadn't considered: a March 2025 internal poll for Stoney showing him at 16%, Rouse at 10%, and 63% undecided. While internal polls can be biased, this fundamentally changes my assessment. I had assumed Stoney had a more commanding structural advantage, but a 6-point gap with nearly two-thirds of voters undecided indicates a far more fluid race than I initially estimated. Forecaster 3's detailed breakdown of the six-way field and emphasis on plurality dynamics in low-turnout primaries is also valuable context. Both forecasters correctly identify that with such massive undecided numbers, the race is genuinely competitive. However, I note that both still anchor on Stoney as the status quo winner due to his fundraising lead, establishment backing, and structural advantages - which I agree with. The key tension is: does a 6-point deficit with 63% undecided justify a 30-35% probability for Rouse, or should we weight the front-runner's advantages more heavily?",
    "rationale": "Upon reflection, I was too conservative at 25%. The internal poll data, despite potential bias, suggests this is a genuinely competitive race rather than one where Stoney has pulled away. A 6-point gap with 63% undecided in March, with the primary in mid-June, means the outcome is highly uncertain. Rouse's labor and progressive backing becomes more valuable in this context - these are exactly the groups that can drive turnout in low-visibility primaries. However, I'm not fully convinced by Forecaster 2's 35% because: (1) the poll is a Stoney internal and may be the most favorable data point for his opposition, (2) Stoney retains his fundraising and establishment advantages, and (3) being behind in available polling, even slightly, is still a disadvantage. The status quo still favors Stoney, but the margin is narrow enough that Rouse has a real shot. I'm updating to 31% - splitting the difference between my original 25% and Forecaster 2's 35%. This reflects that the race is more open than I initially assessed, while still giving appropriate weight to Stoney's structural advantages as the front-runner.",
