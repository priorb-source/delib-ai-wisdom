    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "About 23 days (until June 27, 2025).",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No — the debt remains below $37T by June 27 on its recent trajectory.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Total Public Debt Outstanding sits in the mid–$36T range in early June and rises at a typical pace (~$100–200B/month after April’s tax inflows), keeping it below $37T by June 27; any ongoing debt ceiling constraints/extraordinary measures also cap headline growth.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Debt is already near ~$36.85–$36.95T and ordinary issuance pushes it over $37T by June 27; or Congress resolves the debt limit in June and Treasury’s restoration of extraordinary measures plus catch-up issuance produces a one-off jump of several hundred billion that clears $37T before/around June 27.",
    "rationale": "- Evidence and base rates: Over the past couple of years, total debt has risen roughly $1.5–$2.5T per year (about $125–$200B per month), with a typical April dip/flattening from tax receipts and renewed increases in May–June. Given that cadence and only ~3 weeks left, a move of ~$300–$500B would be needed if the starting point is around the mid–$36T’s, which is unlikely without a one-off jump.\n- Status quo weighting: In most years, daily debt changes are incremental. Absent a discrete policy/action shock, the most probable outcome is that June 27 prints below $37T.\n- Upside pathways: A late-June debt-limit deal could trigger immediate restoration of suspended investments (extraordinary measures) and catch-up issuance—historically this can add hundreds of billions to reported totals quickly. If current levels are already very close to $37T, ordinary issuance alone could tip it over.\n- Downside/No pathways: If the debt limit remains binding (with extraordinary measures in use), the headline total may be held near the ceiling, and normal seasonal patterns won’t deliver a >$300B jump in three weeks.\n- Why not higher: Crossing $37T from a mid–$36T starting point requires an unusually large, rapid increase that typically only follows a debt-limit resolution with restorations; timing and magnitude are uncertain.\n- Why not lower: There is real tail risk from a potential June debt-limit resolution causing a large, immediate step-up, and it’s possible the current level is already close enough that normal issuance suffices.\n- What would change my view: Daily Debt to the Penny prints showing the level by mid-June; any confirmed news on a debt-limit agreement and timing of restoring extraordinary measures; unexpectedly large net borrowing plans or supplemental outlays; a confirmed current level at or above ~$36.9T would push my probability up; confirmation that the debt limit remains binding through late June would push it down.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill the US national debt be greater than $37 trillion on June 27, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nBase rate information can be found at [Merchant Wholesalers, Except Manufacturers' Sales Branches and Offices: Durable Goods: Furniture and Home Furnishings Inventories/Sales Ratio](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/R4232IM163SCEN).\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if the value for Total Public Debt Outstanding at the Debt to the Penny chart at the US Treasury's [Debt to the Penny](https://fiscaldata.treasury.gov/datasets/debt-to-the-penny/debt-to-the-penny) tracker for June 27, 2025 is greater than or equal to $37,000,000,000,000.\n\nIf the resolution source does not report that specific date, then the resolution will be based on the amount corresponding with the first date after it.\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nNo additional information available.\n\nToday is 2025-06-04.\n\nBefore answering you think:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n(e) You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
