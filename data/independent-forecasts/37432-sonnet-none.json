    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Less than 2 months - the question resolves on July 1, 2025, and today is May 5, 2025",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No - the legislation has not yet been enacted",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Senate Bill 153 remains in committee without receiving votes in both chambers, or it passes one chamber but not the other before the July 1 deadline, or amendments create disagreements that cannot be reconciled in time",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "The Ohio legislature, which is Republican-controlled and has already seen the introduction of Senate Bill 153, fast-tracks the bill through both chambers with strong party-line support in the remaining weeks, and both houses pass identical versions before July 1, 2025",
    "rationale": "With less than two months remaining, this question faces significant time constraints. The status quo strongly favors No since the legislation has not yet been enacted and most introduced bills never pass. Key considerations: (1) Time pressure - legislative processes typically take months, and we have under 8 weeks; (2) No evidence of progress - the research assistant found no additional information suggesting the bill has advanced significantly beyond introduction; (3) Base rates - even in favorable conditions, most bills don't pass, and expedited passage within this timeframe is uncommon; (4) Procedural requirements - both chambers must pass identical bills. Factors that prevent this from being lower: Ohio has Republican control making this type of legislation theoretically viable, and voter citizenship verification is a priority issue for some Republicans. Factors that prevent this from being higher: the extremely short timeline, lack of any reported progress, and the typical slow pace of legislative change. I would update higher if: evidence emerged of committee advancement, floor votes scheduled, or leadership prioritizing this bill. I would update lower if: the legislative session ended, the bill stalled in committee, or sponsors withdrew support.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nBefore July 1, 2025, will Ohio enact legislation expanding its verification requirements of a voter's citizenship?\n\nQuestion background:\nThe Ohio Senate: [Gavarone, Brenner Introduce Bill to Require Proof of Citizenship to Vote](https://ohiosenate.gov/members/theresa-gavarone/news/gavarone-brenner-introduce-bill-to-require-proof-of-citizenship-to-vote)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if, before July 1, 2025, the state of Ohio enacts legislation requiring voters to provide proof of US citizenship beyond the requirements at the time of this question, according to [credible sources](https://www.metaculus.com/faq/#definitions).\n\nAny subset of voters being required to provide such proof would count (for example if it only applied to first-time voter registrants or creating a new requirement for mail-in voters). An example of a bill that would count is [Senate Bill 153](https://www.legislature.ohio.gov/legislation/136/sb153). This question resolves upon enactment; therefore other questions such as when the legislation takes effect or whether it survives court challenges and is implemented is immaterial to this question's resolution. Please note that under Ohio law, a bill is considered enacted \"after both houses have passed and agreed on identical bills.\" ([Source](https://www.lsc.ohio.gov/assets/organizations/legislative-service-commission/files/chapter-5-enacting-legislation-10021971.pdf))\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nNo additional information available.\n\nToday is 2025-05-05.\n\nBefore answering you think:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n(e) You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
