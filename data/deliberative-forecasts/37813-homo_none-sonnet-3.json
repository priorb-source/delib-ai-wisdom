    "review": "All three forecasters converged on similar core reasoning: December 2024's 6 cube-shaped reports establish these events occur but are rare, and the question's low threshold (only 1 needed) favors Yes. Forecaster 2 raised an interesting seasonality argument - summer weather increases outdoor activity and UFO sightings generally. However, this is somewhat undermined by December (winter in Northern Hemisphere) having 6 reports. Forecaster 3's more conservative 55% seems overly cautious given recent evidence. The spread of 55-70% reflects different interpretations of 'rare' - whether typical months average 0.5, 1, or 2 cube reports. If we model this as a Poisson process with lambda around 1-2 per month, P(X≥1) ranges from 63-86%. December being 'rare' with 6 reports suggests the typical mean is probably 1-3, not 0.5. Forecaster 2's seasonality point has merit but isn't decisive given December's performance.",
    "rationale": "After reviewing other analyses, my core reasoning remains sound. December 2024's 6 cube-shaped reports (explicitly noted as rare) provides strong recent evidence these events occur and get reported. The binary threshold (≥1 sighting) significantly favors Yes. If December's 6 is rare, typical months likely see 1-3 cube reports, implying 60-85% probability of at least one in any given month. Forecaster 2's seasonality argument about June being summer is valid but not decisive - December's winter performance suggests cube reports don't follow typical UFO seasonality patterns strongly. I'm slightly more confident than my initial 65% given the seasonality consideration and the low bar for resolution. The main uncertainty remains interpreting 'rare' - but even conservative estimates suggest reasonable probability. No evidence has emerged suggesting June would be systematically different from recent months.",
