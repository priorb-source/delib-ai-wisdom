    "review": "Both forecasters largely mirror my reasoning: the fresh May 15 extension of martial law to Aug 6, Article 19’s ban on scheduling/holding national elections under martial law, and the 90-day lead time together make a pre–July 1 announcement very unlikely. Forecaster 2 helpfully emphasizes the specific authority of the Verkhovna Rada to set the presidential election date and highlights the legal inconsistency of an Oct 26 date while martial law runs to Aug 6 unless the law changes or martial law ends early. Forecaster 3’s framing is similar and clear on required steps (early termination or legal amendment) and plausible but low-probability tail scenarios (ceasefire, accelerated legal action). I don’t see new factual information beyond the sharper articulation that only the Rada can set the date, but their stress-testing of the Oct 26 rumor reinforces the low base rate before July 1.",
    "rationale": "Status quo favors No: martial law is now extended beyond the cutoff, and current law forbids scheduling under martial law. Announcing by July 1 would require (a) lifting martial law in June, or (b) passing and enacting a legal change permitting scheduling under martial law and then promptly using it. Official denials from the President’s office and lack of visible legislative motion reduce the near-term intent signal. The rumored Oct 26 date, if real, implies additional steps (early termination or amendment) that could be taken later; there’s no strong reason to act before July 1. A small tail remains for a rapid legal/political pivot (e.g., ceasefire, government-backed amendment to allow scheduling while maintaining wartime constraints, or an early end to martial law). Given alignment with the other analyses and no new bullish indicators, I maintain my forecast. Key up-movers: credible, government-backed draft law enabling scheduling under martial law; public, on-record signals of early lifting; Rada leadership/CEC statements pointing to imminent scheduling. Down-movers: further categorical denials and no legislative activity through June; worsening security.",
