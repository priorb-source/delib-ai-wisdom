  "information": "Analysis of the International Traditional Karate Federation (ITKF) indicates a pattern of announcing World Championship hosts 24 to 36 months prior to the event. As of mid-May 2025, there is no mention of Egypt's 2026 bid, nor any related bid documentation, on the ITKF's official website. There have been no public reports of other nations submitting competing bids for the 2026 championship. Egypt previously hosted an ITKF event in 2014.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Less than 2 months.",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No. As of today, no announcement has been made, and the deadline is approaching.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "The deadline of July 1, 2025, passes without the International Traditional Karate Federation (ITKF) having made any formal announcement designating Egypt as the host for the 2026 championship. This could be due to a delay in the decision-making process, the bid not being finalized, or the selection of another host nation.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "In May or June 2025, following the high-level discussions reported, the ITKF formalizes and approves Egypt's bid in an accelerated process and releases an official statement on its website or through other official channels, formally confirming that Egypt has been selected to host the 2026 Traditional Karate World Championship.",
    "rationale": "My forecast is low due to the significant procedural and timeline-related obstacles. The most compelling evidence against a 'Yes' outcome is the short time remaining before the July 1, 2025 deadline. The research indicates that the ITKF typically announces hosts 24-36 months in advance. As of May 2025, we are well inside that window for a 2026 event. Furthermore, the complete absence of any public bid documentation or mention of Egypt's candidacy on the ITKF's official website is a strong negative indicator. International hosting bids are typically formal, public processes that take considerable time to finalize. While the meeting between Egypt's Minister of Sports and the ITKF President shows intent, translating this discussion into a finalized, approved, and publicly announced decision in under two months is highly improbable. The status quo, in which no announcement has been made, is very likely to continue past the deadline.\n\nMy probability is not lower (closer to 0) because there is credible evidence of high-level interest from both parties, and the research indicates a lack of any other competing bids. This could potentially allow for a fast-tracked, streamlined process if the political will is strong enough. Egypt's prior experience hosting an ITKF event in 2014 is also a positive factor.\n\nMy probability is not higher because the timeline pressure and the lack of any official, public progress are overwhelming factors. The world, and especially bureaucratic international sports federations, tends to move slowly. The evidence for inertia far outweighs the evidence for a rapid, successful conclusion before the deadline.\n\nI would increase my forecast if any official source (ITKF or Egyptian government) announced that a formal bid had been submitted or if a credible source reported that an announcement was imminent. I would decrease my forecast if the ITKF announced a formal bidding process open to other nations or stated that the 2026 host decision would be made in late 2025.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nBefore July 1, 2025, will the International Traditional Karate Federation announce that Egypt has been chosen to host the 2026 Traditional Karate World Championship?\n\nQuestion background:\nVetoGate Egypt: [Ashraf Sobhi discusses hosting the 2026 World Cup with the President of the International Traditional Karate Federation](https://www.vetogate.com/5400045)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if, before July 1, 2025, the International Traditional Karate Federation announces that Egypt has been chosen to host the 2026 Traditional Karate World Championship.\n\n\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nAnalysis of the International Traditional Karate Federation (ITKF) indicates a pattern of announcing World Championship hosts 24 to 36 months prior to the event. As of mid-May 2025, there is no mention of Egypt's 2026 bid, nor any related bid documentation, on the ITKF's official website. There have been no public reports of other nations submitting competing bids for the 2026 championship. Egypt previously hosted an ITKF event in 2014.\n\nToday is 2025-05-08.\n\nBefore answering you think:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n(e) You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
