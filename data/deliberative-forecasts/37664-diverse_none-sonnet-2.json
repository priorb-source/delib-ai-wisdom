    "review": "Forecaster 2's analysis closely aligns with mine, emphasizing the short timeframe and absence of signals as strong negative indicators. Forecaster 3 raises important counterpoints I initially underweighted: (1) the historical release cadence making mid-2025 plausible for Claude 4, (2) Anthropic's demonstrated ability to move quickly from internal testing to general availability, and (3) competitive pressure from recent rival model launches. Forecaster 3's 35% forecast reflects optimism that a mid-June surprise launch remains feasible. However, I find this overestimates the probability given that modern major AI releases rarely occur without advance notice, leaks, or documentation changes. The complete absence of ANY public signals (no model IDs in SDKs, no press invites, no credible rumors) with only 6 weeks remaining is a powerful negative indicator that both Forecaster 2 and I correctly emphasized. While Forecaster 3 correctly notes that Anthropic CAN move fast, the question is whether they WILL in the next 6 weeks with zero current evidence.",
    "rationale": "Upon reflection, I was slightly too pessimistic at 10%. Forecaster 3 makes valid points about the plausible timing window and Anthropic's capability for rapid deployment. The historical cadence argument (Claude 2→3 in ~8 months, then 3.5 iterations) does suggest mid-2025 is within reasonable bounds for a major version increment. Additionally, 6 weeks is technically sufficient for an announcement followed by immediate general availability, and competitive dynamics could motivate such a move. However, the complete absence of signals remains highly significant. In the current AI landscape, flagship releases are typically preceded by documentation updates, developer outreach, media preparation, or at minimum credible leaks. None exist for Claude 4. The strict naming requirement also matters—Anthropic could release another 3.x iteration or use different branding, both resulting in No resolution. Balancing these factors, I should update moderately upward from 10% to acknowledge the non-negligible possibility of a surprise June launch, but remain well below Forecaster 3's 35% given the lack of any supporting evidence.",
