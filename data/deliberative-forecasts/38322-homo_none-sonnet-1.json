    "review": "Both forecasters independently arrived at 30%, raising several important points I should consider. Forecaster 3 provides crucial historical context - noting the Great Recession bottomed at 55.8, which is ABOVE the 54.0 threshold. This reinforces how extreme this threshold is. Both forecasters emphasize that we're now in early June when preliminary data may already be available, and both note that sentiment typically stabilizes after initial shocks rather than continuing to plummet. The explicit mention of a 'sentiment plunge' in the question background suggests genuine recent weakness that all three of us are weighing. However, I need to reconcile this with my knowledge that June 2022 saw readings around 50.0 (the historical low), meaning sub-54 readings, while rare, have occurred in recent history during severe crises. The key question is whether current conditions in June 2025 mirror that level of distress.",
    "rationale": "After reviewing the other forecasters' analyses, I'm updating my reasoning but maintaining a somewhat lower probability than the 30% consensus. The critical factors are: (1) The 54.0 threshold is indeed extreme - worse than Great Recession levels if Forecaster 3's data is correct, though the 2022 inflation crisis did breach this level. (2) The Axios reference to a sentiment plunge indicates real deterioration, which all three of us acknowledge. (3) However, the status quo bias remains powerful - even after a sharp drop, maintaining readings below 54.0 for an entire month requires sustained crisis-level pessimism. (4) We're asking about the FINAL report at month-end, which allows time for potential stabilization from any May shock. (5) Without concrete data on May 2025 or preliminary June readings, I'm weighting historical base rates showing sub-54 as exceptionally rare tail events. The question's existence suggests proximity to the threshold, warranting upward adjustment from my initial 18%, but the extreme nature of the level prevents me from fully adopting the 30% consensus. I'm updating to 24% - acknowledging the genuine uncertainty and recent plunge concerns while maintaining that sub-54 readings represent extraordinarily rare economic pessimism that requires more than tariff concerns alone.",
