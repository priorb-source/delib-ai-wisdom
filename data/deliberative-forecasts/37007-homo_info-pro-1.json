    "review": "My initial analysis, which produced a 62% forecast, was overly reliant on the general advantages of incumbency and the People's National Movement's (PNM) historical performance. The other two forecasters introduced critical, election-specific information that I had not considered. Forecaster 2's analysis was particularly impactful, highlighting the formation of a unified opposition coalition between the United National Congress (UNC) and the Congress of the People (COP). This is a game-changing factor in a first-past-the-post system, and the historical precedent from the 2010 election, where a similar coalition defeated the PNM, is a powerful piece of evidence. Forecaster 3 provided crucial nuance, citing polling data indicating the PNM has a structural advantage in the two Tobago seats due to opposition vote-splitting, while also emphasizing the high volatility created by a large bloc of undecided voters. Both analyses were highly convincing and revealed significant gaps in my initial reasoning.",
    "rationale": "I am significantly updating my forecast downwards from 62% to 52%. The primary reason for this large revision is the new information about the UNC-COP opposition coalition, as raised by Forecaster 2. A unified opposition front fundamentally alters the electoral calculus, mitigating the vote-splitting that often benefits an incumbent party. The historical success of such a coalition in 2010 demonstrates that this is a viable path to victory for the opposition and makes a PNM win far less certain than I originally assessed. However, I am not dropping my forecast below 50%. Forecaster 3's specific, evidence-based point about the PNM's advantage in the two Tobago seats provides a tangible buffer for the incumbents. While the coalition creates a national threat to the PNM, their likely hold on these two seats provides a concrete advantage that cannot be ignored. The race now appears to be a genuine toss-up. My revised forecast of 52% reflects this new understanding: the PNM's chances are much closer to 50/50, but I give them a slight edge due to the combination of their incumbency and their specific structural advantage in Tobago, balanced against the powerful but less certain dynamics of the new opposition coalition and a large group of undecided voters.",
