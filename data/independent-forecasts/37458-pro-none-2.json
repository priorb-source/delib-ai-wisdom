    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "The outcome will be known by the resolution date of June 15, 2025, which is 39 days from today's date of May 7, 2025.",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No. Direct, publicly acknowledged phone calls between the leaders of the United States and China are infrequent. The default state, absent a specific crisis or diplomatic milestone, is no direct communication at this level.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "The 34-day period between May 12 and June 15, 2025, passes without any major crisis (e.g., concerning Taiwan or trade) or diplomatic breakthrough that would necessitate a publicly confirmed call between the two leaders. Standard diplomatic communications, if any, continue through lower-level channels.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "A significant geopolitical or economic event occurs, prompting an urgent need for leader-level de-escalation or negotiation. For instance, a military incident in the South China Sea compels the two leaders to speak directly to manage the crisis. Both the White House and Beijing subsequently issue official readouts confirming the call to signal stability to international observers.",
    "rationale": "This forecast operates on the core assumption that Donald Trump is the sitting U.S. President in May-June 2025. If he were a private citizen, the probability of an officially confirmed call with President Xi would be near zero due to diplomatic protocol. \n\nThe primary reason for my low forecast is the low base rate of such events. Publicly acknowledged phone calls between U.S. and Chinese leaders are rare, often with many months or more than a year between them. The odds of a call falling within a specific 34-day window are therefore low. \n\nThe second key factor is the high bar for resolution: both sides must acknowledge the call. This is a critical constraint, especially given the history cited in the question's background, where Trump has previously claimed talks that China denied. Beijing could strategically choose not to confirm a call to express displeasure or avoid giving Trump a perceived political win, thus causing the question to resolve as 'No' even if a private conversation took place. \n\nMy probability is not lower than 20% because the first few months of a new presidential term can be a volatile period for U.S.-China relations. Trump's personalistic and often confrontational diplomatic style could either precipitate a crisis requiring a leader-level call for resolution or lead him to initiate contact as part of a new diplomatic gambit. The possibility of such an event occurring in this timeframe is not negligible. \n\nMy probability is not higher because, aside from the general unpredictability of a new administration, there is no specific known catalyst scheduled for this window that would make a call more likely than not. The status quo of infrequent contact and the high resolution bar remain the dominant factors. I would raise my forecast upon credible reports of escalating tensions requiring immediate de-escalation, or if groundwork was being laid for a major bilateral announcement.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill Donald Trump and Xi Jinping speak on the phone with each other before June 15, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nCBS News: [Trump says he's talked with Xi about tariffs. China has denied talks are taking place](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/trump-xi-china-tariffs/)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if, after May 12, 2025 and before June 15, 2025, Donald Trump and Xi Jinping speak on the phone with each other, according to [credible sources](https://www.metaculus.com/faq/#definitions).\n\nBoth sides must acknowledge the phone call took place for it to count. \"Speak on the phone with each other\" is defined as both individuals, from different physical spaces, orally uttering words intended for the other individual into a telephone or equivalent device, those words being converted into electrical or digital signals in real time, and then transferred to the other individual via telecommunications links, where they are reconverted into sound waves at the other individual's listening device.\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nNo additional information available.\n\nToday is 2025-05-07.\n\nBefore answering you think:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n(e) You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
