    "review": "The other forecasters and I have reached strong consensus (77-82% range), which reinforces confidence in this assessment. All three analyses identified the same communication pattern and key factors. However, two important points emerged from their analyses that warrant careful consideration:\n\n**Forecaster 3's acknowledgment concern is the most substantive new argument:** The resolution criteria requires BOTH a call to occur AND both parties to publicly acknowledge it. During sensitive peace negotiations, calls could happen without public acknowledgment. This is a genuine additional hurdle I underweighted. However, examining the actual pattern - all three 2025 calls (Feb 12, March 19, May 10) were publicly acknowledged - suggests this is standard practice for these leaders. Unacknowledged head-of-state calls are relatively rare, especially between aligned democratic leaders.\n\n**Forecaster 2's coordination argument is compelling:** The differing positions on preconditions (Trump advising talks without ceasefire, Zelenskyy demanding ceasefire first) create stronger needs for ongoing coordination than I initially emphasized. The follow-up after Istanbul, regardless of outcome, will almost certainly require direct communication. This argues for a slightly higher probability.\n\nBoth forecasters correctly note we're in a \"particularly active phase\" given the May 10 call was just 3 days ago, which I had identified but could have emphasized more strongly as evidence of intensive diplomatic engagement.",
    "rationale": "Weighing the new arguments: The acknowledgment requirement is a legitimate concern that adds uncertainty, but the established pattern of transparency mitigates this risk significantly. Meanwhile, the coordination needs argument - particularly around differing positions on preconditions and inevitable Istanbul follow-up - strengthens the case for another call. These leaders have shown they communicate directly during critical moments, and we're clearly in such a moment. The 33-day window remains generous relative to their 3-4 week communication cadence. The active diplomatic phase we're in, demonstrated by the recent May 10 call, suggests continued high-frequency contact is likely. The balance of new arguments slightly favors an upward adjustment, but not dramatically so. The acknowledgment concern prevents me from moving to 82%+, while the coordination needs and active phase arguments support moving slightly above my original 78%.",
