  "information": "Historical data on FSIS recalls shows that resolution times vary based on classification and complexity. Class I (high-risk) recalls typically close in 2-4 months. Class III recalls often close within 1-3 months, with a median time of approximately 90 days. However, recalls that span multiple states, involve large product volumes, or are distributed through institutional foodservice channels frequently take longer to resolve. The extended shelf life of some of the recalled products, until March 2026, is another factor that can complicate and lengthen the verification process.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Approximately 55 days until July 1, 2025",
    "status_quo_outcome": "The recall remains Active past the July 1, 2025 deadline",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "The recall investigation and verification process extends beyond July 1, 2025, likely due to the complexity of tracking products through institutional foodservice channels, the multi-state distribution, or the extended shelf life requiring lengthy verification that all contaminated product has been removed from distribution",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Cargill and FSIS complete all necessary recall verification activities by late June 2025, with efficient product recovery and documentation allowing the recall to be classified as Closed just before the July 1 deadline, particularly if this is a Class III recall following a typical 90-day timeline",
    "rationale": "The recall was issued March 28, 2025, meaning 40 days have elapsed as of today (May 7) with the recall still Active. The question deadline of July 1 provides a total window of 95 days from issuance. According to the research assistant, Class III recalls have a median closure time of approximately 90 days, while Class I recalls typically take 2-4 months (60-120 days). The 95-day window falls right at the median for Class III but represents a relatively tight timeline given several complicating factors: multi-state distribution, large product volumes, institutional foodservice distribution channels (which are harder to track), and extended shelf life until March 2026. The nature of contamination with cleaning solution could classify this as Class I if there's significant health risk, which would push expected resolution time longer. The status quo strongly favors the recall remaining Active, as we're already 40 days in without resolution and complex recalls tend to take time. However, if this is Class III and proceeds efficiently, closure around the 90-day mark (late June) is possible. The probability would be higher if we had more time past the median closure date, or if we knew this was definitively a simpler Class III recall. It would be lower if we had evidence this was Class I or if typical closure times for institutional foodservice recalls were substantially longer than the general median. I would update upward if news emerged showing rapid progress in product recovery or if FSIS indicated the recall was nearing completion. I would update downward if this were confirmed as Class I or if complications in the recovery process were reported.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill the USDA-posted recall by Cargill Kitchen Solutions of its liquid egg product for an unapproved substance issued March 28, 2025 be closed before July 1, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nABC News: [Liquid eggs recalled due to potential cleaning solution contamination](https://abcnews.go.com/GMA/Food/liquid-eggs-recalled-due-potential-cleaning-solution-contamination/story?id=120329600)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if the status of the recall posted by the U.S. Department of Agriculture’s Food Safety and Inspection Service (FSIS) is changed from Active to Closed on [this page](https://www.fsis.usda.gov/recalls-alerts/cargill-kitchen-solutions-recalls-liquid-egg-products-due-unapproved-substance) before July 1, 2025. If the recall is still shown as Active when the link is accessed by Metaculus on or after July 1, 2025, this question resolves as **No**.\n\n\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nHistorical data on FSIS recalls shows that resolution times vary based on classification and complexity.

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
