    "review": "Forecaster 2 introduces critical new information: specific reports from May 15-16 about 'Claude Neptune' completing red-teaming around May 18 with GA targeted for late May/early June. This is highly material if accurate. However, Forecaster 2's 70% seems to underweight the naming risk - even if a model releases on time, it must be called 'Claude 4' specifically. Forecaster 2 acknowledges 10-20% naming risk, 10% access gating risk, and 10-15% schedule risk, which compounds to reduce the probability significantly below 70%. Forecaster 3's 15% appears too pessimistic given the possibility of near-term releases, though the point about 'later in 2025' semantics and lack of public announcements is well-taken. The key uncertainties are: (1) accuracy of the Neptune reports, (2) whether it will be branded 'Claude 4', and (3) whether any delays occur in the tight 46-day window.",
    "rationale": "I'm updating upward from my initial 20% based on Forecaster 2's reports of imminent release targeting late May/early June, but remaining well below 70% due to three compounding risks. First, naming risk (~20-25%): Anthropic could brand as 'Claude Neptune,' 'Claude 3.5 Opus,' or another variant that fails resolution criteria. Second, schedule risk (~20%): even with late May/June targets, safety concerns or technical issues could push past July 1. Third, report uncertainty (~15%): I cannot independently verify these May 15-16 reports, and leaked timelines are often optimistic. If we assume 60% probability of a next-gen model releasing before July 1 (accounting for reports and schedule risk) and 75% probability it's named 'Claude 4' (accounting for naming risk), that yields ~45% overall. I'm settling at 40% as a compromise that's meaningfully higher than my initial forecast to account for possible near-term release signals, but appropriately discounted for the multiple ways this could resolve No even with a launch.",
