    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "About 46 days (until July 1, 2025)",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No — no snap election is announced by July 1, 2025",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "The ruling SNS-led majority quickly names and confirms a new prime minister and cabinet, keeping the current parliament in place. The president does not dissolve the assembly, and no decree is issued setting an election date before July 1.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Following the prime minister’s resignation, coalition talks stall or leadership opts for a fresh mandate. The president dissolves the National Assembly and issues a decree setting a specific parliamentary election date (likely in late June or July), or parliament fails to elect a new PM within constitutional deadlines, forcing dissolution and an election date announcement before July 1.",
    "rationale": "- Baseline and timing: With only ~1.5 months left, the status quo favors no announcement. Serbia’s president issues the election decree, and by law elections are typically held 45–60 days after they are called. Announcing now would likely mean a late-June/July vote, which is operationally tight and politically suboptimal (summer turnout).\n- Political arithmetic: The SNS-led bloc still holds a working majority from the December 2023 elections, so they can likely replace the PM without triggering elections. A confirmed PM resignation raises risk but does not require dissolution; the assembly can elect a new PM and continue.\n- Base rates vs short window: Serbia has frequent snap elections (2022, 2023), which keeps the prior non-trivially high. However, the short decision window and existence of a majority capable of forming a government argue that no announcement by July 1 is more likely.\n- Why not higher: Ruling party control of parliament makes government reconstitution the path of least resistance. Summer timing makes a near-term snap election less attractive. There is no corroborated evidence (from the assistant’s report) of acute coalition breakdowns that would force dissolution on this timeline.\n- Why not lower: Serbia’s political practice tolerates frequent early elections, and a PM resignation can be used to reset the mandate. If leadership sees advantage in consolidating power or if coalition talks unexpectedly falter, an announcement could come quickly.\n- What would move me up: Public signals from President Vučić favoring early elections; failure to nominate/confirm a PM within constitutional deadlines; coalition partners withdrawing support; scheduling steps consistent with dissolution.\n- What would move me down: Swift nomination and confirmation of a new PM and cabinet; explicit denials of early elections from top leadership; parliamentary calendar filling with regular legislative business.\n- Research assistant input: None beyond the prompt; no additional confirming or disconfirming details provided.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill Serbia announce a general election before July 1, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\n[Serbia could face snap elections as PM’s resignation confirmed](https://tvpworld.com/85681783/serbia-could-face-snap-elections-as-pms-resignation-confirmed-)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if, before July 1, 2025, a specific date on which a general election will be held is officially announced by the government of Serbia or any of its agencies that have the authority to do so. If no such announcement occurs before July 1, 2025, this question resolves as **No**.\n\nThe election does not have to be held before July 1, 2025; this question resolves based on an announcement.\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nNo additional information available.\n\nToday is 2025-05-15.\n\nBefore answering you think:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n(e) You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
