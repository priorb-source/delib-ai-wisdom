  "information": "In the 2019 and 2021 Canadian federal elections, the Bloc Québécois won 32 seats in Quebec, while the Conservative Party of Canada won 10 seats in each of those elections. Historically, the Bloc has won more seats in Quebec than the Conservatives in the last five to seven elections.\n\nRecent polling data shows a shift in voter support in Quebec. Bloc Québécois support has declined from 37% to a range of 23-27%. Conservative support has remained stable at approximately 23%. The Liberal Party has seen its support surge to between 40-42%. Aggregated polls from sources like Nanos, CROP, Abacus Data, and Ipsos show the Bloc leading the Conservatives by 5 to 17 percentage points province-wide.\n\nSeat projection models, including Canada388 and The Writ, estimate the Bloc Québécois will win between 19 and 25 seats. Projections for the Conservative Party place their seat count between 10 and 12. The increase in Liberal support is reported to primarily affect the Bloc's vote share rather than the Conservatives'. The Conservative party's support is most concentrated in the Quebec City region and its south shore.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "The 2025 Canadian federal election must occur by October 2025. Given we are in late April 2025, the outcome should be known within approximately 2-6 months.",
    "status_quo_outcome": "Yes - The Bloc Québécois wins more seats than the Conservative Party in Quebec. This has been the consistent pattern in recent elections, with the Bloc winning 32 seats versus the Conservatives' 10 in both 2019 and 2021.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "The Conservative Party experiences a major breakthrough in francophone Quebec beyond their traditional Quebec City stronghold, while the Bloc's support collapse accelerates due to the Liberal surge. The Conservatives would need to win 20+ seats while the Bloc falls below that level, requiring a dramatic shift from current projections showing CPC at 10-12 seats and Bloc at 19-25 seats.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Current polling and seat projections hold through election day. The Bloc maintains plurality support (23-27%) in their core ridings despite losing ground to the Liberals, while Conservatives remain confined to their traditional Quebec City base (10-12 seats). Even with the Liberal surge affecting primarily Bloc voters, the Bloc retains enough seats (19-25 projected) to exceed Conservative totals.",
    "rationale": "The historical pattern strongly favors a Yes outcome. The Bloc has consistently won more Quebec seats than the Conservatives in the last 5-7 federal elections, including a 32-10 margin in both 2019 and 2021. Current seat projection models from Canada388 and The Writ estimate the Bloc will win 19-25 seats compared to 10-12 for the Conservatives. Critically, even at the low end of Bloc projections (19 seats) and the high end of Conservative projections (12 seats), the Bloc still wins more seats. Province-wide polling shows the Bloc leading the Conservatives by 5-17 percentage points despite the Bloc's decline from 37% to 23-27%. The Conservative support has remained stable at approximately 23% and is geographically concentrated in the Quebec City region, which provides efficiency in their strongholds but limits their ceiling for seat gains. The Liberal surge to 40-42% is reportedly drawing primarily from Bloc voters rather than Conservative ones, meaning the competitive dynamic between Bloc and Conservatives remains favorable to the Bloc. My forecast is not higher (90%+) because: political volatility exists with the significant Liberal surge still unfolding, polling errors can occur, several months remain until the election allowing for further shifts, and there's a non-zero possibility of an unexpected Conservative breakthrough. My forecast is not lower (60-70%) because: all available evidence points toward the Bloc winning more seats, the margin in projections is substantial (7-15 seat gap at minimum), the historical pattern is very consistent, and Conservative geographic concentration in Quebec limits their upside potential. I would revise upward if new polling showed the gap widening or the Bloc stabilizing/recovering, or if seat projections showed an even larger Bloc advantage. I would revise downward if new polling showed Conservative surge in Quebec, seat projections converging with CPC reaching 18+ seats, or evidence of accelerating Bloc collapse in francophone ridings outside the Liberal surge areas.",
