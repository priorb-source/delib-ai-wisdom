  "information": "On May 22, 2025, the U.S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS) revoked Harvard University's certification for the Student and Exchange Visitor Program (SEVP). Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem announced the decision was due to Harvard's repeated failure to comply with federal law and reporting requirements. The administration accused Harvard of fostering violence, antisemitism, and coordinating with the Chinese Communist Party. Other justifications cited by DHS included creating an 'unsafe environment' hostile to Jewish students, failing to address incidents of campus harassment, and not providing requested government information regarding the conduct of foreign students.",

    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "About one month. The question resolves on July 1, 2025, and today is May 28, 2025.",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No. The Department of Homeland Security revoked Harvard's SEVP certification on May 22, 2025. If this decision is not reversed or suspended by July 1, Harvard will not have the certification.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "The legal and political standoff continues. Harvard's lawsuit against the administration proceeds, but the courts do not issue a preliminary injunction or a stay of the DHS decision by July 1. The Trump administration, firm in its position, makes no concessions, and Harvard's SEVP certification remains revoked on the resolution date.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "A federal court grants Harvard's request for a temporary restraining order or a preliminary injunction, forcing the DHS to reinstate the SEVP certification pending a full hearing of the case. This legal intervention happens before or on July 1, 2025, thus restoring Harvard's ability to enroll international students.",
    "rationale": "My forecast is based on an analysis of the legal and political dynamics at play within a very short timeframe. The status quo is 'No,' as the Trump administration has already taken the significant step of revoking Harvard's SEVP certification. The administration's actions appear to be part of a broader, politically motivated campaign against an institution it perceives as a symbol of the liberal elite. Given this context, a voluntary reversal of the decision is highly unlikely, as it would be perceived as a political defeat.\n\nThe most plausible path to a 'Yes' outcome is through the judicial system. Harvard has filed a lawsuit and will certainly seek a preliminary injunction to halt the revocation. The case for an injunction rests on demonstrating irreparable harm and a likelihood of success on the merits. The irreparable harm to Harvard and its 6,800 affected international students is clear and immediate. The argument for success on the merits would be that the DHS's action was arbitrary, capricious, and an unconstitutional infringement on academic freedom. Courts are often willing to step in to prevent such immediate and severe harm while a case is litigated.\n\nHowever, success is not guaranteed. The administration will argue that its decision is a matter of enforcing federal law and protecting national security, areas where courts typically show deference to the executive branch. The litigation process can also be slow, and securing an injunction within a month is a significant challenge.\n\nMy probability of 35% reflects that while the status quo strongly favors a 'No' outcome, there is a substantial chance—primarily through legal intervention—for a reversal. This forecast is not lower because the case for irreparable harm is compelling, which is a key factor in granting an injunction. It is not higher because the administration is highly motivated to fight this battle, court outcomes are uncertain, and courts are often hesitant to overrule the executive branch on immigration and security-related enforcement actions. I would increase my forecast if a court schedules an emergency hearing quickly or if significant political pressure builds against the administration's decision from within the business community or the Republican party. I would decrease it if Harvard's initial legal motions are denied or if the case is assigned to a judge known for strong deference to the executive branch.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill Harvard University have a Student and Exchange Visitor Program certification on July 1, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nThe Trump administration and Harvard University have been through a significant confrontation, since Trump took office for the second time. This [started](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/22/us/politics/harvard-university-trump.html) with a task force commissioned by Trump to address antisemitism on campus, but quickly spiralled out of control. The administration asked Harvard to provide detailed records on foreign students, including disciplinary actions and involvement in protests, and demanded that Harvard implement changes to its admissions, hiring, and diversity policies. Harvard refused, citing concerns over academic freedom and student privacy. In response, the administration froze or pulled almost \\$4 billion in federal grants and contracts to Harvard and its research partners. Harvard filed a lawsuit against the administration, accusing it of attempting to interfere in academic decision-making and penalising the institution for resisting politically motivated demands.\r\n\r\nThe situation escalated on May 22, 2025, when the Department of Homeland Security [revoked](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/22/us/politics/trump-harvard-international-students.html) Harvard's certification under the Student and Exchange Visitor Program, effectively barring the university from enrolling international students for the 2025–2026 academic year. This action affects approximately 6,800 international students or 27% of Harvard's student body, who must now transfer to other institutions or risk losing their legal status. The administration justified the move by accusing Harvard of fostering a \"toxic campus climate,\" failing to protect Jewish students, and allegedly collaborating with the Chinese Communist Party.\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question will resolve as **Yes** if, on July 1, 2025, Harvard University has a certification under the Student and Exchange Visitor Program (SEVP) programme allowing international students to enroll, according to [credible sources](https://www.metaculus.com/faq/#definitions).\n\n* An announcement that Harvard's certification will be restored on a date after July 1, 2025 will not suffice to resolve this question. The certification needs to be in effect for this to resolve.\r\n* Getting the certification at any point on July 1, 2025 would resolve this question as **Yes**.\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nOn May 22, 2025, the U.S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS) revoked Harvard University's certification for the Student and Exchange Visitor Program (SEVP).

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
