  "information": "Following the March 2025 Greenlandic parliamentary elections, the Demokraatit party, which advocates for a gradual path to independence, emerged as the winner. The new Prime Minister, Jens-Frederik Nielsen, favors incremental autonomy and has emphasized economic development. While the more staunchly pro-independence Naleraq party doubled its number of parliamentary seats, it remains in the opposition. The government has initiated some formal steps, including the presentation of a draft constitution in May 2023 and the formation of a commission under the Self-Government Act to handle independence negotiations; this commission has been given a multi-year mandate.\n\nPublic sentiment in Greenland shows strong support for the principle of independence, with various polls indicating approval from over 80% of the population. However, opinions on the timing vary, with many favoring a more gradual approach. A January 2025 survey revealed that while 84% support independence, 45% of supporters would reconsider if it meant a decline in living standards. The debate over independence has been recently intensified by comments from former U.S. President Donald Trump about acquiring the island, which also prompted a solidarity visit from Danish King Frederik X in late April 2025 and a visit from a U.S. private sector delegation exploring investment opportunities.\n\nGreenland's economy is substantially dependent on an annual block grant from Denmark, which amounts to approximately 4.3 billion Danish kroner and makes up about half of the government's budget. The current government's stated priority is to develop Greenland's mineral resources to build economic self-sufficiency before moving toward political independence. The 2009 Self-Government Act provides the legal basis for Greenland to declare independence through a referendum. Past referendums, such as those in 1979 and 2008, had significantly longer preparation and lead times than the period before the July 1, 2025 deadline.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Less than 2 months, as the question deadline is July 1, 2025.",
    "status_quo_outcome": "The Greenlandic government will continue its gradual approach to independence, focusing on economic development, and no date for an independence referendum will be announced before the deadline.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "The ruling Demokraatit party adheres to its election platform of prioritizing economic self-sufficiency before considering full independence. The government continues the work of its multi-year independence commission but does not feel any urgent political pressure to deviate from its gradualist strategy, and the July 1, 2025 deadline passes without an announcement.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "In response to a sudden domestic political crisis or a significant international incident that inflames nationalist sentiment, the staunchly pro-independence Naleraq party successfully pressures the government. Prime Minister Jens-Frederik Nielsen's coalition makes a surprise strategic decision to announce a referendum date to consolidate its domestic support and assert Greenland's sovereignty on the world stage.",
    "rationale": "My forecast is based on four main factors that strongly indicate a 'No' outcome. First, the ruling Demokraatit party and Prime Minister Jens-Frederik Nielsen won the recent election on an explicit platform of gradualism, prioritizing economic development over a swift move to independence. Announcing a referendum now would directly contradict their mandate. Second, the institutional processes in place, such as the commission formed under the Self-Government Act, have a multi-year mandate, signaling a long-term, deliberate process, not a rush to a vote. Third, the extremely short timeframe of less than two months is insufficient for the political consensus-building and logistical preparation typically required for such a momentous national vote; historical referendums in Greenland had significantly longer lead times. Finally, Greenland's economic dependence on the Danish block grant remains a central issue, and the government's stated policy is to address this before proceeding with an independence vote.\n\nThe probability is not lower than 5% because politics can be unpredictable. The opposition Naleraq party has grown stronger, and a significant external event, such as further provocative statements from a foreign power about Greenland's status, could create unforeseen pressure on the government to act decisively. Public support for independence is high in principle, and this sentiment could be mobilized quickly under the right circumstances.\n\nThe probability is not higher than 5% because the arguments for a 'Yes' outcome rely on the government making a complete and sudden reversal of its core strategy. Such a move would be politically risky and inconsistent with all their recent actions and statements. The status quo, driven by the government's clear and consistent platform, is the most likely path forward. For me to increase my forecast, I would need to see evidence of a major schism within the ruling party or a powerful, sustained public movement demanding an immediate referendum.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nBefore July 1, 2025, will the government of Greenland officially announce a date for an independence referendum?\n\nQuestion background:\nReuters: [Greenland's independence gradualists win election amid Trump control pledge](https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/greenland-election-tests-independence-ambitions-us-interest-looms-2025-03-11/)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if, before July 1, 2025, a referendum on the independence of Greenland from the Denmark is officially scheduled. If this does not occur before that date, this question resolves as **No**.\n\nFor purposes of this question, the referendum will be considered \"officially scheduled\" when it is announced by a person or entity with the authority to do so within Greenland. Please note that broader legality, such as it being overturned by the government of Denmark, will be considered irrelevant for this question.\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nFollowing the March 2025 Greenlandic parliamentary elections, the Demokraatit party, which advocates for a gradual path to independence, emerged as the winner.
