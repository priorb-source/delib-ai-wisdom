    "review": "My initial forecast was likely too pessimistic, interpreting the nine-month period since licensing as a sign of negative delay. Both other forecasters persuasively re-framed this period as a typical, and even long, window for Starlink to complete necessary operational preparations. Forecaster 2's point that the Starlink map shows Sri Lanka as 'Starting Soon' is a particularly strong piece of evidence that I had not weighed, as this status is typically the final stage before service becomes 'Available'. These arguments are convincing and suggest a higher probability of a 'Yes' outcome. However, I believe both forecasters, despite acknowledging risks, are underweighting two key factors. First is the very short remaining timeline of ~45 days, where even minor bureaucratic or logistical snags can easily push the launch past the deadline. Second, and more importantly, is the critical risk raised by Forecaster 3 regarding a potential dependency on ground stations in India, where regulatory approval is not yet finalized. This introduces a major external uncertainty that could act as a hard blocker on the timeline. Therefore, while I agree with the other forecasters that the trajectory is more positive than I initially assessed, their 75% forecast feels too high given this specific and significant dependency risk.",
    "rationale": "After reviewing my peers' analyses, I am updating my forecast upwards. My initial reasoning overemphasized the nine-month period since licensing as a negative signal. The other forecasters correctly pointed out that this is a plausible timeframe for essential on-the-ground preparations, such as importing hardware and setting up infrastructure. The key new piece of information is that Sri Lanka's status on the Starlink map is 'Starting Soon,' which strongly indicates that the company is in the final stages of its pre-launch sequence. This significantly increases the likelihood of a 'Yes' outcome. However, I am not raising my forecast to the 75% level of my peers due to a critical risk that Forecaster 3 identified: a potential dependency on ground stations located in neighboring India. India's regulatory approval for Starlink has not yet been finalized, and any reliance on infrastructure there would likely delay the Sri Lankan service launch. Given the extremely short window of only about 45 days remaining, there is very little buffer to absorb any such external dependency delays or even minor last-minute logistical issues. My updated forecast balances the positive momentum of the license approval and 'Starting Soon' status against the significant, unresolved risk of regional infrastructure dependencies and the unforgiving deadline. I have therefore increased my forecast substantially from 40% to 55%, moving from slightly unlikely to slightly likely.",
