  "information": "In early April 2025, the U.S. administration announced a new trade policy based on 'reciprocal tariffs,' effectively ending the African Growth and Opportunity Act (AGOA) which had allowed many African countries to export goods to the U.S. duty-free. The new policy applies tariffs to approximately 185 countries. The tariff rates are determined by a formula that involves dividing a country's bilateral trade deficit with the U.S. by the amount of U.S. imports from that country, and then dividing the result by two. This policy resulted in varying tariff rates, including 50% for Lesotho and Saint-Pierre and Miquelon, 49% for Cambodia, 46% for Vietnam, 34% for China, and 20% for the European Union. The new tariffs took effect on April 9, 2025, although the U.S. later announced a 90-day pause on introducing new tariffs for some countries, a move not extended to Lesotho.\n\nThe U.S. imposed a 50% tariff on Lesotho due to a significant trade imbalance; in 2024, Lesotho exported approximately $237-240 million worth of goods to the U.S., while importing only about $2.8-3 million from the U.S. The tariff is expected to severely impact Lesotho's economy, particularly its textile and apparel industry, which employs around 40,000 workers and constitutes about 90% of the country's manufacturing employment and exports. In response to the tariff, the Lesotho government announced on April 3, 2025, that it was forming a high-level delegation to travel to Washington to negotiate with U.S. authorities and seek clarification on the tariff's rationale.\n\nThe imposition of new U.S. tariffs prompted various international reactions. The Southern African Development Community (SADC) began assessing the tariffs' impact on the region and planned a high-level summit for June. Within the SADC, Zimbabwe's decision to remove its own tariffs on American imports was criticized by some as undermining regional solidarity. The European Union announced it would delay its own trade countermeasures against the U.S. for 90 days to allow for negotiations. China responded by imposing its own retaliatory tariffs of 34% and filing a formal complaint with the World Trade Organization (WTO).",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Approximately 5 weeks.",
    "status_quo_outcome": "Yes, the tariff is currently 50% and would remain so if nothing changes.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Negotiations by the high-level Lesotho delegation visiting Washington are successful. The US administration agrees to grant Lesotho an exemption or a reduction in the tariff rate before June 1, 2025, and the official harmonized tariff schedule is updated to reflect a rate other than 50%.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "The US administration remains firm on its new 'reciprocal tariffs' policy. Diplomatic efforts by Lesotho fail to secure a change, or any potential review process extends beyond the June 1, 2025 resolution date, leaving the 50% tariff in place.",
    "rationale": "My forecast is heavily weighted towards the status quo. The US implemented the 50% tariff on Lesotho on April 9, 2025, as part of a broad, formula-based policy change. The resolution date is only about five weeks away, which is a very short timeframe for a small nation with limited leverage to overturn a major US policy decision through diplomatic means. Furthermore, the research indicates the US administration deliberately did not extend a 90-day pause on new tariffs to Lesotho, signaling a firm stance. The primary factor favoring a 'Yes' outcome is bureaucratic and political inertia. Reversing a stated policy for one country could undermine the entire framework and invite challenges from numerous other nations. The counter-argument hinges on the success of Lesotho's diplomatic mission. The US may reverse course due to the poor optics of imposing a devastating tariff on a small, developing nation, or as a gesture of goodwill amid broader international criticism. However, the probability of such a rapid reversal is low. My probability is not higher than 90% because there is a non-zero chance that the diplomatic pressure and negative optics lead to a swift concession from the US. My probability is not lower because the structural factors—the existence of the policy, the short timeframe, and the power imbalance—strongly favor the tariff remaining in place. I would lower my probability upon news of concrete progress in the US-Lesotho negotiations. I would raise it if US officials publicly reject Lesotho's appeal.",
