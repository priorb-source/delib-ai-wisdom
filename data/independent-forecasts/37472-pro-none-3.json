    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Less than 2 months.",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No. Sheikh Hasina remains in exile in India, and the interim government in Bangladesh continues to pursue legal cases against her and her administration.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Sheikh Hasina stays in India, deeming a return to Bangladesh too dangerous due to the high likelihood of immediate arrest and prosecution. India does not force her to leave, and any extradition process initiated by Bangladesh does not conclude before the July 1 deadline.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Driven by a desire to rally her political base and challenge the interim government, Sheikh Hasina makes a high-stakes, voluntary return to Bangladesh. Alternatively, India could agree to a swift extradition in a bid to solidify its relationship with the new government in Dhaka, resulting in her involuntary return.",
    "rationale": "My forecast is anchored in the strong status quo, which is that Sheikh Hasina remains in exile in India. The current interim government in Bangladesh is actively pursuing numerous legal cases against her, ranging from corruption to allegations of involvement in extrajudicial killings. A return under these circumstances would almost certainly lead to her immediate arrest and a lengthy legal battle, posing a significant risk to her freedom and personal safety. While she has publicly vowed to return, as noted in the provided background information, a political leader's rhetoric often serves to maintain relevance and rally supporters, and may not translate into immediate action when faced with such high personal stakes. The timeframe for this question is very short, closing on July 1, 2025. It is improbable that the political and legal landscape in Bangladesh will shift dramatically enough in her favor within this period to allow for a safe return. Furthermore, any formal extradition process is typically complex and time-consuming, making its completion before the deadline unlikely. My probability is not lower because Sheikh Hasina has a history of being a determined and bold political actor, and a calculated, high-risk return to galvanize her party cannot be entirely dismissed. The political situation is also fluid, and unforeseen events could precipitate a return. I would increase my forecast if there were credible reports of a political deal for her safe return or if India signaled it would expedite an extradition. Conversely, I would lower it if more severe charges were filed against her or if she publicly revised her timeline for returning.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill Sheikh Hasina return to Bangladesh before July 1, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nFirstpost: [Bangladesh has turned into a ‘terrorist country’: Sheikh Hasina targets Yunus, vows to return](https://www.firstpost.com/world/bangladesh-has-turned-into-a-terrorist-country-sheikh-hasina-targets-yunus-vows-to-return-13878191.html)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if Sheikh Hasina after May 12, 2025 and before July 1, 2025 enters territory of Bangladesh according to [credible sources](https://www.metaculus.com/help/faq/#definitions).\n\nThe circumstances of her entering Bangladeshi territory, whether voluntarily or due to her extradition from India, will not affect resolution.\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nNo additional information available.\n\nToday is 2025-05-08.\n\nBefore answering you think:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n(e) You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
