  "information": "Several other countries in the region or with similar risk profiles have recently been elevated to Level 3. Uganda's advisory was raised due to terrorism risks, political demonstrations, and discriminatory laws. Burundi's Level 3 advisory cites violent crimes like grenade attacks and armed robbery targeting foreigners. The State Department also reissued a Level 3 alert for Bangladesh due to civil unrest, crime, and terrorism, and issued a Level 3 warning for Trinidad and Tobago following a surge in violent crime and a declared state of emergency.",

    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Approximately two months, until July 1, 2025.",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No. The US State Department's travel advisory for Tanzania would remain at its current 'Level 2: Exercise Increased Caution'.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "The security situation in Tanzania remains stable over the next two months, without any major terrorist incidents, significant spikes in violent crime targeting foreigners, or widespread civil unrest that would compel the State Department to escalate its warning.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "A significant security event occurs, such as a terrorist attack in a major city or tourist area, or a sharp, sustained increase in armed crime targeting foreigners. This event crosses a threshold, prompting the US State Department to quickly update its assessment and issue a 'Level 3 – Reconsider Travel' advisory.",
    "rationale": "My forecast is heavily weighted towards the status quo. Travel advisories from the State Department possess significant inertia and are not changed lightly. The current advisory for Tanzania is Level 2, and with only two months remaining until the resolution date, a change would require a significant and unambiguous deterioration in the security environment. The base case is that the existing risks, while real, will not escalate sufficiently to trigger a reassessment and policy change within this short timeframe. The information from my research assistant is valuable as it shows regional precedent for upgrades. The elevation of advisories for Uganda and Burundi for similar reasons (terrorism, crime) confirms that the State Department is actively monitoring and will act if conditions worsen. This prevents me from setting an extremely low probability. However, my forecast is not higher than 20% primarily due to the short window. A major security incident is the most likely catalyst for an upgrade, and while such an event is plausible, it is not probable within any specific two-month period. My forecast is not lower because the underlying threats from crime and terrorism, particularly spillover from the insurgency in Mozambique's Cabo Delgado province, are persistent and volatile. A single high-profile incident could trigger a rapid re-evaluation. I would increase my forecast upon credible reports of specific threats to tourist areas or a noticeable spike in violent incidents targeting foreigners. I would decrease it if the period passes with no major security alerts.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill Tanzania receive a \"Level 3 – Reconsider Travel\" travel advisory from the US State Department before July 1, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nTravel and Tour World: [Travel Advisory for Tanzania: How Increased Crime and Terrorism Threats Impact Tourists in Popular African Destinations](https://www.travelandtourworld.com/news/article/travel-advisory-for-tanzania-how-increased-crime-and-terrorism-threats-impact-tourists-in-popular-african-destinations/)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if the country of Tanzania has received a Level 3 [travel advisory](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/International-Travel-Country-Information-Pages/Tanzania.html) from the US Department of State before July 1, 2025.\n\n\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nSeveral other countries in the region or with similar risk profiles have recently been elevated to Level 3. Uganda's advisory was raised due to terrorism risks, political demonstrations, and discriminatory laws. Burundi's Level 3 advisory cites violent crimes like grenade attacks and armed robbery targeting foreigners.

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
