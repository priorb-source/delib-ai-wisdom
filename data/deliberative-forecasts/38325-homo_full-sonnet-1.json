    "review": "All three analyses converge on similar reasoning with forecasts between 33-38%. The other forecasters raise several important points I should weigh more carefully. Forecaster 3 makes a compelling argument that the second estimate already incorporated additional data but only achieved a 0.1 pp upward revision, suggesting remaining data may not contain major surprises. Both Forecasters 2 and 3 emphasize that we need a revision exceeding 0.2 pp, which is at or above the typical upper bound of second-to-third estimate revisions (0.1-0.2 pp). This is a stronger caution than I initially weighted. However, I note that all of us are anchoring on the same 35-40% historical precedent for advance estimates in the -0.5% to 0% range. The key disagreement is how to condition on the additional information that the second estimate is -0.2% rather than something more negative. Forecaster 2 and 3 interpret this as suggesting the easiest upward revisions have already been captured, making further large revisions less likely. This is reasonable but not definitive - the third estimate includes annual benchmark revisions which can be more substantial than typical data updates.",
    "rationale": "Upon reflection, the other forecasters make valid points about needing a larger-than-typical revision from second to third estimate. The fact that we've already seen one upward revision (+0.1 pp) and still need >0.2 pp more suggests we need something at the upper end of or exceeding typical revision magnitudes. However, several factors prevent me from dropping to 33%: (1) We're extremely close to the threshold at -0.2%, making the required revision much smaller in absolute terms than if we were at -0.5% or -1.0%; (2) The upward revision trend has begun and momentum matters; (3) The third estimate incorporates annual benchmark revisions to trade and services data, which can be more substantial than routine updates; (4) The 35-40% historical precedent for this range remains highly relevant, even if we've updated on the second estimate. The other forecasters appropriately weight the challenge of needing a larger-than-typical final revision, but may slightly underweight how close we are to the threshold and the potential impact of benchmark revisions. I'll update downward to 36% to acknowledge their valid concerns while maintaining that the combination of proximity to zero, upward momentum, and benchmark revisions justifies staying within the historical precedent range.",
