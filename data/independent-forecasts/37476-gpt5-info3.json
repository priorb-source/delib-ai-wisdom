  "information": "In early 2025, GoPro announced it was named the official camera of the 2025 Freeride World Tour for the 12th consecutive year. The company also released a minor upgrade to its GoPro Max panoramic camera in February 2025. Reports in May 2025 also noted the release of a new GoPro Hero13 camera featuring an anamorphic lens. The company's most significant debt maturity is a convertible note due in November 2025.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "About 53 days (until July 1, 2025)",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "GoPro continues operating and managing liquidity through Q2, ships its recent/announced products, pays vendors, and does not trip any covenants or face accelerations. Any balance-sheet action around the November 2025 convertible notes (refinance/exchange/equity raise) is pursued later in Q2–Q3 without requiring a court process before July 1.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "An abrupt liquidity crisis emerges before July 1: a covenant breach or acceleration on a credit facility, a failed capital raise, severe sales shortfall leading to vendor tightening, or a large legal/judgment event. Management, seeing no credible out-of-court path and with limited cash, files a pre-pack/pre-arranged Chapter 11 ahead of the November 2025 converts.",
    "rationale": "Baseline: Bankruptcy filings by established consumer-electronics brands without an imminent maturity wall are uncommon over a 7–8 week window. The research assistant notes that GoPro has continued active marketing (official camera of the 2025 Freeride World Tour), shipped product refreshes in early 2025 (Max update; reports of a Hero13 variant), and that the most significant debt maturity is a convertible note due November 2025—after this market closes date. These are consistent with ongoing operations and suggest no immediate hard catalyst before July 1.\n\nFrom GoPro’s 2024 results press release, there was no public signal of an imminent filing such as an announced missed payment, explicit liquidity crisis, or stated need to seek court protection. While operating challenges likely persist (competitive market, pressure on margins, historical losses), companies typically attempt out-of-court measures (cost cuts, exchanges, equity raises, asset-light pivots) before resorting to Chapter 11—especially when the main maturity is months away.\n\nWhy not higher: No obvious near-term maturity or known acceleration trigger before July 1; continued product cadence and partnerships; short time horizon. There has been no widely reported missed interest/principal payment, going-concern emergency 8-K, or hiring of restructuring advisors publicly disclosed, which often precede filings.\n\nWhy not lower: Consumer electronics demand is volatile; GoPro has faced multi-year revenue and profitability pressures and may be burning cash seasonally in 1H. If they have a revolver or ABL with tight covenants/borrowing base limits, a sharp Q1/Q2 drawdown or inventory issues could create a sudden squeeze. Supplier tightening or an adverse legal development could also force a filing faster than expected.\n\nWhat would move me up: Any 8-K about covenant breaches or forbearances; missed or delayed payments; going-concern language tied to near-term liquidity; engagement of restructuring advisors (e.g., Alvarez & Marsal, PJT, Kirkland); vendor shipment holds; attempts at distressed exchanges rejected by noteholders; large unexpected liabilities.\n\nWhat would move me down: Solid Q1 2025 results with stable/positive operating cash flow; disclosure of ample cash and undrawn facilities; successful financing, asset sale, or convertible note extension/exchange; reaffirmed guidance and clean auditor language; evidence of improving channel sell-through.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill GoPro file for bankruptcy before July 1, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\n[GoPro Announces Fourth Quarter and 2024 Results](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1500435/000150043525000003/gpro2024-12x31exh991xer.htm)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question will resolve as **Yes** if GoPro, Inc., files any petition for bankruptcy protection in the United States, under any chapter of the United States Bankruptcy Code, before July 1, 2025. The question will resolves on the filing of such a petition, not on whether any bankruptcy protection is granted by a court. If no such petition is filed by that date, this question will resolve as **No**.\n\n\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nIn early 2025, GoPro announced it was named the official camera of the 2025 Freeride World Tour for the 12th consecutive year. The company also released a minor upgrade to its GoPro Max panoramic camera in February 2025. Reports in May 2025 also noted the release of a new GoPro Hero13 camera featuring an anamorphic lens.

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
