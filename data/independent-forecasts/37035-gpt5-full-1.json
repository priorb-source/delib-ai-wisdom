  "information": "Colombia has declared a national health and economic emergency due to a yellow fever outbreak. As of April 2025, reports indicate 79 confirmed cases and 36 deaths since September 2024, with a case fatality rate cited as approximately 45-50%. The government has ordered a mass vaccination campaign and requires travelers to high-risk areas, and those arriving from certain countries like Brazil and Ecuador, to present a yellow fever vaccination card. The Ministry of Health has identified over 400 municipalities as being at 'high' or 'very high' risk.\n\nThe U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) issued a Level 2 \"Practice Enhanced Precautions\" travel notice for yellow fever in South America in April 2025, which includes Colombia. This notice advises travelers to get vaccinated. Historically, the CDC has not elevated yellow fever outbreaks beyond Level 2, even during larger epidemics such as those in Brazil (2017–18, with over 2,000 cases) and Nigeria (2019). Level 3 notices are typically reserved for situations with sustained urban transmission, overwhelmed healthcare capacity, or for diseases where risk cannot be mitigated by standard measures like vaccination.\n\nThe current yellow fever outbreak in Colombia is primarily concentrated in rural departments with low tourist traffic, such as Tolima and Putumayo. As of late April 2025, there have been no verified cases of urban transmission in major cities like Bogotá, Medellín, or Cartagena. The Pan American Health Organization (PAHO) has reported a total of 131 cases and 53 deaths across the Americas in the first three months of 2025, with cases primarily found in Brazil, Colombia, and Peru. While neighboring countries have issued alerts, they have not implemented entry bans.",

    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "About 5.5 weeks (~39 days) until the June 1, 2025 check",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No — the notice remains at Level 2 (Practice Enhanced Precautions) on June 1, 2025",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Yellow fever transmission remains focused in rural departments with no sustained urban spread, vaccination campaigns scale up, and CDC maintains a Level 2 alert advising vaccination and enhanced precautions but not advising against nonessential travel.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Evidence of sustained urban transmission in a major Colombian city (e.g., Bogotá, Medellín, Cali, Cartagena) or clear indications that risk to travelers cannot be mitigated by vaccination (e.g., severe vaccine supply constraints or overwhelmed health services) prompts CDC to issue a Level 3 Warning (Avoid Nonessential Travel) for Colombia before June 1, 2025.",
    "rationale": "I place heavy weight on the status quo because CDC rarely upgrades yellow fever outbreaks to Level 3. The research assistant notes that as of April 2025 Colombia has declared an emergency with about 79 confirmed cases and 36 deaths since Sept 2024, and PAHO reports 131 cases and 53 deaths across the Americas in Q1 2025. CDC issued a Level 2 South America yellow fever notice in April 2025 covering Colombia and advising vaccination.\n\nHistorical base rate: During larger outbreaks (e.g., Brazil 2017–18 with >2,000 cases), CDC still maintained Level 2 rather than Level 3. CDC typically reserves Level 3 for situations where risk cannot be effectively mitigated (e.g., no available countermeasures) or where there is sustained urban transmission and/or severe healthcare strain. Yellow fever risk to travelers can be substantially mitigated with vaccination, and CDC generally leans toward Level 2 alerts for YF, sometimes with area-specific guidance.\n\nCurrent epidemiology and geography: The outbreak is concentrated in rural departments with low tourist traffic, and as of late April there are no verified urban transmission chains in major cities. Colombia has initiated mass vaccination and is requiring proof of vaccination for travelers to high-risk areas. These developments support maintaining Level 2.\n\nTime constraint: There are only ~5–6 weeks until the resolution date. A shift to Level 3 within that window would likely require a clear, acute deterioration—most plausibly confirmed urban transmission in a major city or evidence that vaccination cannot be accessed to mitigate risk for travelers. Neither is presently reported.\n\nWhy not higher: Base-rate evidence (Brazil 2017–18, Nigeria 2019) and current lack of urban spread make a Level 3 escalation unlikely in the short timeframe. CDC also just issued a regional Level 2 in April, and policy shifts of this magnitude are infrequent and deliberative.\n\nWhy not lower: There is a declared emergency, high-risk municipalities, and a high case fatality ratio in reported cases; rainy season can boost vector populations. A rapid deterioration with urban transmission is plausible, if still unlikely, within a few weeks. Vaccine supply or delivery constraints could also raise traveler risk.\n\nWhat would move me higher: Credible reports (PAHO/WHO/Colombian MoH/CDC) of sustained urban transmission in a major city; multiple traveler cases linked to urban centers; documented vaccine shortages preventing travelers from accessing YF vaccine; CDC health advisory hinting at or announcing area-specific ‘avoid nonessential travel’ guidance within Colombia.\n\nWhat would move me lower: Clear evidence that cases are plateauing/declining, no urban transmission by mid-May, robust vaccine availability and coverage in high-risk areas, and continued CDC communications reinforcing Level 2 guidance.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill the CDC raise the Travel Health Notice status of Colombia to above level 3 before June 1, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\n[Colombia’s Economic Emergency As Yellow Fever Outbreak Threatens Tourism And Agricultural Exports](https://www.travelandtourworld.com/news/article/colombias-economic-emergency-as-yellow-fever-outbreak-threatens-tourism-and-agricultural-exports/) | CDC: [Travel Health Notices](https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/travel/notices)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below.

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any).
