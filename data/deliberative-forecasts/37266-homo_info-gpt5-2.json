    "review": "Both forecasters align with my base view that nationwide Level 4 requires a major, broadly distributed deterioration and that State has historically managed Mozambique with a Level 3 nationally and regional Do Not Travel in the north. The most useful new element is Forecaster 2’s note about suspected late-April/early-May jihadist activity in Niassa and a related U.S. Embassy warning, plus UK/Canada tightening regional cautions. That does slightly increase near-term tail risk relative to my initial take. Forecaster 3’s point about SADC drawdown and cyclone season tapering is also relevant: the former adds uncertainty while the latter reduces disaster-driven Level 4 risk. I find F2’s 15% a bit high absent evidence of embassy ordered/authorized departure, sustained attacks in major southern/central cities, or peer governments moving to nationwide “avoid all travel.” F3’s 8% is closer to my prior. I’m persuaded to nudge up modestly on the Niassa/embassy alert signal, but the short time window and lack of nationwide triggers keep the probability low.",
    "rationale": "Status quo is a long-running Level 3 nationwide with Level 4 applied to parts of Cabo Delgado (and sometimes adjacent areas). Inertia and base rates favor no change over a ~60-day window unless a clear catalyst emerges. The reported spread/flare in Niassa and a fresh embassy security alert slightly raise the odds of a broader reassessment, and peer advisories tightening regionally are consistent with elevated but localized risk. However, a move to nationwide Level 4 typically coincides with: ordered/authorized departure at the U.S. Embassy; persistent mass violence in multiple regions; credible targeting of foreigners in major cities; or compound crises that cripple state capacity. None of those are currently evidenced. With cyclone season winding down and no sign of a dramatic embassy posture shift or peer nationwide “do not travel,” a rapid change to Level 4 by July 1 remains a tail outcome. I’m increasing my forecast marginally to reflect the Niassa signal and recent alerts, but I still see the bar for a nationwide Level 4 as unmet in this timeframe.",
