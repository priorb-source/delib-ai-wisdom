  "information": "In late April 2025, North Korea conducted the first weapons system tests for its new 5,000-ton 'Choe Hyon-class' destroyer. The tests, observed by leader Kim Jong Un, included the launch of supersonic cruise missiles, strategic cruise missiles, and anti-aircraft missiles. The warship is expected to be delivered to the navy and enter service in early 2026. Earlier in 2025, North Korea conducted several other weapons tests. In April, it tested the 'Haeil-2' underwater attack drone. In February, it test-launched strategic cruise missiles. In January, it conducted its first missile test of the year, firing an intermediate-range ballistic missile with a hypersonic glide vehicle.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "About 61 days (until July 1, 2025)",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "North Korea continues frequent missile, cruise, naval, and UAV/drone tests and harsh rhetoric, but refrains from a nuclear detonation. Punggye-ri shows no clear surge in pre-test activity visible in open sources; Beijing and Moscow quietly discourage a nuclear test; Pyongyang calculates it can signal resolve without crossing the nuclear threshold before July.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Satellite imagery and allied intel indicate renewed, distinctive activity at Punggye-ri (e.g., tunnel prep, equipment staging). Pyongyang times a low-to-moderate-yield underground detonation to validate a tactical warhead design or to mark a political/military milestone (e.g., around June 25), framing it as necessary for deterrence against US–ROK–Japan moves.",
    "rationale": "- Baseline and recent behavior: The last DPRK nuclear test was in 2017 despite multiple windows since 2022 when analysts judged a site ready. That seven-plus-year pause suggests a low base hazard for any given month. The research assistant notes a flurry of 2025 tests (IRBM with HGV in January, strategic cruise missiles in February, Haeil-2 UUV in April, and late-April weapons trials from a new destroyer). This pattern shows active conventional and missile development without crossing the nuclear-test threshold.\n- Costs vs benefits: A nuclear test would be unambiguously detected by the IMS and prompt broad international pushback, likely including Chinese disapproval—costly at a time when Pyongyang benefits from tacit support. Pyongyang can continue advancing delivery systems and claim warhead progress without an actual detonation.\n- Timing: Only about two months remain. While June 25 could be symbolically attractive, there are no publicly reported, credible indicators of imminent Punggye-ri test prep right now. Absent such signals, the short window keeps odds modest.\n- Why not higher: Lack of fresh OSINT/official warnings specific to Punggye-ri; long restraint since 2017; high diplomatic cost; sufficient signaling via non-nuclear tests.\n- Why not lower: The site is believed to be technically usable; DPRK has a history of surprise escalations; tensions are elevated; political symbolism dates exist; an underground test remains a tool to validate tactical nuke designs and bolster coercive leverage.\n- What would move me up: Credible satellite imagery of renewed, sustained activity at Punggye-ri; allied intel leaks stating a test appears imminent; DPRK propaganda explicitly foreshadowing a nuclear validation; crisis escalation tied to US strategic asset deployments. What would move me down: Signals of renewed restraint (e.g., PRC–DPRK engagement conditioning aid on no test), or clear indicators that Punggye-ri is inactive/compromised in the near term.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill North Korea test a nuclear weapon before July 1, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nAccording to Wikipedia, \"North Korea has conducted six nuclear tests, in 2006, 2009, 2013, twice in 2016, and in 2017.\"\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if before July 1, 2025, North Korea tests a nuclear weapon, according to [credible source](https://www.metaculus.com/help/faq/#definitions) reporting such as the [International Monitoring System’s ](https://www.ctbto.org/our-work/detecting-nuclear-tests) and the sources cited at Wikipedia's [List of nuclear weapons tests of North Korea](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_nuclear_weapons_tests_of_North_Korea).\n\n\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nIn late April 2025, North Korea conducted the first weapons system tests for its new 5,000-ton 'Choe Hyon-class' destroyer.

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
