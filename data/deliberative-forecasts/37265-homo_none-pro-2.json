    "review": "All three forecasters are in strong agreement on the primary drivers of this question: the significant bureaucratic inertia of US State Department travel advisories, the very short time frame (under two months), and the high bar required for an advisory level to be escalated. We converge on the idea that the status quo (Level 2) is the most likely outcome, and a 'Yes' resolution would require a major, unforeseen event. Forecaster 2 introduced the valid point of potential pre-election tensions, as the next general election is later in 2025. While this adds a layer of uncertainty, the peak risk period is likely beyond the resolution date. Forecaster 3 provided a crucial piece of evidence I had not explicitly considered: the existence of a targeted 'Level 4 – Do Not Travel' advisory for the Mtwara Region near the Mozambique border. I find this argument particularly convincing. It demonstrates that the State Department already employs geographically specific warnings for Tanzania and is not reliant on country-wide upgrades to flag localized danger. This significantly strengthens the case for the status quo persisting at a national level.",
    "rationale": "After reviewing the other analyses, I am maintaining my forecast. My reasoning is reinforced, particularly by the point raised by Forecaster 3. The existence of a specific Level 4 advisory for the border region near Mozambique shows a precedent for targeted warnings. This makes a country-wide escalation to Level 3 less likely, as the State Department has a mechanism to address heightened risk in a specific area without changing the overall assessment. An event would need to be very significant or widespread to overcome this tendency. The known risks of crime and terrorism are already factored into the current Level 2 advisory. While Forecaster 2's point about pre-election tension is noted, it is unlikely to escalate into a trigger for a country-wide advisory change within the short remaining timeframe. Therefore, the combination of bureaucratic inertia, the short timeline, and the precedent for geographically targeted warnings keeps my forecast for a country-wide Level 3 advisory low.",
