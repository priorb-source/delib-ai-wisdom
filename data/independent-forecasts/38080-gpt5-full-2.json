  "information": "On May 22, 2025, the U.S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS) revoked Harvard University's certification for the Student and Exchange Visitor Program (SEVP). Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem announced the decision was due to Harvard's repeated failure to comply with federal law and reporting requirements. The administration accused Harvard of fostering violence, antisemitism, and coordinating with the Chinese Communist Party. Other justifications cited by DHS included creating an 'unsafe environment' hostile to Jewish students, failing to address incidents of campus harassment, and not providing requested government information regarding the conduct of foreign students.\n\nThe SEVP certification revocation would prohibit Harvard from enrolling new international students holding F or J visas for the 2025-2026 academic year. The decision affects approximately 6,800 current international students, who constitute about 27% of Harvard's student body. These students would be required to transfer to other SEVP-certified institutions or risk losing their legal status in the United States. Following the announcement, the University of Tokyo stated it is considering accepting affected Harvard students, and the Chinese Foreign Ministry pledged to protect the rights of its overseas students.\n\nIn response to the DHS action, Harvard University filed a lawsuit against the administration. On May 23, 2025, a federal judge granted Harvard a temporary restraining order (TRO), which has halted the enforcement of the SEVP certification revocation. As a result of the TRO, Harvard's certification is currently considered active. The university's lawsuit alleges that the administration's actions are unconstitutional retaliation that violates the First Amendment, the Due Process Clause, and the Administrative Procedure Act. A court hearing to determine whether a preliminary injunction will be issued is scheduled for May 29.",

    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Approximately 34 days (until July 1, 2025)",
    "status_quo_outcome": "Yes — a TRO currently keeps Harvard’s SEVP certification active pending further court action.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "The court denies a preliminary injunction on May 29 (or soon after), the TRO expires, appellate courts decline to issue an emergency stay, and DHS’s revocation takes effect before July 1, leaving Harvard without SEVP certification on that date.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "The court grants a preliminary injunction on May 29 and it remains in force through July 1; or, if the PI is denied, an appellate court issues a stay keeping Harvard’s certification active through July 1.",
    "rationale": "Key facts from the research assistant: DHS revoked Harvard’s SEVP certification on May 22; Harvard sued; a federal judge issued a TRO on May 23 that currently keeps certification active; a preliminary injunction hearing is set for May 29. The question resolves Yes if Harvard has active SEVP certification on July 1; an announcement of future restoration is insufficient. The status quo today is that certification is active due to the TRO. Courts often maintain the status quo in high-stakes cases affecting thousands of third parties, especially when the movant shows irreparable harm and at least serious questions on the merits. The TRO issuance is a positive signal for Harvard’s chance at a preliminary injunction (though not determinative). If a PI is granted, it typically stays in place through litigation, which would likely extend past July 1. Even if the PI is denied, Harvard is likely to seek an emergency stay from the First Circuit; the short timeline and the magnitude of disruption to 6,800 international students improve the odds of interim relief that preserves certification into July. Against this, the administration will argue compliance and security/anti-discrimination rationales, and may seek a stay of any PI from appellate courts or the Supreme Court. A rapid appellate stay that strips certification before July 1 is plausible but, in my view, less likely than the status quo being maintained. Why not higher? There is real downside risk that the PI is denied and that appellate courts decline emergency relief, or that a PI (if granted) is stayed promptly on appeal given the high-profile nature and asserted national security/Title VI concerns. Why not lower? The TRO already in place, the court’s inclination to prevent immediate disruption to thousands of students, and the short time window to July 1 all favor certification remaining active. What would move me up: a granted PI with language emphasizing strong likelihood of success; reports that DHS agrees to maintain status quo pending litigation; early signs of favorable appellate posture for Harvard. What would move me down: denial of the PI and dissolution of the TRO; swift appellate denials of a stay; credible revelations of clear, documented regulatory noncompliance by Harvard that courts defer to.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill Harvard University have a Student and Exchange Visitor Program certification on July 1, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nThe Trump administration and Harvard University have been through a significant confrontation, since Trump took office for the second time. This [started](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/22/us/politics/harvard-university-trump.html) with a task force commissioned by Trump to address antisemitism on campus, but quickly spiralled out of control. The administration asked Harvard to provide detailed records on foreign students, including disciplinary actions and involvement in protests, and demanded that Harvard implement changes to its admissions, hiring, and diversity policies. Harvard refused, citing concerns over academic freedom and student privacy. In response, the administration froze or pulled almost \\$4 billion in federal grants and contracts to Harvard and its research partners. Harvard filed a lawsuit against the administration, accusing it of attempting to interfere in academic decision-making and penalising the institution for resisting politically motivated demands.\r\n\r\nThe situation escalated on May 22, 2025, when the Department of Homeland Security [revoked](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/22/us/politics/trump-harvard-international-students.html) Harvard's certification under the Student and Exchange Visitor Program, effectively barring the university from enrolling international students for the 2025–2026 academic year. This action affects approximately 6,800 international students or 27% of Harvard's student body, who must now transfer to other institutions or risk losing their legal status. The administration justified the move by accusing Harvard of fostering a \"toxic campus climate,\" failing to protect Jewish students, and allegedly collaborating with the Chinese Communist Party.\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question will resolve as **Yes** if, on July 1, 2025, Harvard University has a certification under the Student and Exchange Visitor Program (SEVP) programme allowing international students to enroll, according to [credible sources](https://www.metaculus.com/faq/#definitions).\n\n* An announcement that Harvard's certification will be restored on a date after July 1, 2025 will not suffice to resolve this question. The certification needs to be in effect for this to resolve.\r\n* Getting the certification at any point on July 1, 2025 would resolve this question as **Yes**.\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nOn May 22, 2025, the U.S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS) revoked Harvard University's certification for the Student and Exchange Visitor Program (SEVP).

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
