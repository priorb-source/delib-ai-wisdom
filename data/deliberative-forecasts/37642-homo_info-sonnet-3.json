    "review": "Both forecasters provide compelling evidence that meaningfully updates my understanding. Forecaster 2 introduces specific Fed language ('not in a hurry,' needing 'more consistent improvement') and the critical detail that the Fed raised its inflation estimate in March 2025—a hawkish signal I overlooked. Forecaster 3 provides concrete examples of major institutions pushing forecasts back: Goldman Sachs moved from July to December, others shifted from June to July. This backward movement in expectations is highly significant. The key insight I missed is the TREND: forecasters are moving expectations later, not earlier. This directional movement is as important as the point estimates themselves. Forecaster 3's emphasis that Bloomberg consensus moved from May to July directly undermines my initial assessment. Both forecasters also note the US-China tariff agreement and specific inflation data (2.7%) that I didn't adequately weight. Their convergence on 18% with detailed supporting evidence is notable. My 25% forecast now appears too optimistic given: (1) explicit Fed patience language, (2) the trend moving away from early cuts, (3) hawkish inflation estimate increase, (4) unanimous major institution forecasts for July or later. However, I maintain that some probability exists for unexpected shocks in a 6-7 week window, though this alone doesn't justify 25%.",
    "rationale": "After reviewing the other analyses, I'm updating my forecast downward. The most persuasive new evidence includes: (1) the Fed explicitly raising its inflation estimate in March 2025, which is a hawkish signal indicating they see persistent inflation pressures; (2) major financial institutions have moved their forecasts BACKWARD—Goldman Sachs from July to December is particularly striking; (3) the directional trend matters—when consensus moves from May to July, that's the opposite of what we'd need for a pre-July cut; (4) specific Fed language about being 'not in a hurry' and needing 'more consistent improvement' suggests a deliberate, patient approach incompatible with a June surprise cut. My initial 25% failed to adequately weight these factors. The 1.5-month timeframe likely allows only one scheduled meeting (mid-June), and both the Fed's explicit messaging and the backward trend in forecasts make a June cut highly unlikely. The only realistic path to Yes is an emergency cut triggered by a severe economic shock—financial crisis, sharp labor market deterioration, or systemic stress. While such tail events remain possible over 6-7 weeks, they're rare by definition. The weight of evidence—explicit Fed guidance, hawkish inflation signals, backward-moving forecasts, and strong recent economic data—points to a materially lower probability than my initial assessment.",
