    "review": "Forecaster 2 leans heavily on the idea that licensing is the primary barrier and that Starlink tends to move quickly afterward, arguing the 6–7 month window makes activation likely. Forecaster 3 emphasizes the status quo, lack of public launch signals, and the possibility that Chad is a lower-priority, smaller market, making a near-term flip less likely. The new argument I hadn’t explicitly weighed is F2’s framing that post-license steps may be minimal if no local gateway is required, which can shorten timelines. However, I find F3’s caution more convincing: the absence of observable pre-launch indicators by mid-May, the small addressable market, and the variability in Africa rollouts suggest the delay might persist beyond the next 6 weeks. Also, license-to-availability timelines can stretch unpredictably; 6–9 months isn’t unusual. F2’s 75% seems too high given the short runway and no visible momentum. F3’s 40% aligns closely with my prior view.",
    "rationale": "About 46 days remain, and the current map (as far as known here) does not show availability. While the November 2024 license is a strong positive and Starlink sometimes activates countries in batches without local gateways, the lack of any public launch chatter or reseller activity by mid-May is a meaningful negative signal. Chad’s market size and operational complexity could make it a lower priority, increasing the chance of a slip into Q3. At the same time, an end-of-quarter June push is plausible, and only a single area needs to turn “Available” to resolve Yes. Netting these, I keep the forecast modestly below even odds and slightly trim it on status quo weight and lack of signals.",
