  "information": "The preliminary University of Michigan Consumer Sentiment Index for April 2025 was 50.8, the second-lowest level since records began in 1952. This represented the fourth consecutive monthly decline, a drop of 11% from the March 2025 reading of 57.0, and a cumulative decline of over 30% since December 2024. According to Surveys of Consumers Director Joanne Hsu, the decline was 'pervasive and unanimous across age, income, education, geographic region, and political affiliation.'\n\nMultiple reports highlighted significant macroeconomic concerns. Year-ahead inflation expectations rose to 6.7%, the highest level recorded since 1981, with consumers widely citing worries about tariffs. The share of consumers expecting unemployment to rise increased for the fifth consecutive month, reaching its highest point since 2009. Concurrently, the Conference Board’s Leading Economic Indicators registered four consecutive monthly drops. Policy uncertainty was also a factor, with ongoing tariff implementation, market volatility, and potential changes in Federal Reserve leadership.\n\nSpecific industries and markets have shown negative reactions to the economic climate. Moody's Ratings downgraded the retail industry's outlook to 'negative' due to 'bleak' prospects amid the ongoing trade war, predicting that tariffs will harm profitability and raise consumer prices. In response to tariffs, Volkswagen has implemented an 'import surcharge', and companies like Temu, Shein, and Hermès announced price increases. The financial markets have also been volatile, with the S&P 500 Index falling significantly after the tariff announcement. Separately, the U.S. beef industry has expressed concern that poor consumer sentiment could negatively impact demand.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "About 2–3 weeks until the preliminary May reading (typically the second Friday of the month, around May 9–10). Final May reading by late May/early June, but prelim will likely resolve it.",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No — continued pervasive weakness keeps May at or below 50.8.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Tariff headlines persist or escalate, gasoline prices tick up seasonally, equities stay volatile, and early-May labor data/claims soften. Inflation expectations remain elevated near April’s spike, reinforcing household pessimism. May prelim prints in the high 40s to low 50s, ≤50.8.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "News flow calms: markets stabilize or rebound, no fresh tariff shocks, and early-May data (jobs, CPI) are benign. Inflation expectations ease from April’s spike. Even a modest mean-reversion from an extreme low lifts the index a couple points above 50.8.",
    "rationale": "Baseline facts: The April 2025 preliminary University of Michigan Consumer Sentiment reading printed 50.8, the second-lowest on record, after four consecutive monthly declines and an 11% drop from March. The decline was broad-based across demographics. Year-ahead inflation expectations jumped to 6.7% (highest since 1981). Consumers increasingly expect higher unemployment. Broader macro signals (Conference Board LEI down four straight months), tariff uncertainty, and equity volatility compound the weakness.\n\nTwo forces pull in opposite directions for May: (1) status-quo momentum and elevated inflation expectations argue for continued depression or further slippage; (2) regression to the mean from an extreme low argues for at least a small bounce. Historically, after very sharp drops and at very low levels, the Michigan index often posts a modest rebound the next month, but that’s not guaranteed when negative catalysts persist.\n\nWhy lean slightly No: I put extra weight on the status quo. The April print reflected not just a one-off shock but accumulating concerns (tariffs, prices, labor market fears). Inflation expectations spiking to a multi-decade high tends to be sticky month-to-month and is a key input into the survey’s mood. Seasonal gasoline price pressure and any continued market instability could keep households downbeat. That makes a further dip or a flat reading (≤50.8) a bit more likely than a rebound.\n\nWhy not lower: The threshold is very low. It doesn’t take optimism—just an absence of fresh bad news—for May to tick above 50.8. From these depressed levels, even small improvements in markets or inflation narratives can lift sentiment by 1–3 points. That pulls the probability toward the middle.\n\nWhy not higher: The breadth of April’s decline, the surge in inflation expectations, and ongoing policy/trade uncertainty suggest persistence. With four straight monthly declines, the prior trend is negative and may carry into early May sentiment interviews.\n\nWhat would move me higher: Calmer tariff rhetoric or de-escalation; equity rebound; a benign April CPI print or falling gas prices; a solid jobs report without deterioration in unemployment/claims; early leaks/commentary from the survey hinting at easing inflation expectations.\n\nWhat would move me lower: Additional tariff measures or retaliations; a weak jobs report or rising jobless claims; a hot inflation print or gasoline price spike; renewed equity selloff; continued reports of price hikes from large consumer-facing firms.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill the May 2025 University of Michigan Consumer Sentiment number be greater than it was for April 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nCNN: [US consumer sentiment plummets to second-lowest level on records going back to 1952](https://www.cnn.com/2025/04/11/economy/us-consumer-sentiment-april/index.html)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if the University of Michigan's reported Index of Consumer Sentiment, expected to be located [here](http://www.sca.isr.umich.edu/), is greater than 50.8 for May 2025. Less than or equal to that amount resolves the question as **No**.\n\nPreliminary results are sufficient to resolve the question. If there is any confusion about the number, Metaculus will resolve based on whatever number is posted at [this pdf](http://www.sca.isr.umich.edu/files/tbcics.pdf) that is labelled as May 2025, including preliminary. For example, on April 11, 2025 the number displayed was 50.8 for April 2025 (P).\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nThe preliminary University of Michigan Consumer Sentiment Index for April 2025 was 50.8, the second-lowest level since records began in 1952.

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
