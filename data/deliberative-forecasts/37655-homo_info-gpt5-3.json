    "review": "Both forecasters add concrete and relevant points I underweighted. Forecaster 2 brings the fresh May 15 extension of martial law and mobilization to August 6, 2025, which pushes well past the July 1 cutoff and reinforces the legal/political inertia. Forecaster 3 clarifies authority: only a Verkhovna Rada resolution (not the President’s Office or Cabinet) would satisfy the announcement criterion, and notes explicit denials of near‑term elections by the executive. Both emphasize there is no procedural need to announce before July 1 for an October date, and that wartime precedent strongly disfavors taking such steps under martial law. I find their reasoning persuasive and it highlights that my prior was too high given the legal/authority hurdles and the new extension through early August.",
    "rationale": "I’m updating down substantially. Since martial law has just been extended to August 6, the baseline is no announcement before July 1. To get a Yes, the Rada would need to either (a) lift martial law early, (b) amend the legal framework to allow scheduling under martial law, or (c) nonetheless pass a resolution naming a date (potentially conditional) while martial law remains. All are possible but unlikely in the next ~6 weeks absent a ceasefire or major political decision. There’s also no deadline pressure to announce for an October date before July 1, and public messaging has leaned against wartime elections. I still leave a small tail for a pre‑commitment move (e.g., Rada names an October date to signal intent) or a surprise legal carve‑out, but these are low‑probability. Accordingly, I reduce my forecast from 18% to 5%.",
