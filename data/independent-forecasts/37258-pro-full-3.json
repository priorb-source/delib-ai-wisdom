  "information": "A 2022 UK Supreme Court ruling established that the Scottish Parliament cannot unilaterally hold a legally binding independence referendum without the approval of the UK Parliament in Westminster. The UK government has consistently denied requests for another referendum, a position reiterated by the UK Labour party. The previous independence referendum in 2014 was announced approximately two years before it was held, and precedent suggests constitutional changes require around 18 months of legal and administrative lead time.\n\nIn January 2025, Scotland's First Minister John Swinney described independence as an 'urgent priority'. However, former First Minister Nicola Sturgeon stated in the same month that a referendum was 'off the radar' for now and unlikely before the 2030s. More recent government announcements in April 2025 indicate a strategic focus on the economy, child poverty, and public services. The Scottish Labour leader, Anas Sarwar, has stated his party will not support an independence referendum during the next Holyrood term, regardless of the 2026 election outcome. The leader of the Alba Party, Kenny MacAskill, has suggested using the May 2026 Holyrood elections as a direct mandate for negotiating independence rather than holding a separate referendum.\n\nThe Scottish Government has issued guidance advising against significant or high-profile government announcements between May 15 and June 5, 2025, due to a by-election campaign in the Hamilton, Larkhall and Stonehouse constituency. Separately, tens of thousands of Scottish council workers are being balloted on strike action, with the vote closing on June 12. Public opinion polls on independence are mixed; while one poll showed an 11-point lead for 'Yes,' other sources from late April 2025 indicate polling remains in the 45-55% range against independence, with one citing 54% opposition.",

    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "1 month, 29 days",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "The Scottish Government under First Minister John Swinney continues its declared strategic focus on the economy, poverty, and public services. Deeming the political conditions unfavorable and respecting the pre-election guidance for an upcoming by-election, the government makes no major constitutional announcements. The July 1, 2025 deadline passes without a referendum date being set, with the SNP instead focusing on building a case for independence to present at the 2026 Holyrood elections.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Facing pressure from within the independence movement to show progress, and perhaps seeing an opportunity in a moment of UK political distraction, the First Minister makes a surprise announcement in mid-June. He names a date for a consultative, non-binding referendum, framing it as a means to test the will of the Scottish people. This move, while legally contentious at the UK level, satisfies the resolution criteria as it is an official announcement from a person with authority in Scotland.",
    "rationale": "My forecast is a low 5%. The overwhelming weight of evidence suggests that the Scottish Government will not announce a referendum date within the short, two-month timeframe. \n\nThe primary reason is the apparent strategic shift within the SNP. Despite rhetoric from the First Minister about independence being an 'urgent priority', recent actions and statements from influential figures suggest a move away from an immediate referendum push. Former First Minister Nicola Sturgeon's comment that a vote is 'off the radar' for now is particularly significant, likely reflecting the party's internal consensus. Furthermore, the government's stated policy focus in April 2025 was on domestic issues like the economy and public services, not constitutional change. This aligns with a strategy of building a stronger case for independence ahead of the 2026 Holyrood election, rather than forcing a confrontation now.\n\nPractical constraints also make an announcement unlikely. There is a government embargo on major announcements from May 15 to June 5 due to a by-election, cutting the available window for action nearly in half. Past referendums have also had lead times of 18-24 months, making a snap announcement for a vote in the near future highly irregular. While polling for independence has seen some positive results for the 'Yes' campaign, it is not consistently showing a commanding lead that would compel the government to act immediately.\n\nMy probability is not zero because the question's criteria make a purely political announcement sufficient for a 'Yes' resolution. The Scottish Government could decide to announce a date for a consultative referendum as a strategic move to rally its base, even with no clear path to it being legally recognized by the UK. A sudden and dramatic shift in polling or an unexpected political crisis at Westminster could precipitate such a move. \n\nHowever, the probability is not higher because the current strategy, key leadership statements, and practical constraints all point strongly toward inaction on this specific issue before the July 1 deadline. For my forecast to increase, I would need to see a clear and coordinated shift in rhetoric from the SNP leadership indicating an imminent announcement, or multiple polls showing a durable and significant lead for independence.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nBefore July 1, 2025, will the government of Scotland officially announce a date for an independence referendum?\n\nQuestion background:\nThe National: [Yes posts huge 11-point lead in new Scottish independence poll](https://www.thenational.scot/news/25089457.yes-posts-huge-11-point-lead-new-scottish-independence-poll/)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if, before July 1, 2025, a referendum on the independence of Scotland from the United Kingdom is officially scheduled. If this does not occur before that date, this question resolves as **No**.\n\nFor purposes of this question, the referendum will be considered \"officially scheduled\" when it is announced by a person or entity with the authority to do so within Scotland. Please note that broader legality, such as within the United Kingdom, will be considered irrelevant for this question, so if the federal government declared the referendum illegal, the question would still resolve as Yes.\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nA 2022 UK Supreme Court ruling established that the Scottish Parliament cannot unilaterally hold a legally binding independence referendum without the approval of the UK Parliament in Westminster.
