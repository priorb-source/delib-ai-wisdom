  "information": "An executive order signed on March 7, 2025, aims to limit eligibility for the Public Service Loan Forgiveness (PSLF) program by altering the definition of 'public service'. The order directs the Department of Education and the Treasury Department to propose regulatory changes to make certain public-sector employees ineligible. Additionally, a provision within the House GOP's 2025 tax bill would grant the U.S. Treasury Secretary the authority to revoke the tax-exempt status of non-profits designated as 'terrorist supporting organizations,' which would disqualify their employees from the PSLF program.",

    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "~48 days (until July 1, 2025)",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "The tracker keeps the PSLF objective at “in progress” because actions taken so far only restrict eligibility or signal intent (EOs and proposed rules) without actually ending the statutory program. No new law terminating PSLF is enacted before July 1, 2025.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Congress passes and the President signs legislation that ends PSLF, or the tracker moderators decide that an administrative action (e.g., a final rule that effectively halts PSLF participation/forgiveness) is sufficient to count as “terminate” and mark it complete before July 1, 2025.",
    "rationale": "- Statutory barrier: PSLF is created by statute; fully terminating it almost certainly requires an act of Congress. Executive actions can narrow eligibility or slow processing but are unlikely to qualify as outright termination.\n- Evidence to date: The research assistant notes a March 7, 2025 executive order directing agencies to propose changes narrowing eligibility and a House GOP tax-bill provision affecting some nonprofits’ status. These measures reduce coverage but do not end PSLF. Proposed rules take time (drafting, OMB review, comment period) and are unlikely to culminate in a definitive termination by July 1.\n- Tracker behavior: Keep_Track’s Project 2025 Tracker tends to reserve “complete” for clear, implemented policy outcomes. Given the wording “terminate the Public Service Loan Forgiveness program,” moderators are likely to wait for unambiguous termination (most plausibly legislation) rather than partial administrative curtailment.\n- Time constraint: Roughly seven weeks remain. Passing and enacting legislation to end PSLF on this timeline—especially if the Senate is not solidly aligned—is unlikely. Administrative actions could accelerate, but a mere proposal or interim step is unlikely to be labeled “complete.”\nWhy not higher: Legislative passage by July 1 is a heavy lift; administrative steps so far aim to limit, not end, PSLF. The tracker’s conservative completion standard further lowers odds.\nWhy not lower: Two avenues could still produce a “Yes”: (1) a fast-moving legislative package (e.g., a budget or reconciliation vehicle) that includes PSLF termination; or (2) the tracker decides that a sweeping final rule effectively ending PSLF participation/forgiveness counts as termination and marks it complete even absent new statute.\nWhat would move me up: Clear Senate movement on a bill to terminate PSLF, credible reporting of a near-term deal including PSLF termination, or public clarification from Keep_Track moderators that they will mark “complete” upon an aggressive administrative action that halts PSLF in practice.\nWhat would move me down: Signals that Congress has shelved related provisions until later in the year, or the tracker clarifying it will only mark “complete” upon statutory repeal/termination.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill the Project 2025 Tracker spreadsheet have the objective of terminating the Public Service Loan Forgiveness program marked as complete before July 1, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nAt the time of this question, the objective was marked as \"in progress.\" The 2025 Tracker is a project of the Keep_Track subreddit and is explained [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/Keep_Track/comments/1ii7tbr/project_2025_tracker_is_now_live/).\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if the Project 2025 objective to \"terminate the Public Service Loan Forgiveness program\" is marked as complete according to [this spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1QGG6wNHna-1tt91yXNkOauAJJ7snobFjfEnmxlmzhl4/edit?gid=0#gid=0) before July 1, 2025. If it is anything other than complete (such as \"in progress\") when accessed by Metaculus on or after July 1, 2025, then the question resolves as **No**.\n\n\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nAn executive order signed on March 7, 2025, aims to limit eligibility for the Public Service Loan Forgiveness (PSLF) program by altering the definition of 'public service'.

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
