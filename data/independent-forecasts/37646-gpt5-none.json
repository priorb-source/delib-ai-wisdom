    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "About 46 days (until end of June 30, 2025)",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No — as of now the Starlink map does not show Somalia as Available.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Regulatory and commercial steps after the announced license take longer than expected (e.g., final type approvals, reseller agreements, taxation/import arrangements, geofencing/security requirements), or website/map updates lag. Political or incumbent-operator pushback in Somalia delays activation, keeping the map at Coming Soon past June 30.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "After the license announcement, SpaceX flips service on for at least part of Somalia and updates the map accordingly (even if sales and distribution are limited initially). A soft launch in Mogadishu or via a local partner triggers the map to show Available within weeks.",
    "rationale": "- Base rate and timelines: In many countries where Starlink secures licensing, the availability map often turns to Available within roughly 2–8 weeks, though there are notable exceptions with longer lags. With ~6.5 weeks left, this is plausible but not assured.\n- Specifics to Somalia: The reported license announcement is a strong positive signal. Technically, Starlink can activate service quickly using inter-satellite links without local gateways. However, Somalia’s regulatory complexity (federal vs. regional authorities), security sensitivities (risk of misuse), and potential resistance from incumbent telecoms could introduce additional steps before SpaceX is comfortable switching the map to Available. Even when service is operational in practice, Starlink sometimes delays the public map update or keeps regions at Coming Soon pending commercial readiness.\n- Status quo weight: The current map does not show Somalia as Available. Given that institutional and website-update frictions are common and the world changes more slowly than headlines suggest, I discount from a higher optimistic estimate.\n- Why not higher: Short runway (46 days), Somalia’s governance/security environment, potential for last‑mile compliance steps (type approvals, tax/VAT setup, distribution/MNO partnerships), and historical instances where map updates lag license announcements.\n- Why not lower: Elon Musk’s direct announcement suggests genuine regulatory progress; Africa rollout has accelerated; technical readiness is high; precedent exists for countries moving from license to Available within weeks.\n- Update signals:\n  • Upward: Official Starlink/X announcement of Somalia availability; Somalia’s comms ministry confirming commercial activation; local resellers advertising kits; the map showing a dated “Available Q2 2025” note or early pockets turning green.\n  • Downward: Reports of regulatory disputes, bans or reversals (federal or regional), explicit delays to Q3+, or the map shifting to a later “coming soon” window.\n- Research assistant info: No additional information provided beyond the license headline; thus I rely on general rollout patterns and contextual risk factors.\nOverall, I moderately favor Yes but keep a substantial chance of delay past July 1.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill Starlink's website show Somalia as a country with Starlink availability before July 1, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\n[Musk announces Starlink license for Somalia](https://www.spacedaily.com/reports/Musk_announces_Starlink_license_for_Somalia_999.html)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if, before July 1, 2025, the [Starlink Availability Map](https://www.starlink.com/us/map) has anywhere in Somalia listed as \"Available.\"\n\n\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nNo additional information available.\n\nToday is 2025-05-15.\n\nBefore answering you think:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n(e) You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
