    "review": "Both forecasters largely mirror my initial view: short window, no forcing deadline, and Morgan’s history of flirtations point toward No, while his wealth and the recent Politico blueprint keep a nontrivial tail for a surprise June launch. The main new/clarified arguments I found additive were: (1) quarter-end (June 30) optics as a potential incentive to announce, (2) the idea of freezing the Democratic field by moving sooner, and (3) the July 4 news lull consideration. None of these overcome the lack of concrete pre-launch indicators (staff hires, filings, venue holds, media advisories) or Morgan’s personal base rate, but they do justify a modest nudge upward. The suggestion that some candidates prefer early July or later cuts the other way; for Morgan specifically, quarter-end optics are probably less binding given self-funding capacity.",
    "rationale": "We have ~24 days left until July 1. The default remains No absent strong signals. Morgan’s pattern of public deliberation without declaring, coupled with a 2026 cycle that doesn’t require early entry, weighs against a June announcement. The May 15 Politico piece indicates real consideration, and his ability to self-fund/launch quickly keeps a meaningful chance of a sudden video rollout. New considerations from peers—quarter-end optics, field-freezing, and avoiding the July 4 lull—slightly increase the plausibility of a late-June launch window. However, with no credible reporting of an imminent announcement (staffing leaks, filings, scheduled events), I still see the status quo dominating. I’m nudging up modestly to reflect those June-specific incentives but not as high as 30%, given the absence of concrete pre-launch smoke.",
