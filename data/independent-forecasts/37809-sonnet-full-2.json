  "information": "As of mid-to-late May 2025, New York Yankees player Aaron Judge had a batting average at or above .400. Reports from May 20th list his average as .401, while other reports from the preceding week cited it as high as .410 and .423. Through his first 46 games, he had a batting average of 0.401. His Batting Average on Balls in Play (BABIP) was .481, compared to his career average of .344. Statcast data calculated his expected batting average (xBA) at approximately .362.\n\nAs of May 18, 2025, Freddie Freeman of the Los Angeles Dodgers led the National League with a batting average of .375. Other top hitters in the NL included Will Smith (.336), Brendan Donovan (.330), and Manny Machado (.323). One report also listed Shohei Ohtani's average at .370. In contrast, three-time All-Star Marcus Semien was batting .174 for the Texas Rangers.\n\nHistorically, maintaining a .400 batting average is extremely rare in modern baseball. No MLB player has finished a season batting .400 since Ted Williams in 1941. Furthermore, no player in the last 25 seasons has had a batting average of .400 or greater on July 1. In 2023, Luis Arraez's average was .401 on June 23 but fell to .392 by July 1. Factors contributing to this difficulty include lower league-wide Batting Average on Balls in Play (BABIP), which is .288 in the current era compared to .300 in 1930.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Approximately 42 days from May 20, 2025 to July 1, 2025",
    "status_quo_outcome": "If Aaron Judge's current .401 batting average remained unchanged, the question would resolve as Yes. However, status quo in baseball involves natural regression toward more sustainable levels, particularly given Judge's inflated BABIP",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Judge's batting average regresses below .400 as his unsustainably high BABIP (.481) normalizes toward his career average (.344). Over the next 40-45 games, even strong performance at his expected batting average level (.362) would drop him below .400. No other player gets sufficiently hot to reach .400",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Judge defies historical odds and maintains his .400+ average through July 1st despite statistical indicators suggesting regression, or another top performer like Freeman (.375) or Ohtani (.370) goes on an exceptional hot streak to reach .400",
    "rationale": "Judge currently sits at .401 with 42 days remaining until resolution. The critical factors: (1) Historical precedent is extremely strong - no player has been at .400 on July 1 in the last 25 seasons, and Luis Arraez dropped from .401 to .392 in just 8 days in 2023. (2) Judge's underlying metrics strongly suggest regression - his BABIP of .481 is 137 points above his career average, and his expected batting average (xBA) is .362, indicating he's overperforming by about 39 points. (3) He needs approximately 40-45 more games before July 1st. To maintain .400, he'd need to continue hitting at exactly that level, but his Statcast data suggests true talent closer to .360s. Mathematically, even if Judge hits an excellent .375 over the next 45 games, his average would likely drop to around .389. The starting point of already being at .400 provides some probability, as does having 42 days rather than months remaining. Freeman at .375 and Ohtani at .370 provide additional chances but would need extraordinary hot streaks. My forecast isn't higher because the historical and statistical evidence for regression is overwhelming - maintaining .400 is perhaps the rarest achievement in modern baseball. It's not lower because Judge actually is at .401 right now, variance could keep him there for 6 weeks, and we have multiple credible candidates. I would update higher if Judge maintains .395+ through mid-June, or lower if he drops below .385 within the next two weeks, confirming expected regression",
