    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "About 60 days (until July 1, 2025)",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "The new coalition pursues a gradualist path: it prioritizes economic and legal groundwork (constitution drafting, fiscal reforms) and declines to commit to a specific referendum date before July, offering only a roadmap without a fixed date.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Greenlandic authorities (Naalakkersuisut or Inatsisartut) formally set a referendum date—possibly in a coalition agreement, a parliamentary vote, or a government announcement timed to a symbolic moment such as Greenland National Day (June 21)—for a vote to be held later in 2025/2026.",
    "rationale": "- Baseline and recent signals: Independence is a long-term, broadly popular goal in Greenlandic politics, but parties differ on timing. The referenced Reuters framing that “independence gradualists” won the March 2025 election implies the governing bloc is less likely to rush into setting a near-term referendum date. That lowers the odds of an official date being announced by July 1.\n- Institutional and practical hurdles: Scheduling an independence referendum usually requires legislative or executive action and political consensus, which typically takes time. Even if the vote were intended for 2026+, the governing coalition may prefer to finish constitutional drafting and economic preparations before locking in a date. Announcing a date without those steps exposes the government to criticism and risk.\n- Time window: Fewer than two months remain. While a date could be announced quickly, the short runway and the gradualist mandate make a near-term scheduling less likely. The one notable focal point is June 21 (National Day), which marginally increases the probability of a symbolic announcement.\n- Why not higher: No concrete public signals (in the prompt) of imminent scheduling; a gradualist government tends to avoid hard dates; administrative and coalition dynamics typically slow these decisions.\n- Why not lower: Independence remains a core national objective; the question only requires an official date announcement (not the referendum itself), which is procedurally easier than holding the vote. A coalition deal, a premier’s policy speech, or a National Day statement could set a date even if the vote is far in the future.\n- What would move the forecast up: Reports of a coalition agreement including a referendum timetable; government tabling a referendum bill; statements from the premier or speaker indicating an imminent date announcement; calendar signals around June 21 preparations.\n- What would move it down: Explicit government statements deferring any date until after specific prerequisites (e.g., completion of a constitution) with no timeline; signs of coalition discord on the referendum; a legislative calendar that leaves no room for such an announcement before July.\n- Research assistant input: No additional information available, so this forecast leans on general political dynamics, base rates for scheduling sovereignty referenda, and the Reuters characterization that gradualists prevailed, which tilts toward delay.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nBefore July 1, 2025, will the government of Greenland officially announce a date for an independence referendum?\n\nQuestion background:\nReuters: [Greenland's independence gradualists win election amid Trump control pledge](https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/greenland-election-tests-independence-ambitions-us-interest-looms-2025-03-11/)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if, before July 1, 2025, a referendum on the independence of Greenland from the Denmark is officially scheduled. If this does not occur before that date, this question resolves as **No**.\n\nFor purposes of this question, the referendum will be considered \"officially scheduled\" when it is announced by a person or entity with the authority to do so within Greenland. Please note that broader legality, such as it being overturned by the government of Denmark, will be considered irrelevant for this question.\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nNo additional information available.\n\nToday is 2025-05-02.\n\nBefore answering you think:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n(e) You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
