    "review": "All three forecasters, including myself, have identified the central issue: the immense procedural inertia of the federal government versus the political will of a new administration. We unanimously agree that a formal, legally sound rule change is impossible in the six-week timeframe. The key point of deliberation is the likelihood of an irregular, politically-motivated action, such as a legally questionable 'interim final rule' as noted by Forecaster 2, or a simple cosmetic update to the webpage to signal intent. I found Forecaster 2's identification of specific mechanisms for bypassing normal procedure, like an interim rule, to be a valuable addition to the analysis, as it outlines a concrete, albeit risky, pathway to a 'No' outcome. However, I found Forecaster 3's counter-argument even more compelling: such a hasty change, lacking underlying regulatory authority, would create massive confusion for recipients and retailers and would almost certainly be halted by legal challenges. The argument about historical institutional resistance from the USDA itself further strengthens the case for the status quo.",
    "rationale": "After reviewing the other analyses, I am maintaining my forecast of 95%. The deliberation has not changed my overall assessment but has sharpened my reasoning. Forecaster 2 raised valid points about the high motivation of a new administration and specific procedural shortcuts they might attempt. This initially made me consider lowering my probability. However, Forecaster 3's analysis provided a strong counterweight, highlighting the practical chaos and legal backlash that would result from a change to the website not supported by a formal rule. The operational burden and potential for legal injunctions are powerful disincentives that I believe would temper even a highly motivated political appointee. The risk of a 'No' outcome primarily hinges on the administration prioritizing a symbolic, disruptive act over procedural correctness and operational stability. While this risk is not zero, I assess that the high probability of immediate legal challenges under the Administrative Procedure Act, combined with the practical difficulties for the agency, makes this course of action unlikely. The status quo remains the most probable outcome due to overwhelming institutional and procedural inertia.",
