  "information": "In early April 2025, the U.S. administration announced a new trade policy based on 'reciprocal tariffs,' effectively ending the African Growth and Opportunity Act (AGOA) which had allowed many African countries to export goods to the U.S. duty-free. The new policy applies tariffs to approximately 185 countries. The tariff rates are determined by a formula that involves dividing a country's bilateral trade deficit with the U.S. by the amount of U.S. imports from that country, and then dividing the result by two. This policy resulted in varying tariff rates, including 50% for Lesotho and Saint-Pierre and Miquelon, 49% for Cambodia, 46% for Vietnam, 34% for China, and 20% for the European Union. The new tariffs took effect on April 9, 2025, although the U.S. later announced a 90-day pause on introducing new tariffs for some countries, a move not extended to Lesotho.\n\nThe U.S. imposed a 50% tariff on Lesotho due to a significant trade imbalance; in 2024, Lesotho exported approximately $237-240 million worth of goods to the U.S., while importing only about $2.8-3 million from the U.S. The tariff is expected to severely impact Lesotho's economy, particularly its textile and apparel industry, which employs around 40,000 workers and constitutes about 90% of the country's manufacturing employment and exports. In response to the tariff, the Lesotho government announced on April 3, 2025, that it was forming a high-level delegation to travel to Washington to negotiate with U.S. authorities and seek clarification on the tariff's rationale.\n\nThe imposition of new U.S. tariffs prompted various international reactions. The Southern African Development Community (SADC) began assessing the tariffs' impact on the region and planned a high-level summit for June. Within the SADC, Zimbabwe's decision to remove its own tariffs on American imports was criticized by some as undermining regional solidarity. The European Union announced it would delay its own trade countermeasures against the U.S. for 90 days to allow for negotiations. China responded by imposing its own retaliatory tariffs of 34% and filing a formal complaint with the World Trade Organization (WTO).",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Approximately five weeks, as the outcome will be determined on or after June 1, 2025, from the current date of April 23, 2025.",
    "status_quo_outcome": "The 50% tariff on Lesotho, which was implemented on April 9, 2025, remains unchanged. The US Harmonized Tariff Schedule continues to list the 50% duty, resulting in a 'Yes' outcome.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Diplomatic efforts by the high-level Lesotho delegation successfully persuade the US administration to grant an exemption or reverse the tariff. This policy change is reflected in the official tariff schedule before the resolution date of June 1, 2025.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "The US administration adheres to its new formula-based 'reciprocal tariffs' policy. Despite diplomatic pressure from Lesotho and other international actors, no changes are made to Lesotho's tariff status by the resolution date, and the 50% duty remains in effect.",
    "rationale": "The foundation of this forecast is the strength of the status quo. The US implemented a new, sweeping 'reciprocal tariffs' policy on April 9, 2025, and the 50% tariff on Lesotho is a direct result of its formula. The timeframe for a reversal is extremely short—less than two months between the policy's implementation and the resolution date. Major policy changes, especially those affecting 185 countries, are rarely reversed this quickly. Critically, the US administration already announced a 90-day pause for some countries but explicitly did not extend it to Lesotho, signaling a firm position. While Lesotho is mounting a diplomatic effort and international criticism exists, these processes typically move much slower than the five weeks remaining until the resolution date. The probability is not higher because there is a small chance that the optics of imposing the world's highest tariff on a small developing nation—with catastrophic economic consequences for that nation—could prompt a swift, low-cost political concession from the US administration. I would lower my forecast if reports emerged of a successful high-level meeting between the Lesotho delegation and the US Trade Representative with a commitment to review the tariff. The probability is not lower because the US has demonstrated clear intent by excluding Lesotho from the tariff pause, and reversing a key component of a brand-new, formula-based policy so soon would undermine its credibility. I would raise my forecast if the White House or USTR released a statement reaffirming the tariff on Lesotho despite its appeals.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill the US government's harmonized tarifff schedule list the tariff on Lesotho as 50% on June 1, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nAP: [How tiny Lesotho ended up with the highest US tariffs in the world](https://apnews.com/article/lesotho-us-trump-tariffs-b337efa47290e889aa076cc9ede7bc9d)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below.

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any).
