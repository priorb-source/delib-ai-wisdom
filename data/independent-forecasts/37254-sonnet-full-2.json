  "information": "The United States and Ukraine have signed an agreement establishing a fund for reconstruction and granting the US administration access to Ukraine's mineral resources, including rare earth minerals. In an official statement about the deal, the US Treasury Department mentioned the 'large-scale invasion' of Ukraine by Russia. In parallel, the US has urged both Russia and Ukraine to accept its peace proposal during a UN Security Council meeting. On February 24, 2025, the US voted against a UN resolution demanding the immediate withdrawal of Russian troops from Ukrainian territory, aligning with Russia and North Korea. The US presented an alternative resolution that called for a 'swift end' to the conflict without mentioning Russian aggression.\n\nUkrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky has issued warnings that Russia may be preparing a new wave of aggression under the guise of the upcoming 'West-2025' military exercises in Belarus. The potential targets mentioned in these warnings include a further invasion of Ukraine, or an attack on Lithuania or Poland. Zelensky stated that intelligence reports indicate Russia is building up its military forces in Belarus, with as many as 150,000 soldiers, for a potential invasion of a NATO country. In response, Ukraine's State Border Guard Service is closely monitoring the border with Belarus and tracking the movement of Russian units.\n\nRussia's recent history of military invasions includes Georgia in 2008, the annexation of Crimea and intervention in Eastern Ukraine in 2014, and the full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022. The US has historically been prompt in publicly accusing Russia of military aggression when it occurs. Currently, Russia's military remains heavily committed in Ukraine. Reports from various think tanks and news organizations, including RUSI, CSIS, Politico, and the BBC, do not indicate any new, significant Russian troop buildups for operations in countries other than Ukraine.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Exactly 2 months remain until July 1, 2025",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No - the United States does not accuse Russia of invading any country other than Ukraine",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Russia remains militarily committed to operations in Ukraine without expanding to other countries, or if Russia does engage in military action elsewhere, the US administration continues its current policy approach of not publicly emphasizing Russian aggression, as evidenced by voting against UN resolutions condemning Russia",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Russia launches a military invasion of another country such as Lithuania, Poland, or another neighbor (potentially using the West-2025 exercises in Belarus as cover), and the US government publicly accuses Russia of invasion despite its recent conciliatory policy stance",
    "rationale": "The status quo strongly favors a No outcome for several converging reasons. First, Russia's military forces remain heavily committed to operations in Ukraine, making a simultaneous large-scale invasion of another country logistically challenging within just 2 months. Second, and critically important, the US has demonstrated a significant policy shift away from publicly condemning Russian aggression - voting against a UN resolution demanding Russian withdrawal from Ukraine on February 24, 2025, and proposing alternative language that avoids mentioning Russian aggression. This suggests that even if Russia engaged in limited military action elsewhere, this administration might not characterize it as 'invasion' or issue public accusations. Third, major defense analysis organizations (RUSI, CSIS, Politico, BBC) report no credible evidence of Russian troop buildups for operations outside Ukraine. While Zelensky's warnings about 150,000 Russian troops in Belarus preparing to invade NATO countries are concerning, they could represent Ukrainian efforts to maintain international support rather than imminent threat intelligence. Russia's historical pattern of military aggression (Georgia 2008, Crimea 2014, Ukraine 2022) shows multi-year gaps between major operations. My forecast is not higher because: only 2 months remain with no preparation indicators, Russia's forces are occupied, and US policy appears fundamentally opposed to publicly accusing Russia. My forecast is not lower because: geopolitical surprises do occur, the West-2025 exercises could provide cover, and Zelensky may have legitimate intelligence. To revise upward, I would need credible intelligence reports of major Russian military buildups near other borders or changes in US foreign policy rhetoric. To revise downward would require explicit US statements guaranteeing non-interference in potential Russian actions or Russia publicly committing to non-expansion",

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
