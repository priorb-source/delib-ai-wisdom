    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "16 days. The awards ceremony is scheduled for May 8, 2025, and today is April 22, 2025.",
    "status_quo_outcome": "Chris Stapleton wins at least one award. As one of the most commercially successful and critically acclaimed artists in modern country music, he has a consistent history of winning major awards. With five nominations, the status quo is that he will convert at least one of them into a win.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Despite receiving five nominations, Stapleton goes home empty-handed. This would likely be the result of exceptionally strong competition in every category he is nominated in, leading voters to favor other artists. A sweep by another major artist or a general trend of 'spreading the love' among several nominees could lead to this outcome.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Chris Stapleton wins an award in at least one of the five categories for which he is nominated. Given his multiple chances, a win could come in a major category like Male Artist of the Year or a more specific one like Song of the Year, reaffirming his status as an industry powerhouse.",
    "rationale": "My forecast is based primarily on Chris Stapleton's consistent track record of success at the ACM Awards and the statistical advantage provided by his five nominations. Stapleton is a perennial favorite among both fans and industry voters, respected for his vocal talent, songwriting, and musicianship, making him a formidable contender in any category. The most significant factor supporting a 'Yes' outcome is the number of opportunities; the probability of winning at least one of five independent events is substantially higher than winning a single one. Even if he is not the frontrunner in every category, his chances of securing a win across five attempts are high.\n\nMy forecast is not higher because the country music landscape is highly competitive. Artists like Luke Combs, Morgan Wallen, and Lainey Wilson have also had massive success and could easily win in overlapping categories. There is always the possibility of voter fatigue or a narrative shift that favors a different artist, leading to Stapleton being the runner-up in several categories and winning none. \n\nMy forecast is not lower because a complete shutout for an artist of Stapleton's stature with five nominations would be a significant surprise. His broad appeal and consistent quality make it improbable that he would be overlooked across the board. \n\nI would increase my probability if strong industry buzz or precursor indicators pointed towards a win for him in a specific category. I would decrease my probability if a clear narrative emerged for a competitor to sweep the major awards, or if betting markets showed him as a significant underdog in all nominated categories.",

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
