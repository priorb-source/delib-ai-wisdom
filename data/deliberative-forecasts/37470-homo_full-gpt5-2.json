    "review": "Both forecasters reinforce the short-window/status-quo argument and the higher bar that the announcement must come from ITKF itself. They also stress typical governance cadence (host decisions at congresses/board meetings aligned with major events), which tilts toward no decision before July 1 absent clear signs of an imminent meeting. These points are consistent with my view but push me slightly more cautious. I didn’t see new concrete evidence, but the procedural emphasis and lack of visible ITKF signals argue for trimming my probability. I continue to factor in Egypt’s strong hosting capacity and recent high-level engagement, and the absence of known rival bids, which keep the chance non-trivial.",
    "rationale": "Time remaining (~7 weeks) and lack of official ITKF indications (no bid materials, no calendar cues, no teasers) make a pre–July 1 announcement unlikely, especially given the noted pattern of earlier host selections (24–36 months). While smaller federations can move quickly, and the Apr 29 meeting plus Egypt’s track record and apparent clean field are supportive, the default is that selection awaits a later 2025 meeting. The requirement of an explicit ITKF announcement (not just Egyptian media) further narrows the path. I maintain a non-trivial probability for a swift executive decision/press release in late May–June, but in light of the other forecasters’ emphasis on procedural cadence and the continued absence of official signals, I lower my estimate modestly from 33% to 28%.",
