  "information": "The proposed VAT exemption has received public support from Ahmed Dangiwa, the Minister of Housing and Urban Development, as well as from industry groups like the Council of Registered Builders of Nigeria (CORBON) and the Housing Development Advocacy Network (HDAN). However, the broader tax reform package faces opposition from labor unions. The President of the Trade Union Congress (TUC), Festus Osifo, described the bills as 'anti-worker,' with union objections focusing on provisions such as the minimum taxable income and the proposed scrapping of the Tertiary Education Trust Fund (TETFUND).",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Less than 2 months (57 days from May 5, 2025 to July 1, 2025)",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No - the legislation has not been enacted yet. The Tax Reforms Bill is currently under consideration by the National Assembly but has not been passed into law.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "The Tax Reforms Bill faces continued opposition from labor unions over provisions related to minimum taxable income and TETFUND, leading to prolonged debates and amendments in the National Assembly. The legislative process extends beyond July 1, 2025, or the bill is significantly delayed, amended to remove the VAT exemption clause, or fails to pass entirely. Nigerian legislative processes are often slow, and the complexity of a comprehensive tax reform package could require extensive committee reviews and multi-chamber deliberations that cannot be completed in the remaining timeframe.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "The National Assembly accelerates consideration of the Tax Reforms Bill given strong support from the Ministry of Housing and Urban Development and industry stakeholders. The opposition from labor unions focuses on other provisions, allowing the real estate VAT exemption to remain largely uncontested. The government prioritizes housing affordability as a policy objective, fast-tracking the bill through both legislative chambers. The President signs the legislation into law before July 1, 2025, with the VAT exemption provision intact.",
    "rationale": "The status quo strongly favors 'No' as the legislation has not been enacted. With only 57 days remaining, the timeline is extremely tight for passing comprehensive tax reform legislation through Nigeria's bicameral legislature. While there are positive signals - active consideration by the National Assembly, explicit support from the Housing Minister (Ahmed Dangiwa), and endorsement from industry groups (CORBON and HDAN) - these must be weighed against significant obstacles. Nigerian legislative processes are typically slow, and this is a complex, multi-faceted tax reform bill, not just a narrow real estate provision. The opposition from the Trade Union Congress, while focused on different provisions (minimum taxable income and TETFUND), could slow the entire bill's progress through procedural delays, amendments, and extended debates. The real estate VAT exemption itself appears relatively uncontroversial, which is encouraging, but it's embedded in a broader package facing resistance. For the forecast to be higher, I would need evidence of: (1) the bill having already passed at least one chamber, (2) an expedited legislative schedule being announced, or (3) a compromise being reached with labor unions. For it to be lower, I would need to see the bill being sent back to committee, additional opposition emerging specifically against the real estate provision, or legislative calendar conflicts. Given the slow pace of status quo change and the compressed timeline, I assign a 30% probability to enactment before July 1, 2025.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill Nigeria enact legislation exempting real estate transactions from VAT before July 1, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\n[FG: Tax reform bill to exempt real estate transactions from VAT, boost housing affordability in Nigeria](https://nairametrics.com/2025/04/25/fg-tax-reform-bill-to-exempt-real-estate-transactions-from-vat-boost-housing-affordability-in-nigeria/)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if, before July 1, 2025, the government of Nigeria enacts legislation exempting real estate transactions from the Value Added Tax (VAT) according to [credible sources](https://www.metaculus.com/help/faq/#definitions).\n\nFor example, the current iteration of the Tax Reforms Bill that is [being considered](https://brtnews.ng/tax-reforms-bill-to-exempt-real-estate-transactions-from-vat/) by the National Assembly, if it should be enacted, would count for purposes of this question.\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nThe proposed VAT exemption has received public support from Ahmed Dangiwa, the Minister of Housing and Urban Development, as well as from industry groups like the Council of Registered Builders of Nigeria (CORBON) and the Housing Development Advocacy Network (HDAN). However, the broader tax reform package faces opposition from labor unions.

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
