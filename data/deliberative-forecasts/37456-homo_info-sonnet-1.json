    "review": "Forecaster 2 raises a critical point I had not sufficiently considered: this may be a Class III recall based on the precautionary nature and absence of reported illnesses. If true, this significantly changes the expected timeline. Forecaster 3 provides valuable data that Class III recalls have a median closure time of ~90 days, placing our 95-day window just past the median. However, I have concerns about definitively accepting the Class III classification without explicit confirmation. Sodium hypochlorite contamination in food products can be serious enough to warrant Class I status regardless of whether illnesses have been reported yet. Both forecasters provide useful frameworks, but Forecaster 2 may be overly optimistic at 60% given we're already 40 days in without closure, while Forecaster 3's 45% seems more balanced given the uncertainties.",
    "rationale": "After reviewing the arguments, I need to update my analysis based on the possibility this is Class III rather than Class I. The key factors are: (1) If Class III with a 90-day median, the 95-day window puts us just past the median, suggesting roughly 45-50% probability; (2) However, we're already at day 40 without closure, indicating this isn't tracking on the faster end; (3) Complicating factors remain - multi-state distribution, institutional foodservice channels, and extended shelf life through March 2026; (4) Even for Class III recalls, administrative processes can extend timelines. The uncertainty about the actual recall classification is significant. If it's Class I, my original 35% was appropriate. If it's Class III, a higher probability is warranted. Splitting the difference and accounting for the fact that we're already 42% through the timeline without resolution, I'm updating to 42%. This reflects: modest optimism that Class III characteristics may apply, but tempered by the lack of progress so far and persistent complexity factors. I would update higher if the Class III classification were confirmed or if progress indicators emerged. I would update lower if this were confirmed as Class I or if additional complications arose.",
