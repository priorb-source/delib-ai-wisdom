    "review": "Forecaster 2 provides critical new empirical evidence claiming that cube-shaped sightings were reported every single month from January through April 2025 based on direct database analysis. If accurate, this transforms the December 2024 data from a potential outlier into part of a consistent 5-month trend, which would strongly support forecasts in the 80-85% range. However, I note some uncertainty about this claim since the original background described such reports as 'rare' and didn't mention this pattern. Forecaster 3 makes valid counterpoints about the specificity of the 'Cube' label and historical rarity, noting that near-miss descriptions wouldn't count. Their 45% forecast seems overly conservative given December 2024's 6 confirmed reports, but the caution about label specificity and the narrow resolution criteria is well-taken. The key tension is between Forecaster 2's claimed recent streak (suggesting high probability) versus Forecaster 3's emphasis on historical rarity and label specificity (suggesting lower probability).",
    "rationale": "The most significant new information is Forecaster 2's claim of cube reports in every month from January-April 2025. While I cannot independently verify this, if even partially true (say, 2-3 of those months had cube reports), it substantially updates the evidence from treating December 2024 as a rare spike to recognizing an ongoing elevated pattern. This would raise the base rate considerably. However, I maintain some caution because: (1) the original background emphasized rarity, (2) Forecaster 3's point about label specificity is valid - witnesses might describe the same object as 'box,' 'rectangular,' or 'square' rather than specifically 'cube', and (3) month-to-month variation still exists even with an elevated base rate. Balancing these considerations: the December 2024 precedent of 6 reports is confirmed and strong evidence, Forecaster 2's pattern claim (even if partially accurate) suggests continuation rather than anomaly, summer months typically see higher reporting volumes, and we only need 1 report. Against this, the label is specific and historically rare. I'm updating upward from 65% to 72%, giving substantial weight to the recent pattern evidence while maintaining reasonable uncertainty about whether June 2025 will specifically yield at least one 'Cube' label.",
