    "review": "Both forecasters emphasize the decisive procedural bottleneck: only the Federal Constitutional Court can ban a party, and such cases take many months to years. They also add a useful detail I hadn’t explicitly weighed: the January 30 Bundestag debate reportedly lacked majority support to even file, further lowering near-term odds of an application. Forecaster 2’s note that BfV extremist classification doesn’t translate into or accelerate a ban is also important context. I find their reasoning consistent with legal precedent and timeline realities; their tail-risk framing matches mine but is slightly more conservative on timing feasibility.",
    "rationale": "Key constraints remain unchanged: no formal application has been filed; even if filed immediately, a final ruling by July 1 would be unprecedented given the Court’s history (e.g., NPD timeline) and general caution on party bans. The added information that the Bundestag motion lacked majority support marginally reduces the likelihood that a filing will even occur soon, which indirectly lowers the already tiny odds of a ban by the deadline. While I still allow for a minimal tail risk of extraordinary events prompting unprecedented expedited action, the combination of political non-consensus, legal process, and timing makes a Yes outcome extraordinarily unlikely. Accordingly, I nudge my estimate down slightly from 0.5% to 0.3%.",
