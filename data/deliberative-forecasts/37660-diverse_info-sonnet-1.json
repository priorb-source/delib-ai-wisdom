    "review": "Both forecasters raise important points I should reconsider. Forecaster 2 correctly emphasizes that 9 months have passed since the license grant without availability appearing - this is a crucial status quo indicator I mentioned but didn't sufficiently weight. Forecaster 3 introduces new information: that an April 2025 launch expectation was already missed, and that TRCSL has actively denied suspension rumors. This last point is particularly important positive evidence I didn't have.\n\nHowever, I believe both forecasters may be underweighting the significance of accumulated delays. The pattern is concerning: license in August 2024, services put on hold in March 2025 with discussions at 'preliminary stage,' April target missed, and now mid-May with no updates. This suggests systemic obstacles rather than routine final steps.\n\nTheir point about the low bar for resolution (only 'anywhere' in Sri Lanka needs to show available) is valid and suggests I was too strict. The Bangladesh regional context is moderately positive but doesn't directly address Sri Lanka's specific data interception requirements, which remain fundamentally different from routine regulatory processes.\n\nThe TRCSL denial of suspension rumors is the strongest new positive evidence, suggesting active rather than stalled negotiations. Combined with the already-granted license and the low bar for resolution, this warrants an upward revision from my initial 12%.",
    "rationale": "Upon reflection, I maintain that the status quo strongly favors No, but I was too pessimistic about the probability of rapid progress in the final weeks. The key factors supporting an upward revision: (1) TRCSL actively denying suspension rumors indicates ongoing progress rather than paralysis; (2) The license grant in August 2024 cleared the highest regulatory hurdle; (3) The resolution criterion's low bar means a limited pilot or soft launch anywhere in Sri Lanka would suffice; (4) Starlink can update its availability map quickly once internal approvals are secured.\n\nHowever, I remain more pessimistic than my co-forecasters because: (1) The 9-month delay since licensing suggests deep, not superficial, obstacles; (2) The missed April 2025 target from just weeks ago shows continued slippage; (3) Data interception requirements involve national security sensitivities that historically take longer than 6 weeks to resolve from a 'preliminary stage'; (4) No positive news in the past 2 months suggests inertia continues.\n\nBalancing these factors, I'm revising upward to 25%. This reflects genuine uncertainty - the pieces could fall into place quickly - while maintaining that the accumulated pattern of delays and the short remaining timeline make a No outcome substantially more likely.",
