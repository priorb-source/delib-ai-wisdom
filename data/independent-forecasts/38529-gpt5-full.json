  "information": "A series of polls conducted between March and June 2025 show Andrew Cuomo as the frontrunner in the Democratic primary. A SurveyUSA poll in May showed Cuomo as the first choice for 43% of likely Democratic voters, with Zohran Mamdani at 11%. A Marist poll from early May placed Cuomo at 37% and Mamdani at 18%, and a simulation showed Cuomo surpassing the 50% threshold to win in the fifth round of ranked-choice voting. An Emerson College/PIX11/The Hill poll from late May placed Cuomo at 39% to Mamdani's 23%. Earlier polls from March by Honan Strategy Group and Data for Progress also showed Cuomo leading Mamdani with 41% to 18% and 39% to 15%, respectively.\n\nAndrew Cuomo has secured endorsements from several key groups and individuals. These include Luis Dávila Pernas, the chairman of the Democratic Party of Puerto Rico; Latin music star Marc Anthony; and several Orthodox Jewish communities, including the Bobov Hasidic movement, the Crown Heights community, and the Far Rockaway Jewish Alliance. In contrast, Cuomo's primary opponent, Zohran Mamdani, has received the endorsement of Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez.\n\nFinancially, Cuomo's campaign is supported by the New York Apartment Association, which plans to spend $2.5 million on his behalf. His campaign has also run ads targeting Hispanic voters, including a $100,000 ad buy related to the Puerto Rican Day Parade. In a recent debate, all nine Democratic candidates, including Cuomo and Mamdani, were united in their pledge to protect immigrants and maintain New York's status as a sanctuary city. In a separate strategic move, Cuomo announced the founding of his own independent party, 'Fight and Deliver', while remaining in the Democratic primary race.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "About 2–4 weeks (Primary is Jun 24, 2025; credible outlets may call a presumptive nominee on or shortly after primary night, but RCV/absentee tabulation could push a call into late June or early July).",
    "status_quo_outcome": "Yes — Cuomo wins the Democratic primary and is called the presumptive nominee.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Anti-Cuomo voters consolidate behind Mamdani through ranked-choice transfers and a late progressive turnout surge; or a late-breaking scandal/gaffe erodes Cuomo’s lead; or counting delays/RCV margins are too tight for a presumptive call for an extended period.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Cuomo holds his ~40% first-choice share, remains well ahead on election night, and gains enough transfers from eliminated moderates to surpass 50% by mid-rounds in RCV, prompting credible outlets to call him the presumptive nominee.",
    "rationale": "Polling from March–late May consistently shows Cuomo leading by double digits (e.g., SurveyUSA 43–11, Marist 37–18 with an RCV simulation giving him a majority by round five, Emerson/PIX11/The Hill 39–23). That cross-pollster consistency, combined with Cuomo’s high name recognition, targeted outreach to Hispanic voters, supportive IEs (e.g., $2.5M by NY Apartment Association), and endorsements in vote-rich Orthodox communities, makes him the clear frontrunner. With early voting imminent and only ~2 weeks left, large late reversals are less common. Ranked-choice dynamics could narrow margins, but Marist’s simulation suggests Cuomo still clears 50% after transfers. This is not higher because: (1) RCV can enable anti-Cuomo consolidation toward Mamdani; (2) late momentum signs for Mamdani (narrowing in recent polling); (3) uncertainty around turnout composition (a progressive surge could overperform polls); (4) non-trivial risk of late negative revelations for Cuomo. It’s not lower because: (1) multiple reputable polls show a stable, sizable lead; (2) Cuomo’s coalition (older, moderate, parts of Latino and Orthodox communities) is historically reliable in NYC Democratic primaries; (3) resources and air cover likely sustain his edge through Election Day. I would move higher if: new high-quality polls in mid-June show Cuomo at ≥45% first-choice with favorable RCV simulations, or he secures major union/establishment endorsements and strong early vote indicators in his base areas. I would move lower if: late polls tighten to single digits, prominent rivals drop and endorse Mamdani, fresh damaging revelations hit Cuomo, or early turnout skews heavily toward progressive precincts.",
