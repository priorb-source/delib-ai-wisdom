    "review": "The other forecasters raise several important points. Forecaster 2 emphasizes bureaucratic inertia and the risk that reversing policy for one country could undermine the entire reciprocal tariff framework - this is a compelling structural argument I had considered but not fully emphasized. Forecaster 3 makes an excellent technical observation about the resolution criteria: the question explicitly states that suspended provisions still count toward a Yes resolution. This significantly reduces the downside risk, as even temporary relief measures, legal injunctions, or administrative pauses would not prevent a Yes outcome as long as the HTS still displays 'Lesotho + 50%'. Forecaster 3 also flags a technical risk I hadn't considered: the possibility that HTS presentation could change to remove explicit country listings. However, given the high-profile nature of this policy and its recent implementation, this seems unlikely within 5-6 weeks. All three of us independently converged on the 80-90% range, which increases my confidence that this probability band is appropriate. The main uncertainty remains whether diplomatic efforts or political optics could produce a rapid policy reversal or carve-out for Lesotho.",
    "rationale": "After reviewing the other analyses, I'm updating slightly upward. The suspension clause is more important than I initially weighted - it means that even if Lesotho achieves temporary relief through diplomatic channels or legal challenges, the question could still resolve Yes as long as the tariff remains listed in the HTS. This materially reduces the pathways to a No outcome. The convergence of all three forecasters in the 80-90% band also suggests this is the appropriate range. The core logic remains: (1) the tariff is currently in effect, (2) the timeframe is extremely short (5-6 weeks), (3) Lesotho was explicitly excluded from the 90-day pause, and (4) reversing policy for one small country could undermine the broader framework. The primary risk to Yes remains a rapid policy reversal due to diplomatic pressure or humanitarian concerns, but the probability of this occurring within such a compressed timeframe remains low. The technical HTS display risk is minimal given the recency and visibility of the policy. I'm settling at 85%, up from my initial 80%, accounting for the reduced downside risk from the suspension clause while maintaining appropriate uncertainty about tail-risk scenarios.",
