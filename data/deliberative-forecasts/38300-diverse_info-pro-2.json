    "review": "The other forecasters provided excellent, specific details that added valuable nuance. Forecaster 2 introduced crucial data points: negative signals from the Leading Economic Index (LEI) and core PPI, suggesting a weakening trend, but also the critical counterpoint that near-term 'hard data proxies' like rail carloadings for May appeared stable. Forecaster 3 provided a very compelling quantitative framing, emphasizing the high statistical bar required to flip a +1.49% year-over-year (YoY) growth rate to negative in a single month. They also astutely pointed out that April's strength might have been narrowly concentrated in the volatile energy sector, suggesting underlying weakness. The core tension identified is between the strong momentum and high statistical bar favoring a 'Yes' outcome, versus weakening leading indicators and compositional fragility favoring a 'No' outcome.",
    "rationale": "I am updating my forecast slightly upward from 85% to 87%. The deliberation process was highly valuable. While I initially focused on momentum, the other forecasters brought more rigor. I was particularly swayed by two key arguments. First, as articulated by Forecaster 3, the mathematics of flipping from a +1.49% YoY growth in April to a negative reading in May are challenging. This would require a significant month-over-month decline, which is a low-probability event without a major shock. Second, Forecaster 2's point about stable 'hard data proxies' for May is the most direct piece of evidence about the month in question. While their concern about the declining LEI is valid for the medium-term trend, the stable near-term data provides strong evidence that a sharp contraction did not occur *in May*. The risk that April's headline growth was driven by volatile energy components (raised by Forecaster 3) is a valid reason not to be overly confident, but on balance, the combination of the high statistical hurdle and stable real-time proxies makes a positive YoY reading the most likely outcome. I am therefore nudging my probability up by 2 points to reflect a slightly stronger conviction in the status quo holding for one more month.",
