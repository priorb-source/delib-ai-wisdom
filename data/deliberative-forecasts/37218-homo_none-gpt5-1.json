    "review": "Both forecasters emphasize the low per-event base rate and the heavy dependence on location and late-breaking signaling (Dana White/Trump hints). They also point out that UFC 315 is not assured to be a flagship/Las Vegas card (my earlier nudge toward International Fight Week was speculative) and that 2025 obligations could depress attendance frequency. I find these points persuasive, especially the reminder that without venue/date confirmation or signals, the default should lean lower. No new hard facts were introduced, but their framing sharpens the base-rate reasoning and tempers my earlier uplift.",
    "rationale": "Recalibrating to a cleaner base rate: Trump has attended several UFC PPVs in recent years but still misses most. Absent confirmed venue/date and without public signals, the status quo is No. The venue mix across a year includes international sites (near-zero odds) and U.S. cities outside Trump’s usual pattern, which lowers the unconditional probability. Conversely, if 315 were confirmed for Las Vegas/Miami/NYC-NJ and accompanied by credible hints, odds would rise meaningfully. Also, if Trump is serving in office, appearances are possible but likely less frequent due to logistics/security, nudging the unconditional probability down. Given these factors and the lack of supportive signals right now, I’m trimming my estimate from 35% to 27%. I would move up to ~40–45% with credible pre-fight signaling in a friendly venue; I’d move down to ~5–10% if 315 is international/Canada or there’s a clear scheduling conflict.",
