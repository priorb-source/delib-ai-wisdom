    "no_outcome_scenario": "All MLB players have batting averages below .400 on June 1, 2025. Any players who were on a hot streak in April and May experience a natural regression toward their career norms as the sample size of at-bats increases, causing their averages to dip and remain below the .400 mark.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "An elite, high-contact hitter has an exceptionally hot start to the 2025 season. By mid-May, their average is already in the high .300s (e.g., .380+), and they continue their streak for the final two weeks of the month, keeping their average at or above .400 through the June 1st deadline.",
    "rationale": "My forecast is based on the historical rarity of this event. Hitting .400 is exceedingly difficult, even for a two-month stretch. The last player to have a batting average of .400 or higher on June 1st appears to be Chipper Jones in 2008 (.409). This indicates a base rate of roughly once every 15-20 years, suggesting a low probability. The modern baseball environment, with its high-velocity pitchers and specialized relievers, makes sustained high batting averages challenging for all hitters. The status quo is that this event does not happen in a typical season.\n\nMy probability is not lower than 15% because the event is not impossible, and the conditions for it to occur are plausible. It only requires one player out of roughly 50-60 qualified hitters to maintain a hot streak. The June 1st date is key; the sample size of at-bats (roughly 170-190) is still small enough to allow for such an outlier performance. Additionally, recent rule changes restricting defensive shifts could provide a slight tailwind for high-contact hitters, marginally increasing the chance of a .400 run.\n\nMy probability is not higher than 15% because the historical data is a powerful counterargument. Despite the theoretical possibility, it has proven to be a very infrequent occurrence in the 21st century. To forecast a higher probability would be to overweight the chance of an outlier and underweight the strong evidence of historical precedent and the general difficulty of hitting in the modern era.\n\nI would update my forecast upwards significantly if, on May 19, 2025, there is a qualified hitter with a batting average already above .385. Conversely, I would update downwards if the league leader in batting average is below .350 on that date.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill any major league baseball player have a .400 batting average on June 1, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\ntheScore: [How long can Judge's .400 batting average last?](https://www.thescore.com/mlb/news/3284701/how-long-can-judges-400-batting-average-last)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if on June 1, 2025, any Major League Baseball player in the 2025 regular season has a batting average of greater than or equal to .400 according to the [ESPN baseball stats page](https://www.espn.com/mlb/stats)\n\n\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nNo additional information available.\n\nToday is 2025-05-19.\n\nBefore answering you think:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n(e) You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
