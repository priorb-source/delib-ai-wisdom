    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Approximately 2-3 weeks. We are currently on April 22, 2025, and April inflation data is typically released by Trading Economics in early-to-mid May with standard reporting lags.",
    "status_quo_outcome": "The status quo suggests moderate inflationary pressure continues. Given we are late in April 2025, the economic conditions determining April's inflation rate are largely already in place. The linked article indicates Ukraine is approaching stagflation, suggesting elevated inflation concerns.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Ukraine's April inflation remains below 15% due to effective central bank monetary policy, continued international financial support stabilizing the hryvnia, relative improvement in supply chains, or if recent price pressures have been less severe than the stagflation warnings suggest. Currency stability and external aid could be keeping inflation in single digits or low double digits.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Ukraine's April inflation exceeds 15% due to sustained wartime economic pressures including currency devaluation, energy price shocks, severe supply chain disruptions, increased government deficit spending, reduced agricultural production, or accelerating price spirals in essential goods. The stagflation warning materializes with high inflation coinciding with economic stagnation.",
    "rationale": "Since we are already late in April 2025, the economic fundamentals that will determine April's inflation reading are essentially locked in. The article reference to stagflation suggests concerning inflationary pressures exist. However, without specific recent inflation data points from my research assistant, I face significant uncertainty. Key considerations: (1) Ukraine has been in wartime economy conditions which typically generate inflationary pressures through supply disruptions, currency weakness, and fiscal deficits; (2) International financial support has helped stabilize Ukraine's economy; (3) 15% annual inflation is a fairly high threshold - not hyperinflation but clearly elevated; (4) The status quo principle suggests I should be cautious about predicting dramatic changes without strong evidence. My forecast is not higher because 15% is a substantial threshold and Ukraine has received considerable international economic support that may have kept inflation more controlled. My forecast is not lower because the stagflation article indicates real inflationary concerns and wartime economies face inherent price pressures. To update higher, I would need: evidence of recent months showing inflation approaching or exceeding 15%, currency crisis indicators, or reports of accelerating price increases. To update lower, I would need: recent data showing inflation well below 15%, evidence of effective price controls, or currency stabilization data.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill Ukraine's inflation rate increase to at least 15.0% for April 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\n[Ukraine is one step away from stagflation. And here's why](https://en.iz.ru/en/1868046/2025-04-10/ukraine-one-step-away-stagflation-and-heres-why)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if Ukraine's annualized inflation rate is greater than or equal to 15.0% for the month of April 2025, according to the number presented by [Trading Economics](https://tradingeconomics.com/ukraine/inflation-cpi). Under 15.0% resolves as **No**.\n\n\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nNo additional information available.\n\nToday is 2025-04-22.\n\nBefore answering you think:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n(e) You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
