    "review": "The other forecasters provided excellent, structured analyses that highlight a crucial piece of information I had not initially considered: that Merab Dvalishvili has already defeated Sean O'Malley once by a clear unanimous decision. Both forecasters correctly framed the problem as a two-part probability: the chance the fight happens as scheduled, multiplied by the chance Dvalishvili wins if it does. This quantitative approach is more rigorous than my initial assessment. Forecaster 3's inclusion of specifics like O'Malley's post-loss hip surgery and training partners adds valuable context, outlining a clear (though difficult) path for O'Malley to improve. Their consensus on an 80-90% chance of the fight proceeding as planned seems reasonable, especially given the minor injury report for Dvalishvili. Their arguments are convincing and provide a clearer framework for assigning a final probability.",
    "rationale": "My initial forecast of 58% was based on the stylistic matchup and champion status. After reviewing the other analyses, I am adjusting my forecast slightly downwards to 57%. The key new information for me was that Dvalishvili already holds a decisive victory over O'Malley. Paradoxically, while this information increases my confidence that Dvalishvili will win *if the fight occurs*, adopting the other forecasters' more rigorous two-part framework forces a slight moderation of my overall probability. \n\nMy updated reasoning is as follows:\n1.  **P(Fight Happens):** I concur with the other forecasters that a last-minute cancellation is a significant factor, as it results in a 'No' resolution. Given the reports of Dvalishvili's minor injuries, I estimate an 85% probability that the fight proceeds as scheduled. This implies a 15% chance of a 'No' resolution due to cancellation alone.\n2.  **P(Dvalishvili Wins | Fight Happens):** With the knowledge of the first fight's decisive outcome, I see Dvalishvili as a strong favorite. His style is a proven kryptonite for O'Malley. However, I must respect O'Malley's elite striking, knockout power, and the potential for improvement following his surgery. I'm placing this conditional probability at approximately 67%, aligning with the midpoint of Forecaster 3's range.\n\nMultiplying these probabilities (0.85 * 0.67) yields 0.5695. This leads me to revise my forecast from 58% to 57%. The small downward shift is not due to decreased confidence in Dvalishvili as a fighter, but rather a more formal accounting of the non-trivial risk of fight cancellation.",
