  "information": "The West Northamptonshire Council election is scheduled for May 1, 2025. The number of council seats has been reduced from 93 to 76 for this election, with 39 seats required for a majority. The current council composition is: 50 Conservatives, 16 Labour, 4 Reform UK, 3 Greens, and 3 Independents. The incumbent Conservative council leader, Jason Smithers, is not seeking re-election.\n\nNational polling data from late April 2025 indicates voting intentions place Reform UK at approximately 25%, Labour at 24%, and the Conservative Party at 22%. Reports suggest the Liberal Democrats are targeting Conservative-held areas with significant campaign resources, and the rise of Reform UK is expected to split the traditional Conservative vote.\n\nA recent parliamentary by-election in Wellingborough, located within the West Northamptonshire council area, saw a swing from the Conservative Party to the Labour Party. The 2025 election will be contested on new electoral boundaries. Political analyst Professor Sir John Curtice has predicted that nationally, Reform UK could win hundreds of council seats in the May 2025 local elections.",

    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "10 days until the May 1, 2025 election",
    "status_quo_outcome": "The Conservative Party currently holds 50 of 93 council seats (53.8%), suggesting they would retain the most seats if the status quo continues",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Reform UK's rise splits the Conservative vote sufficiently that either Labour, Reform UK, or a combination of opposition parties win more seats than the Conservatives. The Liberal Democrats' targeted campaigning in Conservative areas and the absence of the incumbent leader weaken Conservative performance enough that they fall to second place",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Despite challenging national polling, the Conservatives maintain enough of their voter base and the opposition vote fragments across Labour, Reform UK, Liberal Democrats, and others. Local incumbency advantages and geographic concentration of Conservative support allow them to win more seats than any single opposing party, even if they lose their overall majority",
    "rationale": "The Conservatives start from a strong position with 50 of 93 seats, which normally would suggest a high probability of retaining the most seats. However, several significant headwinds make this uncertain. National polling 10 days before the election shows Conservatives at only 22%, trailing both Reform UK (25%) and Labour (24%). The rise of Reform UK specifically threatens Conservative vote share, as Reform draws from traditional Conservative voters. The Liberal Democrats are actively targeting Conservative areas with substantial resources. The incumbent Conservative leader Jason Smithers not seeking re-election removes a potential advantage. The recent Wellingborough by-election within this council area showed a clear swing from Conservative to Labour. The council size reduction from 93 to 76 seats adds complexity, but proportionally wouldn't help Conservatives given current polling. That said, local elections can deviate from national polls due to local issues and incumbency effects. Conservative support may be geographically concentrated enough to win more seats than rivals even with lower overall vote share. The opposition vote splitting between Labour, Reform UK, and Lib Dems could work in Conservatives' favor under first-past-the-post. My forecast isn't higher because the polling deficit is substantial and the Reform UK factor is specifically designed to hurt Conservatives. The 11-point gap to Reform UK nationally is severe. My forecast isn't lower because of the strong starting position and the possibility that opposition fragmentation prevents any single party from overtaking them. To update higher, I'd need polling showing Conservative recovery or evidence that Reform UK won't perform as well locally. To update lower, I'd need polling showing Conservatives falling further or evidence of tactical voting consolidation against them.",
