    "review": "Both forecasters provide valuable perspectives. Forecaster 2 makes a compelling mathematical argument: with only 5 deaths needed and a recent rate of 0.36 deaths/day (15 deaths over 42 days from March-April), we'd expect approximately 20 deaths over the remaining 57 days. Even at 1/4 the recent pace, the threshold would barely be crossed. This 'low bar' argument is strong - the No outcome truly requires near-cessation of UN staff deaths for two months. Forecaster 3 raises important methodological concerns I underweighted: the status quo resolution is No (295), OCHA could pause reporting, verification lags might delay death reporting, and UN operations might be curtailed. The point about reporting mechanisms is particularly valuable. However, I find these concerns somewhat overstated given OCHA's consistent monthly reporting pattern and the fact that we're discussing only 5 additional deaths over 8 weeks. Forecaster 2's core insight - that you need an extraordinary change to prevent crossing such a low threshold - is more persuasive than Forecaster 3's cautions, though those cautions do matter.",
    "rationale": "After review, I'm updating upward from 78% to 83%. The mathematical case is stronger than I initially weighted: at the recent 0.36 deaths/day rate, we'd expect ~20 deaths by July 1, making 5 seem almost inevitable barring major changes. The key insight is that preventing 5 deaths over 57 days requires either: (1) dramatic security improvements (ceasefire/de-escalation), (2) significant UN operational withdrawal, or (3) OCHA reporting disruption. While each is possible, their combined probability of preventing the threshold seems lower than the 22% I initially assigned. However, I'm not going to 90% because Forecaster 3's concerns about reporting mechanisms, verification lags, and the status quo anchor have merit. OCHA could theoretically freeze updates, deaths might not be verified/reported in time, or there could be methodology changes. These are non-trivial risks that justify staying below 90%. The May 5 report of intensified operations and deteriorating humanitarian conditions supports continuation of dangerous conditions for UN staff.",
