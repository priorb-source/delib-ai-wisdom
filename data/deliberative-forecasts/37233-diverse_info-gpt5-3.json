    "review": "Both peers sharpened the timing/base-rate case against a May declaration. Forecaster 2’s emphasis that the June 1 cutoff is arbitrary from a campaign standpoint is compelling and aligns with Ouattara’s past preference for late declarations (e.g., 2020). Their note that Ouattara said in January he hadn’t yet decided is relevant and slightly lowers the odds for a near-term move. Forecaster 3’s broader strategic point—that weakened opposition reduces urgency to declare—also makes sense, though the specific claim about court rulings sidelining Tidjane Thiam is not something I can independently verify and I won’t overweight it. Both analyses correctly stress the lack of public signals (e.g., a May RHDP congress) that would catalyze a pre–June 1 announcement. Overall, their arguments push me modestly downward from my prior.",
    "rationale": "I started higher (42%) because persistent elite cues (ministers calling him the candidate; “natural candidate” framing) indicate strong party appetite for Ouattara and make a May declaration plausible if the RHDP chooses to lock in momentum. However, the decisive factor for this question is timing, not eventuality. There is no legal or strategic necessity to announce before June 1, and Ouattara has historically been comfortable declaring late. With about a month left and no credible reporting of a scheduled May party congress or set-piece announcement, the base rate for a May declaration is modest. The January comment that he hadn’t decided nudges probabilities down for a near-term move. I would move up if we see credible notice of an RHDP National Council/extraordinary congress in May with candidate designation on the agenda or a presidential address billed as a “major announcement.” I’d move down if silence continues into mid-May or if there are signals of active grooming of an alternative standard-bearer. Net effect: revise down modestly to reflect the timing disadvantage and lack of event signals.",
