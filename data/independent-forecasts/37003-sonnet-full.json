  "information": "The Social Democratic Party of Austria (SPÖ) has been the leading party in every Viennese state election since 1945.\n\nPublic polls from outlets such as ElectsWorld and ORF ahead of the April 27, 2025, election consistently showed the SPÖ with 38-40% of the vote, compared to the Freedom Party of Austria (FPÖ) with 21-24%, indicating a lead of 16-19 percentage points.\n\nThe SPÖ is the incumbent party governing Vienna and is noted to have a well-established and entrenched local party organization.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "6 days - the election is scheduled for April 27, 2025",
    "status_quo_outcome": "Yes - the SPÖ wins the most seats, continuing their unbroken streak since 1945",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Another party, most likely the FPÖ, wins more seats than the SPÖ. This would require either a catastrophic polling error (all recent polls showing 16-19 point SPÖ lead would need to be wrong), a major scandal breaking in the final days that devastates SPÖ support, or unprecedented voter mobilization shifts in the final week.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "The SPÖ maintains its polling lead and converts it into a plurality of seats as expected. Polls hold relatively steady, the SPÖ's established party organization successfully mobilizes voters, and the party continues its 80-year dominance of Viennese politics.",
    "rationale": "The evidence overwhelmingly favors a Yes outcome. My research assistant reports that the SPÖ has won every Viennese state election since 1945 - an 80-year unbroken streak that represents extraordinary political dominance. Recent polling from multiple sources (IFDD, ElectsWorld, ORF) consistently shows the SPÖ at 38-40% versus the FPÖ at 21-24%, a commanding 16-19 percentage point lead. With only 6 days remaining until the election, there is very limited time for this dynamic to shift dramatically. The SPÖ also benefits from incumbency advantage and a well-established local party organization. Good forecasting requires putting substantial weight on the status quo, and here the status quo is remarkably stable and clear. My forecast is not higher (95%+) because: (1) polling errors do occur, though multiple independent polls agreeing reduces this risk, (2) unexpected events could theoretically emerge in the final days, and (3) some epistemic humility is warranted even with strong evidence. My forecast is not lower (85% or below) because: (1) the polling lead is very substantial and consistent across pollsters, (2) the historical pattern is exceptionally strong, (3) the timeframe is extremely short for major shifts, and (4) there's no evidence of late-breaking momentum against the SPÖ. For me to update higher, I would need to see exit polls confirming the SPÖ victory or the election day passing without incident. For me to update lower, I would need new polls showing dramatic tightening or a major scandal affecting the SPÖ leadership.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill the Social Democratic Party of Austria win the most seats in the 2025 Viennese state election?\n\nQuestion background:\nSee for example election polls at [Vienna: Poll by IFDD from 24.03.2025](https://politpro.eu/en/austria/polls/63413/ifdd/2025-03-24)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below.
