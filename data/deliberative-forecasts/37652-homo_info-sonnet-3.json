    "review": "The other forecasters raise several valuable points I hadn't fully considered. Forecaster 2 highlights Carney's deficit increase platform as a potential dampener on enthusiasm - a valid concern during the honeymoon period. Forecaster 3 introduces the tariff dispute context, noting that while Carney's firm stance could boost domestic approval, economic pain from tariffs presents downside risk. Both are slightly more conservative than my initial forecast (65% and 68% vs my 72%), creating a reasonable range of 65-72%. All three analyses converge on similar structural factors: honeymoon effect, Trump's historically low approval, lack of current data, and the short timeframe. The tariff context is particularly relevant - it could amplify the approval gap if Canadians rally around Carney against Trump, or narrow it if economic pain emerges. The deficit concern is real but may be overstated given how robust honeymoon periods typically are in overriding policy concerns initially.",
    "rationale": "After reviewing the other analyses, I'm adjusting my forecast slightly downward from 72% to 70%. The key factors remain: (1) Carney's honeymoon period should still be strong on July 1 (only 2 months post-election); (2) Trump's approval historically constrained in low-40s range; (3) 77% of Canadians held negative views of Trump, creating strong contrast effects; (4) Carney won the election, demonstrating public support. However, I'm moderating my forecast to account for: (1) legitimate concerns about deficit messaging potentially dampening enthusiasm; (2) tariff-related economic risks that could materialize; (3) genuine uncertainty from lack of May 2025 baseline data. The convergence of forecasts around 65-72% suggests this range captures the appropriate uncertainty. My 70% reflects high confidence in the structural advantages (honeymoon + anti-Trump sentiment) while acknowledging meaningful downside risks. I would still update higher with evidence of sustained Carney approval above 55% or update lower with signs of early governing problems or economic deterioration.",
