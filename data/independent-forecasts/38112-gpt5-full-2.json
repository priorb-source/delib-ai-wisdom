  "information": "The 17th BRICS Summit is scheduled for July 6-7, 2025, in Rio de Janeiro. As the host nation, Brazil's presidential adviser Celso Amorim stated in a May 11, 2025 interview that BRICS_ 'should stabilise where it is' before admitting more members.

Brazil has invited Mexico, Uruguay, and Colombia to attend the summit as non-members.\n\nAt the 16th BRICS Summit, a 'partner country' framework was introduced. Of the initial invitees, Indonesia has since become a full member. Algeria, Turkey, and Vietnam have not yet confirmed their participation in the partner framework.

    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "About 38 days (until July 8, 2025, 00:00 BRT, following the scheduled July 6–7 summit in Rio de Janeiro).",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No new full‑membership invitation is issued; BRICS emphasizes consolidation and partner-country engagement without enlarging full membership.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Brazil, as host, keeps the agenda on financial architecture and development funds. India and Brazil prefer a pause on expansion; unanimity is not reached. The summit communiqué contains only general language on future enlargement and no new invitations.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "A late pre‑summit or on‑site leaders’ deal identifies one ‘low‑controversy’ candidate (e.g., a current partner such as Malaysia, Thailand, or Nigeria) to admit as a symbolic win, or a China–Russia push secures Brazilian and Indian acquiescence to invite one additional member.",
    "rationale": "- Status quo bias: The host (Brazil) has publicly signaled a preference to “stabilise where it is” before adding more members, and draft agendas reportedly contain non‑committal language on enlargement. That points to no new invitations absent a deliberate pivot. \n- Process and unanimity: Full membership requires unanimous consent. The April 2025 foreign ministers’ meeting could not even agree on a joint communiqué, a sign that consensus on a divisive issue like expansion will be hard to achieve within weeks. \n- Recent structure: The partner-country framework created in 2024 provides a lower‑friction alternative to keep interested states engaged without committing to full membership. Indonesia’s Jan 2025 accession shows expansion can occur, but Brazil’s current stance and the short runway argue against another move so soon. Several partners (Algeria, Turkey, Vietnam) have not even confirmed participation in the partner framework, and Kazakhstan has publicly ruled out seeking full membership. \n- Guest list context: Brazil has invited Mexico, Uruguay, and Colombia as guests, consistent with outreach without committing to enlargement. Mexico’s strategic alignment and caution make a sudden invitation unlikely. Saudi or Argentina developments wouldn’t count here (reinvites don’t resolve Yes). \nWhy not higher: Strong host-level caution, need for unanimity, recent internal disunity, and a short timeline make a new invitation improbable. \nWhy not lower: BRICS has demonstrated willingness to expand (2023–25), and leaders can strike last‑minute deals. If a ‘safe’ candidate seen as geographically balancing and less controversial emerges, a single invitation could be used as a summit deliverable. \nWhat would move me up: Credible leaks or sherpa‑level reports that leaders have converged on specific admission criteria and a named candidate; Brazil shifting rhetoric from ‘stabilise’ to endorsing limited expansion; pre‑summit joint language foreshadowing admission. \nWhat would move me down: Firm on‑record statements by India and/or Brazil ruling out any 2025 additions; a finalized summit agenda explicitly deferring enlargement; further signs of intra‑bloc disagreement (e.g., another failed joint statement) that make unanimity implausible within the remaining time.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill a new country be invited to BRICS at the 17th BRICS Summit?\n\nQuestion background:\n[BRICS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BRICS) is an intergovernmental organization originally founded by Brazil, Russia, India, and China, which held their first formal summit in 2009. South Africa was invited to join in 2010, completing the original five-member grouping. BRICS serves as a forum for cooperation among major emerging economies, with a focus on economic development, political coordination, and reform of international institutions.\n\nAt the [15th BRICS Summit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/15th_BRICS_summit) in August 2023, the group announced a major expansion. Full membership invitations were extended to Argentina, Egypt, Ethiopia, Iran, Saudi Arabia, and the United Arab Emirates. Argentina later declined the invitation, while Saudi Arabia has not formally accepted. Egypt, Ethiopia, Iran, and the UAE officially joined on January 1, 2024.&#x20;\n\nAt the [16th BRICS Summit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/16th_BRICS_summit) in October 2024, held in Kazan, Russia, BRICS formally introduced a new partner country framework. Thirteen countries were invited as partners at the 16th Summit: Algeria, Belarus, Bolivia, Cuba, Indonesia, Kazakhstan, Malaysia, Nigeria, Turkey, Thailand, Uganda, Uzbekistan, and Vietnam. Algeria, Turkey, and Vietnam have not yet confirmed participation. Indonesia later joined as a full member on January 6, 2025.\n\nThe 17th BRICS Summit is scheduled to take place on July 6–7, 2025, in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. Many countries have formally expressed interest in joining BRICS, but new members can only be admitted with unanimous agreement from existing members. While expansion remains a stated goal of the bloc, no new invitations have been confirmed.\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question will resolve as **Yes** if at least one previously not invited country is invited to join BRICS as a full member during or before the 17th BRICS summit.\n\nThis question will only resolve based upon an invitation for full membership, not partner status or any other status in the organisation.\n\n* An invitation of a partner country to become a full member will resolve this question as **Yes**.\n* Reinvitation of Saudi Arabia or Argentina will not be sufficient to resolve this question as **Yes**.&#x20;\n* Whether or not a country accepts its invitation will have no impact on this question.\n* If the 17th BRICS summit is delayed, that will not impact this question unless the delay is to after August 31, 2025, in which case this question will be annulled.\n* The specific cutoff for resolution will be 00:00 following the final day of the summit. For example, if the summit is held as expected on July 6-7, the cutoff will be July 8, 00:00. This question will use the timezone of the summit's location, if the summit has no physical location, it will use UTC.\n* For the purposes of this question, \"country\" is defined as a UN member state.\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nThe 17th BRICS Summit is scheduled for July 6-7, 2025, in Rio de Janeiro.

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
