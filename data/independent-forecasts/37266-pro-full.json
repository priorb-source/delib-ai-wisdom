  "information": "The U.S. State Department's travel advisory for Mozambique is currently 'Level 3: Reconsider Travel,' as of the last update on December 19, 2023. Specific northern regions of the country are under higher-level warnings. Recent security developments include suspected jihadist attacks in late April and early May 2025 in Niassa province, an area previously less impacted by the insurgency centered in Cabo Delgado. In response, the U.S. Embassy in Maputo issued specific warnings. The UK and Canada have also warned against travel to parts of Niassa and Cabo Delgado. Concurrently, ongoing post-election protests have led the African Travel & Tourism Association (ATTA) to issue its own travel advisory.\n\nThe U.S. State Department uses a four-level travel advisory system. Level 1 is 'Exercise Normal Precautions.' Level 2 is 'Exercise Increased Caution,' for heightened safety and security risks. Level 3, 'Reconsider Travel,' signifies serious risks. Level 4, 'Do Not Travel,' is the highest level, typically applied in cases of widespread violent conflict, civil war, uncontrolled crime, risk of wrongful detention, or severe breakdowns in national infrastructure. The advisories are determined based on factors including crime, terrorism, civil unrest, and health concerns. The State Department reviews advisories for Level 3 and 4 countries at least every six months.\n\nAs of early May 2025, the U.S. State Department has 'Level 4: Do Not Travel' advisories in effect for 21 countries. Reasons for these advisories include active conflicts, terrorism, civil unrest, kidnapping, and health emergencies. The list of countries includes Afghanistan, Belarus, Burkina Faso, Haiti, Iran, Iraq, North Korea, Russia, Somalia, South Sudan, Sudan, Syria, Ukraine, and Yemen. Some advisories have been updated recently; the advisory for South Sudan was elevated to Level 4 on March 8, 2025. In other instances, advisories are applied regionally, such as in Bangladesh, which has a country-wide Level 3 advisory but a Level 4 warning for the Chittagong Hill Tracts region.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Less than two months, as the question resolves on July 1, 2025.",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No. The travel advisory for Mozambique will remain at Level 3 or lower.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "The Islamist insurgency remains largely contained in the northern provinces of Cabo Delgado and Niassa. Post-election protests de-escalate or remain localized without spreading to threaten the stability of the entire country. The US State Department continues to warn against travel to specific northern regions but does not deem the risk high enough for a country-wide Level 4 advisory.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "A significant and rapid deterioration of the security situation occurs. This could involve the jihadist insurgency spreading south and launching major attacks in a key city like Maputo, or the post-election political instability erupting into widespread, violent civil unrest across multiple provinces, leading to a collapse of state control and posing a direct threat to U.S. citizens throughout the country.",
    "rationale": "My forecast is based on the high threshold for a Level 4 advisory and the short timeframe for resolution. The status quo is a 'No,' as Mozambique is currently at Level 3. The State Department reserves Level 4 for the most severe situations, such as widespread civil war, state collapse, or active conflict on a national scale, as seen in countries like Ukraine, Haiti, or Yemen. While the situation in Mozambique is concerning, it does not currently meet this threshold. The primary security threats—the jihadist insurgency and political protests—are significant but have so far been largely regionalized or have not led to a complete breakdown of national order. The recent expansion of insurgent activity into Niassa province and the ongoing political unrest create volatility, which is why the probability is not zero. However, for a 'Yes' outcome to occur within the next two months, the country would need to experience a catastrophic and rapid escalation that spreads nationwide. This is a possible but not a probable scenario. My forecast is not higher because the State Department has historically maintained regional advisories (e.g., Level 4 for specific regions while the country is Level 3) rather than immediately escalating the entire country unless the threat becomes pervasive. My forecast is not lower because the confluence of a spreading insurgency and political instability creates a non-trivial risk of a 'black swan' event that could trigger a rapid re-evaluation. I would increase my forecast if there were credible reports of insurgent cells staging attacks in southern cities or a violent, nationwide crackdown on protests. I would decrease it if the Mozambican government demonstrates significant success in containing the northern insurgency and the political situation stabilizes.",
