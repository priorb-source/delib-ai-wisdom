  "information": "In January 2025, Databricks completed a major funding round, raising over $15.25 billion. This included a $10 billion Series J equity financing round, which valued the company at $62 billion, and an additional $5.25 billion in debt financing provided by several major banks. New investors in the equity round included Meta as a strategic partner. The funding is intended to accelerate the development of new AI products, expand market reach, and finance acquisitions. A portion of the funds was also designated to offer liquidity to current and former employees.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Approximately 40 days (from May 22, 2025 to July 1, 2025)",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No - companies do not announce IPOs by default, and Databricks has shown no signs of planning one",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Databricks continues operating as a well-funded private company, focusing on AI product development and market expansion with the $15.25 billion raised in January 2025. The company makes no announcements about IPO plans before July 1st, consistent with the CEO's previous statement that it would be 'dumb to IPO this year.'",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Despite the recent funding round and previous statements, Databricks unexpectedly decides that market conditions have become highly favorable and announces IPO plans through either an SEC Form S-1 filing or a website announcement, possibly driven by strategic considerations or competitive pressures in the AI/data analytics space.",
    "rationale": "The evidence strongly points toward a NO outcome. Most critically, Databricks completed a massive $15.25 billion funding round just 4 months ago in January 2025, comprising $10 billion in equity at a $62 billion valuation plus $5.25 billion in debt. Companies that raise funding of this magnitude typically don't announce IPOs immediately afterward - such rounds provide substantial runway (18-24+ months typically) and reduce urgency to go public. Additionally, the CEO explicitly stated it's 'dumb to IPO this year,' which directly contradicts announcing IPO plans before July 1, 2025. The funding round included provisions for employee liquidity, which removes one common pressure point for IPOs. With only 40 days remaining until the resolution date, the timeframe is extremely compressed. Even if leadership had changed their strategic thinking, the process from decision to public announcement typically takes longer than this window. The base rate of companies announcing IPOs within 5 months of a major funding round is very low. Why not lower (than 3%): While unlikely, corporate strategies can shift rapidly, especially in dynamic markets. Meta's involvement as a strategic investor could theoretically create unexpected catalysts. Market windows for IPOs can open suddenly. The resolution only requires an announcement, not an actual IPO. Why not higher: The cumulative weight of evidence is overwhelming - recent massive funding, explicit CEO statements against 2025 IPO, short timeframe, and lack of any signals suggesting imminent IPO activity. There are no credible catalysts that would drive such an announcement in the next 40 days. For me to update higher, I would need: evidence of S-1 preparation, leadership statements walking back the anti-IPO stance, market conditions dramatically improving, or credible reporting of IPO preparations. For me to update lower: it's already very low at 3%, but could go to 1% if we saw confirmed statements reaffirming no IPO plans for 2025.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nBefore July 1, 2025, will Databricks announce that it is planning an IPO?\n\nQuestion background:\nTechCrunch: ['It's dumb to IPO this year': Databricks CEO explains why he's waiting to go public](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/dumb-ipo-databricks-ceo-explains-064957000.html)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question will resolve as **Yes** if Databricks, Inc., announces before July 1, 2025, that it is planning an initial public offering. In order to streamline the resolution of this question, there are two resolution sources for the IPO announcement: 1) Databricks filing an [SEC Form S-1](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/sec-form-s-1.asp) or 2) An announcement at the [news](https://www.databricks.com/blog) section of its website. If there is no such announcement before that date, this question resolves as **No**.\n\n\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nIn January 2025, Databricks completed a major funding round, raising over $15.25 billion. This included a $10 billion Series J equity financing round, which valued the company at $62 billion, and an additional $5.25 billion in debt financing provided by several major banks. New investors in the equity round included Meta as a strategic partner. The funding is intended to accelerate the development of new AI products, expand market reach, and finance acquisitions. A portion of the funds was also designated to offer liquidity to current and former employees.\n\nToday is 2025-05-22.\n\nBefore answering you think:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n(e) You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
