    "review": "All three forecasters converge on an extremely low probability (1-2%) with highly consistent reasoning. The core arguments are nearly identical: 16 days is insufficient for standard presidential visit planning, there are no signals or announcements suggesting a trip is planned, and such visits to major powers like China typically require months of advance preparation. Forecaster 2 makes excellent points about flight tracking data and the difficulty of maintaining secrecy this close to execution. Forecaster 3 adds valuable insight about the absence of multilateral events in China that would naturally facilitate a visit. One notable discrepancy: Forecaster 2 refers to Trump as a 'former President' and 'private citizen,' while Forecaster 3 and I both assume Trump is currently serving as President (given the 2025 timeframe and question wording). However, this distinction doesn't materially affect the forecast range since even private citizen visits to China by someone of Trump's prominence would require significant advance planning and would likely be reported. The strong consensus around 1-2%, the absence of any new information suggesting a visit, and the compelling logistical arguments all reinforce the extremely low probability assessment.",
    "rationale": "After reviewing both analyses, I find no compelling reason to change my forecast. The three of us independently arrived at nearly identical probabilities (1%, 2%, 2%) using convergent reasoning. The 16-day window remains the decisive factor - no credible signals exist of advance planning, security preparations, diplomatic announcements, or media leaks that would precede such a visit. Forecaster 3's point about the absence of multilateral events in China is particularly relevant, as these often provide natural opportunities for bilateral meetings. The information environment remains empty of indicators. While I acknowledge Forecaster 2's slightly more conservative 1% and their valid emphasis on the difficulty of maintaining secrecy, I maintain 2% to account for a very small but non-zero probability of extraordinary circumstances: a secretly pre-arranged trip about to be announced, an emergency diplomatic breakthrough, or an undisclosed Asia itinerary that includes China. The difference between 1% and 2% at this level is marginal and reflects slightly different tail-risk assessments rather than substantive disagreement. Each passing day without new information further supports this extremely low probability.",
