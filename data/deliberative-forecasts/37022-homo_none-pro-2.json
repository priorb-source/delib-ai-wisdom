    "review": "Both Forecaster 2 and Forecaster 3 presented analyses that strongly align with my own, reinforcing the conclusion of a near-certain 'Yes' outcome. Forecaster 2 provided a more recent data point for February 2025 (6.65 trillion UAH), which was higher than the figure in my initial analysis and makes the case for 'Yes' even more definitive. Forecaster 3 added valuable context by focusing on the fundamental economic drivers, namely the war-financing needs and reliance on international loans, which explains the persistent upward trend in debt. Their reasoning is highly convincing, as it is based on the same publicly available data and sound economic logic. The consensus among all three of us at 99% is notable and confirms that we are all interpreting the data and the question in the same way, leaving only a small probability for extreme, non-economic events like a major data error or a technical issue with the resolution source.",
    "rationale": "My initial forecast of 99% remains unchanged. The deliberation process has strongly reinforced my confidence in this assessment. The new data points provided by the other forecasters strengthen the existing evidence. Forecaster 2's figure of 6.65 trillion UAH for February 2025 means that Ukraine's government debt would have needed to decrease by an impossible 4.75 trillion UAH in a single month to fall below the 1.90 trillion UAH threshold. Forecaster 3's emphasis on the underlying economic drivers—the war and associated budget deficits—confirms that the financial pressures on Ukraine guarantee a continued high level of debt, making a decrease of this magnitude economically inconceivable. The unanimous agreement among all forecasters on both the outcome and the probability gives me no reason to adjust my position. The 99% forecast correctly reflects a near-certainty based on all available data, while appropriately accounting for the tiny, residual risk of unforeseen technical or administrative errors in the resolution process.",
