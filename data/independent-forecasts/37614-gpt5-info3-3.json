  "information": "Historical data for U.S. local recall elections shows that approximately 60% of recalls that make it to the ballot succeed in removing the official. Several recent recall efforts in other small Colorado towns have been successful. In March 2025, three council members in Dillon were removed by voters in a recall election related to a development plan. In a separate 2025 case in Loveland, the targeted council member resigned from his position after a recall petition gathered sufficient signatures.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "About 8–10 days (recall election is May 20, 2025; unofficial results likely the night of, certification shortly after)",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No — the recall succeeds and Metz is removed",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Turnout is driven by opponents galvanized by the shooting incident coverage; in a very small electorate, a motivated recall group secures a majority to remove Metz.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Metz’s supporters successfully frame the incident as misunderstood or legally defensible, there are no new damaging developments, and low off-cycle turnout is dominated by his network, leading to a narrow retain vote.",
    "rationale": "Base-rate priors for U.S. local recalls suggest roughly 60% of officials on the ballot are removed, implying about a 40% survival chance before case-specific information. The case-specific signals here tilt against survival: the high-salience and negative nature of the allegation (accused of shooting a teen in the face) and recent Colorado recall momentum in small jurisdictions (e.g., Dillon removals in March 2025; a Loveland target resigned once a petition qualified) suggest a political environment favorable to recall proponents. Mountain View is a very small town, so mobilization effects are strong and a passionate opposition can decide the outcome in a low-turnout, off-cycle election. We should also weight the status quo outcome—given the prevailing trend in similar recalls and current negative press—as removal unless countervailing evidence appears. Countervailing considerations keep the probability of survival from being too low: about 40% of recall targets do survive; small-town networks can deliver surprisingly high support in low-turnout contests; if there are no formal charges or if the self-defense narrative resonates locally, some voters may see the recall as overreach. Why not higher? The combination of base-rate disadvantage for incumbents in recalls, the severity and media salience of the allegation, and recent Colorado examples point to removal as more likely. Why not lower? Survival in recalls is not rare; the electorate is tiny and idiosyncratic; off-cycle dynamics can favor an organized incumbent camp. What would move this forecast up: credible reports of strong pro-Metz organization/turnout, endorsements from respected local figures, absence or dismissal of charges, or evidence of voter fatigue with the recall. What would move it down: new negative revelations, broad civic group opposition, high early turnout driven by recall proponents, or legal developments worsening Metz’s standing.",

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any).
