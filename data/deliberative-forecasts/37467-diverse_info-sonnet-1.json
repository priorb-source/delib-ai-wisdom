    "review": "Both forecasters raise critical new information. Forecaster 2 provides crucial liquidity details: a $100M PIK senior secured facility with no cash interest until 2030, plus $116M in cash as of March 2025, totaling ~$216M in available liquidity with no debt maturities before July 1. This is a game-changing data point I lacked. Forecaster 3 highlights alarming operational metrics I underweighted: a negative gross margin of -1.5% and withdrawal of annual guidance, which signals management has lost visibility. The negative gross margin is particularly concerning as it means they lose money on every sale before operational costs. However, I find Forecaster 2's liquidity-focused argument more compelling for this specific 54-day window. Forecaster 3 may be conflating medium-term bankruptcy risk (which is high) with imminent filing risk (which is constrained by available liquidity). The converts trading at 17 cents confirm eventual restructuring likelihood, but the new PIK facility suggests sophisticated lenders believe the company can bridge the near term. The key question is whether covenant breaches or unexpected cash drains could force a filing in 54 days, which seems unlikely but non-zero given the operational catastrophe.",
    "rationale": "After reviewing both analyses, I'm updating my forecast slightly upward from 8% to 9%. The new information cuts both ways. On the positive side, the $100M PIK facility with no cash interest until 2030 combined with $116M cash provides substantial liquidity headroom - approximately $216M total without immediate cash drains from debt service. This makes an imminent bankruptcy filing materially less likely in just 54 days, even with high burn rates. On the negative side, the negative gross margin of -1.5% is far worse than I initially appreciated, and the withdrawal of annual guidance suggests management uncertainty about their ability to project even near-term performance. This operational catastrophe accelerates cash burn and increases tail risk. However, the timeframe remains the dominant factor. With $216M in liquidity and no maturities before July 1, the company would need to burn roughly $4M per day to exhaust resources, which seems implausible. The main risks are: (1) covenant breaches on the new facility forcing acceleration, (2) vendor credit tightening creating a sudden liquidity crisis, or (3) an unforeseen negative event. These remain tail risks rather than base case scenarios. The 9% probability reflects that while the operational situation is dire and medium-term restructuring appears likely, the recent financing provides sufficient runway to survive this particular 54-day window absent a black swan event.",
