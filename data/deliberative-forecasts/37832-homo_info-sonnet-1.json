    "review": "Forecaster 2 raises an important point I initially overlooked: the Data + AI Summit (June 9-12) provides a natural, high-profile venue for an IPO announcement before July 1st. This is a legitimate catalyst that increases the probability somewhat. However, I find their 22% forecast too high given the weight of evidence against an announcement. Forecaster 3's analysis closely mirrors mine and reinforces the low-probability assessment with additional details about lack of preparation signals and comparisons to other companies that have taken visible IPO steps. The key disagreement centers on how much weight to give the summit as a catalyst versus the CEO's explicit statement, absence of preparation signals, and recent mega-funding round.",
    "rationale": "After reviewing both analyses, I'm updating my forecast slightly upward to acknowledge the Data + AI Summit as a genuine catalyst event. Companies do sometimes use their flagship conferences for major strategic announcements, and the June 9-12 timing fits within the resolution window. However, several factors prevent me from moving significantly higher: (1) IPO announcements typically follow months of visible preparation - underwriter selection, audit work, confidential S-1 filings - none of which have been reported, (2) the CEO's explicit statement that '2025 would be dumb' for an IPO remains a powerful signal of intent, (3) the January 2025 mega-funding ($15.25B) was only 4 months ago and included employee liquidity provisions, removing both capital pressure and a key IPO motivation, (4) even if they announce at the summit, the complete absence of preparation signals suggests this wasn't actively planned, making a sudden pivot unlikely. The summit raises the probability from essentially 'only if something completely unexpected happens' to 'there's a specific event where it could happen,' but the baseline factors remain strongly negative. A 6% forecast reflects acknowledgment of the summit catalyst while maintaining that the status quo and CEO statements point heavily toward NO.",
