    "review": "Both forecasters stress the same key drivers I used: extreme time compression, status quo inertia, and the acting-president constraint. Forecaster 3 usefully highlights the article’s language (“growing support” vs. concrete steps), which implies discussions rather than execution—this supports a lower base rate. Forecaster 2 aptly notes that a snap election can compress decision cycles and that a party ‘draft’ could accelerate an announcement. Neither introduced decisive new evidence (e.g., credible reports of Han assembling a campaign, PPP unifying behind him with a timetable, or Han signaling interest). Overall, their ranges (15–25%) bracket my prior and validate a clearly sub-50% but nontrivial probability.",
    "rationale": "The strongest precedent is 2017, when Acting President Hwang declined to run in a snap election, reinforcing a norm of neutrality that likely applies to Han. Organizationally, a real candidacy would usually show signs—formation of a campaign nucleus, donor outreach, legal vetting, and clear party choreography—none of which are indicated beyond a ‘draft’ narrative. Structurally, a June snap election likely places formal registration in late May/early June, so there is no hard necessity to announce before May 5, reducing the pressure to move in the next 13 days. The countervailing path to “Yes” is a rapid PPP consensus that a stabilizing technocrat is optimal, paired with Han’s willingness to resign or otherwise navigate the acting-president constraint; if that coalesces, an announcement could happen quickly. Absent concrete signals, however, the base case remains No. Given that the other analyses do not add specific new signals, I’m holding close to my prior.",
