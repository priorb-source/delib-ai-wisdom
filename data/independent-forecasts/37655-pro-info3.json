  "information": "Former President of Ukraine, Petro Poroshenko, announced on February 16, 2025, that the next presidential elections will take place on October 26, 2025. He claimed his information came from multiple sources, including the Office of the President, law enforcement agencies, the Central Election Commission, and a printing plant which, he alleged, was already calculating the number of ballots required. This followed earlier reports in March 2025 from The Economist, which, citing anonymous sources in the Ukrainian government, had suggested President Zelensky was planning to announce a surprise election for July 2025.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Approximately six and a half weeks, as the question resolves on July 1, 2025.",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No. Martial law remains in effect due to the ongoing war. Ukrainian law currently prohibits holding elections under martial law, and no official plans to hold them have been announced.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "The Ukrainian government maintains that holding elections during a full-scale invasion is legally impossible and practically infeasible. The statements by opposition figures and media reports are disregarded as political maneuvering, and the July 1, 2025 deadline passes without an official government announcement of an election date.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "In response to growing domestic and international pressure regarding the government's democratic mandate, President Zelensky's administration decides to seize the political narrative. A legal framework for wartime elections is hastily passed, and an official body announces a specific date for a presidential election to be held later in the year, thereby satisfying the resolution criteria before the July 1 deadline.",
    "rationale": "My forecast is anchored in the strong status quo that Ukrainian law prohibits elections under martial law, which remains in effect due to the war. The logistical, security, and legal barriers to announcing and holding an election are immense. This makes 'No' the most likely outcome. However, the probability is not lower than 35% due to the significant political pressure indicated by the research assistant's report. A specific claim by a former president, Petro Poroshenko, and a report in The Economist suggest that discussions about an election are very active at high levels. The question resolves on an 'announcement', which is a much lower bar than actually holding an election. The Zelensky administration might use an announcement as a political tool to reaffirm its democratic legitimacy, counter opposition narratives, and demonstrate stability to international partners, even if the election itself is proposed for a much later date and is conditional on the security situation. My forecast is not higher because overcoming the legal and security hurdles would be a radical policy shift and a monumental undertaking that remains unlikely. I would increase my forecast if we see members of the ruling party or the President's Office begin to publicly advocate for a specific legal mechanism for wartime elections. I would decrease it if President Zelensky makes a definitive statement ruling out any election announcement before the end of martial law, or if there is a major military escalation.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill Ukraine announce a presidential election before July 1, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\n[Next Ukrainian presidential election](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Next_Ukrainian_presidential_election)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if, before July 1, 2025, a specific date on which a presidential election will be held is officially announced by the government of Ukraine or any of its agencies that have the authority to do so. If no such announcement occurs before that date, this question resolves as No.\n\nThe election does not have to be held before July 1, 2025; this question resolves based on an announcement.\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nFormer President of Ukraine, Petro Poroshenko, announced on February 16, 2025, that the next presidential elections will take place on October 26, 2025.

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
