    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "About 16 days (until on/after July 1, 2025)",
    "status_quo_outcome": "Most likely No (Anthropic model currently more likely to hold #1 overall on Chatbot Arena based on recent historical pattern)",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Claude remains #1 overall through July 1, 2025, with OpenAI’s best model sitting at #2–#3 and insufficient time or new votes to flip the Elo ordering.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "An OpenAI model (e.g., an o4/o3/4.1 variant) is already #1 and maintains it through July 1, or a late-June update/addition pushes an OpenAI model into a narrow lead or tie for #1 by the check date (ties count).",
    "rationale": "a) Time left: roughly two weeks, which is short for large Elo shifts absent a major new model or a surge of comparisons.\n\nb) Status quo: Without live access, I lean on 2024–early 2025 patterns where Anthropic’s top Claude variant frequently held or contested the #1 spot on the Arena, with OpenAI models commonly in the top cluster but not consistently first. Given slow-moving Elo at the very top and short time remaining, the base case is that the current #1 likely persists to July 1.\n\nc) No scenario: If Claude (or another non-OpenAI model) holds a modest Elo edge now, the remaining time likely isn’t enough for OpenAI to overtake via organic Arena voting. No major OpenAI release is expected in the next two weeks; absent that, rankings tend to be sticky.\n\nd) Yes scenario: If an OpenAI model is already #1, inertia favors it staying there. Alternatively, a late-June OpenAI update or model addition with strong win rates could push it to a narrow #1 or even a tie (ties resolve Yes), though the window is tight.\n\ne) Rationale and evidence weighting: I put extra weight on the status quo because the Arena’s top ranks change slowly. In 2024–early 2025 the top spot often alternated between Anthropic and OpenAI models, but Anthropic more often held a slim edge. With only ~16 days left and no evidence of an imminent OpenAI launch, I modestly favor No. The research assistant provided no new info, so I’m relying on historical leaderboard behavior and typical release cadence.\n- Why not higher: If Anthropic is currently #1 (plausible), there’s little time for OpenAI to overtake without a new release or large influx of matchups.\n- Why not lower: OpenAI’s best models are consistently in the top cluster; small Elo differences and the possibility of a tie for #1 meaningfully raise the chance to around the low-40s.\n\nf) What would change my view:\n- Upward: Confirmation that an OpenAI model is currently #1 overall with a clear Elo lead (e.g., >20–30 Elo) or news of a credible OpenAI model/update landing before July 1; evidence of a tie at #1 including an OpenAI model.\n- Downward: Confirmation that a Claude (or other non-OpenAI) model leads by a comfortable margin; removal or degradation of an OpenAI model from the Arena; a strong new non-OpenAI release displacing OpenAI further down the top cluster.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill an OpenAI model be ranked #1 overall on the Chatbot Arena Leaderboard at the end of the 2nd Quarter of 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nMethodology: [Chatbot Arena: An Open Platform for Evaluating LLMs by Human Preference](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.04132)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if a model owned by OpenAI is in the number 1 overall rank (ties count) at the [Chatbot Arena Leaderboard](https://lmarena.ai/leaderboard) when accessed by Metaculus on or after July 1, 2025. If this is not the case, this question resolves as **No**.\n\nScroll down to Arena Overview and the resolution is based on the \"overall\" rank.\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nNo additional information available.\n\nToday is 2025-06-15.\n\nBefore answering you think:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n(e) You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
