    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Less than 1 day - the question resolves on July 1, 2025, and today is May 31, 2025",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No - the borders remain closed",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "The borders remain closed through July 1, 2025. Given the serious security concerns cited (terror group Mahmuda attacks and arms smuggling) along with economic issues (soya exportation), diplomatic negotiations between Benin and Nigeria require more time than is available. Security protocols, bilateral agreements, and implementation of new border control measures cannot be completed within the remaining timeframe.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Benin announces a rapid reopening of the border crossings before July 1. This would require either: (1) a swift diplomatic breakthrough where both countries agree to immediate security measures, (2) the closure having been intended as only a brief symbolic measure that was already planned to lift, or (3) the borders having already quietly reopened but not yet being widely reported in media.",
    "rationale": "The critical factor here is timing - there is less than 1 day remaining until the resolution date. The borders were closed very recently in May 2025, making this an extremely fresh development. The stated reasons for closure are substantial: a new terror group (Mahmuda) launching attacks, arms smuggling concerns, and economic disputes over commodity exportation. These are serious security and economic issues that typically require extended diplomatic negotiations, security assessments, and implementation of new protocols - processes that normally take weeks or months, not days. My research assistant provided no information suggesting the borders have reopened or that reopening is imminent. The strong status quo bias applies here: borders that were just closed for significant security reasons are very unlikely to reopen within days. To forecast higher, I would need evidence of: ongoing high-level diplomatic talks, public statements indicating imminent reopening, or reports that the closure was always intended to be brief. To forecast lower, I would need absolute certainty that no quiet reopening has occurred, which I cannot have. The 8% probability accounts for epistemic humility regarding potentially unreported developments and the tiny possibility of a last-minute diplomatic breakthrough, while heavily weighing the reality that complex border security issues are not resolved in 24 hours.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill Benin re-open its closed land border crossings with Nigeria's Kwara state before July 1, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\n[Exclusive: Benin Rep.

These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if before July 1, 2025, Benin's land border crossings with Nigeria's Kwara state that were closed in May 2025 are [credibly](https://www.metaculus.com/faq/#definitions) reported to have been reopened.\n\n\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nNo additional information available.\n\nToday is 2025-05-31.\n\nBefore answering you think:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n(e) You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
