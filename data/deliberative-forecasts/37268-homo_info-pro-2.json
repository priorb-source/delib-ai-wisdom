    "review": "The deliberation provided crucial new information and a superior analytical framework that caused a major revision of my initial forecast. My initial analysis was anchored too heavily on Muqtada al-Sadr's public statements and a narrow interpretation of an administrative deadline (the IHEC's May 4th date for alliance registration). I significantly undervalued his history of tactical reversals and was unaware of a critical piece of evidence. \n\nForecaster 2's analysis was similar to my own but assigned a higher probability to Sadr's general unpredictability. While reasonable, it did not introduce new facts. \n\nForecaster 3's analysis was transformative for my forecast. They introduced two powerful arguments I had not considered: \n1.  **New Evidence:** The report that Sadr has called on his followers to update their voter registration. This is a concrete, costly action that is fundamentally inconsistent with a genuine boycott and strongly signals preparation for participation.\n2.  **Superior Framing:** They framed the problem as a contest between Sadr's current stated position and his established historical pattern of reversing boycotts (e.g., in 2014 and 2021). This historical precedent is a much stronger predictor of behavior than his current rhetoric, which can be seen as a negotiating tactic. \n\nI found Forecaster 3's reasoning exceptionally convincing. The new evidence of voter registration updates is a game-changer, and their emphasis on Sadr's strategic imperative to not cede the political arena to his rivals provides a strong explanatory mechanism for a reversal. My initial forecast was wrong because it was based on incomplete and less salient information.",
    "rationale": "My forecast has undergone a significant upward revision based on new evidence and arguments presented during deliberation. My initial 5% forecast was based on Sadr's consistent public reaffirmation of his election boycott. However, two key points raised by another forecaster have convinced me that a reversal is now the most likely scenario.\n\nFirst is the critical new information that Sadr has called on his followers to update their voter registration. This is a concrete preparatory action for an election and a costly signal that directly contradicts his stated intent to boycott. There is little strategic logic in mobilizing his base to register if he does not intend for them to vote.\n\nSecond is the strong historical precedent. Muqtada al-Sadr has a well-established pattern of announcing an election boycott, only to reverse his decision closer to the election date, as he did in 2014 and again in 2021. His boycotts function as a tool for political leverage rather than an irreversible ideological stance. His current public position is therefore more likely to be a tactic in a broader political negotiation than a final decision.\n\nWhile his 2022 withdrawal from parliament was more dramatic than previous actions, the fundamental strategic reality remains: a prolonged absence from government allows his Shi'a rivals in the Coordination Framework to consolidate power unopposed, an outcome he is highly motivated to prevent.\n\nI have updated my forecast from 5% to 60%. My probability is not higher because of the specific deadline in the question (July 1, 2025). Sadr is known for brinkmanship and could strategically delay his announcement past this date to maximize political impact, which would cause this question to resolve as 'No' even if he ultimately participates. However, the combination of strong historical precedent and the recent, tangible action of preparing his voter base makes an announcement of participation before the deadline the most probable outcome.",
