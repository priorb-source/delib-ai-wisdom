    "review": "All three of us converge on a high-confidence forecast (88-95%), which strengthens my conviction in the overall assessment. Forecaster 2 raises an important point I underweighted: the multi-year trend of 100+ losses (103 in 2023, 101 in 2024) suggests systemic organizational problems that transcend any single managerial change. This reinforces that short-term improvements are unlikely to be dramatic. Forecaster 3's explicit mention of PECOTA's .343 preseason projection is useful - even if the Rockies regress toward this 'true talent' level, they'd still be far worse than typical bottom-dwellers. However, I notice Forecaster 3 mentions the Marlins as another potential cellar team, which I hadn't explicitly considered. This actually slightly reduces the probability, as having more teams in contention for worst record increases the chance someone else falls below the Rockies. The key mathematical reality all three analyses agree on: to overtake the Rockies, another team would need to go roughly .100-.200 over 25 games while the Rockies play .350-.400 ball. This requires both events happening simultaneously, which is the compounded improbability driving our high forecasts.",
    "rationale": "After reviewing the other analyses, I'm adjusting my forecast upward slightly to 90%. The convergence around 88-95% from three independent analyses suggests we're in the right range. The multi-year organizational dysfunction argument (100+ losses for three straight years) is compelling and suggests the new manager bounce will be minimal and temporary. The .112 gap remains the dominant factor - it's simply enormous for a ~25 game window. Even accounting for baseball's variance, having another team fall .112 points in cumulative winning percentage while the Rockies surge requires an extreme combination of events. However, I'm not going as high as 95% because: (1) baseball has meaningful variance over this sample size, (2) there are multiple teams that could theoretically collapse (White Sox, Marlins, possibly others), and (3) the compound probability of unlikely events, while small, isn't negligible. A 90% forecast appropriately balances the dominant probability of status quo with realistic tail risk scenarios.",
