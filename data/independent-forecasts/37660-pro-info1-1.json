  "information": "According to a March 25, 2025 report, the Telecommunications Regulatory Commission of Sri Lanka (TRCSL) denied reports of plans to suspend Starlink's satellite broadband service. The TRCSL Director General stated that a 'dashboard system' is required to regulate the service and that its implementation had been delayed. The Director General mentioned that the service was expected to become operational in April 2025 once the necessary systems were in place.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Until July 1, 2025",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No. As of today, May 16, 2025, Sri Lanka is not shown as 'Available' on the Starlink map, and the previously expected launch in April 2025 did not occur.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "The implementation of the 'dashboard system' required by the Sri Lankan telecommunications regulator (TRCSL) continues to face bureaucratic or technical delays. These issues are not resolved in time, pushing the official service launch past the July 1, 2025 deadline.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "The TRCSL and Starlink swiftly resolve the final regulatory requirements concerning the 'dashboard system' in late May or early June. The system goes live, final approval is granted, and Starlink updates its availability map to show Sri Lanka as 'Available' before July 1, 2025.",
    "rationale": "My forecast is based primarily on the recent evidence of delays, which outweighs the initial positive news of licensing. Starlink was granted a license by Sri Lanka in August 2024, indicating a strong initial intent from both parties. However, the more recent and influential information is the March 25, 2025 report from my assistant. This report highlights that a required 'dashboard system' for regulation has been delayed. Critically, the Director General of the TRCSL had expected the service to become operational in April 2025. It is now mid-May, and this deadline has been missed. Missed deadlines in regulatory and technical rollouts are a strong indicator of unforeseen complexity and suggest that future timelines are also at risk. The status quo is one of delay. For the outcome to be 'Yes,' the current trajectory must change significantly within the next six weeks. \n\nMy forecast is not lower than 35% because the fundamental agreement and license are in place. The TRCSL has also actively denied rumors of suspending the service, which shows continued commitment. The remaining hurdle appears to be a specific implementation detail rather than a fundamental policy disagreement, making a resolution within the timeframe still plausible.\n\nMy forecast is not higher than 35% because the missed April deadline is a powerful piece of negative evidence. It demonstrates that the initial official timeline was overly optimistic. With a relatively short period remaining until July 1, 2025, and no public updates on the resolution of the 'dashboard system,' the probability of further delays is substantial. \n\nI would increase my forecast upon news that the dashboard system is complete and has been approved by the TRCSL, or a firm, new launch date is announced by either party. I would decrease my forecast if there is news of additional regulatory requirements or if officials state the launch is now expected in the third quarter of 2025 or later.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill Starlink's website show Sri Lanka as a country with Starlink availability before July 1, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nReuters: [Musk's Starlink wins Sri Lanka licence](https://www.reuters.com/business/media-telecom/sri-lanka-regulator-grants-licence-musks-starlink-satellite-broadband-2024-08-13/)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if, before July 1, 2025, the [Starlink Availability Map](https://www.starlink.com/us/map) has anywhere in Sri Lanka listed as \"Available.\"\n\n\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nAccording to a March 25, 2025 report, the Telecommunications Regulatory Commission of Sri Lanka (TRCSL) denied reports of plans to suspend Starlink's satellite broadband service. The TRCSL Director General stated that a 'dashboard system' is required to regulate the service and that its implementation had been delayed. The Director General mentioned that the service was expected to become operational in April 2025 once the necessary systems were in place.\n\nToday is 2025-05-16.\n\nBefore answering you think:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n(e) You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
