    "no_outcome_scenario": "The State Department restructures the Diversity Visa section and removes or renames the specific 'diversity-visa-submit-entry1.html' page (e.g., consolidating steps into a new page), resulting in a 404 or a redirect to a page that is not the Step 1 Submit an Entry instructions.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "The URL continues to resolve (directly or via a stable redirect) to the Step 1: Submit an Entry instructions page when accessed on or after July 1, 2025.",
    "rationale": "- Baseline: The US State Department’s DV program is ongoing and the Step 1 instructions page is typically evergreen, remaining available year-round even outside the entry window. Government sites tend to preserve legacy URLs or maintain redirects. With only ~6 weeks to go, institutional inertia strongly favors continuity.  \n- Policy risk: Ending or suspending the DV program before July 1 would require legislative or significant executive action, neither of which is signaled right now; even if policy changed, agencies usually keep informational pages or archive them rather than abruptly removing them.  \n- Technical risk: The main downside is a content reorganization that changes the specific slug 'diversity-visa-submit-entry1.html'. While USG sites sometimes refresh IA, they usually retain redirects; the question’s wording could be interpreted strictly about the page living at that exact path. If the URL 404s or redirects to a non-equivalent page, that would resolve No. The clause “on or after July 1” mitigates transient downtime risk because multiple attempts can be made.  \n- Assistant report: No additional information available; thus I lean on general site-stability priors and the short time horizon.  \n- Why not higher: Residual risk of a summer content refresh or URL change, and ambiguity about whether a redirect would count as being “at this location.”  \n- Why not lower: The DV program is active, the page has been stable across cycles, and short horizon greatly reduces chances of disruptive changes.  \n- Updates: I would raise the forecast to 96–98 if I saw recent evidence that this exact URL has been stable across multiple years and that State consistently preserves redirects. I would lower to 75–85 if there were announcements of a site-wide CMS migration, a DV section redesign, or signs the page has recently changed slugs or intermittently 404’d.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill the US State Department's Diversity Visa page still be online on July 1, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\n[Federal judge’s order leaves many visa lottery winners out of luck](https://www.siliconvalley.com/2020/10/01/judges-order-leaves-many-visa-lottery-winners-out-of-luck/) | [Donald Trump's 2017 tweet discussing the DV program](https://x.com/realDonaldTrump/status/925684982307348480)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if the Step 1 Submit an Entry page with instructions for registering for the Diversity Immigrant Visa (DV) Program is at [this location](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/us-visas/immigrate/diversity-visa-program-entry/diversity-visa-submit-entry1.html) when attempted to be accessed by Metaculus on or after July 1, 2025.\n\n\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nNo additional information available.\n\nToday is 2025-05-20.\n\nBefore answering you think:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n(e) You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
