    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Approximately 1.5 months - the resolution period runs from May 12, 2025 to July 1, 2025, and today is May 6, 2025.",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No - the USD would stay above 0.80 EUR. Even with current dollar weakness mentioned in the background article, a move to under 0.80 EUR per USD would represent a significant further depreciation beyond current levels.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "The dollar stabilizes or strengthens as tariff concerns ease, the Federal Reserve maintains its policy stance supporting the dollar, or positive US economic data emerges. Capital flows return to US assets, and the exchange rate remains above 0.80 EUR per USD throughout the resolution period.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Tariff tensions escalate dramatically, causing a crisis of confidence in US economic policy. This triggers significant capital outflows from dollar assets, combined with potential Fed policy shifts or adverse economic data. The resulting volatility drives the USD temporarily below 0.80 EUR, even if just for a brief period during the resolution window.",
    "rationale": "The background indicates the dollar recently hit a 3-year low against the euro amid tariff turmoil, suggesting current weakness and volatility. However, reaching under 0.80 EUR per USD would represent an extreme depreciation - historically, USD/EUR has typically traded in the 0.85-0.95 range. For context, 0.80 EUR per USD means the euro would be worth more than 1.25 USD, a significant threshold. The short timeframe of less than two months makes such a dramatic move less probable absent a major shock. Currency markets do experience volatility during policy uncertainty, and the tariff situation could worsen, but status quo bias suggests rates are more likely to fluctuate within established ranges than break dramatically lower. My forecast is not higher because: (1) such extreme depreciations are rare without major crises; (2) central bank interventions or policy adjustments typically prevent disorderly moves; (3) the short timeframe limits probability of extreme outcomes. My forecast is not lower because: (1) current weakness suggests vulnerability; (2) tariff situations can escalate unpredictably; (3) market volatility is elevated. I would revise upward if trade tensions dramatically worsen or if we see the rate approach 0.82-0.83 in coming days. I would revise downward if tensions ease or the dollar shows renewed strength.",
