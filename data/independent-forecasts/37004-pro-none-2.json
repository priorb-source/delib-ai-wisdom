    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Approximately 6 months, as the election must be held on or before October 20, 2025.",
    "status_quo_outcome": "Yes. Based on current and long-term polling trends, the Conservative Party holds a substantial and sustained lead in popular support over the incumbent Liberal Party.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "The Liberal Party stages a significant comeback. This could be driven by a notable improvement in the economy, a series of missteps or scandals from the Conservative campaign, or a change in Liberal leadership that re-energizes the party and closes the polling gap in the final months.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Current political trends continue. Persistent voter dissatisfaction with the incumbent government over the cost of living and housing affordability, combined with a disciplined campaign from the Conservatives, allows them to maintain their polling lead and secure the most votes.",
    "rationale": "My forecast is primarily based on the Conservative Party's consistent and significant double-digit lead in polling averages over the past 18 months. This is not a recent trend but a durable shift in public opinion, largely driven by voter fatigue with the long-serving Liberal government and persistent economic anxieties around inflation and housing, which are core themes of the Conservative message. The status quo strongly favors a Conservative victory in the popular vote. The fictional Politico article's title suggests polls are the dominant story, which aligns with this assessment. \n\nMy forecast is not higher because an election campaign has yet to begin. Campaigns intensify scrutiny on the front-runner, and Pierre Poilievre's performance under that spotlight is a variable. The Liberal party has historically proven to be a resilient and effective campaign machine, and a six-month timeframe allows for unforeseen events or shifts in public sentiment.\n\nMy forecast is not lower because the scale and duration of the Conservative lead are substantial. The core issues driving their support (economic discontent, desire for change) are deeply entrenched and unlikely to be resolved before the election. Overcoming such a large deficit would require a historic comeback by the incumbent Liberals.\n\nI would increase my probability if the Conservative lead remains at or above 10 points into the fall campaign season. I would decrease my probability if the polling gap narrows to within 5 points, or if the Liberals change leaders and receive a significant and lasting polling boost.",

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any).
