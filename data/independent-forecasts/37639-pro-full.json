  "information": "Mahmoud Khalil, a lawful permanent resident and Palestinian activist, was detained by Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) in March 2025. An immigration judge subsequently ruled that he can be deported, concluding that the government had met its burden to prove grounds for deportation based on national security and foreign policy concerns. Khalil's legal team is appealing this decision to the Board of Immigration Appeals (BIA) and has also filed a separate habeas corpus petition in federal court, arguing that the government's actions violate his First Amendment rights.\n\nOn May 11, 2025, a federal judge in New Jersey extended a temporary restraining order (TRO) that bars ICE from deporting Mahmoud Khalil. The extension was granted because the court found Khalil’s First-Amendment and Administrative Procedure Act claims to be “plausible.” Further legal briefings have been scheduled, and TROs that are extended typically remain in effect until a court rules on a motion for a preliminary injunction.\n\nThe case occurs within a broader context of the Trump administration's actions against individuals involved in pro-Palestinian activism. Reports indicate that since January 2025, the administration has revoked visas for over 1,000 foreign university students. Additionally, the Zionist organization Betar US announced it is working with the administration to help deport demonstrators it considers a threat, and has publicly named Mahmoud Khalil in its statements. U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio has also written that allowing Khalil to remain in the country would create a “hostile environment for Jewish students.”",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Approximately 1.5 months, until July 1, 2025.",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No. The current state is that Mahmoud Khalil is in the United States and is legally protected from deportation by a federal court order. If the legal process continues at a normal pace, he will not be deported by the deadline.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "The federal court's temporary restraining order (TRO) preventing Khalil's deportation remains in effect while the court considers a preliminary injunction. The legal briefings and hearings for this injunction, along with the separate appeal pending before the Board of Immigration Appeals, are not concluded by the July 1, 2025 deadline. As a result, Khalil remains in the United States.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "The federal court moves with extraordinary speed, dissolves the temporary restraining order, and denies a preliminary injunction. Concurrently, the Board of Immigration Appeals expedites and denies his appeal. ICE, under significant political pressure from the administration, immediately secures travel documents and transports Mahmoud Khalil out of the United States before July 1, 2025.",
    "rationale": "My forecast is based on the significant legal barriers that must be overcome in a very short timeframe. The primary factor is the temporary restraining order (TRO) extended by a federal judge on May 11, 2025. The judge found Khalil's First-Amendment claims 'plausible,' signaling that the case has merit and is not frivolous. Federal court proceedings, especially those involving constitutional claims and preliminary injunctions, rarely conclude in under seven weeks. The existence of this TRO creates a powerful legal shield that the executive branch cannot simply ignore.\n\nFurthermore, Khalil has a separate, ongoing appeal with the Board of Immigration Appeals (BIA), which itself is a time-consuming process that often takes many months to resolve. For a 'Yes' outcome to occur, both of these independent legal tracks would need to resolve against Khalil almost immediately.\n\nWhile I acknowledge the considerable political will from the Trump administration, Secretary of State Rubio, and outside groups to deport Khalil, this pressure is directed at a legal system with established procedures and timelines. The judiciary's role often acts as a brake on swift executive action. Therefore, the status quo—where Khalil remains in the U.S. while his legal challenges proceed—is the most probable outcome by the July 1 deadline.\n\nMy probability is not lower than 15% because of the intense and high-level political pressure, which could lead to an unusually expedited process or an emergency legal maneuver by the government to lift the TRO. The initial immigration judge's decision to grant the deportation order also indicates the government has a substantive case on statutory grounds.\n\nMy probability is not higher because the timeline is extremely compressed. Overcoming a federal TRO and a BIA appeal in under 47 days would be an exceptional deviation from standard legal timelines. I would increase my forecast if the federal court were to schedule an emergency hearing and swiftly rule against Khalil, or if the BIA were to issue a sudden, expedited denial of his appeal. I would decrease it if the court schedules hearings for after the July 1 deadline.",
