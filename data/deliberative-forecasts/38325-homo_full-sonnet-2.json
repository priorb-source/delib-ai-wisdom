    "review": "All three forecasts cluster tightly between 33-38%, which is reassuring - we're all anchoring to the same historical base rate of 35-40% for advance estimates in the -0.5% to 0% range. Forecaster 3 raises a compelling point I didn't emphasize enough: the second estimate already incorporated additional data yet only achieved a 0.1 pp upward revision, suggesting the most obvious positive adjustments may have been captured. Forecaster 2's emphasis on 'momentum' is less convincing - statistical revisions don't have momentum in the way economic processes do; each revision is based on new data, not the direction of previous revisions. However, Forecaster 2 correctly notes we're very close to the threshold, which does matter. The key tension is between (1) the strong 35-40% historical precedent for this specific range, and (2) the practical challenge that we need a larger-than-typical second-to-third revision (>0.2 pp) when typical is 0.1-0.2 pp, and we've already had one upward revision. Forecaster 3's caution about the second estimate already capturing low-hanging fruit is valid but not decisive - the third estimate still includes benchmark revisions and more complete March data that weren't available for the second estimate.",
    "rationale": "After reviewing the other forecasters' analyses, my core reasoning remains sound. The 35-40% historical base rate for advance estimates between -0.5% and 0% turning positive by the third estimate is the strongest empirical anchor, and our -0.3% advance estimate falls squarely in this range. This historical rate already accounts for typical revision patterns from advance through second to third estimates. While Forecaster 3's point about the second estimate only achieving a 0.1 pp revision is noteworthy, it doesn't fundamentally change the calculation - the third estimate incorporates distinctly new data (complete March international trade, construction spending, inventories, and annual benchmark revisions) that wasn't available for the second estimate. The fact that all three forecasters converged on 33-38% through independent analysis strengthens confidence in this range. I'm not moving higher because we do need a larger-than-typical single revision (>0.2 pp) and sign changes remain uncommon overall. I'm not moving lower because the historical precedent for this specific situation remains compelling and we're extremely close to the threshold. My 35% forecast sits at the conservative end of the 35-40% historical range, appropriately accounting for the challenge of needing a larger second-to-third revision.",
