    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Less than two months. The outcome will be determined by the final OCHA report published before July 1, 2025.",
    "status_quo_outcome": "Yes. The conflict, while potentially at a lower intensity than its peak, continues. The ongoing risk to humanitarian workers makes it very likely that at least five more UN staff fatalities will be reported over a two-month period.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "A durable ceasefire is agreed upon and effectively implemented for the months of May and June 2025, leading to fewer than five additional UN staff fatalities. Alternatively, OCHA could cease publishing updated reports, locking the observed number at 295.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "The conflict continues through May and June 2025. Ongoing military operations, airstrikes, or crossfire result in the deaths of at least five more UN staff members, which are then reflected in OCHA's subsequent impact snapshots.",
    "rationale": "The current reported number of UN staff fatalities is 295 as of April 30, 2025. The threshold for a 'Yes' outcome is 300, meaning only five additional fatalities need to be reported in the two-month period of May and June 2025. Given that 295 UN staff have been killed since the conflict began, the environment in Gaza is exceptionally dangerous for humanitarian workers. This establishes a strong prior that fatalities will continue as long as the conflict does. The 'Yes' scenario only requires a continuation of this status quo, even at a significantly reduced rate of casualties compared to the conflict's average. A rate of just 2.5 deaths per month would be sufficient to cross the threshold. The 'No' scenario, conversely, requires a significant break from the status quo, namely a durable and effective ceasefire that almost completely eliminates risks to UN staff, or a halt to OCHA's reporting. Given the difficulty in achieving lasting ceasefires in this conflict, this scenario is less probable. My forecast is not higher than 88% because there remains a non-zero chance of a politically negotiated ceasefire being implemented, which could drastically reduce casualties. My forecast is not lower because the required number of additional fatalities is very small (five) over a two-month period in an active, high-intensity conflict zone where a large number of UN staff are operating. I would increase my forecast if a major military escalation occurs. I would decrease it if a credible, internationally-backed ceasefire is announced and appears to be holding.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill 300 or more UN staff be reported to be killed in Gaza according to UN's OCHA in its final impact snapshot before July 1, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nSee accompanying Humanitarian update [here](https://www.ochaopt.org/content/humanitarian-situation-update-284-gaza-strip).\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if the number of reported UN staff killed in Gaza is greater than or equal to 300 according to the most recent impact snapshot for the Gaza Strip posted [here](https://www.ochaopt.org/publications) by the United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs as of July 1, 2025. For example, a snapshot dated April 30, 2025, [reports](https://www.ochaopt.org/content/reported-impact-snapshot-gaza-strip-30-april-2025) 295 UN staff fatalities.\n\nIf OCHA stops posting new updates, this resolves as the most recent number, which as of the time of this question would be the impact snapshot posted on April 30, 2025.\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nNo additional information available.\n\nToday is 2025-05-05.\n\nBefore answering you think:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n(e) You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
