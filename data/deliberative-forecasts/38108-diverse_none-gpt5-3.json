    "review": "New points I found useful: (1) Forecaster 3’s “$200B ≈ 3% of the federal budget” provides a helpful magnitude check; (2) Forecaster 2’s emphasis on COVID-relief fraud as a large, plausibly aggregable pool for claims strengthens the case that a single tranche could push totals quickly; (3) both stress that the criterion is about a claim, not audited savings, increasing feasibility. I’m less convinced by F2’s 35% floor—government update cadence and reputational risk of over-claiming still weigh heavily, and we’ve seen no signaling that DOGE is close. I agree with F3’s “if they were near, we’d likely see hints,” which nudges me to keep the probability modest. Overall, their arguments justify a slight uptick from my prior due to the claim-based resolution and political incentives, but not as high as 35%.",
    "rationale": "Time remaining is ~1 month, and the public narrative earlier this year centered around “over $100B” in waste, not realized or claimed savings. To reach ≥$200B by the first check on/after July 1 likely requires either a methodology shift (counting multi‑year projections/preventions) or a large, prepackaged tranche posted at once. The resolution only requires a claim on doge.gov, so political incentives for a headline milestone are real, and large fraud categories (e.g., pandemic funds) could be aggregated to cross the threshold. Offsetting that: update cadence in government settings tends to be lumpy but infrequent; there’s reputational risk to making an implausible claim without backing; and we’ve seen no credible hints that the tally is already near the threshold. The “if they were close, we’d probably know” signal plus timeline compression keeps the base case at No. I modestly raise my forecast to reflect the plausible path via aggressive counting and a single big update. Triggers for upward revision: reports that DOGE’s current tally is ≥$150B, an announced mid‑year update, or explicit inclusion of multi‑year “estimated” savings. Downward: confirmation that the site’s total remains well under $100B into mid‑June or indications of more conservative methodology.",
