    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Approximately 3.5 weeks until the final Friday of June 2025 (expected June 27, 2025) when the University of Michigan Consumer Sentiment Final Report for June will be released.",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No - Consumer sentiment remains at or above 54.0",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Consumer sentiment stabilizes or improves in June, remaining at 54.0 or higher. This could occur if tariff concerns ease, inflation shows signs of moderating, the labor market remains stable, or positive economic news emerges that rebuilds consumer confidence. The preliminary June reading (typically mid-month) comes in above 54.0 and the final reading confirms this level.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Consumer sentiment continues to plummet below 54.0, driven by intensifying tariff impacts on prices and economic uncertainty, deteriorating economic conditions, rising unemployment concerns, stock market volatility, or other shocks that severely damage consumer confidence. The economic situation resembles crisis-level conditions seen in 2008 or early 2020.",
    "rationale": "The threshold of 54.0 represents an exceptionally low level for consumer sentiment, typically only reached during severe economic crises. The Axios article reference to a 'consumer sentiment plunge' suggests recent significant declines, but without current baseline data from my research assistant, I must weigh several factors. Historically, the Consumer Sentiment Index has ranged from mid-50s during severe recessions to 100+ during strong economic periods. Reaching below 54.0 would indicate crisis-level pessimism. Since we're already in early June 2025, the preliminary June report may be imminent or recently released, which would significantly influence the final reading. Good forecasting practice emphasizes the status quo - dramatic month-over-month changes are relatively rare without major economic shocks. The fact this specific threshold is being asked suggests we may be in unusual territory with tariff-related concerns, but 54.0 remains an extremely pessimistic level. My forecast is not higher because: (1) the explicit mention of a sentiment plunge indicates real concerns, (2) tariff impacts could materially worsen consumer outlook, and (3) we lack data showing current levels are safely above this threshold. My forecast is not lower because: (1) 54.0 is historically extreme, (2) absent evidence of imminent crisis, such levels are uncommon, and (3) the status quo bias suggests gradual rather than catastrophic changes. To update higher, I'd need evidence that current sentiment is solidly above 60, economic indicators are stabilizing, or tariff concerns are easing. To update lower, I'd need preliminary June data near or below 54.0, evidence of accelerating economic deterioration, or major negative shocks.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill the June 2025 University of Michigan Consumer Sentiment Final Report number be less than 54.0?\n\nQuestion background:\nAxios: [Why the consumer sentiment plunge is different now](https://www.axios.com/2025/05/19/tariffs-consumer-economy-sentiment)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if the University of Michigan's reported June Final Results of the Index of Consumer Sentiment, expected to be posted [here](https://data.sca.isr.umich.edu/reports.php) on the final Friday of June 2025, is less than 54.0 for June 2025. Greater than or equal to that amount resolves the question as **No**.\n\n\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nNo additional information available.\n\nToday is 2025-06-04.\n\nBefore answering you think:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n(e) You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
