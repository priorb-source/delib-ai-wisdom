    "review": "The other forecasters raised important points I hadn't fully considered. Forecaster 2 provided valuable historical context showing Erdoğan typically ranges 40-55% approval while Sánchez typically ranges 30-45%. This suggests a historical advantage for Erdoğan that, absent contrary evidence, should influence our baseline expectation. Forecaster 3 appropriately emphasized Turkey's structural economic challenges as a countervailing factor, noting inflation, currency issues, and the potential for 'approval fatigue' after Erdoğan's long tenure since 2003. However, Forecaster 3 also correctly noted Erdoğan won the 2023 election, demonstrating continued electoral support despite these headwinds. All three of us converged on similar uncertainty levels (42-55% range), which provides some validation of the analytical approach. The historical pattern identified by Forecaster 2 is particularly compelling given the short timeframe - with only 33 days, dramatic changes are unlikely, so the historical relationship serves as a reasonable anchor point.",
    "rationale": "Upon reflection, the historical approval ranges cited by Forecaster 2 provide the strongest anchor for this forecast. If Erdoğan has typically maintained 5-10 percentage points higher approval than Sánchez based on their historical ranges, and we have no specific data showing this relationship has reversed, the default expectation should favor continuation of that pattern. The 33-day timeframe reinforces this - approval ratings rarely undergo dramatic reversals in such short periods. While Forecaster 3's points about Turkey's economic challenges are valid, these factors have been present for some time and may already be reflected in whatever the current approval levels are. Without evidence of a recent shift in the relative standings, I should weight the historical pattern more heavily. I'm adjusting my forecast down from 48% to 45%, acknowledging that the historical pattern suggests Erdoğan more likely maintains higher approval, while still expressing considerable uncertainty given our complete lack of current baseline data. The forecast remains near the middle of our range because the uncertainty is genuinely high - we cannot rule out that recent events have shifted the dynamic.",
