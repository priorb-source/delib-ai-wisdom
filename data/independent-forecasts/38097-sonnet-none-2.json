    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "32 days (from May 30, 2025 to July 1, 2025)",
    "status_quo_outcome": "Yes - at least one candidate has likely already been disqualified",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "All five named candidates (Gnangbo Kacou, Laurent Gbagbo, Pascal Affi N'Guessan, Jean-Louis Billon, and Simone Gbagbo) remain eligible and on the electoral list through July 1, 2025, with no legal challenges or administrative decisions removing any of them.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "At least one of the five named candidates is officially disqualified or removed from the electoral list before July 1, 2025, either through court decisions, electoral commission rulings, or administrative actions citing eligibility requirements under Ivorian law.",
    "rationale": "The BBC article headline indicates that a 'main opposition leader' has already been removed from the Ivory Coast electoral list. This is highly significant context. Several of the named candidates are prominent opposition figures: Laurent Gbagbo (former president, previously barred from 2020 election), Simone Gbagbo (Laurent's wife, also a political figure), and Pascal Affi N'Guessan (opposition leader). Given that the article specifically mentions a main opposition leader being removed, there's a substantial probability that one of these five candidates is the subject of that article. Ivory Coast has a documented history of contentious electoral disputes and candidate eligibility challenges. The very short timeframe (only 32 days remaining) means that if a disqualification hasn't already occurred, there's limited time for new ones to happen. However, electoral commissions can act quickly when making such decisions. My forecast is not higher (e.g., 85%+) because: (1) the BBC article might refer to a different opposition leader not on this list, (2) the research assistant provided no confirming details, and (3) without full article access, I cannot verify which candidate was removed. My forecast is not lower (e.g., 30%) because: (1) the timing and specificity of the BBC article strongly suggests recent action, (2) multiple candidates on this list have histories of electoral exclusion, and (3) the 'main opposition leader' descriptor fits several of these candidates perfectly. I would update higher if I could confirm the BBC article specifically names one of these five candidates. I would update lower if credible sources showed all five candidates are currently registered and eligible with no pending legal challenges.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill any of these candidates be disqualified from running in the 2025 Ivorian presidential election before July 1, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nBBC: [Main opposition leader removed from Ivory Coast electoral list](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c0l0j849143o)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if before July 1, 2025, according to [credible sources](https://www.metaculus.com/faq/#definitions) any of these candidates has been removed from the electoral list or otherwise become legally ineligible to run in the [2025 presidential election](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2025_Ivorian_presidential_election) of the Ivory Coast (Côte d'Ivoire) under the laws of the country: Gnangbo Kacou, Laurent Gbagbo, Pascal Affi N'Guessan, Jean-Louis Billon, or Simone Gbagbo.\n\n\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nNo additional information available.\n\nToday is 2025-05-30.\n\nBefore answering you think:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n(e) You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
