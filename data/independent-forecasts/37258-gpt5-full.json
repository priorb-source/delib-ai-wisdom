  "information": "A 2022 UK Supreme Court ruling established that the Scottish Parliament cannot unilaterally hold a legally binding independence referendum without the approval of the UK Parliament in Westminster. The UK government has consistently denied requests for another referendum, a position reiterated by the UK Labour party. The previous independence referendum in 2014 was announced approximately two years before it was held, and precedent suggests constitutional changes require around 18 months of legal and administrative lead time.\n\nIn January 2025, Scotland's First Minister John Swinney described independence as an 'urgent priority'. However, former First Minister Nicola Sturgeon stated in the same month that a referendum was 'off the radar' for now and unlikely before the 2030s. More recent government announcements in April 2025 indicate a strategic focus on the economy, child poverty, and public services. The Scottish Labour leader, Anas Sarwar, has stated his party will not support an independence referendum during the next Holyrood term, regardless of the 2026 election outcome. The leader of the Alba Party, Kenny MacAskill, has suggested using the May 2026 Holyrood elections as a direct mandate for negotiating independence rather than holding a separate referendum.\n\nThe Scottish Government has issued guidance advising against significant or high-profile government announcements between May 15 and June 5, 2025, due to a by-election campaign in the Hamilton, Larkhall and Stonehouse constituency. Separately, tens of thousands of Scottish council workers are being balloted on strike action, with the vote closing on June 12. Public opinion polls on independence are mixed; while one poll showed an 11-point lead for 'Yes,' other sources from late April 2025 indicate polling remains in the 45-55% range against independence, with one citing 54% opposition.",

    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "About 60 days (until July 1, 2025)",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No — no official date is announced or scheduled.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "The Scottish Government maintains focus on domestic priorities (economy, child poverty, public services), observes its May 15–June 5 guidance against major announcements, and then goes into late-June end-of-term rhythms without taking a provocative step. SNP messaging continues to emphasize building a mandate for the 2026 Holyrood election rather than scheduling a referendum date now.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "The First Minister or Scottish Government announces a specific date for an independence referendum (even if framed as consultative or conditional on Westminster’s cooperation), e.g., by publishing a bill with a date or publicly naming a day, as happened in 2022 with the (ultimately blocked) 19 October 2023 plan.",
    "rationale": "Baseline conditions favor inaction over the next two months. Although the question’s resolution ignores UK-wide legality, Scottish ministers still weigh legality and practicality. After the UK Supreme Court’s 2022 ruling that Holyrood cannot legislate an independence referendum unilaterally, the UK Government (now Labour) opposes another vote, and Scottish Labour reiterates no support in the next Holyrood term. Precedent indicates significant lead time (often 18+ months) for constitutional referendums; there’s no preparatory runway or parliamentary alignment evident now. The Scottish Government has recently emphasized domestic policy priorities (economy, child poverty, public services), and there is a guidance period discouraging major announcements from May 15 to June 5 due to a by-election, narrowing the already short window. Polls remain mixed around the mid-40s to low-50s, with occasional pro-Yes outliers; that is unlikely to spur an immediate scheduling decision. While broader legality is irrelevant for this market’s resolution, the government’s own risk calculus makes it reluctant to re-run the 2022 tactic unless it sees strategic value. Why not higher? Time is short, institutional incentives discourage a move likely to be challenged or seen as performative, and party strategy appears oriented toward 2026 rather than a pre-scheduled referendum. Why not lower? There is precedent: in 2022 the Scottish Government did name a specific referendum date despite legal uncertainty. If leadership sought to energize the base or create leverage, they could again announce a date (even conditionally), which would satisfy this market’s criteria. What would raise my forecast: credible reporting or leaks of a new referendum bill or strategic paper naming a date; sustained (multi-poll) Yes support above ~55%; public signals from the First Minister or Cabinet that a date announcement is imminent; an SNP/Parliamentary motion or legislative timetable naming a referendum date. What would lower it: explicit statements ruling out any date announcement before 2026; further emphasis on non-constitutional priorities; continued or worsening polling for Yes; signs the government is risk-averse ahead of summer recess.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nBefore July 1, 2025, will the government of Scotland officially announce a date for an independence referendum?\n\nQuestion background:\nThe National: [Yes posts huge 11-point lead in new Scottish independence poll](https://www.thenational.scot/news/25089457.yes-posts-huge-11-point-lead-new-scottish-independence-poll/)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if, before July 1, 2025, a referendum on the independence of Scotland from the United Kingdom is officially scheduled. If this does not occur before that date, this question resolves as **No**.\n\nFor purposes of this question, the referendum will be considered \"officially scheduled\" when it is announced by a person or entity with the authority to do so within Scotland. Please note that broader legality, such as within the United Kingdom, will be considered irrelevant for this question, so if the federal government declared the referendum illegal, the question would still resolve as Yes.\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nA 2022 UK Supreme Court ruling established that the Scottish Parliament cannot unilaterally hold a legally binding independence referendum without the approval of the UK Parliament in Westminster.
