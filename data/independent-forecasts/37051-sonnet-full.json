  "information": "The Trump administration has threatened to revoke Harvard University's 501(c)(3) status, citing the university's DEI programs, alleged anti-Semitism, and refusal to comply with demands for reforms to governance and leadership. The administration has frozen $2.2 billion in federal funding and $60 million in contracts intended for the university. In response, Harvard has filed a lawsuit against the administration, arguing that its actions are arbitrary, capricious, and outside the scope of its legal authority. The university has rejected the administration's demands, with its spokesperson stating there is 'no legal basis for revoking the University's exemption.'\n\nThe authority to revoke a 501(c)(3) tax-exempt status rests with the Internal Revenue Service (IRS), not the President. According to legal precedent, revocation typically requires evidence that an organization is violating public policy or engaging in illegal activities. The key Supreme Court case, Bob Jones University v. United States (1983), affirmed that tax-exempt status could be revoked for organizations violating clear public policy, such as racial discrimination. The legal and administrative process in the Bob Jones case took over seven years to resolve. Historically, no major university has had its tax-exempt status revoked in recent decades.\n\nLegal experts and former IRS officials state that the revocation process normally involves a multi-step, years-long procedure including an audit, formal notice, appeals, and litigation. Statutory safeguards, such as IRC § 7217 and a 1998 anti-targeting law, are intended to prevent direct presidential direction or politically motivated targeting. The IRS is also reportedly experiencing significant internal challenges, including leadership turnover with three acting directors in one week and workforce reductions. Despite these procedural hurdles, multiple news outlets have reported the Trump administration has formally asked the IRS to begin revocation proceedings and that the agency is 'making plans' to rescind Harvard’s exemption.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Approximately 67 days until July 1, 2025",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No - Harvard retains its 501(c)(3) tax-exempt status, as universities maintain this status absent successful completion of a lengthy IRS revocation process",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "The IRS revocation process follows normal procedures requiring audit, formal notice, appeals, and potential litigation - a multi-year process that cannot be completed by July 1, 2025. Harvard's lawsuit results in injunctions or stays that prevent immediate action. The legal and administrative machinery moves at its typical pace, making it impossible to finalize revocation within 67 days.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "The Trump administration successfully pressures the IRS to bypass normal procedures and expedite an emergency revocation. Harvard's legal challenges are quickly dismissed or denied. The IRS issues immediate revocation without following standard multi-step processes, and this action stands despite legal and procedural safeguards. All of this occurs within 67 days.",
    "rationale": "This forecast heavily weights the status quo due to multiple structural barriers. Historical precedent is clear: the Bob Jones University case took over 7 years, and no major university has lost tax-exempt status in recent decades. The timeframe of 67 days is extraordinarily compressed compared to normal IRS procedures. Key factors supporting a low probability: (1) Legal authority rests with the IRS, not the President directly; (2) Statutory safeguards (IRC § 7217, 1998 anti-targeting law) exist to prevent political targeting; (3) Harvard has filed a lawsuit challenging the administration's authority, which typically results in stays or injunctions; (4) The IRS is experiencing internal turmoil with three acting directors in one week and workforce reductions; (5) Revocation requires following multi-step procedures including audit, formal notice, and appeals processes. While the administration has formally requested IRS action and reports indicate the agency is 'making plans,' there is an enormous gap between initiating proceedings and completing them within 67 days. However, I don't assign zero probability because: (1) We're in unprecedented political times with demonstrated willingness to push executive authority boundaries; (2) The administration has already taken aggressive actions (freezing $2.2B in funding); (3) Emergency or irregular procedures could theoretically be invoked; (4) Some non-zero chance exists for norm-breaking actions. My forecast would increase significantly with evidence of formal IRS revocation notices, court rulings favoring expedited procedures, or clear indications of imminent action by mid-June. It would decrease with court injunctions, statements confirming normal multi-year procedures will be followed, or administration backing down. The probability remains very low due to the severe time constraint and strong institutional/legal barriers.",
