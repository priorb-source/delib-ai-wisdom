    "review": "Both forecasters present compelling evidence I had not fully considered. Most critically, Forecaster 2 cites specific data showing Ukraine's government debt at 6.01 trillion UAH in February 2025 from Trading Economics - the exact resolution source. This is more than 3x the threshold and would require an impossible 67% drop in one month to resolve as No. Forecaster 3 corroborates this with independent references to debt levels exceeding 5 trillion UAH by late 2023 and continuing upward. Both note that even pre-war (2021-2022), Ukraine's debt already exceeded 1.90 trillion UAH, and wartime financing has dramatically increased it. Their reasoning about the implausibility of massive debt reduction is sound - there have been no announcements of major debt forgiveness, and such an event would be widely reported. The only residual risk they identify is definitional issues with Trading Economics' reporting methodology or data errors, which is appropriately cautious. My initial 78% forecast was far too conservative given we're past the reference date and have strong concrete data suggesting debt levels 3x the threshold.",
    "rationale": "I am updating significantly upward based on the specific data points provided. If Trading Economics showed 6.01 trillion UAH for February 2025, and no major debt restructuring occurred (which would be headline news), then March 2025 almost certainly exceeded 1.90 trillion UAH. The wartime context supports continued high debt levels, not sudden reductions. My previous forecast underweighted the concrete evidence available and overweighted general uncertainty. The 1.90 trillion threshold is far below recent reported levels, making this effectively resolved. I'm not going to 99% because I want to preserve a small margin for potential data reporting issues, methodology changes at Trading Economics, or other unforeseen technicalities, but the evidence strongly supports a Yes outcome. The convergence of both forecasters on 97-99% with independent reasoning reinforces the strength of this conclusion.",
