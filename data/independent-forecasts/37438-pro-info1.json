  "information": "Based on its Q4 Fiscal Year 2025 results (for the quarter ending January 31, 2025), ChargePoint reported having $225.6 million in cash, cash equivalents, and restricted cash. The company's operating cash usage decreased to $3 million in Q4, down from $31 million in the previous quarter. The non-GAAP gross margin improved to 30%. While overall Q4 revenue declined 12% year-over-year, subscription revenue grew by 14% to $38 million. The company has no debt maturities until 2028. For Q1 of Fiscal Year 2026, ChargePoint guided for revenues between $95 million and $105 million.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Approximately 2 months, until July 1, 2025.",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No. The company continues to operate without filing for bankruptcy protection.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "ChargePoint continues its operational improvements, maintains its low cash burn rate, and utilizes its substantial cash reserves to fund operations. Its growing subscription revenue and improved margins help stabilize the business, and it successfully navigates the market without facing a liquidity crisis before the resolution date.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "A sudden, catastrophic event occurs, such as a massive, uninsurable liability from a lawsuit or product recall, or a complete and unexpected collapse in revenue that dramatically accelerates cash burn. This would deplete the company's cash reserves far faster than anticipated, forcing management to seek bankruptcy protection as an emergency measure.",
    "rationale": "My forecast is heavily weighted towards the status quo, which in this case is the company's continued operation. The most critical factors supporting this conclusion are ChargePoint's strong liquidity and lack of immediate debt pressure, as highlighted in the provided report. As of January 31, 2025, the company held $225.6 million in cash. Even more significantly, its operating cash usage plummeted to just $3 million for the quarter, a massive improvement from $31 million in the prior quarter. This demonstrates successful cost management and significantly extends their financial runway. Furthermore, with no debt maturities until 2028, there is no near-term catalyst for a creditor-driven bankruptcy. While the year-over-year revenue decline is a concern, it is offset by the 14% growth in higher-margin subscription revenue and the improved non-GAAP gross margin of 30%. Given the short time frame of less than two months until the resolution date, the company's existing cash buffer is more than sufficient to cover its low burn rate. My probability is not lower than 2% because there is always a non-zero tail risk of an unforeseen 'black swan' event, such as major fraud being uncovered or a sudden, catastrophic market shock. My probability is not higher because the financial data shows a company that has successfully taken drastic steps to control its cash burn and has ample liquidity to operate for many quarters, let alone the less than two months remaining for this question. I would raise my forecast significantly if there were news of a sudden liquidity crisis, a major adverse legal judgment, or a restatement of financials revealing a much weaker position. Conversely, a positive earnings report showing continued low cash burn or positive cash flow would cause me to lower my forecast.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill ChargePoint file for bankruptcy before July 1, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\n[ChargePoint Reports Fourth Quarter and Full Fiscal Year 2025 Financial Results](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1777393/000177739325000009/chpt8-kerfy2025q4exx991.htm)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question will resolve as **Yes** if ChargePoint Holdings, Inc., files any petition for bankruptcy protection in the United States, under any chapter of the United States Bankruptcy Code, before July 1, 2025. The question will resolves on the filing of such a petition, not on whether any bankruptcy protection is granted by a court. If no such petition is filed by that date, this question will resolve as **No**.\n\n\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nBased on its Q4 Fiscal Year 2025 results (for the quarter ending January 31, 2025), ChargePoint reported having $225.6 million in cash, cash equivalents, and restricted cash. The company's operating cash usage decreased to $3 million in Q4, down from $31 million in the previous quarter. The non-GAAP gross margin improved to 30%.

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
