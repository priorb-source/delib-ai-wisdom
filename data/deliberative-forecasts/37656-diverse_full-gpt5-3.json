    "review": "Both forecasters focus on the key hinge: the tracker’s labeling standard rather than the underlying policy reality. Forecaster 2 underscores legal inertia and CPB’s strong structural/appropriations position; Forecaster 3 emphasizes revealed preference from the maintainers—leaving it “in progress” two weeks after a high‑profile EO—implying a higher bar than mere announcement. Neither adds new factual data beyond what I considered, but both sharpen two points: (1) how the multi‑year appropriations and CPB’s independence make a decisive, court‑proof cessation implausible within ~6 weeks, and (2) how the maintainers’ delay is itself evidence against a quick flip to “complete.” I find these arguments persuasive and directionally consistent with my prior, with Forecaster 3’s emphasis on tracker behavior particularly salient. The only counterweight is the non-zero chance the maintainers choose an expansive definition of “complete” (EO + OMB/agency guidance), but the two‑week lag lowers that likelihood.",
    "rationale": "This is a labeling/timing question. The main pathways to “Yes” are: (a) the tracker adopts a permissive criterion where the EO plus clear implementation guidance (e.g., OMB/agency halt directives, CPB board compliance) suffices; or (b) a surprisingly rapid legal win that removes uncertainty. Evidence to date points the other way: CPB has sued, funding is pre‑appropriated years ahead, and even sympathetic GOP senators exist—factors that complicate any clean near‑term “funding stopped” narrative. The maintainers’ choice to keep it “in progress” two weeks post‑EO is strong revealed-preference evidence they want tangible, durable implementation before calling it complete. With roughly six weeks left, the modal outcome is continued litigation and ambiguity, which likely keeps the tracker at “in progress.” I slightly lower my forecast to reflect the reinforced point about the tracker’s apparent bar and the short runway. I would move up if: the tracker marks other contentious EO-driven items as “complete” quickly, or if CPB signals compliance halting distributions and courts decline to enjoin. I would move down if a preliminary injunction issues or the tracker states it requires actual cessation of funds/overcoming legal challenges.",
