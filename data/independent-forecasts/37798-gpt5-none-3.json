    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "About 27 days (until June 15, 2025; resolution when Metaculus checks on/after that date)",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Another elite club (e.g., Yankees/Phillies/Braves/Orioles) holds or reaches a higher winning percentage by mid-June, leaving the Dodgers within a couple of games but not at the top when the standings page is checked.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "The Dodgers play roughly .630–.700 over the next ~25–30 games while current leaders cool to ~.500–.550, nudging LA to the best MLB winning percentage (outright or tied) when the MLB standings are checked on/after June 15.",
    "rationale": "- Time horizon and base rates: With only ~4 weeks to go, large reshuffling at the very top is possible but not common. Historically, several teams cluster near the top in mid-May to mid-June; the chance that any one specific team is No. 1 on a particular date is well below 50% unless they already lead by a clear margin.\n- Current-information constraint: I do not have live standings for May 19, 2025. The Dodgers are typically elite and the background article suggests sustained winning, implying they are likely among the top few teams by win%. However, multiple strong contenders usually exist. If the Dodgers are not currently first, the status quo favors No. If they are currently first by a small margin, the edge is still thin due to short-term variance over ~25–30 games.\n- Variance over the next month: In ~28 games, even elite teams face a standard deviation of ~2.5 wins, and several peers with similar true talent could outpace them over this sample. The contest is effectively among ~4–6 top teams; if roughly comparable, a neutral share would be ~17–25%. The Dodgers’ roster strength (Betts/Ohtani/Freeman core; strong rotation depth) nudges that higher, but injuries and schedule strength can offset.\n- Tie handling: I assume ties for highest winning percentage count as \"have the highest\"; if ties did not count, the probability would be a bit lower. Also, because Metaculus resolves when they check on/after June 15, there’s slight timing risk if LA is on top on the 15th but not when checked.\n- Why not higher: Multiple near-peer teams can finish June 15 with the best record; single-team target is hard to hit; small timing/resolution risk.\n- Why not lower: Dodgers’ true-talent level is among MLB’s best, the horizon is short, and they plausibly are already near the top, giving them a meaningful shot.\n- What would move me up: Confirmation that LA currently holds the best MLB win% by a clear margin (≥2 games in the loss column), soft upcoming schedule, strong run differential and key pitchers/regulars healthy. That could push to ~40–50%.\n- What would move me down: Evidence that another team currently leads by multiple games, tougher LA schedule, or fresh injuries to core players; that would drop me to ~10–20%.\n- Research assistant: No additional info provided; forecast relies on priors and typical in-season variance among top teams.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill the LA Dodgers have the highest winning percentage in the MLB on June 15, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nYahoo Sports: [Even as Dodgers navigate injuries and manage pitcher usage, the wins keep coming](https://sports.yahoo.com/mlb/article/even-as-dodgers-navigate-injuries-and-manage-pitcher-usage-the-wins-keep-coming-053322413.html)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if the Los Angeles Dodgers have the highest winning percentage in Major League Baseball according to the [MLB official standings](https://www.mlb.com/standings/) when checked by Metaculus on or after June 15, 2025.\n\nNo other resolution source will be used to resolve the question. Question resolves based on how the page appears when checked by a Metaculus Admin.\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nNo additional information available.\n\nToday is 2025-05-19.\n\nBefore answering you think:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n(e) You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
