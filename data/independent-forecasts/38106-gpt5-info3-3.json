  "information": "In late May 2025, following a major Russian drone and missile attack in Ukraine, President Donald Trump referred to President Vladimir Putin as 'absolutely crazy.' In a separate statement, Trump also expressed his disappointment with Putin's continued attacks, saying, 'I am very disappointed, very, very disappointed.' Trump indicated he would observe Russia's intentions over a two-week period to determine if they were genuine about achieving peace.",

    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "About 31 days (until July 1, 2025)",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Russia continues strikes in Ukraine; the White House pursues diplomacy via phone or neutral venues (e.g., Geneva/Helsinki/Abu Dhabi) and publicly releases no guidance about a Moscow trip. June ends without any Russia visit.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "A sudden breakthrough (e.g., a ceasefire framework, major prisoner/hostage swap, or urgent crisis) prompts the White House to announce or execute a rapid, tightly coordinated visit to Moscow or another Russian city in June.",
    "rationale": "Baseline/priors: US presidential visits to Russia are uncommon and typically planned well in advance. In any random 30–40 day window, the base rate of such a visit is extremely low. Current context: US–Russia relations are at a nadir due to the ongoing war in Ukraine. A post–May 19 Russian barrage, and President Trump’s reported remarks calling President Putin “absolutely crazy” and expressing strong disappointment, signal a hardening posture rather than imminent high-visibility outreach. Trump said he would observe Russia’s intentions for about two weeks—this suggests a wait-and-see approach rather than immediately rewarding Moscow with a visit. Optics and security: A presidential visit to Russia amid active conflict would face intense domestic and allied backlash, as well as complex Secret Service and diplomatic security requirements. When urgent diplomacy does occur, neutral venues are far more likely than travel to Russia itself. Timing: There is only about one month left in the resolution window. Major presidential foreign trips are usually telegraphed; while surprise visits occur, Russia is an unlikely destination for an unannounced stop. Why not higher: The combination of strained relations, security/optics costs, and limited lead time makes a June visit to Russia highly unlikely. Why not lower: Trump’s unpredictability and appetite for headline-grabbing diplomacy create a small tail risk—if a genuine peace initiative or urgent crisis emerges, a rapid trip cannot be ruled out entirely. Information from research assistant: Trump’s late-May comments criticizing Putin and setting a two-week observation period reduce the likelihood of near-term conciliatory gestures like a Moscow visit. What would move me up: Credible reporting of a ceasefire/prisoner-swap framework tied to an in-person meeting in Russia; official or well-sourced leaks about planning security/logistics for a Russia trip; a sharp, public softening in Trump’s rhetoric toward Putin. What would move me down: Continued or escalated Russian strikes, lack of any summit rumors, or announcements of alternative neutral-site talks in June.",

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
