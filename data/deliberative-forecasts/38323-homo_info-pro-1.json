    "review": "My colleagues also forecast a 'No' outcome as more likely, but assign a significantly higher probability to 'Yes' (40%) than my initial 10%. Their reasoning for a potential 'Yes' outcome hinges on two main points: the conflicting positive signal from the Conference Board's confidence index and the general volatility of sentiment data. I find these arguments unpersuasive. Forecaster 2 correctly notes the methodological differences between the surveys; the University of Michigan (UMich) index is more sensitive to forward-looking inflation expectations (which are currently deeply pessimistic), while the Conference Board index is more focused on the current labor market. This divergence explains the conflicting signals and, in my view, reinforces the specific weakness captured by the UMich survey rather than suggesting an imminent rebound. Furthermore, while sentiment is volatile, an 8-point jump in one month is historically rare, making the 60.0 threshold a high bar, not a low one. Conversely, the specific evidence they raise to support the 'No' case—a weak ADP jobs report, rising student loan delinquencies, trade uncertainty, and a cautious Federal Reserve—are compelling additions that I had not fully weighed. This new evidence strengthens the argument for a 'No' outcome.",
    "rationale": "I am maintaining my forecast of 10%. The deliberation has reinforced my conviction in a low probability for a 'Yes' outcome. My original forecast was anchored on the low baseline of 52.2 and the historical rarity (<3% chance) of the nearly 8-point single-month jump required to exceed 60.0. The discussion with my colleagues has only added more concrete, negative evidence to support this view. The weak May ADP report and rising student loan delinquencies cited by Forecaster 2 provide tangible proof of the consumer financial strain driving pessimistic sentiment. Similarly, Forecaster 3's points on tariff uncertainty and a hawkish Fed underscore the macroeconomic headwinds that are unlikely to dissipate in the short term. I believe my colleagues are underweighting the magnitude of the required increase and overweighting the predictive power of the methodologically different Conference Board index. The confluence of historically high inflation expectations (the key driver of the UMich index plunge), fresh signs of labor market weakness, and persistent policy uncertainty makes a significant rebound in sentiment in June highly improbable.",
