    "yes_outcome_scenario": "A federal district court grants a TRO or preliminary injunction before July 1 that stays DHS’s revocation and orders SEVP certification restored pending litigation; alternatively, DHS/SEVP voluntarily reinstates certification before July 1.",
    "rationale": "- Baseline/status quo: Certification was revoked on May 22. By default, SEVP revocations remain in effect unless the agency reverses or a court enjoins enforcement. With just over a month left, the status quo favors No.\n- Path to Yes: The most plausible route is swift judicial relief. Harvard is highly likely to sue and seek a TRO/preliminary injunction on APA grounds (arbitrary/capricious, retaliation, exceeding statutory authority). The harms to ~6,800 international students and the institution are immediate and irreparable, which typically weighs heavily for injunctive relief. The administration’s stated rationale (campus climate, alleged CCP collaboration) appears only tenuously related to the statutory/regulatory criteria SEVP uses for certification (accreditation, reporting, recordkeeping). That legal mismatch increases odds a court restores the prior state pending merits. The 2020 Harvard/MIT case against DHS’s COVID-era student rule, while not identical, shows courts’ receptivity and the government’s vulnerability in this policy area under time pressure.\n- Countervailing risks: The government may frame its action in national security/compliance terms (e.g., refusal to provide records), where courts can be more deferential. If DHS can point to concrete regulatory noncompliance (e.g., 8 C.F.R. 214.3 reporting/record requests) rather than generalized “campus climate,” a judge may be less inclined to order immediate recertification. Procedural hurdles (exhaustion within DHS) could delay relief; and even if a TRO issues, the government might seek a stay on appeal. Politically, this administration appears willing to escalate, lowering odds of voluntary restoration.\n- Why not higher: Status quo is No; the administration seems committed; national security framing and procedural defenses could stick; appellate stay risk exists; timelines for TRO/PI and appeal could slip past July 1.\n- Why not lower: The legal posture likely favors Harvard at the injunction stage (irreparable harm, likelihood of success at least nontrivial, public interest). Courts often preserve the status quo ante in student visa contexts. There is enough time (34 days) for TRO/PI relief.\n- Updates that would move the forecast: Up if a favorable district judge is assigned, a TRO/PI is granted, or DHS signals willingness to pause or narrow its action. Down if Harvard delays filing, a court denies a TRO, DHS produces detailed noncompliance evidence, or an appeals court quickly stays any injunction.\n- Research assistant: No new public information beyond the described revocation; forecast is based on general legal/process considerations and timelines.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill Harvard University have a Student and Exchange Visitor Program certification on July 1, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nThe Trump administration and Harvard University have been through a significant confrontation, since Trump took office for the second time. This [started](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/22/us/politics/harvard-university-trump.html) with a task force commissioned by Trump to address antisemitism on campus, but quickly spiralled out of control. The administration asked Harvard to provide detailed records on foreign students, including disciplinary actions and involvement in protests, and demanded that Harvard implement changes to its admissions, hiring, and diversity policies. Harvard refused, citing concerns over academic freedom and student privacy. In response, the administration froze or pulled almost \\$4 billion in federal grants and contracts to Harvard and its research partners. Harvard filed a lawsuit against the administration, accusing it of attempting to interfere in academic decision-making and penalising the institution for resisting politically motivated demands.\r\n\r\nThe situation escalated on May 22, 2025, when the Department of Homeland Security [revoked](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/22/us/politics/trump-harvard-international-students.html) Harvard's certification under the Student and Exchange Visitor Program, effectively barring the university from enrolling international students for the 2025–2026 academic year. This action affects approximately 6,800 international students or 27% of Harvard's student body, who must now transfer to other institutions or risk losing their legal status. The administration justified the move by accusing Harvard of fostering a \"toxic campus climate,\" failing to protect Jewish students, and allegedly collaborating with the Chinese Communist Party.\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question will resolve as **Yes** if, on July 1, 2025, Harvard University has a certification under the Student and Exchange Visitor Program (SEVP) programme allowing international students to enroll, according to [credible sources](https://www.metaculus.com/faq/#definitions).\n\n* An announcement that Harvard's certification will be restored on a date after July 1, 2025 will not suffice to resolve this question. The certification needs to be in effect for this to resolve.\r\n* Getting the certification at any point on July 1, 2025 would resolve this question as **Yes**.\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nNo additional information available.\n\nToday is 2025-05-28.\n\nBefore answering you think:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n(e) You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
