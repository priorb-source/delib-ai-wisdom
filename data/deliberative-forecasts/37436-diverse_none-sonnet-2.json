    "review": "The other forecasters raised several compelling points I had underweighted. Forecaster 2 effectively emphasizes the extremely low rate required (2.5 deaths/month) compared to the historical average - even a 95% reduction in casualties would still reach the threshold. Forecaster 3 introduces two critical considerations: (1) procedural risk that OCHA could cease posting snapshots before July 1, which would lock the count at 295, and (2) retroactive confirmations or attributions of prior deaths could increase the reported number without new fatalities occurring. This second point is particularly important - I focused only on new deaths when the resolution criteria depends on 'reported' deaths, which can increase through documentation updates. Both forecasters appropriately note the difficulty of achieving durable ceasefires in this conflict historically. However, I think Forecaster 2 at 88% slightly underweights procedural risks and ceasefire possibilities, while Forecaster 3's 78% better balances the high baseline probability against real downside risks.",
    "rationale": "Upon reflection, my initial 65% was too conservative. The key insight is that we need only 5 additional reported deaths over 2 months when 295 have already occurred in a highly dangerous environment. Even substantial de-escalation would likely not prevent this threshold from being crossed. Additionally, Forecaster 3's point about retroactive confirmations creates a second path to YES that I hadn't fully considered - the count could reach 300 through documentation updates of previous incidents rather than only new fatalities. However, I'm not moving all the way to 88% because the procedural risk Forecaster 3 identifies is real - if OCHA stops posting snapshots (though their consistent cadence suggests otherwise), we'd be locked at 295. A meaningful ceasefire with strong UN staff protection, while difficult to achieve, remains possible over a 2-month window. Balancing the strong baseline expectation (continuation reaches threshold easily) against legitimate downside risks (procedural issues, successful ceasefire), I'm updating upward but staying below 88%.",
