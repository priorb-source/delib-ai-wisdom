    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Approximately five weeks, until the deadline of July 1, 2025.",
    "status_quo_outcome": "Discord is a private company and has not announced an IPO. If nothing changes by the deadline, the outcome will be No.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Despite earlier reports of IPO preparations, Discord's management decides to delay the public filing due to unfavorable market conditions, a strategic pivot, or a timeline that extends just beyond the July 1, 2025, deadline.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Acting on its previously reported plans, Discord finalizes its preparations with its investment banking partners and either files its S-1 form with the SEC or makes a formal IPO announcement on its company blog before July 1, 2025.",
    "rationale": "My forecast is heavily influenced by the March 2025 Ars Technica report stating Discord has partnered with J.P. Morgan Chase and Goldman Sachs for a 2025 IPO. The status quo is that Discord is a private company, and without strong evidence, one should assume it will remain so. However, hiring specific, top-tier investment banks is a significant and costly step that signals a firm intention to go public, moving this far beyond mere speculation. Such partnerships typically occur when a company is in the advanced stages of IPO preparation. Given a target of a 2025 IPO, an announcement or S-1 filing before July 1 is a logical step to allow time for the subsequent stages of the process. The current date of May 23, 2025, leaves a five-week window for this to occur, which is a reasonable timeframe. My probability is not higher because IPO timelines are notoriously fluid and can be delayed by weeks or months due to market volatility or internal factors. The report is now two months old, and priorities could have shifted. The July 1 deadline is a strict cutoff, and a minor delay would result in a 'No' outcome. My probability is not lower because the evidence provided is a very strong signal of intent. Ignoring a report naming specific, high-profile underwriters would be overly cautious. I would update my forecast higher upon seeing new, corroborating reports from other major financial news outlets. I would update lower upon seeing reports of a delayed IPO or a significant downturn in the tech or IPO market.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nBefore July 1, 2025, will Discord announce that it is planning an IPO?\n\nQuestion background:\nArs Technica: [Discord is planning an IPO this year, and big changes could be on the horizon](https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2025/03/report-discord-partners-with-jp-morgan-chase-goldman-sachs-for-a-2025-ipo/)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question will resolve as **Yes** if Discord, Inc., announces before July 1, 2025, that it is planning an initial public offering. In order to streamline the resolution of this question, there are two resolution sources for the IPO announcement: 1) The company filing an [SEC Form S-1](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/sec-form-s-1.asp) or 2) An announcement at the [news](https://discord.com/blog) section of its website. If there is no such announcement before that date, this question resolves as **No**.\n\nPlease note that for an announcement on the news section of the company's website to resolve the question as Yes, the announcement must be specific. Vague statements such as \"someday becoming a public company\" will not count. If there is any doubt, then greater weight will be placed on whether an S-1 has been filed.\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nNo additional information available.\n\nToday is 2025-05-23.\n\nBefore answering you think:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n(e) You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
