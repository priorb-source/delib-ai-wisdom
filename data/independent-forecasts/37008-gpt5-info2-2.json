  "information": "According to reports from Samoa NewsHub and the Samoa Observer, temporary generators were expected to be operational by the end of April, coinciding with the scheduled end of the state of emergency. However, the permanent solution to the power crisis is not anticipated to be in place until August 2025.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "9 days",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No — the current emergency is scheduled to expire on April 29, 2025, and no extension is currently announced.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Temporary generators are commissioned by end-April and provide enough capacity to stabilize supply; the government allows the emergency proclamation to lapse on April 29 without renewing it, so there is no state of emergency in effect on April 30 (local time).",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Commissioning of temporary generators slips, or supply/fuel/logistics issues keep outages severe; the Cabinet extends the existing proclamation beyond April 29 or issues a new one, leaving a state of emergency in force on April 30.",
    "rationale": "The government’s March 31 proclamation reportedly set the emergency through April 29, 2025. That sets the status quo to “No” for April 30 unless an extension is announced. The research assistant notes that temporary generators were expected to be online by the end of April, aligning with the emergency’s scheduled end, while the permanent fix is only due around August. If the temporary capacity comes online on schedule, authorities have a clear off-ramp to let the emergency lapse. Political incentives generally favor ending an emergency once a credible interim solution exists. However, short slippages are common in commissioning power assets, and Samoa’s grid likely remains tight even with temporary units. The government may prefer to keep emergency powers briefly (e.g., for fuel procurement, load-shedding management, or price controls) if reliability is uncertain, which creates a real risk of a short extension that covers April 30. Why not higher: The declared end date is April 29, and local reporting anticipates temporary generators by end-April, which would reduce the need for continued emergency powers. Why not lower: The crisis is ongoing, the permanent solution is months away, and delays in commissioning or fuel/logistics could make a short extension prudent; governments often extend emergencies in such contexts. What would move me up: Credible reports of delays in generator arrival/commissioning, continued widespread blackouts late in April, or official hints that Cabinet will extend the proclamation. What would move me down: Official confirmation that temporary generators are online and stable before April 29, or a clear government statement that the emergency will end without renewal.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill a state of emergency be in effect in Samoa on April 30, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\n[Samoan Prime Minister declares state of emergency over power cuts](https://www.stuff.co.nz/nz-news/360634988/samoan-prime-minister-declares-state-emergency-over-power-cuts)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if, according to [credible sources](https://www.metaculus.com/faq/#definitions) Samoa is in a state of emergency that has been declared by a governmental entity with the authority to make such a declaration.\n\nFor example, the state of emergency declaration [posted](https://www.facebook.com/samoagovt/posts/hon-prime-minister-of-samoa-press-statement-proclamation-of-emergency-energy-cri/1059050259591457/) by the government of Samoa on Facebook on March 31, 2025 would count. (Note that when it was declared, it was scheduled to be in effect through April 29, 2025.)\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nAccording to reports from Samoa NewsHub and the Samoa Observer, temporary generators were expected to be operational by the end of April, coinciding with the scheduled end of the state of emergency. However, the permanent solution to the power crisis is not anticipated to be in place until August 2025.\n\nToday is 2025-04-21.\n\nBefore answering you think:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n(e) You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
