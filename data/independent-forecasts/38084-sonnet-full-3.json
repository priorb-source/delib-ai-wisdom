  "information": "According to the resolution source, drought.gov, approximately 22.7 million California residents were living in areas of drought (classified as D1-D4) as of the week of May 27, 2025. The U.S. Drought Monitor map, which provides this data, is updated weekly. Earlier in the year, on March 25, 2025, the California Department of Water Resources reported that water storage at Lake Oroville was 86% full and the statewide snowpack was at 96% of the normal level for that date. Consequently, the State Water Project increased its water allocation forecast to 40% of requested supplies.\n\nIn late May 2025, the National Weather Service issued extreme heat watches and advisories for several inland regions of California, with temperatures forecasted to exceed 100 degrees Fahrenheit. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's (NOAA) Climate Prediction Center also forecasted higher-than-usual temperatures across much of the state for the summer of 2025. NOAA's outlook indicated that the ongoing drought would likely persist through the end of August, with an above-normal risk for significant wildfires from June through August.\n\nA late May 2025 weather forecast for the Bay Area noted a period of unusual weather activity, including a forecasted hot weather event followed by a sharp cooldown. The same forecast mentioned the potential formation of Tropical Storm Alvin in the Eastern Pacific. According to the report, this storm system could track northwest towards California and interact with a low-pressure system, potentially bringing widespread storm activity and rainfall. This was to be followed by a trough of low pressure from Canada, resulting in below-average temperatures and showers.",

    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "30 days until June 28, 2025",
    "status_quo_outcome": "Yes - currently 22.7 million residents are in drought areas, which exceeds the 20.0 million threshold",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Significant rainfall from Tropical Storm Alvin or other weather systems brings widespread precipitation to California over the next 30 days, sufficiently improving conditions to reclassify enough drought areas such that fewer than 20.0 million residents remain in official drought zones by June 28",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Drought conditions persist or worsen as forecasted by NOAA. The predicted extreme heat and above-normal summer temperatures continue, with limited rainfall. The U.S. Drought Monitor continues to show 20.0 million or more residents in drought areas through late June",
    "rationale": "The current baseline strongly favors a Yes outcome. As of May 27, 2025, 22.7 million California residents are in drought areas - already 2.7 million above the resolution threshold. This provides a significant buffer. NOAA's Climate Prediction Center has explicitly forecasted that drought conditions will persist through the end of August 2025, with above-normal temperatures expected across California for summer 2025. The extreme heat watches issued in late May (100°F+ temperatures) suggest conditions that typically exacerbate rather than relieve drought. While earlier water storage levels were promising (Lake Oroville at 86%, snowpack at 96% in March), these springtime conditions have not prevented the current drought situation. The potential for Tropical Storm Alvin to bring rainfall is noted, but even substantial precipitation events typically take more than 30 days to significantly alter official drought classifications, especially when starting from 22.7 million affected residents. The U.S. Drought Monitor updates weekly and uses multiple indicators including precipitation, streamflow, groundwater, and reservoir levels - all of which change slowly. Given that expert forecasts predict persistence, the time frame is short, and we have a comfortable buffer above the threshold, the probability of staying at or above 20 million is high. My forecast is not higher (90%+) because weather can be unpredictable and multiple significant rain events remain possible, particularly with tropical storm activity mentioned. It's not lower (70% or below) because the official forecast explicitly predicts drought persistence and 30 days is insufficient time for the dramatic improvement needed to drop 2.7+ million residents out of drought classification",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill California have 20.0 million or more residents living in drought on June 28, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nSF Gate: [California's drought has returned — and it's already bad](https://www.sfgate.com/bayarea/article/california-drought-problem-20271547.php)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if Drought Monitor at [this link](https://www.drought.gov/states/california) lists greater than or equal to 20.0 million California residents in areas of drought, when the link is accessed by Metaculus on or after June 28, 2025. If the number is below that, this question resolves as **No**.\n\nThe question will resolve as soon as the page is accessed by Metaculus Admins on the resolution date. However, if there are issues accessing the page, then resolution will wait up until the end of the tournament's scoring at which point if Metaculus has still not been able to access the resolution source, this question will be **annulled**.\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nAccording to the resolution source, drought.gov, approximately 22.7 million California residents were living in areas of drought (classified as D1-D4) as of the week of May 27, 2025.

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any).
