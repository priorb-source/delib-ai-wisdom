  "information": "Recent data for the US Industrial Production Index (INDPRO) shows accelerating year-over-year (YoY) growth through early 2025: -0.2% in January, +0.45% in February, +0.85% in March, and +1.49% in April. The April rebound was largely driven by a 1.2% increase in oil extraction and a 2.2% rise in oil processing. In contrast, civil non-energy processing industries have seen a persistent decline since the beginning of the year, averaging a 0.7% monthly fall between January and April.\n\nForward-looking indicators for May 2025 presented a mixed picture. The flash ISM manufacturing PMI for May was above the 50-point growth threshold, and the S&P Global PMI also rose. However, the Conference Board’s Leading Economic Index (LEI) fell by 1.0%, its largest drop since March 2023, and the core Producer Price Index (PPI) saw its first decline since 2020. Hard data proxies were also varied: aggregate hours worked in manufacturing were flat in April, while May's rail car-loadings and electricity output were tracking close to April's levels. Auto assemblies rebounded following shutdowns in the first quarter.\n\nThe global economic environment shows signs of slowing. The U.S. Energy Department forecasts that global oil consumption growth will be less than 1 million barrels per day in 2025 and 2026, a significant drop from the historical average, partly due to economic slowdowns in Asia. China's manufacturing PMI for May rose to 49.5 but remained in contractionary territory for the second straight month, although sub-indexes for production and new orders improved. In the Eurozone, industrial production grew in early 2025, but the outlook is considered uncertain due to potential U.S. tariffs.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Approximately 2 weeks. The data for May 2025 is expected to be released on or after June 15, 2025.",
    "status_quo_outcome": "Yes. Year-over-year (YoY) growth has been positive and accelerating for the past three months, with the most recent figure for April 2025 being +1.49%. A continuation of this trend would result in a 'Yes' outcome.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "A 'No' outcome would occur if YoY growth is zero or negative. This could be triggered by a sharp, unexpected contraction in May, driven by the persistent decline in non-energy processing industries deepening and overwhelming the stronger energy and auto sectors. A sudden external shock or a rapid cooling of domestic demand, as hinted at by the recent sharp drop in the Leading Economic Index and the first core PPI decline since 2020, could also cause the index to fall below its May 2024 level.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "A 'Yes' outcome occurs if YoY growth is greater than zero. This scenario is supported by the strong positive momentum from the previous three months. Continued strength in oil extraction and a sustained rebound in auto assemblies could be enough to offset the weakness in other manufacturing sectors. Positive forward-looking indicators like the ISM and S&P Global PMIs, which are in expansionary territory, also support this outcome, suggesting that businesses expect near-term growth.",
    "rationale": "My forecast is primarily based on the strong recent trend and momentum in the Industrial Production Index. The year-over-year growth has not only been positive for the last three months but has also been accelerating, reaching +1.49% in April. This provides a significant buffer, meaning May's industrial production would need to contract substantially to fall below the level of May 2024 and register negative YoY growth. This strong status quo is the main driver of my high probability estimate. The forecast is further supported by positive near-term survey data, specifically the ISM and S&P Global manufacturing PMIs for May, both of which indicate expansion. Additionally, the reported rebound in auto assemblies provides a concrete source of strength for the index.\n\nMy probability is not higher than 80% due to several significant counter-signals that introduce uncertainty. The research report highlights a persistent decline in civil non-energy processing industries, suggesting the recovery is not broad-based. More concerning are the recent sharp drop in the Conference Board's Leading Economic Index (LEI) and the first decline in the core Producer Price Index (PPI) since 2020. These are forward-looking indicators that suggest a potential slowdown ahead. Furthermore, a slowing global economy, particularly in China and Europe, could create headwinds for US exports. These factors suggest the recent acceleration may be fragile and prevent me from assigning a higher probability.\n\nConversely, my probability is not lower than 80% because the negative indicators are, at this point, potential risks rather than confirmed-impact events for the May data. The positive momentum from a +1.49% YoY reading is a very strong signal that is difficult to reverse in a single month without a major shock. The positive PMIs are more contemporaneous indicators of manufacturing health than the LEI and directly support a 'Yes' outcome for May.\n\nI would update my forecast downwards if high-frequency data for May (such as weekly electricity output or rail car loadings) were to show a significant drop-off. I would update it upwards if there were positive revisions to prior months' data or evidence that the non-energy manufacturing slump had bottomed out.",
