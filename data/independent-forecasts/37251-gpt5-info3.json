  "information": "The potential purchase is part of Vietnam's broader effort to diversify its arms suppliers, moving away from its traditional reliance on Russian equipment. The deal is situated within a complex regional security environment, particularly Vietnam's ongoing territorial disputes with China in the South China Sea. Hanwha Aerospace, the manufacturer of the K9, has been actively securing defense contracts globally, with significant sales to Poland, Australia, and Egypt. The company reported a substantial increase in its first-quarter 2025 sales, driven by exports of the K9, and noted expectations for more orders in the second half of the year.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "About 2 months (until July 1, 2025)",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No — absent a public government announcement by the deadline, the question resolves No.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Talks continue but slip into the second half of 2025; or Vietnam opts for a different artillery solution (e.g., a wheeled system) or delays the purchase amid internal approvals/anti-corruption headwinds; or the parties quietly conclude terms but do not make a public government announcement before July 1.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Seoul’s DAPA or the Blue House, and/or Vietnam’s Ministry of National Defence or government media, publicly announce that the two governments have agreed for South Korea to export at least two K9 (or other South Korean self-propelled howitzers) to Vietnam—possibly timed with a high-level visit or bilateral event, or a contract-signing ceremony.",
    "rationale": "- Evidence of active talks: Credible reporting indicates Vietnam is negotiating to buy ~20 K9s (~$300M). This aligns with Vietnam’s desire to diversify away from Russian gear and with Seoul’s push to expand K9 exports.\n- Incentives: Both sides benefit—Seoul opens a new market; Hanoi modernizes artillery and deepens ties with a major regional partner amid South China Sea frictions.\n- Timing headwinds vs our deadline: The research assistant notes Hanwha expects more orders in 2H 2025, suggesting slippage past July 1. Vietnam’s procurement pace has been cautious, and a first-ever Korean defense sale to Vietnam likely undergoes extra scrutiny. Vietnam also tends to be discreet on sensitive arms buys, which matters because this question requires a government announcement; a company-only disclosure may not count.\n- Status quo weighting: With only ~2 months left, the default is that negotiations continue without a qualifying public announcement by governments before the cutoff. That path-to-No feels more likely than a rapid, public, G2G announcement.\n- Why not higher: First-of-kind sale, political sensitivity vis-à-vis China, internal approval processes, potential preference for wheeled artillery, and the 2H guidance from Hanwha all lean against a near-term public G2G announcement.\n- Why not lower: The deal is live, publicly reported, and strategically coherent. A small initial tranche (≥2) would satisfy the criterion, and South Korea frequently publicizes export wins—if buyer permits.\n- Up/down triggers:\n  • Up: Reports of final approval or initialing, scheduled high-level visit with defense deliverables, explicit statements from DAPA/MND that negotiations are concluded pending formal signing, budgetary allocation in Vietnam state media, or notice that buyer consented to public disclosure.\n  • Down: Credible reporting that Vietnam selects a different system, procurement delays linked to internal politics/anti-corruption probes, signals that Hanoi requests confidentiality beyond July, or company guidance pushing expected closure beyond Q3/Q4 2025.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill Vietnam and South Korea announce an agreement for South Korea to export self-propelled howitzers to Vietnam?\n\nQuestion background:\nThe Korea Herald: [South Korea-Vietnam ties enter new strategic terrain, but need more detailed road map: Seoul envoy](https://www.koreaherald.com/article/10464718) \"Vietnam is reportedly in negotiations to import 20 units of K9 self-propelled howitzers from Korea in a deal valued at $300 million. If finalized, it would mark Korea’s first defense arms sale to the country.\"\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if, before July 1, 2025, the governments of Vietnam and/or South Korea announce an agreement for South Korea to export 2 or more self-propelled howitzers to Vietnam. If no such agreement is announced after the launch of this question and before July 1, 2025, this question resolves as **No**.\n\n\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nThe potential purchase is part of Vietnam's broader effort to diversify its arms suppliers, moving away from its traditional reliance on Russian equipment. The deal is situated within a complex regional security environment, particularly Vietnam's ongoing territorial disputes with China in the South China Sea.

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
