    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Approximately 2–4 weeks (until the June 2025 G7 meeting occurs and attendance is observed)",
    "status_quo_outcome": "Yes — Trump attends in person as planned",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "A last‑minute cancellation due to acute health issues, a domestic or international crisis that keeps him in Washington, a security threat that alters his travel, or an unexpected rescheduling/format change that moves the summit outside June or makes it virtual.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Trump flies to Canada and participates in at least one in‑person leaders’ session/photo‑op with other G7 heads of government during the June 2025 summit.",
    "rationale": "- Evidence: The user-provided CTV report says the White House has confirmed President Trump will visit Canada for the G7. Historically, U.S. presidents nearly always attend G7 summits in person, and Trump himself attended prior G7s when in office. Canada is a short, low‑friction trip for a U.S. president, and advance planning/logistics for such visits are typically locked in weeks ahead.\n- Status quo weighting: With a public confirmation and standard practice favoring attendance, the base case is that he goes. The short time window until the event further lowers the probability of a major change.\n- Why not higher: Non‑trivial tail risks remain — sudden health issues, an acute domestic crisis, security concerns, or an unexpected diplomatic choice to skip. A small chance also exists of date/format changes (e.g., if the summit were moved or made virtual) that would invalidate in‑person attendance in June per the question’s criteria.\n- Why not lower: Official confirmation, allied expectations, and the strategic value of the first G7 of a term make a no‑show unlikely. Travel to Canada reduces logistical risk compared to longer trips.\n- Updates that would move me up: Publication of the official schedule with firm travel times, Air Force One wheels‑up toward the venue, or pool reports confirming arrival at the summit site.\n- Updates that would move me down: Credible reports of illness/injury, an emergent crisis (e.g., major domestic emergency or military escalation), security advisories affecting the venue, or any indication of postponement/virtualization moving the summit outside June.\n- Research assistant: No additional information beyond the cited confirmation; nothing contradicts attendance.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill Donald Trump attend the G7 Summit in June 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nCTV: [Donald Trump will visit Canada for G7, White House confirms](https://www.ctvnews.ca/politics/article/white-house-confirms-trump-will-visit-canada-for-g7-leaders-summit/)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if US President Donald J. Trump attends in person a G7 summit held in June 2025.\n\n\"In person\" is defined as occupying the same physical space closely enough at the G7 Summit that he can see and hear other heads of state through direct un-intermediated exchange of photons and sound waves.\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nNo additional information available.\n\nToday is 2025-06-03.\n\nBefore answering you think:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n(e) You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
