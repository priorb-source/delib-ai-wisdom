    "review": "I have reviewed the analyses from the two other forecasters, both of whom arrived at a 65% probability. I found their reasoning persuasive, particularly their emphasis on two points I had previously underweighted. First, they both correctly identified the Israeli media report as a uniquely powerful signal. Their argument—that an assessment of a 'high chance' of a deal from senior ministers in a typically hawkish and well-informed nation like Israel implies genuine, non-public progress—is very compelling. It suggests the negotiations have moved beyond posturing. Second, they framed President Trump's two-month deadline not just as a source of pressure, but as a 'forcing function' that makes some form of resolution (deal or collapse) more likely than a continued stalemate. This interpretation suggests the deadline is a signal of the US administration's own desire for a swift outcome.",
    "rationale": "After deliberating with my colleagues, I am increasing my forecast. My initial analysis was anchored more heavily on the vast and seemingly irreconcilable gap between the public 'red lines' of the U.S. and Iran. While this remains a major obstacle, the other forecasters convinced me that the combination of high-tempo, reportedly 'constructive' negotiations and the powerful external signal from Israeli intelligence should be weighted more heavily than the public negotiating stances. Public positions are often maximalist, whereas the process evidence points more reliably to the true trajectory of the talks. The Israeli assessment, in particular, suggests that the probability of a behind-the-scenes compromise is significantly higher than I first estimated. The short timeframe to the resolution date also makes a limited 'less-for-less' agreement, which would satisfy the resolution criteria, a plausible outcome to de-escalate the situation and claim a political victory. I am therefore updating my forecast to align with the others, reflecting a greater confidence that the current momentum will overcome the remaining obstacles to produce at least an initial agreement by the deadline. The 35% chance of a 'No' outcome accounts for the very real possibility that the contradictory imposition of new U.S. sanctions could still scuttle the talks or that the gap on core issues proves too wide to bridge in time.",
