    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "~41 days (until Metaculus checks on/after July 1, 2025)",
    "status_quo_outcome": "Yes",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "NUFORC posts June 2025 reports but none are tagged with the shape “Cube” (reports skew to Lights/Spheres/Triangles; a few boxy objects are labeled Rectangle/Box/Unknown instead), or there’s a posting lag such that by July 1 no June entries with “Cube” are live.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "At least one June 2025 NUFORC entry lists the shape as “Cube” on the June index page by July 1, 2025.",
    "rationale": "Mechanics: The question resolves Yes if the NUFORC June 2025 listings include at least one event with the shape explicitly labeled “Cube” when checked on or after July 1. NUFORC routinely tags sightings by shape and “Cube” exists in their taxonomy (e.g., December 2024 reportedly had six such entries), so the category is in active use. \n\nBase rate and seasonality: Summer months tend to see elevated sighting volumes due to more outdoor activity and longer evenings. Higher total reports modestly increase the chance of observing rarer shapes at least once in a month. While “Cube” is uncommon relative to Lights, Circles, Spheres, etc., the December 2024 example demonstrates that multiple cubes can occur in a single month, so a “Cube” in any given month is plausible rather than extraordinary. My mental base-rate model treats cube counts as a low-rate process with month-to-month variance; summer should push the rate up somewhat, making a Yes more likely than in winter/shoulder months.\n\nCountervailing risks: Cube is a specific descriptor and may be under-selected relative to similar categories (Rectangle, Box, Unknown). That taxonomy/labeling uncertainty plus randomness could easily yield zero cubes for a given month. Another risk is posting lag: if NUFORC is behind on June entries by July 1, the check might miss later-added cube reports.\n\nResearch assistant note: The hypothesis that some UAPs (especially in the Southwest) could be drones used by cartels might marginally increase the frequency of boxy or cage-like forms that witnesses could label “cube.” This is weak evidence but nudges probability upward slightly by providing a plausible mechanism for more cube-like sightings.\n\nWhy not higher: Cube remains a minority label; classification ambiguity and update lags could lead to zero visible cubes by the resolution check. Why not lower: NUFORC actively uses the “Cube” category; overall sighting volume is typically higher in June; recent history shows months with multiple cubes, so at least one in June is far from rare.\n\nWhat would move me up: Early-in-month June postings already showing one or more “Cube” entries; visible spikes in June sighting volume; media/social chatter specifically about cube-shaped UAPs. What would move me down: NUFORC slowing or pausing June postings into early July; evidence that shape taxonomy changed or recent months show a string of zero-cube months.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill the National UFO Reporting Center report a sighting of a cube-shaped UFO in June 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nAccording to the [National UFO Reporting Center](https://nuforc.org/about-us/): \"The National UFO Reporting Center was founded in 1974 by noted UFO investigator Robert J. Gribble. The Center’s primary function over the past five decades has been to receive, record, and to the greatest degree possible, corroborate and document reports from individuals who have been witness to unusual, possibly UFO-related events. Throughout its history, the Center has processed over 180,000 reports, and has distributed its information to thousands of individuals.\"\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if The National UFO Reporting Center posts a report of a sighting of a UFO/UAP shaped like a cube in June 2025 at [this link](https://nuforc.org/ndx/?id=event) when accessed by Metaculus on or after July 1, 2025.\n\nFor example, although rare in the history of NUFORC, the month of December 2024 [had](https://nuforc.org/subndx/?id=e202412) six sightings with a cube shape.\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nSome U.S. officials speculate that a portion of the UAP sightings, especially in the Southwest, could be attributable to advanced drone technology used by drug cartels for espionage or smuggling. Ron Vitiello, an advisor to U.S. Customs and Border Protection, noted that the 'unlimited funding' of cartels could enable them to deploy technologies previously unseen in the drone sector. This theory has been presented as a potential explanation for some of the unidentified objects observed in restricted military airspace.\n\nToday is 2025-05-21.\n\nBefore answering you think:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n(e) You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
