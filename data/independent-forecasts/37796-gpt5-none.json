    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "About 4–6 weeks (FATF Plenary typically occurs in late June; today is 2025-05-19)",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No changes to the FATF grey list after the June 2025 plenary",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "FATF’s June 2025 communiqué states that all jurisdictions remain under increased monitoring without additions or removals, with potential decisions deferred to the October plenary due to pending on-site visits or incomplete action plans.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "At least one jurisdiction is removed for completing its action plan (e.g., a country that has recently advanced reforms and hosted a successful on-site visit), or at least one new jurisdiction is added based on recent evaluations or emerging strategic deficiencies, and the official FATF list is updated accordingly.",
    "rationale": "Base rate: In recent years, the FATF has made changes to the grey list at the vast majority of plenaries (February, June, October), with at least one addition or removal being common. February 2025 already saw changes (Philippines removed; Laos and Nepal added, per AML Intelligence), and historically June plenaries also tend to include updates.\nPipeline considerations: The current list is lengthy, and several jurisdictions publicly aim to exit in 2025 after intensive remediation. Governments often signal nearing completion ahead of a plenary, with FATF on-site visits as a key precursor to removal. Conversely, new additions can arise from recent mutual evaluations or follow-up assessments by FATF-style regional bodies. Given this pipeline dynamic, the chance that literally no jurisdiction moves in June is meaningfully lower than the chance that at least one does.\nWhy not higher: There is a non-trivial risk that removals slip to October because of scheduling of on-site visits, last-mile legislative steps, or FATF preferring to bunch announcements. Similarly, potential additions can be delayed if jurisdictions present credible remediation plans. A zero-change outcome, while not the norm, is possible.\nWhy not lower: The base rate of change at plenaries is high, and the breadth of jurisdictions under monitoring increases the odds that at least one is ready to exit or that one new case is added. February 2025 changes demonstrate ongoing dynamism rather than a freeze.\nWhat would shift me upward: Credible pre-plenary reporting or official statements that specific jurisdictions have completed action plans and hosted successful on-site visits; finance ministry or central bank communiqués signaling expected delisting; FATF agenda notes hinting at list updates.\nWhat would shift me downward: Reports that key candidate jurisdictions need more time or that on-site visits will occur after June; indications from FATF or regional bodies that decisions are deferred to October.\nResearch assistant summary: No additional new information beyond the cited AML Intelligence update, which confirms February 2025 changes and supports the base-rate view that the list is actively updated.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill any jurisdictions be added to or removed from the FATF \"grey list\" following the FATF Plenary meeting in June 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nAML Intelligence (February 2025) [UPDATE: Philippines removed from FATF ‘grey list’ as Laos, Nepal added to watchlist](https://www.amlintelligence.com/2025/02/breaking-fatf-grey-list-update-laos-and-nepal-added-the-philippines-removed/)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if following its June 2025 plenary, the Financial Action Task Force (FATF) has made any changes to its \"Jurisdictions under Increased Monitoring\" list, which at the time of this question consists of Algeria, Angola, Bulgaria, Burkina Faso, Cameroon, Côte d'Ivoire, Croatia, the Democratic Republic of Congo, Haiti, Kenya, the Lao People's Democratic Republic, Lebanon, Mali, Monaco, Mozambique, Namibia, Nepal, Nigeria, South Africa, South Sudan, Syria, Tanzania, Venezuela, Vietnam, and Yemen. Resolves according to the [official list](https://www.fatf-gafi.org/en/countries/black-and-grey-lists.html).\n\nThe question may resolve according to [credible sources](https://www.metaculus.com/help/faq/#definitions) in case the website is unavailable or not timely updated.\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nNo additional information available.\n\nToday is 2025-05-19.\n\nBefore answering you think:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n(e) You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
