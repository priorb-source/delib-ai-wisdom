  "information": "Joe Pyfer has won six of his last seven professional fights, holding a 4-1 record within the UFC. His most recent victory was a first-round knockout of Marc-Andre Barriault at UFC 303, which earned him a Performance of the Night bonus. Pyfer had to withdraw from the originally scheduled fight against Gastelum in Mexico due to an illness.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "UFC 316 likely occurs within the next 1-3 months from the current date of May 26, 2025. UFC events are numbered sequentially and occur regularly, so the exact date should be publicly announced soon if not already.",
    "status_quo_outcome": "The fight between Joe Pyfer and Kelvin Gastelum has been rebooked for UFC 316 after Pyfer's withdrawal from the Mexico card. The status quo is that this fight is currently scheduled to take place.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Pyfer withdraws again due to recurring illness or injury, the fight is cancelled for other reasons (opponent withdrawal, card changes), Pyfer makes it to the event but loses the fight to Gastelum, or the fight ends in a no contest or draw.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Pyfer successfully makes it to the event, the fight proceeds as scheduled, and he defeats Kelvin Gastelum via knockout, submission, or decision, continuing his strong recent UFC performance.",
    "rationale": "Several factors influence this forecast. On the positive side, Pyfer has strong momentum with 6 wins in his last 7 fights and a 4-1 UFC record, including a recent Performance of the Night first-round knockout. The fight has been rebooked, indicating both fighters and the UFC are committed to making it happen. However, significant uncertainties exist. Pyfer already withdrew once due to illness, which raises concerns about his reliability for this event - fighters who withdraw once sometimes have recurring issues. In MMA, approximately 15-20% of scheduled fights don't materialize due to injuries, weight cut failures, or other issues. Even if the fight occurs, Pyfer faces Kelvin Gastelum, a veteran middleweight who has fought top competition. While Pyfer's recent form is strong, no fighter has a guaranteed victory. Estimating the fight happens at ~75% probability and Pyfer wins if it happens at ~60% probability yields ~45% combined. The forecast isn't higher because of the withdrawal history and uncertainty factors. It isn't lower because Pyfer has demonstrated clear skill and the fight is actively scheduled. I would revise upward with confirmation of successful weigh-ins and strong pre-fight indicators, or downward with any news of health concerns or late opponent changes.",
