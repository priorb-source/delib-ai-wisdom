    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Approximately 10 days. The 2025 Cornwall Council election is scheduled for May 1, 2025, with results expected to be known within 24-48 hours of voting.",
    "status_quo_outcome": "Liberal Democrats winning the most seats. In the 2021 Cornwall Council election, the Liberal Democrats became the largest party with approximately 37 seats out of 87, ahead of the Conservatives (around 32 seats) and Independents, though no party achieved overall control.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "The Conservative Party stages a recovery and wins more seats than the Liberal Democrats, potentially capitalizing on any local issues or voter fatigue with Liberal Democrat administration. Alternatively, a surge in Independent candidates could result in them collectively holding more seats than any single party, though the question specifically asks about party seats.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "The Liberal Democrats maintain or expand their position as the largest party on the council, benefiting from their strong local campaigning infrastructure in Cornwall, continued Conservative weakness nationally, effective local governance record since 2021, and their traditional strength in Southwest England constituencies.",
    "rationale": "The status quo strongly favors a Yes outcome. The Liberal Democrats were already the largest party after the 2021 election, and local government compositions typically show significant persistence election-to-election. Cornwall has been trending Liberal Democrat in recent electoral cycles, with the party holding multiple Westminster constituencies in the region. Without specific polling data or research assistant information about recent developments, I must rely on historical patterns and the principle that the status quo is the most likely outcome in the absence of clear evidence to the contrary. The forecast is not higher (toward certainty) because: (1) we're still 10 days out and late campaign dynamics could shift results, (2) Independents remain strong in Cornwall and could potentially outperform party candidates, (3) local issues specific to Cornwall could create unexpected swings, and (4) the lack of current polling data introduces uncertainty. The forecast is not lower because: (1) incumbency advantage typically helps the largest party, (2) the Liberal Democrats have strong local organization in Cornwall, (3) no evidence suggests a major shift in voter sentiment, and (4) historical precedent suggests continuity. I would update my forecast higher if polling showed a clear Liberal Democrat lead or evidence of strong ground operations emerged. I would update lower if there were indications of Conservative recovery, strong Independent performance, or local scandals affecting the Liberal Democrats.",
