    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Likely about 4–6 months (UFC 316 is expected in late summer/early fall 2025); outcome will be known on the event date.",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "UFC 316 is held outside the continental U.S. (e.g., Abu Dhabi, UK, Australia) or at a domestic site where logistics/security or competing presidential commitments make attendance impractical, so he does not appear at the venue.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "UFC 316 is scheduled in a Trump-friendly U.S. location (e.g., Las Vegas, Miami, New York/New Jersey). Dana White invites him, and he makes a brief appearance (backstage or cageside) that satisfies “anywhere within the grounds” of the venue.",
    "rationale": "Baseline: For any single UFC PPV, the default is that Trump does not attend; historically he attends a small minority of numbered events each year. As President, security and scheduling constraints lower attendance odds for any given event, but he has already shown willingness to appear at UFC as a sitting president (the cited April 13, 2025 Miami event), and he has a longstanding relationship with UFC/Dana White, which keeps the probability meaningfully above a token level. Key uncertainty is the location of UFC 316. If it’s domestic in a friendly market (especially Las Vegas or Florida), the chance rises materially; if it’s overseas, it becomes near-zero. Without confirmed location/date and with months to go, the status quo for a specific future PPV remains “No,” but with a notable upside tail given his pattern and incentives for visible, base-energizing appearances. Why not higher: The per-event base rate is low—he doesn’t attend most PPVs—and we lack location/date confirmation. Presidential scheduling and security frictions further reduce odds. Why not lower: He frequently partners with UFC for public appearances, already did so in 2025 as President, and these events are useful politically; a brief drop-in would satisfy the resolution criteria. Update triggers: Up if UFC 316 is announced for Las Vegas/Miami/NYC or credible reports indicate he plans to attend; strong up if Dana White/WH schedule signals confirm (+ to 50–80%). Down if UFC 316 is overseas or if a conflicting state visit/crisis emerges (down to <5%). Research assistant provided no additional information, so this forecast relies on base rates, known patterns of Trump/UFC ties, and the April 2025 attendance precedent.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill Donald Trump attend UFC 316?\n\nQuestion background:\nNew York Times: [Trump and Some of His Cabinet Members Attend U.F.C. Fight in Miami](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/13/us/politics/trump-ufc-fight-reyes.html)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if President Donald Trump is anywhere within the grounds of the venue where [UFC 316](https://www.ufc.com/event/ufc-316) takes place. Otherwise this resolves as **No**.\n\n\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nNo additional information available.\n\nToday is 2025-04-30.\n\nBefore answering you think:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n(e) You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
