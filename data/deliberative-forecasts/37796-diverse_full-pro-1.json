    "review": "The other two forecasters provide excellent, grounded analyses that have prompted me to adjust my initial forecast. We all agree on the overwhelmingly strong historical base rate (~94% of plenaries since 2018 have resulted in changes) and identify the same primary candidates: Mozambique for removal and the British Virgin Islands (BVI) for addition. Their key contribution, which I find highly persuasive, is a more nuanced and skeptical assessment of the other potential candidates. They correctly point out that South Africa's official target for removal is October 2025, not June, and that Nigeria's stated goal for a May exit is ambitious and requires clearing several procedural hurdles, including a successful on-site visit, in a very short time. My initial analysis had lumped these countries in as plausible paths to a 'Yes' resolution, whereas their reasoning rightly downgrades them to 'unlikely' for the June plenary. This Narrows the highly probable paths to resolution to just Mozambique and BVI. I also find their argument about specific procedural risks—such as reports needing to be processed in time or contentious decisions being deferred—to be a more concrete articulation of the general 'unforeseen circumstances' I had accounted for. This increased focus on the specific ways in which even strong individual cases can be delayed has convinced me to temper my initial optimism.",
    "rationale": "My forecast is anchored by the strong historical base rate, with 16 of the last 17 plenaries resulting in a change to the grey list. This establishes a baseline probability of over 90%. Furthermore, there are at least two highly credible, independent paths to a 'Yes' resolution in June 2025. First, Mozambique has reportedly completed its action plan and underwent a successful on-site visit in April 2025, the final step before removal. Second, the British Virgin Islands is a strong candidate for addition after its grace period for remediation expired in February 2025 following a poor evaluation, with the UK indicating it will not block a listing. \n\nHowever, I am lowering my forecast from 95% to 89%. The reasoning provided by the other forecasters has convinced me that I initially overestimated the number of plausible routes to a 'Yes' outcome. As they correctly noted, South Africa and Nigeria are unlikely to have their status changed at the June plenary due to official timelines and practical constraints. This focuses the outcome almost exclusively on Mozambique and BVI. While both cases are strong, relying on a narrower set of events makes the forecast more vulnerable to failure. A single procedural delay or political decision to defer could affect one of these cases. A plenary session that becomes focused on policy debate could theoretically postpone country-level decisions, affecting both. My updated forecast of 89% continues to reflect a very high probability of change but incorporates a greater degree of uncertainty, acknowledging that with fewer active pathways, the chance of a 'No' outcome—whereby both the Mozambique and BVI cases are simultaneously delayed—is slightly higher than I first assessed.",
