    "review": "I have reviewed the analyses from two other forecasters. We all agree on the core constraints: a very short timeframe until the July 1, 2025 deadline, with only one scheduled FOMC meeting in June. We also concur that the Federal Reserve has set a high bar for a rate cut, requiring a significant shift in incoming data. The main point of divergence is the probability assigned to such a shift occurring in time. Forecaster 2's estimate of 30% seems too high, as it appears to underestimate the Fed's stated caution and preference for seeing a sustained trend before acting. Forecaster 3's analysis at 18% is more persuasive. I found their specific point about the June meeting including a new Summary of Economic Projections (SEP) particularly insightful. This is a mechanism for the Fed to reframe its outlook and justify a policy pivot based on a shorter data series, a point I had not explicitly weighed in my initial forecast.",
    "rationale": "My initial forecast of 10% was based on the belief that only a significant economic or financial shock—a low-probability event—would compel the Fed to cut rates within this brief window. The status quo of a resilient economy and sticky inflation strongly supports a continued hold. However, after considering the other forecasts, particularly Forecaster 3's, I am updating my view. While I still believe a shock is the most straightforward path to a 'Yes' outcome, I was likely underweighting the possibility of a non-shock, but data-driven, cut. The Fed will receive two CPI reports and one more jobs report before the mid-June meeting. Forecaster 3's point that the accompanying SEP could provide the necessary 'cover' for the committee to act on a short but sharp run of weak data is compelling. This slightly widens the path to a cut beyond just a crisis scenario. Therefore, I am increasing my forecast to reflect this added possibility. I am moving my forecast up by 5 percentage points, from 10% to 15%. I am not moving higher because I still believe the Fed's inertia and high evidentiary bar are substantial hurdles, and one or two months of data may still be insufficient to prompt a cut absent a more severe downturn.",
