  "information": "A key topic of discussion related to the G7 summit is the potential for new sanctions against Russia. US Senators Lindsey Graham and Richard Blumenthal have advocated for a new package of sanctions to be coordinated with European allies before the summit. However, according to news reports citing EU diplomats, it is unlikely that the European Union will have a new sanctions package ready by mid-June. President Zelenskyy has publicly called for increased pressure on Russia and for joint sanctions to be agreed upon at the G7 level.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Approximately 1-2 weeks. The G7 Summit in Kananaskis is scheduled for mid-June 2025, and today is June 3, 2025.",
    "status_quo_outcome": "Yes, Zelenskyy attends in person",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "A sudden deterioration in the military situation in Ukraine requires Zelenskyy's immediate presence in Kyiv, or security concerns make physical travel too risky, forcing him to participate virtually or cancel his attendance entirely.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Zelenskyy accepts the formal invitation from PM Carney, travels to Kananaskis with appropriate security arrangements, and attends the summit in person to advocate for continued support for Ukraine and discuss sanctions against Russia with G7 leaders.",
    "rationale": "The status quo strongly favors attendance. Key evidence: (1) A formal invitation has been extended by the Canadian Prime Minister, (2) Zelenskyy has established a pattern of attending major international summits in person when possible since the war began, (3) The G7 represents Ukraine's most critical allies and the meeting offers vital opportunities to secure continued military and financial support, (4) The research assistant notes sanctions discussions are on the agenda - a key priority for Ukraine. The timing (mid-June in Kananaskis, Canada) provides a secure Western location. However, I'm not forecasting higher because: the war creates inherent unpredictability, there's only 1-2 weeks for circumstances to change, past instances exist where he's had to cancel international travel due to urgent developments, and his physical safety during travel remains a concern. I'm not lower because: the invitation is already issued, the pattern of attendance is well-established, the strategic importance of the meeting is extremely high, and there are no current reports suggesting he won't attend. To update higher, I'd need confirmation of travel plans or his actual departure. To update lower, I'd need reports of military escalation requiring his presence in Ukraine or explicit indication he'll attend virtually.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill Volodymyr Zelenskyy attend the G7 Summit in June 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nCalgary Herald: [Prime Minister Carney invites Ukrainian President Zelenskyy to G7 summit in Kananaskis](https://calgaryherald.com/news/local-news/pm-mark-carney-invites-ukrainian-president-volodymyr-zelenskyy-g7-summit-kananaskis)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if Ukrainian President Volodymyr Oleksandrovych Zelenskyy attends in person a G7 summit held in June 2025.\n\n\"In person\" is defined as occupying the same physical space closely enough at the G7 Summit that he can see and hear other heads of state through direct un-intermediated exchange of photons and sound waves.\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nA key topic of discussion related to the G7 summit is the potential for new sanctions against Russia.

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any).

Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
