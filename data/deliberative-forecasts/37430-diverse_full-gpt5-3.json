    "review": "Both forecasters largely mirror my base view: strong executive/industry momentum offset by process risk and slippage. Forecaster 2 emphasizes the political incentive created by the July 1 implementation target and House passage; that’s convincing and aligns with my priors. Forecaster 3 presses harder on status quo inertia, the missed Q1 target, and Nigeria’s procedural unpredictability; I find that caution warranted. Neither introduced new concrete facts (e.g., Senate scheduling or text changes), but F3’s focus on compressed timeline with two remaining steps (Senate + assent) usefully sharpens the process risk. I also note an operational risk both didn’t emphasize: possible harmonization if the Senate amends, plus a likely Eid al‑Adha break in June that compresses the window further.",
    "rationale": "I previously put this at 58% on the basis of: House passage achieved, explicit executive priority, and a stated July 1 go‑live that creates strong pressure to enact beforehand; balanced against missed Q1 timing, labor opposition to other elements of the omnibus, and typical legislative slippage. After considering the other analyses, I still think the VAT exemption itself is non‑contentious and likely to survive. The main risk is process timing on an omnibus bill facing union pushback on unrelated provisions, which could force Senate amendments and harmonization, risking a late‑June crunch. A narrow, standalone VAT amendment could rescue timing if the omnibus stalls, but I’ve seen no signal yet that leadership will pursue that path. Net: I modestly shade down on calendar compression and harmonization risk while keeping the base case that prioritization can still deliver by end‑June. I’d move up on signs of Senate fast‑tracking (second/third readings scheduled in May, minimal committee changes) or reports of transmission to the President; I’d move down on indications of significant Senate rewrites, talk of deferring implementation beyond July 1, or prolonged recess/holidays affecting June sittings.",
