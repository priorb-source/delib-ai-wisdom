    "review": "The three analyses reveal a key mathematical insight that I should have emphasized more clearly. Forecaster 2 correctly notes that if 2,382,000 shares represented approximately 6.7% of Domino's outstanding shares, reaching 7% necessarily requires additional purchases - the 115,000 share buyback alone wouldn't bridge that gap. Let me verify: if 2,382,000 shares = 6.7%, then total shares ≈ 35.5 million. After the 115,000 buyback, Berkshire's percentage would only increase to about 6.72%. To reach 7%, Berkshire would need approximately 2,480,000 shares - roughly 98,000 more than the Q4 2024 position. This mathematical clarity strengthens the case that the 7% news reports reflect actual Q1 purchases.\n\nForecaster 3 raises valid concerns about Berkshire's overall net selling posture and status quo bias, but I think this underweights the specific, timely evidence about Domino's. The fact that Berkshire made selective purchases in Q1 (Verisign, Sirius XM, Occidental) shows they weren't completely abstaining from buying, and Domino's could easily have been among these selective additions.\n\nForecaster 2's 95% confidence seems slightly high given that press reports, while credible, aren't definitive until the actual 13F filing appears. There's also a small possibility the reports conflate Q1 and April activity, or represent slight misinterpretations of statements made at the annual meeting.",
    "rationale": "Upon reflection, the mathematical analysis is more decisive than I initially weighted. The 7% figure reported by multiple news outlets in early May cannot be explained by share buybacks alone - it requires Berkshire to have purchased approximately 98,000 additional shares beyond the Q4 2024 position. This transforms the question from 'did they likely buy more?' to 'are the news reports accurate?'\n\nThe timing is particularly compelling: these reports emerged immediately after Berkshire's annual meeting and just before the Q1 13F filing deadline. If the reports were simply referring to the already-disclosed Q4 2024 position, why would this be newsworthy in early May? The specificity of '7%' combined with language about an 'increased stake' strongly suggests the information reflects Q1 2025 activity.\n\nWhile Berkshire was a net seller overall in Q1 2025, they demonstrably made selective purchases during this period. Domino's fits Berkshire's investment criteria, and the Q3-Q4 2024 accumulation pattern supports continued building in Q1.\n\nThe main remaining uncertainties are: (1) the possibility of inaccurate press reports, (2) potential confusion between Q1 and early Q2 activity, and (3) until the actual 13F is filed, we cannot be 100% certain. However, these uncertainties are relatively small compared to the strong directional evidence.\n\nI'm updating my forecast upward from 72% to 82%, giving substantial weight to the mathematical necessity of additional purchases to reach 7%, while maintaining appropriate skepticism until the official filing confirms this.",
