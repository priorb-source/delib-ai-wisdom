    "no_outcome_scenario": "Communications remain at staff/ministerial level or occur in-person instead; any leader call is either not held or only one side publicizes it, failing the mutual-acknowledgement criterion.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "A battlefield or diplomatic inflection point prompts outreach (e.g., peace-talks trial balloon, pre-summit coordination, crisis response), resulting in an official readout or posts from both the White House/Trump team and Zelenskyy’s office confirming a call.",
    "rationale": "- Baseline: Leader-to-leader calls between the US President and Zelenskyy have been episodic—often clustered around crises, funding decisions, or summits. Over a short 33-day window, absent a catalyst, the default is no call. \n- Relationship/current incentives: Under Trump, incentives to keep distance from publicized Ukraine engagements are higher than under Biden, which lowers the base rate for a public, mutually acknowledged call. Zelenskyy has strong incentives to engage and typically publicizes calls, but the criterion requires both sides to acknowledge it. Trump-world communications can be irregular or strategically silent, introducing failure modes even if a call occurs. \n- Triggers that could make a call likelier: (1) a significant front-line development or strike necessitating coordination; (2) an upcoming multilateral moment or peace-initiative push where Zelenskyy seeks US participation; (3) US policy moves on aid or sanctions that require leader-level messaging. Any of these could push probability up quickly. \n- Why not higher: Short window; no known scheduled event requiring a leader call; mutual-acknowledgement requirement; possibility of preferring in-person contact or backchannel staff talks. \n- Why not lower: The US-Ukraine file remains high-salience; Zelenskyy persistently seeks top-cover from Washington; if Trump pursues or signals a negotiation framework, a call would be a natural instrument and both sides might want to publicize it for leverage. \n- What would move me up: Credible reports of planned outreach, public hints from either side about imminent talks, scheduling around a summit/initiative involving Ukraine, or fresh battlefield shocks. \n- What would move me down: Public deterioration in relations (e.g., sharp rhetoric), announcement of an in-person meeting within the window (substituting for a call), or signals that communications are being routed strictly through aides with no leader readouts.\n- Research assistant input: No additional information available; thus the estimate leans on base rates, incentives, and the short time window, placing extra weight on the status quo of no new, mutually acknowledged call in any given month.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill Donald Trump and Volodymyr Zelenskyy speak on the phone with each other before June 15, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nSky News: [Key moments that have shaped Trump and Zelenskyy's relationship](https://news.sky.com/story/trump-and-zelenskyys-relationship-from-perfect-phone-call-to-oval-office-clash-13331892)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if, after May 12, 2025 and before June 15, 2025, Donald Trump and Volodymyr Zelenskyy speak on the phone with each other, according to [credible sources](https://www.metaculus.com/faq/#definitions).\n\nBoth sides must acknowledge the phone call took place for it to count. \"Speak on the phone with each other\" is defined as both individuals, from different physical spaces, orally uttering words intended for the other individual into a telephone or equivalent device, those words being converted into electrical or digital signals in real time, and then transferred to the other individual via telecommunications links, where they are reconverted into sound waves at the other individual's listening device.\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nNo additional information available.\n\nToday is 2025-05-13.\n\nBefore answering you think:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n(e) You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
