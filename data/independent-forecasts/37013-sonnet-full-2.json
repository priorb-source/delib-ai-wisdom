  "information": "The composition of the Cornwall Council prior to the 2025 election consisted of 44 seats for the Conservatives, 13 for the Liberal Democrats, 4 for Labour, 1 for Reform UK, and 1 for the Greens, with the remainder held by others or independents. This represents a 31-seat lead for the Conservatives over the Liberal Democrats. Historically, the Liberal Democrats have never been the largest party on the Cornwall Council.\n\nNational polling data shows the Conservative party with a 22% approval rating, while Reform UK is polling at 25% and the Liberal Democrats at approximately 14-16%. In the 2024 UK general election, the Liberal Democrats regained the constituencies of North Cornwall and St Ives. Political analyst Professor John Curtice has noted that the surge in support for Reform UK is likely to split the right-wing vote, which could indirectly benefit the Liberal Democrats.\n\nFor the 2025 election, the Liberal Democrat party has launched a significant fundraising effort, including a £100,000 fund, and is fielding a near-full slate of candidates. An Electoral Calculus MRP poll has been cited in analyses of the election. On the Conservative side, several high-profile councillors announced their retirement, including the council leader Linda Taylor.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Approximately 2 weeks. Cornwall Council elections typically occur on the first Thursday in May, which would be May 1, 2025.",
    "status_quo_outcome": "The Conservative Party maintains the most seats on Cornwall Council. They currently hold 44 seats compared to the Liberal Democrats' 13 seats, a 31-seat advantage.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "The Conservative Party retains the most seats despite losses, as their votes fragment to Reform UK, independents, and other parties rather than consolidating with Liberal Democrats. Alternatively, independents or Reform UK emerge as the largest bloc while Lib Dems remain in second or third place.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "A massive anti-Conservative swing occurs with tactical voting consolidating behind the Liberal Democrats as the primary opposition party. The Reform UK surge splits the Conservative vote sufficiently in key wards, while the Liberal Democrats' strong organization and funding translate into seat gains across the council. The retirement of key Conservative figures including leader Linda Taylor creates a leadership vacuum that accelerates their collapse.",
    "rationale": "The status quo strongly favors a No outcome. The Liberal Democrats face an unprecedented 31-seat deficit and have never been the largest party on Cornwall Council historically. To win the most seats, they would need to approximately triple their representation from 13 to 45+ seats while Conservatives collapse from 44 seats - an extraordinary swing unprecedented in Cornwall Council history.\n\nSeveral factors create some possibility for upset: Conservative national approval is dismal at 22%, Reform UK polling at 25% nationally could split the right-wing vote, key Conservative councillors including the leader are retiring, and Liberal Democrats showed renewed strength winning North Cornwall and St Ives in the 2024 general election. The Lib Dems' significant fundraising (£100k fund) and near-full candidate slate demonstrate serious organizing effort.\n\nHowever, critical constraints limit this probability: Liberal Democrats' national polling remains modest at 14-16%, not indicative of a major breakthrough. In local elections, votes dissipate to independents and smaller parties rather than consolidating behind one opposition party. Reform UK historically performs worse in local versus national elections. The sheer scale of the required swing - gaining 32+ seats while Conservatives lose correspondingly - has no historical precedent in Cornwall.\n\nMy forecast is not higher because the historical precedent is overwhelming and the mathematical requirement (tripling Lib Dem seats) is extreme. It's not lower because the unusual political volatility, Conservative organizational weakness, and Reform UK's potential spoiler effect create a non-trivial possibility of unprecedented change. I would revise upward with polls showing Lib Dems specifically surging in Cornwall or evidence of massive Conservative-to-Lib Dem switching in key wards. I would revise downward if polling showed Conservative resilience or Reform UK gaining traction directly from potential Lib Dem voters.",
