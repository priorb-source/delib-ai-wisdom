    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Approximately 60 days (until July 1, 2025)",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No - assuming no major protest-triggering events occur in the next two months that mobilize 10,000+ participants in a tracked protest",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "The remaining two months pass without a major catalyzing event (Supreme Court decision, significant policy announcement, controversial incident, or international crisis) that mobilizes 10,000+ people to a single protest location, or protests occur but fall below the 10,000 threshold or are not captured by the Global Protest Tracker's methodology",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "A significant political, legal, or social event triggers mass mobilization - such as a major Supreme Court ruling (abortion, civil rights), controversial policy implementation (immigration, climate, healthcare), an international conflict decision, or a high-profile social justice incident. Cities like Washington DC, New York, Los Angeles, or Chicago host a coordinated protest that draws 10,000+ participants and is documented by the Carnegie Endowment's Global Protest Tracker",
    "rationale": "With 60 days remaining, this is a moderate timeframe for a large protest to materialize. The US has demonstrated capacity for rapid large-scale mobilization in recent years (Women's March 2017 had hundreds of thousands; George Floyd protests 2020 saw widespread participation exceeding 10,000 in multiple cities). The current political environment likely includes polarizing issues that could trigger protests. However, several factors moderate the probability: (1) We need the Global Protest Tracker specifically to report it - not all protests get captured in their database; (2) The 10,000 threshold is substantial, requiring either a major urban center or exceptional mobilization; (3) Large protests typically require a catalyzing event rather than occurring spontaneously; (4) While 2 months provides opportunity, it's not a long period. The base rate for 10,000+ protests is perhaps a few per year in the US, making one in any given 2-month period possible but not highly probable. My forecast is not higher because we lack a known imminent catalyzing event and require specific tracking criteria. It's not lower because the US political environment remains volatile, multiple potential trigger issues exist, and the timeframe is sufficient for mobilization. I would revise upward if a major controversial event is announced or occurs. I would revise downward as time passes without such triggers emerging.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill the Global Protest Tracker report any protests in the United States with 10,000+ participants, before July 1, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nBrookings Institution: [The power of protest in the US](https://www.brookings.edu/articles/the-power-of-protest-in-the-us/)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if the [Global Protest Tracker](https://carnegieendowment.org/features/global-protest-tracker?lang=en) reports a protest in the United States with 10,000 or more participants with a start date after the launch of this question and before July 1, 2025.\n\n\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nNo additional information available.\n\nToday is 2025-05-02.\n\nBefore answering you think:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n(e) You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
