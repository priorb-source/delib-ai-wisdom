    "review": "Both forecasters emphasize the dual‑veto problem (U.S. executive plus El Salvador) on a short timeline, which matches my baseline. Two useful additions: (1) the Supreme Court’s “facilitate” wording is weaker than a direct production order, giving the U.S. room to claim efforts while blaming Salvadoran noncooperation; (2) confirmation that a U.S. embassy/consulate abroad does not count as U.S. territory for resolution. They also underscore logistics/time costs once any deal is struck. Balancing factors they note—unanimous SCOTUS pressure, congressional attention, and U.S. leverage over El Salvador—were in my prior reasoning. I find their arguments largely persuasive and consistent with a low single‑digit to low‑teens probability. The “facilitate” nuance slightly lowers enforceability; the minimal resolution threshold and potential for a late face‑saving deal slightly raise it. Net effect: no material change from my prior estimate.",
    "rationale": "Time remaining (~61 days) plus two aligned blockers makes a return by July 1 unlikely. El Salvador’s public stance (terrorist label, max‑security detention, refusal to release) and the U.S. administration’s resistance (missed court deadline, signals of immediate re‑removal) create a high bar for rapid resolution. Courts can escalate against U.S. officials, but cannot compel El Salvador to release; the “facilitate” language weakens immediate judicial leverage. Diplomatic tools exist (aid/visa levers), but the current U.S. posture appears disinclined to use them on this timeline. While a last‑minute, face‑saving compliance or unilateral Salvadoran expulsion to the U.S. is conceivable—and any brief physical entry into U.S. territory would resolve Yes—the current trajectory and incentives point to continued detention in El Salvador and U.S. non‑production through July 1. Given colleagues’ points, I weigh the added enforceability downside (facilitate vs produce) against the minimal resolution threshold and keep my estimate essentially unchanged.",
