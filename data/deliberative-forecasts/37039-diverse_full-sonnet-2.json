    "review": "Both forecasters make compelling arguments that I initially underweighted. Forecaster 2's emphasis on the *purpose* of the 90-day suspension is particularly strong - the suspension mechanism is specifically designed to keep the underlying tariff structure in place while negotiations occur, avoiding the need for immediate changes. Forecaster 3 adds the crucial insight about procedural pressure: with the suspension window extending beyond June 1, there's no administrative reason to modify the HTS listing before the negotiation period concludes on July 9. Both forecasters also correctly emphasize that a NO outcome would require multiple steps: (1) reaching a deal, (2) issuing a formal proclamation, AND (3) actually updating the HTS - all within 38 days. This is a higher bar than I initially considered. Their forecasts of 88-90% reflect a more systematic appreciation of how the suspension mechanism functions. However, I note they may slightly underweight the volatility of this administration's tariff policy, which has shown capacity for rapid reversals. The Swiss have strong arguments (0% actual tariffs, 500,000 US jobs created), and political pressure could theoretically prompt expedited action. That said, their core reasoning about the suspension mechanism's design and lack of procedural pressure is convincing.",
    "rationale": "Upon reflection, I was too conservative at 80%. The other forecasters correctly emphasize that the 90-day suspension is structurally designed to keep the tariff listing in place while negotiations proceed - modifying the HTS mid-suspension would defeat its purpose. There's no procedural incentive for the administration to update the official schedule before July 9, even if informal negotiations progress. For a NO outcome, we'd need: (1) swift diplomatic resolution, (2) formal proclamation, and (3) HTS update - three sequential steps in 38 days during an active suspension period. This is less likely than I initially estimated. I'm updating upward to 86%, splitting the difference between my original forecast and the other two. This reflects increased confidence in bureaucratic inertia and the suspension mechanism's design, while maintaining some discount for policy volatility and the possibility of politically-motivated expedited action. The tariff is already listed, suspension status is explicitly irrelevant, and the negotiation window extends well beyond June 1.",
