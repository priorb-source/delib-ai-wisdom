    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "6 weeks (from May 20, 2025 to July 1, 2025)",
    "status_quo_outcome": "NO - The site remains offline",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "The climate.mil portal remains down through July 1, 2025. The Trump administration continues its policy of removing climate-related content from federal websites, and the military climate resilience portal stays offline indefinitely as part of this broader initiative. No administrative action is taken to restore the site despite any operational concerns from military personnel.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "The site comes back online before July 1, 2025. This could occur if military leadership successfully argues that climate resilience is a national security and operational readiness issue requiring immediate action, if there's congressional pressure on bipartisan grounds, if the content is modified and republished in a politically acceptable format, or if there's a partial policy reversal allowing military-specific climate preparedness information.",
    "rationale": "The status quo strongly favors the site remaining down. As of May 5, 2025, climate.mil has been offline, and The Guardian article indicates this is part of a systematic Trump administration effort to purge climate mentions from federal websites. This suggests a coordinated policy decision rather than a temporary technical issue. The site has now been down for at least 15 days with no reported restoration efforts. The baseline expectation should be continuation of this status, as the world changes slowly and policy reversals within 6 weeks are relatively uncommon. However, several factors prevent me from going lower than 25%: (1) Military climate resilience has legitimate national security framing that could override political considerations - military leaders may view operational preparedness as non-negotiable; (2) Six weeks provides meaningful time for administrative processes or policy adjustments; (3) Climate resilience for military installations is arguably more defensible politically than pure environmental policy; (4) Congressional pressure from defense-focused members could emerge. I'm not going higher because there's no evidence of restoration efforts, the political signals are very strong and consistent, and the systematic nature of these removals suggests deep commitment to the policy. For me to update significantly higher, I would need to see reports of active restoration work, military leadership publicly pushing back, or congressional action. To update lower, I would need confirmation of permanent decommissioning or explicit statements that the portal will not return.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill the US military's climate resiliance portal be back online on July 1, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nThe Guardian [Scientists brace ‘for the worst’ as Trump purges climate mentions from websites](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/feb/04/trump-climate-change-federal-websites)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if climate.mil is online according to [Is It Down Right Now?](https://www.isitdownrightnow.com/climate.mil.html) when accessed by Metaculus on or after July 1, 2025.\n\nAs of May 5, 2025, the resolution source returns the message, \"Climate.mil is DOWN for everyone.\"\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nNo additional information available.\n\nToday is 2025-05-20.\n\nBefore answering you think:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n(e) You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
