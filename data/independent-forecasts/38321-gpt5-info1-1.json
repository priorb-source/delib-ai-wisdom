  "information": "According to multiple news reports from early June 2025, the White House has officially confirmed that US President Donald Trump will attend the NATO summit in The Hague. White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt stated, 'I can confirm that Trump will attend the NATO summit.' This confirmation was also echoed by officials from allied nations. Dutch Prime Minister Dik Scoh announced Trump's intention to attend following a phone call between the two leaders. Similarly, Polish Foreign Minister Radoslaw Sikorski stated that Trump had reaffirmed his commitment to the alliance and would be present at the summit.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Approximately 2–4 weeks (mid-to-late June 2025)",
    "status_quo_outcome": "Yes — Trump attends in person as planned.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "A late cancellation or change of plans prevents travel (e.g., sudden domestic crisis, health issue, major security concern, or the summit is postponed out of June). He sends a senior representative instead or participates remotely, which does not meet the in-person criterion.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Trump flies to The Hague, appears at the leaders’ sessions and photo-ops, and engages other heads of state face-to-face during the June 2025 NATO Summit.",
    "rationale": "Multiple outlets report an on-record White House confirmation that President Trump will attend the NATO Summit in The Hague, echoed by allied officials. Historically, U.S. presidents almost always attend NATO summits, and once attendance is officially confirmed, reversals are rare. Trump attended NATO summits during his previous term despite tensions with the alliance, and skipping would impose significant diplomatic costs after a public commitment. Therefore, the status quo strongly favors attendance, and good forecasting practice gives that considerable weight. I am not at 100% because unanticipated disruptions can occur: acute health issues, urgent domestic crises (e.g., major national emergencies), security threats, or a last-minute political decision to forgo travel. A postponement of the summit out of June would also prevent a Yes under the question’s June-specific criterion. I would raise the probability further upon signs like final day-by-day schedule releases with pooled press logistics, departure wheels-up reports, or credible sighting of the U.S. advance team locking in the presidential movements and bilaterals. I would lower it if credible reports emerged of potential cancellation, a serious domestic emergency, health concerns, or indications the summit might be postponed/cancelled.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill Donald Trump attend the NATO Summit in June 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\n[The Netherlands to host 2025 NATO Summit in The Hague](https://www.nato.int/cps/en/natohq/news_225618.htm)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if US President Donald J. Trump attends in person a NATO summit held in June 2025.\n\n\"In person\" is defined as occupying the same physical space closely enough at the NATO Summit such that he can see and hear other heads of state through direct un-intermediated exchange of photons and sound waves.\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nAccording to multiple news reports from early June 2025, the White House has officially confirmed that US President Donald Trump will attend the NATO summit in The Hague.

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
