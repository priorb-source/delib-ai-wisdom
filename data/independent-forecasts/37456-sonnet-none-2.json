    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "55 days until July 1, 2025",
    "status_quo_outcome": "The recall remains Active",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "The recall investigation and verification process extends beyond July 1, 2025. This could occur if FSIS needs additional time to verify that all contaminated product has been removed from commerce, if Cargill's corrective actions take longer than expected to implement and validate, or if complications arise in tracing and recovering the affected liquid egg products from institutional and food service channels.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Cargill successfully implements corrective actions to prevent future contamination, all affected product is removed from commerce and verified by FSIS, and the regulatory review process is completed. The FSIS changes the recall status from Active to Closed on their website before July 1, 2025, indicating the issue has been fully resolved.",
    "rationale": "The recall was issued on March 28, 2025, approximately 40 days ago. With 55 days remaining until July 1, this provides a total window of about 95 days (roughly 3 months) from initial recall to the resolution deadline. USDA/FSIS recalls vary considerably in duration depending on the complexity of the issue, the responsiveness of the company, and the distribution scope. Some key factors to consider: (1) Liquid eggs are perishable with relatively short shelf lives, which may facilitate faster removal from commerce; (2) The contamination source (cleaning solution) appears identifiable with potentially straightforward corrective actions; (3) However, institutional and food service distribution channels can be complex to trace and verify; (4) The recall has already been active for 40 days without closure, suggesting the process isn't immediate. Without specific information about this recall's progress or typical FSIS closure timelines for similar cases, I'm applying a moderate probability that favors status quo (recall remaining active) based on general status quo bias - regulatory processes typically move slowly, and 95 days represents a relatively brisk timeline for complete recall closure including verification. My forecast would increase if evidence emerged that Cargill has completed corrective actions or that similar recalls typically close within 2-3 months. It would decrease if complications arise or if typical closure timelines significantly exceed 3 months.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill the USDA-posted recall by Cargill Kitchen Solutions of its liquid egg product for an unapproved substance issued March 28, 2025 be closed before July 1, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nABC News: [Liquid eggs recalled due to potential cleaning solution contamination](https://abcnews.go.com/GMA/Food/liquid-eggs-recalled-due-potential-cleaning-solution-contamination/story?id=120329600)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if the status of the recall posted by the U.S. Department of Agriculture’s Food Safety and Inspection Service (FSIS) is changed from Active to Closed on [this page](https://www.fsis.usda.gov/recalls-alerts/cargill-kitchen-solutions-recalls-liquid-egg-products-due-unapproved-substance) before July 1, 2025. If the recall is still shown as Active when the link is accessed by Metaculus on or after July 1, 2025, this question resolves as **No**.\n\n\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nNo additional information available.\n\nToday is 2025-05-07.\n\nBefore answering you think:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n(e) You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
