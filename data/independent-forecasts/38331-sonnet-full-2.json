  "information": "In May 2025, Pakistan restored access to X (formerly Twitter) after a 15-month ban that was first enforced in February 2024. Internet monitoring organization NetBlocks confirmed that access was restored, allowing citizens to use the platform without a VPN. In a separate development, X blocked access to 126 accounts in Turkey in February 2025 following a court order citing the need for 'protection of national security and public order.' The blocked accounts included those of journalists and activists. In April 2025, a court in Ankara issued further access block decisions for several popular Turkish news accounts on the platform.\n\nThe Indian government ordered X to block access to over 8,000 accounts in May 2025, citing a crackdown on 'anti-India content' and violations of local regulations. The blocked accounts included those of several Turkish and Chinese media organizations, as well as independent media outlets and journalists. X stated its disagreement with the orders, noting that 'blocking entire accounts is not only unnecessary, it amounts to censorship... and is contrary to the fundamental right of free speech,' but indicated it would comply while investigating legal options.\n\nIn early June 2025, the government of Tanzania blocked access to X. The country's information minister stated the ban was due to the platform hosting explicit sexual material, including pornographic and LGBTQ+ content, which he said was 'contrary to the East African state's laws, culture, customs, and traditions.' The move followed a recent change in X's policy to allow 'consensually produced and distributed' adult content. The Legal and Human Rights Centre (LHRC), a local rights group, described the action as part of a 'troubling pattern of digital repression' ahead of scheduled elections in October.",

    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Approximately 26 days until July 1, 2025",
    "status_quo_outcome": "YES - all seven countries (China, Iran, Myanmar, North Korea, Russia, Turkmenistan, and Venezuela) remain listed on Wikipedia as currently blocking X",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "At least one of the seven countries unblocks X and Wikipedia updates its article to reflect this change by July 1, 2025. This could occur if one of these countries suddenly lifts its ban, or if Wikipedia's article structure changes such that one or more countries are no longer listed as 'currently' blocking X.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "The status quo persists and all seven countries continue to block X as they have been doing, with Wikipedia maintaining its current categorization of these countries as blocking the platform. No country lifts its ban in the next 26 days.",
    "rationale": "The status quo strongly favors a YES resolution. With only 26 days remaining until resolution, there is very limited time for any significant policy changes. The seven countries in question - China, Iran, Myanmar, North Korea, Russia, Turkmenistan, and Venezuela - are all authoritarian regimes with long-standing social media restrictions. China has blocked Twitter since 2009, Iran since 2009, Russia since 2022, and the others have maintained similar long-term blocks. The research assistant's report provides no indication that any of these specific countries are considering lifting their bans. The report mentions Pakistan restoring access, but Pakistan is not among the seven countries in question. Other developments (Turkey's account blocks, India's takedown orders, Tanzania's new ban) involve different countries and don't affect the resolution criteria. The only risk factors are: (1) unexpected political developments leading to unblocking, (2) Wikipedia article reorganization or consensus issues, or (3) edit wars. However, given the extremely short timeframe and the stability of these regimes' censorship policies, these risks are minimal. The question requires ALL seven countries to remain blocked for YES - just one unblocking would result in NO - which adds some uncertainty, but not enough to significantly lower the probability given the 26-day window. My forecast is not higher (99%+) because Wikipedia-based resolutions always carry some structural uncertainty, and there's a non-trivial chance of unexpected political events. It's not lower because the time window is remarkably short for major policy reversals in authoritarian states with entrenched censorship regimes.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nAt the end of June 2025, will Wikipedia still list all these countries as \"currently\" blocking access to X (formerly Twitter)?\n\nQuestion background:\nAccording to the resolution source, \"Censorship of Twitter refers to Internet censorship by governments that block access to Twitter (officially known as X since July 2023). Twitter censorship also includes governmental notice and take down requests to Twitter, which it enforces in accordance with its Terms of Service when a government or authority submits a valid removal request to Twitter indicating that specific content published on the platform is illegal in their jurisdiction.\"\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if Wikipedia still lists X (formerly known as Twitter) as currently blocked in China, Iran, Myanmar, North Korea, Russia, Turkmenistan and Venezuela at [this link](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Censorship_of_Twitter#Current) when accessed by Metaculus on or after July 1, 2025. If the Wikipedia article does not list X as currently being blocked in any of those countries, this question resolves as **No**.\n\nThe question will resolve as soon as the page is accessed by Metaculus Admins on the resolution date. However, if there are issues accessing the page, then resolution will wait up to July 7, 2025, at which point if Metaculus has still not been able to access the resolution source, this question will be **annulled**. Admins will also use their discretion if there appears to be an [edit war](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Edit_warring) or lack of Wikipedia [consensus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Consensus) and may annul the question in such a case; however, Admins will also strive to resolve the question as definitively Yes or No, and such an edge case should be considered a rare outcome.\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nIn May 2025, Pakistan restored access to X (formerly Twitter) after a 15-month ban that was first enforced in February 2024.

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
