  "information": "In late 2024 and early 2025, Berkshire Hathaway was a net seller of stocks, increasing its cash position to $348 billion by May 2025. The company reduced its holdings in Apple by 50% and also sold shares in Bank of America and Citigroup. New positions were initiated in Constellation Brands, while existing stakes in Occidental Petroleum, SiriusXM Holdings, Pool Corp, and Verisign were increased. During the first quarter of 2025, Berkshire's purchases included additions to Verisign, Sirius XM, and Occidental Petroleum, as well as an estimated $2.7 billion investment in five Japanese trading houses.\n\nBerkshire Hathaway first purchased 1.27 million shares of Domino's Pizza in the third quarter of 2024. In the fourth quarter of 2024, it increased this stake to a total of 2,382,000 shares, with the investment's value growing from $549 million to $1 billion. Multiple news articles from early May 2025, published after Berkshire's annual meeting, reported that the company had further increased its stake in Domino's Pizza to 7%.\n\nFor its first fiscal quarter of 2025, Domino's Pizza reported a 0.5% decline in U.S. same-store sales and missed revenue forecasts, but it exceeded earnings per share expectations. During that same quarter, the company repurchased 115,000 of its own shares. The company's 'Hungry for More' strategy aims to open over 1,000 new stores annually until 2028 and achieve 7% annual sales growth. As part of this strategy, Domino's is set to begin a collaboration with DoorDash in 2025, following a previous partnership with Uber Eats in 2023.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "The 13F filing for the period ending March 31, 2025, is due within 45 days of the quarter's end, on or before May 15, 2025. As today is May 6, 2025, the outcome will be known in approximately 9 days.",
    "status_quo_outcome": "The status quo would be for Berkshire Hathaway to have maintained its end-of-Q4 2024 position of 2,382,000 shares through Q1 2025. This would mean no new purchases were made, and the question would resolve as 'No'.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "The Q1 2025 13F filing shows Berkshire Hathaway holding a position in Domino's Pizza of 2,382,000 shares or fewer. This would happen if Buffett and his team paused their buying after Q4 2024, perhaps viewing the stock as fully valued or prioritizing other investments, consistent with the firm's overall status as a net seller of equities during the quarter.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "The Q1 2025 13F filing reveals that Berkshire Hathaway holds more than 2,382,000 shares of Domino's Pizza. This would confirm that the company continued to build its position during the first three months of 2025, aligning with recent news reports.",
    "rationale": "My forecast is heavily influenced by the research assistant's report that multiple news outlets in early May 2025 stated Berkshire Hathaway had increased its stake in Domino's Pizza to 7%. Berkshire's Q4 2024 holding of 2,382,000 shares represented roughly 6.7% of Domino's shares outstanding at the time. An increase to a 7% stake necessarily implies an additional purchase of shares, which would cause this question to resolve as 'Yes'. This reporting, coming just after Berkshire's annual meeting, is highly likely to be based on information that will be reflected in the upcoming 13F filing. This specific, timely evidence outweighs the more general information that Berkshire was a net seller of stocks overall in Q1 2025. While the firm was increasing its cash pile, it was also selectively adding to certain positions (e.g., Occidental, SiriusXM), and it is very plausible that Domino's was one of them. Berkshire's typical pattern of building significant positions over several quarters also supports the likelihood of continued buying in Q1 after initiating in Q3 2024 and adding in Q4 2024. \n\nMy forecast is not higher than 95% because there is a small but non-zero chance the news reports were inaccurate or misinterpreted a statement from the company. Until the 13F is officially filed, we cannot be 100% certain. \n\nMy forecast is not lower because the specificity and timing of the news reports provide very strong evidence. To forecast a lower probability would be to unduly favor the general trend of Berkshire's net selling over direct information about this specific holding. \n\nI would update my forecast downward if the news outlets that reported the 7% stake issued a retraction. I would update it higher, toward 99%, if a Berkshire executive officially confirmed the purchase before the filing.",
