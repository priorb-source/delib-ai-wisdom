    "review": "The analysis from the other two forecasters strongly aligns with my own, showing a clear consensus on the key drivers of this forecast. We all identified the same three independent pathways to a 'Yes' resolution: the baseline turnover rate, the acute Huawei scandal, and potential appointments to national governments. I found two specific points raised by my peers particularly insightful. Forecaster 2's use of a Poisson distribution to estimate a ~65% probability from the baseline turnover alone provides a valuable quantitative anchor. Forecaster 3's observation that turnover is typically higher at the start of a new parliamentary term is a crucial piece of context that strengthens the baseline argument even further. Both points are convincing and suggest the baseline probability is perhaps even higher than I had initially weighted it.",
    "rationale": "After reviewing my peers' analyses, I am updating my forecast slightly upward. My initial reasoning remains the same: the convergence of a high baseline resignation rate, a major unfolding scandal creating acute pressure, and parallel opportunities for national appointments makes a resignation within the resolution window highly probable. The arguments from the other forecasters have convinced me that my initial forecast of 79% was slightly too conservative. The quantification of the baseline risk by Forecaster 2 (~65%) and the contextual factor of this being the start of a new, higher-turnover parliamentary term highlighted by Forecaster 3 both suggest the floor for this probability is very high. Adding the significant, time-sensitive pressures from the scandal and the Portuguese government formation on top of this strengthened baseline warrants a higher degree of confidence. Therefore, I am increasing my forecast by two percentage points to 81% to better reflect the combined weight of these factors.",
