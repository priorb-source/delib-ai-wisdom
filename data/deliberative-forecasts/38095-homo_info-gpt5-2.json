    "review": "- New points I hadn’t explicitly used: (1) Forecaster 2’s claim of a late-May spree with >2 dozen actions and OPA-tallies around ~25 in late May, reinforcing near-term operational capacity; (2) Forecaster 3’s historical note that Trump did no June clemencies in his first term and may time actions for July 4; (3) the specific possibility that only the two Whitmer-plot defendants are acted on, landing exactly at two (a miss for this market).\n- Persuasiveness: F2’s evidence of recent throughput and the Juneteenth hook is compelling and aligns with my prior. F3’s first-term seasonality is less convincing given the clear regime shift in 2025 (volume, staffed pipeline, early mass order). However, F3 raises two credible downside risks: bunching to July 4 and an \"exactly two\" scenario.\n- Net impact: I still see the status quo as continued activity with a very low threshold (>2), but I give a bit more weight to timing/bunching risk and the edge case of exactly two. That nudges my probability slightly down from my prior, not up.",
    "rationale": "Baseline: Since January 2025, the administration has shown both willingness and capacity to grant clemency at scale, capped by a fresh late-May burst. Infrastructure (new OPA leadership and a WH clemency czar) supports continuing flow. Given the tiny bar (>2) and political incentives (reward constituencies, sustain momentum), the default is Yes.\nKey risks that temper confidence:\n- Timing/batching: After a high-profile May run, they might pause or bunch next actions for symbolic dates (Juneteenth is a plausible June hook, but July 4 may be even more attractive). A deliberate June lull would push probability down.\n- \"Exactly two\" risk: If they focus on the two Whitmer-plot cases in June and hold others for July, the market resolves No. While Trump typically issues lists larger than two, this edge case is non-trivial.\n- Disclosure timing: The resolution requires public disclosure; if grants are signed late June but announced in July, they may not count at resolution time (depending on how trackers record date vs announcement), adding small downside risk.\nWhy still above 70: The near-term operational cadence and recent spree make a zero-or-one month unlikely. Even a modest Juneteenth-themed action or routine trickle would typically exceed two. The first-term June base-rate is less probative under a clear 2025 regime change.\nNet: Slight downshift from my prior to reflect bunching/\"exactly two\" risks, but still clearly above even.",
