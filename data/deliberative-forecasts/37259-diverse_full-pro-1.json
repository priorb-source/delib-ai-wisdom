    "review": "My two colleagues and I are in strong agreement on the primary factors that make a 'No' outcome highly probable: the ruling Demokraatit party's explicit gradualist platform, the extremely short two-month timeframe, Greenland's economic realities, and the precedence of past referendums. The core of our disagreement lies in the weight we assign to a low-probability 'Yes' scenario. Both of my fellow forecasters compellingly argued for a scenario I had underweighted: the government could announce a referendum date set far in the future. This would be a symbolic political act to appease the strengthened pro-independence opposition and high public sentiment, without contradicting the government's gradualist focus on near-term economic development. They correctly identified that the resolution question only requires the *announcement* of a date, not the referendum itself.",
    "rationale": "I am updating my forecast upwards based on my colleagues' analyses. My initial 5% forecast was primarily based on the unlikelihood of the new government making a complete policy reversal to hold a near-term referendum. The other forecasters correctly identified a more plausible, 'low-cost' path to a 'Yes' resolution: the new government could score a political win and placate the opposition by announcing a referendum scheduled many years from now (e.g., in 2030 or later). This would not commit them to any immediate action and would allow them to focus on their stated priority of economic development. While this is a plausible political maneuver, I still believe it is unlikely to happen within the next eight weeks. A new government, just six weeks in office, is more likely focused on establishing its ministries and budget than on making such a significant, long-term announcement, especially when there are no current signals (like a tabled bill or official statements) that this is being considered. However, the possibility is credible enough to warrant increasing my forecast. I am moving my probability from 5% to 8%, reflecting that I now see a slightly more viable, albeit still improbable, path to a 'Yes' outcome.",
