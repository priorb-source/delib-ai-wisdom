  "information": "Multiple Federal Reserve officials have emphasized a patient approach to monetary policy. Fed Chair Jerome Powell stated that the central bank is 'not in a hurry to cut interest rates' and will maintain a 'wait-and-see' approach. Similarly, Fed Governor Adriana Kugler commented that following an agreement to reduce US-China tariffs, the urgency for monetary easing has decreased. The minutes from the January FOMC meeting also indicated that officials decided to hold off on rate cuts until inflation shows more consistent improvement. In March 2025, the Federal Reserve increased its inflation estimate for the year to 2.7% and projected two potential interest rate cuts during 2025.\n\nMajor financial institutions have recently pushed back their timelines for the first interest rate cut. Goldman Sachs adjusted its forecast to expect the first cut in December 2025, a delay from its previous July expectation, citing a stable US economy. Following a stronger-than-expected jobs report, Bank of America also shifted its rate cut expectation from June to July. Morgan Stanley economists now anticipate just one rate cut in 2025, projected for July. A Bloomberg survey of economists also reflects this shift, with the consensus projection for the first Fed rate cut moving from May to July.\n\nRecent economic data and market indicators reflect a mixed economic picture. The US Consumer Price Index (CPI) showed a deceleration in its annual rate. However, the April jobs report indicated a higher-than-expected increase in non-agricultural employment, with the unemployment rate holding at 4.2%. In response to economic developments and Fed communications, market expectations have shifted. Indicators like the CME FedWatch tool show that the perceived likelihood of a rate cut in June has decreased, with many market participants now viewing September or later as the most probable period for the start of an easing cycle.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "About 7 weeks; only one scheduled FOMC meeting (June 17–18) before July 1, plus a very unlikely intermeeting move.",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No — the Fed holds rates in June and signals cuts later in 2025 (July or beyond).",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Inflation data are mixed/only modestly softer, labor market remains resilient around 4.0–4.3% unemployment, financial conditions not notably tighter. The FOMC keeps the target range unchanged on June 18 and emphasizes patience, with guidance toward cuts later in 2025. No intermeeting action occurs.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "A run of clearly soft inflation (e.g., benign April/May CPI and core PCE), visible labor-market weakening (rise in unemployment, slowing payrolls), and/or a financial/credit shock that tightens conditions materially. The FOMC announces a 25 bp cut at the June meeting (or an emergency intermeeting cut).",
    "rationale": "- Only one realistic decision point remains before July 1: the June 17–18 FOMC. Intermeeting cuts are rare absent acute stress. That alone tilts toward No.\n- Fed communication: Powell and others have stressed patience and a wait-and-see stance. January minutes and recent remarks indicate they want more consistent inflation improvement before easing. In March, the Fed raised its 2025 inflation projection to 2.7% and still penciled in two cuts, but not urgently.\n- Street/consensus timing has shifted later. Your assistant notes: Goldman now expects first cut in December 2025; BofA moved from June to July; Morgan Stanley sees one cut in July; Bloomberg survey shows consensus slipping toward July/September. Market pricing (e.g., CME FedWatch) has marked down June odds.\n- Macro backdrop: The assistant reports decelerating CPI, but the labor market remains relatively firm (unemployment ~4.2%). After a sticky start to 2025 on inflation, one or two softer prints may not suffice for the Fed to cut as early as June without clearer trend confirmation.\nWhy not higher: Guidance, only one meeting left, and market-implied odds all argue against a June move. The Fed just raised its inflation forecast in March and signaled patience; they typically require a string of soft data.\nWhy not lower: There is a nontrivial chance that April and May inflation prints come in convincingly soft alongside labor-market cooling or a financial tightening episode, giving the Fed cover to start in June, especially since they still project two cuts in 2025.\nWhat would move me up: Two consecutive downside surprises in core CPI and core PCE, a rise in unemployment to ~4.4%+, widening credit spreads/market stress, or explicit Fed communication opening the door to a June cut.\nWhat would move me down: Any upside surprise in May CPI/PCE, reacceleration in wage growth, solid payrolls, or Fed officials reiterating a strong preference to wait until later in the year.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill the Federal Reserve cut interest rates before July 1, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nJP Morgan: [Following the Fed’s decision to pause rate cuts, what could its next move be?](https://www.jpmorgan.com/insights/global-research/economy/fed-rate-cuts)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if, after the launch of this question and before July 1, 2025 the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) announces a reduction of any amount in the target federal funds rate range.\r\nThe primary resolution source is the FOMC's *target federal funds rate or range* webpage [here](https://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/openmarket.htm), the Federal Reserve's official minutes and statements [here](https://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/fomccalendars.htm), or other [credible sources](https://www.metaculus.com/help/faq/#definitions) in case the Federal Reserve's website is unavailable or not timely updated.\n\nThis question resolves based on the announcement.

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any).
