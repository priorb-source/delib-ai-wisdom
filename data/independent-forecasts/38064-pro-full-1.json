  "information": "GameStop's annual shareholder meetings have historically been held in the first half of June. Recent meetings have shown a pattern of being held on a Thursday. Past dates include June 2, 2022 (Thursday), June 15, 2023 (Thursday), and an initial schedule of June 13, 2024 (Thursday). The 2024 virtual meeting was adjourned to a later date after its servers crashed due to overwhelming interest from shareholders attempting to join the webcast.\n\nAs of late May 2025, no definitive proxy statement (DEF 14A) filed by GameStop with the SEC for its 2025 annual meeting has been located. According to SEC rules, such a filing is required ahead of a shareholder meeting. Business information aggregators present conflicting information: Computershare, GameStop's transfer agent, lists the meeting for June 2, 2025, while sources like Business Insider and Bloomberg terminals list June 12, 2025. The Business Insider entry also contains an apparent error regarding a dividend payment.\n\nIt is standard corporate practice for companies to avoid rescheduling an annual meeting within a two-week period unless there is a significant reason. Meetings can sometimes be intentionally adjourned if a controversial proposal requires more time for proxy solicitation. GameStop has previously done this for a share-increase motion. The technical failure that affected GameStop's 2024 meeting is a known risk, though many other large-cap companies regularly hold virtual meetings without major incidents.",

    "status_quo_outcome": "The meeting is held on June 12, 2025 as scheduled. Large public companies follow established annual calendars, and the June 12 date aligns with GameStop's historical pattern of holding meetings on a Thursday in early-to-mid June.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "The definitive proxy statement (DEF 14A) is filed and confirms a different date (such as June 2), or the meeting is intentionally postponed by the company. Alternatively, the meeting commences on June 12 but is adjourned without completion due to a recurrence of the server crashes seen in 2024.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "GameStop's official DEF 14A filing confirms the June 12, 2025 date. The company, having learned from its 2024 experience, ensures its webcasting infrastructure is robust enough to handle high shareholder interest, allowing the meeting to be held and fully completed as scheduled.",
    "rationale": "My forecast is based on the strong historical pattern of GameStop holding its annual meeting on a Thursday in early-to-mid June, a pattern that June 12, 2025, fits perfectly. This date is also listed by multiple business information aggregators, such as Bloomberg and Business Insider, which provides significant supporting evidence. The status quo for a large public company is to adhere to its announced schedule.\n\nHowever, my confidence is tempered by several key factors, preventing a higher probability. The most significant is that, as of late May 2025, no official DEF 14A filing confirming the date has been located. This is an unusual delay and introduces major uncertainty. Furthermore, there is conflicting information from GameStop's transfer agent, Computershare, which lists a June 2 date. The most prominent risk is operational: the 2024 meeting was famously postponed due to server crashes from overwhelming interest. A repeat of this technical failure is a non-trivial risk and would cause this question to resolve as 'No'.\n\nMy forecast is not lower because the convergence of historical precedent and multiple data aggregators on June 12 makes it the most probable date. I assume the company has a strong incentive to avoid a repeat of the 2024 technical fiasco and has taken steps to bolster its infrastructure. I would increase my forecast to ~90% if the DEF 14A is filed promptly and confirms the June 12 date. Conversely, I would decrease my forecast if the filing continues to be delayed or if it confirms a different date (in which case the probability would drop to 0).",
