  "information": "India has a history of large-scale demonstrations that have exceeded 10,000 participants, including the farmers' protests of 2020-2021 and the anti-CAA protests of 2019-2020. The Global Protest Tracker recorded 145 anti-government protests worldwide in the 12 months preceding May 2025. Reports also indicate that authorities in India have used technologies such as drones with facial recognition to identify participants in farmer protests and subsequently confiscate their passports.",

    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "About 2 months (until July 1, 2025).",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Ongoing or potential protests fail to mobilize 10,000 participants in a single event due to effective government suppression, loss of momentum, or organizational challenges. Alternatively, a qualifying protest occurs but is not logged by the Global Protest Tracker by the resolution date.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "The volatile situation surrounding the 'Muslim land law' escalates, prompting civil society groups or political parties to organize a new wave of large-scale demonstrations in one or more cities, which is then documented by the tracker.",
    "rationale": "My forecast of 60% indicates this event is more likely than not, but contains significant uncertainty. The primary factor supporting a 'Yes' outcome is the ongoing, volatile political situation in eastern India regarding a 'Muslim land law,' which has already resulted in fatalities. This serves as a powerful, existing catalyst for further mass mobilization. My research assistant's report confirms that India has a recent history of protests far exceeding the 10,000-participant threshold (e.g., 2020-2021 farmers' protests), demonstrating the capacity for such events.\n\nMy probability is not higher primarily due to the very short two-month timeframe. Organizing, executing, and having a protest of this scale officially recorded by the Global Protest Tracker before July 1 is a significant challenge. Additionally, the reported use of surveillance technology and other deterrents by authorities could suppress turnout below the required threshold. There is also a specific requirement that the protest must have a 'start date' after today, meaning a simple continuation of an existing protest might not qualify.\n\nMy probability is not lower because a forecast below 50% would fail to properly weigh the severity of the existing trigger. The fact that the issue is already causing deadly violence suggests tensions are extraordinarily high, making an escalation leading to a mass demonstration plausible, even within a short period.\n\nI would increase my forecast upon news of major political or civil society groups calling for a specific, nationwide 'day of action'. Conversely, I would decrease my forecast if protest leaders and the government enter de-escalation talks or if a different major event captures the nation's attention.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill the Global Protest Tracker report any protests in India with 10,000+ participants, before July 1, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nReuters: [Three dead as protests against Muslim land law turn violent in eastern India](https://www.reuters.com/world/india/three-dead-protests-against-muslim-land-law-turn-violent-eastern-india-2025-04-14/)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if the [Global Protest Tracker](https://carnegieendowment.org/features/global-protest-tracker?lang=en) reports a protest in India with 10,000 or more participants with a start date after the launch of this question and before July 1, 2025.\n\nA protest with at least 10,000 participants that is active at the launch of this question does not count for resolution.\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nIndia has a history of large-scale demonstrations that have exceeded 10,000 participants, including the farmers' protests of 2020-2021 and the anti-CAA protests of 2019-2020. The Global Protest Tracker recorded 145 anti-government protests worldwide in the 12 months preceding May 2025. Reports also indicate that authorities in India have used technologies such as drones with facial recognition to identify participants in farmer protests and subsequently confiscate their passports.\n\nToday is 2025-05-02.\n\nBefore answering you think:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n(e) You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
