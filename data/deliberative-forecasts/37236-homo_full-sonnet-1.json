    "review": "The other forecasters raised several compelling points I underweighted. Forecaster 3's quantitative framing is particularly valuable: April falling below the threshold requires approximately a 5.7% decline from February's $278.5 billion - a substantial month-over-month drop that's historically rare outside recessions. Both forecasters correctly emphasize the distinction between bookings (forward-looking) versus actual April shipments, and the measurement lag in export data where April shipments reflect earlier-contracted orders. I also underweighted services export resilience - services are a major component of total exports and are less directly affected by goods tariffs. However, I believe Forecaster 3 at 40% may be slightly too optimistic given the breadth of retaliatory measures (multiple countries, not just China) and the manufacturing PMI contraction indicating real production constraints. The tariffs did affect 28 of 30 days in April, and while there's measurement lag, the disruption was immediate and widespread.",
    "rationale": "Upon reflection, I need to update upward but remain more cautious than Forecaster 3. The key insights that move me higher: (1) A 5.7% month-over-month decline from February to April is substantial and historically unusual outside recessions; (2) Export data has inherent measurement lag - April shipments reflect contracts established weeks or months earlier, providing some insulation from the April 2 tariff shock; (3) The 45% China booking decline represents forward-looking orders, not April shipments themselves; (4) Services exports form a substantial buffer and are less vulnerable to goods tariffs. However, I remain more cautious than 40% because: (1) Manufacturing PMI contraction indicates real production and capacity constraints affecting exports; (2) Retaliatory measures came from multiple countries, compounding the effect beyond just China; (3) The tariffs were broad-based and implemented immediately on April 2, affecting nearly the entire month; (4) While measurement lag provides some protection, the shock was severe enough to likely impact even pre-contracted shipments through cancellations or delays. The balance suggests a meaningful probability of falling below the threshold, but the structural factors (measurement lag, services resilience, magnitude of required decline) make it less likely than I initially estimated.",
