  "information": "The National UFO Reporting Center (NUFORC) receives approximately 5,000-6,000 total UFO reports annually. The 'Pilot' report subtype constitutes about 1% of these, amounting to 30-60 reports worldwide per year. Non-US pilot reports are less frequent, with about 3-5 recorded annually from outside the United States. Reports from South American countries average around 1-2 per year. Specific examples of recent pilot reports from the continent logged in the NUFORC database include a sighting in Brazil in December 2024 and one from a Chilean Air Force crew in February 2023. The NUFORC system is based in the United States and uses an English-language reporting form.",

    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Approximately 41 days until July 1, 2025 when the outcome will be determined",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No - it is unlikely that a South American pilot report will be posted to NUFORC in June 2025",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "No pilots from South American countries witness UFOs/UAPs during June 2025, or if they do, they report to local authorities rather than the US-based NUFORC system, or their reports are not processed and posted by July 1, 2025",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "A commercial or military pilot from a South American country (such as Brazil, Chile, Argentina, or Colombia) witnesses an unusual aerial phenomenon during June 2025, submits a report to NUFORC despite the language barrier and geographic distance, and NUFORC processes and posts the report by early July",
    "rationale": "Based on the assistant's research, South American pilot reports to NUFORC average 1-2 per year. This translates to approximately 0.08-0.17 reports per month, or roughly 8-17% probability for any given month if evenly distributed. Using a Poisson distribution with λ=0.125 (midpoint estimate), the probability of at least one report in a single month is approximately 12%. The status quo strongly suggests a No outcome given the low base rate. However, recent concrete examples (Brazil December 2024, Chilean Air Force February 2023) demonstrate that such reports do occur with some regularity. Key factors limiting the probability: (1) NUFORC is US-based with an English-language reporting system, creating barriers for South American pilots; (2) pilots may report to local aviation authorities instead; (3) the base rate is inherently low. Factors preventing an even lower forecast: (1) documented historical precedent of 1-2 reports annually; (2) June represents 8.3% of the year, which aligns with base rate expectations; (3) commercial aviation continues normally. I would update upward if: evidence of increased UFO/UAP activity in South America emerged, or reporting barriers decreased. I would update downward if: June passed with no unusual sightings reported elsewhere, or if NUFORC posting delays became apparent.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill a pilot report of UFOs come from a country in South America in June 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nFor example, the resolution source [reports](https://nuforc.org/subndx/?id=x) a sighting in Brazil in December 2024.\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if The National UFO Reporting Center posts a pilot report of a UFO/UAP having occurred in a country on the South American continent, during the month of June 2025 at [this link](https://nuforc.org/subndx/?id=x) when accessed by Metaculus on or after July 1, 2025.\n\n\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nThe National UFO Reporting Center (NUFORC) receives approximately 5,000-6,000 total UFO reports annually.

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
