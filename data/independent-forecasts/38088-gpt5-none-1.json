    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "About 33 days (until July 1, 2025)",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No — as of Apr 30, 2025, the #250 (Giancarlo Devasini) is listed as Italy, not the United States.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Rank 250 on July 1 is Devasini or another non-U.S. billionaire, reflecting that mid-list ranks are more internationally distributed and the composition near 250 doesn’t shift toward a U.S. name by that date.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Market moves shuffle the ranks so that a U.S. billionaire sits at #250 on July 1—for example, U.S. equities modestly outperform peers, or a crypto/EM or European billionaire near #250 drops on price moves, letting a U.S. name land exactly at #250.",
    "rationale": "Baseline: The U.S. is the single largest cohort on the Bloomberg Billionaires Index, but the U.S. share tends to be lower in the mid-ranks than at the very top. A reasonable base rate for a random mid-list slot like #250 is roughly 30–35% U.S. Status quo: On Apr 30, #250 was Italian (Giancarlo Devasini). With only about a month until July 1 and typically modest day-to-day rank drift around the middle of the list, I place extra weight on the current non-U.S. outcome. That nudges the forecast slightly below the midpoint of the 30–35% range. Drivers: - U.S. upside: Continued strength in U.S. mega-cap and mid-cap billionaire wealth, or a relative dip in non-U.S. peers, could place a U.S. billionaire at exactly #250 on the reference date. - Non-U.S. stickiness: The mid-list is internationally diversified (not U.S.-dominated), so the most likely single-country outcome on any given day is still “not U.S.” - Idiosyncratic factor: Devasini’s wealth is tied to crypto/Tether-linked economics; crypto volatility could push him up or down, but that uncertainty doesn’t systematically favor a U.S. occupant at exactly #250 on a specific date. Why not higher: The U.S. is unlikely to be a majority at this specific rank; current occupant is non-U.S.; and only a short horizon remains. Why not lower: The U.S. remains the largest single-country cohort overall, and moderate relative outperformance over a month could plausibly place a U.S. billionaire at #250. Update triggers: I would move higher if I saw evidence that the cluster around ranks 245–255 skews U.S. right now, or if U.S. markets significantly outperform others into late June. I would move lower if crypto or non-U.S. markets outperform and a clear non-U.S. cluster forms around #250. Research assistant input: None beyond noting the Apr 30 occupant was Italian; no additional list context provided.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill the median person on Bloomberg's Billionaires Index be from the United States on July 1, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nOn April 30, 2025, the 250th-ranked name on the list was Giancarlo Devasini of Italy\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if the person ranked 250th on the Bloomberg Billionaires Index (available at [this link](https://www.bloomberg.com/billionaires/)) is listed as being from the United States, when accessed by Metaculus Admins on or after July 1, 2025. It resolves as **No** if the 250th-ranked person is from any other country.\n\nFor purposes of this question, the \"median\" from the question's title is defined as the 250th ranked person on the Bloomberg Billionaires Index, no matter how many are on the list.\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nNo additional information available.\n\nToday is 2025-05-29.\n\nBefore answering you think:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n(e) You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
