    "review": "Both forecasters emphasize correlation across categories (if voters embrace/reject the crossover, results cluster), which trims the naïve union probability. They also note timing (ballots essentially set) and that Post’s nominations likely center on one or two works, increasing outcome covariance. These are sensible points I only implicitly accounted for. They did not introduce concrete new evidence (odds, category-by-category intel, or leaks), but their correlation framing and reminder of strong incumbent rivals are persuasive as a modest downward pressure. I agree with their rationale that the Music Event/Single lanes could be his best shots, but that marquee competition and genre‑identity dynamics keep per‑category odds moderate.",
    "rationale": "Starting from a base-rate union model for four nominations (roughly 59% if each were ~20% independent chances), I had been above that due to Post Malone’s very strong commercial footprint and the Morgan Wallen collaboration likely making at least one category relatively live. However, the nominations appear concentrated around the same material, which raises correlation. With ballots effectively set and no credible signals he’s a clear favorite in any single category, I trim my prior slightly. I still keep the forecast above 60% because: (1) four bites materially improve odds versus single-category contenders; (2) the collaboration angle historically plays well in ACM “event” and high-impact single categories; and (3) his 4 nods signal broad industry recognition rather than a token crossover. I move down from 68% to 64% to reflect correlated outcomes and tough competition, in the absence of new positive signals.",
