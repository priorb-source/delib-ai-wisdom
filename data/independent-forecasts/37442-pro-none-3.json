    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "The 13F filing for the first quarter of 2025 is due on or around May 15, 2025. As today is May 6, 2025, the outcome will be known in approximately 9 days.",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No. The status quo is that Berkshire Hathaway maintains its previously reported position without making additional purchases during the first quarter. This would result in their holding being less than or equal to 2,382,000 shares.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Berkshire Hathaway's investment managers, having established their initial position, determine that Domino's stock price during Q1 2025 did not offer a compelling enough value to increase their stake. They instead chose to hold their existing shares and allocate new capital to other investment opportunities, resulting in no change to their DPZ holdings.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Berkshire Hathaway views Domino's Pizza as a long-term holding and is in the process of building a larger position. During Q1 2025, the stock price may have experienced a dip or was otherwise considered attractive, prompting them to purchase additional shares to increase their stake beyond the initial 2,382,000 shares.",
    "rationale": "My forecast leans towards the status quo, which is a 'No' outcome. Berkshire Hathaway is known for its long-term, value-oriented investment strategy. Once a position is established, it's common for them to hold it for an extended period without making quarterly additions unless there is a significant change in valuation. The default action in any given quarter is typically 'no action'. The resolution threshold is very low (only one share more is needed), which prevents the probability from being lower. However, there are plausible reasons for a 'Yes' outcome. Domino's fits the Berkshire profile of a strong, simple-to-understand consumer brand with a potential economic moat. It is common for Berkshire to build a desired position over several quarters to avoid significantly impacting the stock price. The initial reported stake could be just the first tranche of a larger planned investment. My probability is not higher because, without specific information about Domino's stock performance in Q1 2025 or commentary from Berkshire, assuming they were actively buying is more speculative than assuming they were holding steady. My probability is not lower because the character of the likely investment (a durable consumer brand) and Berkshire's history of accumulating positions over time make a 'Yes' outcome a very real possibility. I would increase my forecast if information emerged that Domino's stock was particularly undervalued during Q1 2025. I would decrease it if Berkshire signaled a major capital allocation to a different company or industry during that same period.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill Berkshire Hathaway reveal a purchase of more Domino's Pizza stock in its Q1 2025 13F filing?\n\nQuestion background:\nRetailWire: [Domino’s Pizza Stake Purchased by Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway Group](https://retailwire.com/dominos-pizza-warren-buffett/)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if the 13F filing for Berkshire Hathaway, Inc., filed for the period ending 2025-03-31, reports the company holding greater than 2,382,000 shares of Domino's Pizza, Inc. (ticker symbol DPZ).\n\n\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nNo additional information available.\n\nToday is 2025-05-06.\n\nBefore answering you think:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n(e) You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
