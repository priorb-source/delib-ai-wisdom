  "information": "Donald Trump has a history of attending UFC events in the United States, typically appearing at 2 to 4 cards per year since 2019. All of his previous appearances have been at domestic events. He has a strong personal relationship with UFC President Dana White. Trump recently attended a UFC event in Miami in April 2025. Historically, he has not attended two consecutive numbered UFC cards within a one-month span; UFC 315 is scheduled to take place four weeks after the Miami event.\n\nUFC 315 is scheduled for May 10, 2025, at the Bell Centre in Montreal, Quebec, Canada. The event's fight card includes two title fights, with a welterweight championship bout between Belal Muhammad and Jack Della Maddalena as one of the main events. No sitting or former U.S. president has previously attended a UFC event held in Canada or any other foreign country.\n\nJoe Rogan, a prominent UFC commentator, has publicly announced he will not be attending UFC 315 in Montreal. He cited his discontent with the Canadian government as the reason, stating he 'doesn't go to Canada anymore' and would 'rather go to Russia.' Rogan also mentioned that he had discussed US-Canada relations with Donald Trump, who had joked about Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau.",

    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "About 12 days (until May 10, 2025)",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No — he does not attend",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Trump continues his pattern of attending only U.S.-based UFC cards, skips the Montreal event due to international travel, security/logistics, and limited incremental benefit. He focuses on domestic appearances or has conflicting obligations that day.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Trump coordinates with Dana White for a surprise appearance and obtains the necessary entry permissions for Canada, making a brief, highly publicized stop at the Bell Centre (even if just backstage), satisfying the “anywhere on the grounds” criterion.",
    "rationale": "Base rates and logistics point to No. Per the assistant’s report: Trump typically attends 2–4 UFC events per year and has only attended domestic cards; no sitting or former U.S. president has attended a UFC event abroad; UFC 315 is in Montreal on May 10; he already attended a Miami UFC event in April, and historically he hasn’t done two numbered cards within four weeks. Joe Rogan’s announced absence from Montreal slightly lowers the draw for a high-profile U.S. political cameo, and Canada-specific factors (border formalities, security posture, potential controversy) add friction. The fight card, while solid with two title fights, lacks an obvious once-in-a-decade headliner that would strongly pull Trump north of the border. Status quo therefore favors non-attendance. Why not higher: zero precedent for Trump at a foreign UFC, very short time to arrange international travel with security, and his recent attendance four weeks prior. Why not lower: Trump’s relationship with Dana White, his appetite for headline-grabbing drop-ins, and the fact that UFC 315 is a numbered PPV keep a small-but-real chance alive. What would move me up: credible reporting of planned Canada travel, statements from Dana White/UFC hinting at VIP attendees, local security preparations specific to Trump, flight tracking of his aircraft bound for Montreal, or explicit confirmation from Trump. What would move me down: firm conflicting commitments (rally/court appearance) on May 10, reporting of Canadian entry complications, or further signals from UFC that the broadcast talent and VIP slate will be lean.",
