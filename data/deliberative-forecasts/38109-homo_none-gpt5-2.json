    "review": "Forecaster 2’s emphasis on regulatory base rates and the strict “every day” requirement is persuasive and aligns with my prior. The CFTC’s treatment of sports as “gaming” (e.g., the ErisX disapproval) is a meaningful headwind, and without verified evidence of current real-money MLB listings, the status quo favors No. Forecaster 3’s arguments about operational ease and the existence of a sports/baseball page are plausible but not evidentiary; a category page does not establish that compliant, real-money MLB game markets are live or will be continuous. The compounding nature of the “every day” bar also undercuts a 62% view absent strong proof of current daily listings and regulatory comfort. Overall, F2 nudges me slightly downward; F3 doesn’t provide new hard evidence to move me up.",
    "rationale": "Key points: (1) Regulatory risk: The CFTC has previously disapproved sports event contracts as contrary to the public interest/gaming. Kalshi’s litigation momentum concerns elections, not sports, and does not obviously relax sports constraints in June. (2) Lack of confirmation: I have no verified evidence that Kalshi is currently running real-money MLB game markets. A sports/baseball tag alone isn’t enough. (3) Fragile criterion: Even if sports markets launch, the “every day in June” requirement is brittle—one missed day resolves No. Operational or strategic skips, maintenance, or a compliance pause would be fatal. (4) Update from deliberation: F2’s base-rate framing and the strictness of the requirement reinforce my original caution. F3’s operational feasibility is true but insufficient without regulatory clearance and observed continuity. Net effect: slight downgrade from my prior 25% to reflect the compounding failure risk and absence of concrete evidence that MLB markets are presently live and compliant.",
