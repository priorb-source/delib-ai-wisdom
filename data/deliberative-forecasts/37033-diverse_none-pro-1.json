    "review": "The other forecasters provide a valuable analytical tension. Forecaster 2 (15%) compellingly anchors their reasoning in the strong base rate of government inaction, highlighting the five-year gap preceding the first payment. This emphasizes that such payments are rare, and a second one within seven weeks would be a significant aberration. Forecaster 3 (46%) effectively outlines the bull case, focusing on the powerful signaling incentives tied to debt restructuring negotiations with international creditors. Their concept of a 'deliberate symbolic tranche' to maintain momentum is the most plausible path to a 'Yes' outcome. I find Forecaster 2's argument about historical patterns and administrative inertia particularly convincing for such a short timeframe, while Forecaster 3's point that the first payment proves the 'administrative pathway exists' is an important counterargument against extreme pessimism.",
    "rationale": "After reviewing the other analyses, I am lowering my forecast from 35% to 25%. Forecaster 2's emphasis on the five-year delay before the *first* payment has convinced me to place more weight on the high probability of bureaucratic inertia and financial constraints reasserting themselves. The default state for the Zimbabwean government is slow action. A second payment in under two months would be exceptionally fast. The April payment may have satisfied an immediate need to signal intent to creditors, temporarily reducing the urgency for an immediate follow-up before June 1. However, I am not lowering my forecast to 15%. I still believe, in line with Forecaster 3's reasoning, that the external pressure is a significant, non-negligible factor. The first payment proves the mechanism is viable, and the potential for a small, symbolic payment to unlock larger financial aid or advance critical negotiations remains a plausible scenario. My revised 25% forecast reflects a stronger belief in the status quo of inaction, while still acknowledging a roughly one-in-four chance that acute international pressure forces another small, symbolic payment within this very short window.",
