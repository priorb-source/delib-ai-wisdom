    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "9 days. The outcome will be known on April 30, 2025.",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No. The current state of emergency was declared to be in effect through April 29, 2025. If no new action is taken, it will expire before April 30, 2025.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "The Samoan government determines that the power crisis has been sufficiently managed, or that emergency powers are no longer necessary to address it. Consequently, they allow the state of emergency to expire as scheduled on April 29, 2025, and do not declare a new one.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Repairs to the power generators take longer than anticipated, and the energy crisis persists. The Samoan government decides to formally extend the state of emergency to facilitate ongoing response efforts, and it is therefore still in effect on April 30, 2025.",
    "rationale": "The primary piece of evidence is the initial declaration, which explicitly set an end date of April 29, 2025. The status quo, therefore, is that the state of emergency will not be in effect on April 30. This is the most likely outcome, as it requires no new action from the government. However, the underlying cause is a significant infrastructure failure involving power generators. Such problems are often not fully resolved within a 30-day period. This creates a substantial probability that the government will need to extend the declaration to continue managing the crisis, procuring parts, or accessing emergency resources. My forecast balances the official end date (favoring 'No') against the practical difficulty of resolving a nationwide power crisis quickly (favoring 'Yes'). My forecast is not lower because the type of crisis—critical infrastructure failure—makes extensions common. A quick fix is not guaranteed. My forecast is not higher because for the outcome to be 'Yes', the government must take the deliberate step of issuing an extension. Without new information suggesting the crisis has worsened or that repairs have stalled, the default path remains that the declaration will expire as planned. I would increase my forecast if there were credible reports of continued, severe power outages or official statements suggesting an extension was being considered. I would decrease it upon news of successful repairs or the arrival of new generating capacity.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill a state of emergency be in effect in Samoa on April 30, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\n[Samoan Prime Minister declares state of emergency over power cuts](https://www.stuff.co.nz/nz-news/360634988/samoan-prime-minister-declares-state-emergency-over-power-cuts)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if, according to [credible sources](https://www.metaculus.com/faq/#definitions) Samoa is in a state of emergency that has been declared by a governmental entity with the authority to make such a declaration.\n\nFor example, the state of emergency declaration [posted](https://www.facebook.com/samoagovt/posts/hon-prime-minister-of-samoa-press-statement-proclamation-of-emergency-energy-cri/1059050259591457/) by the government of Samoa on Facebook on March 31, 2025 would count. (Note that when it was declared, it was scheduled to be in effect through April 29, 2025.)\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nNo additional information available.\n\nToday is 2025-04-21.\n\nBefore answering you think:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n(e) You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
