    "review": "The other forecasters and I reached a strong consensus on the core issue: the extremely short timeframe of less than two months means a bankruptcy filing would require an acute, near-term liquidity crisis. Both analysts reinforced this view, but they introduced crucial new evidence I had not initially considered. Forecaster 2 provided specifics like the NYSE non-compliance notice having a six-month cure period, which removes one potential source of immediate pressure. Forecaster 3's analysis was particularly compelling, offering concrete financial data that Chegg has a net cash position and, most importantly, no large debt maturities before 2026. This final point about the lack of a near-term maturity wall is a very powerful argument against an imminent filing. Their nuanced discussion of quantitative metrics like the Altman Z and Piotroski F-scores also added a layer of analytical rigor that I found persuasive.",
    "rationale": "After reviewing my peers' analyses, I am lowering my forecast. My initial 5% probability was based on Chegg's stated goals and the low base rate of such an event. However, the new evidence provided, particularly by Forecaster 3, changes my assessment of the near-term risk. The confirmation that Chegg has a net cash position and no significant debt maturities before 2026 is the most critical fact. A company does not typically file for bankruptcy within two months when it has cash on hand and no imminent, large debt payments to make. This financial cushion provides a substantial buffer against the severe operational headwinds the company is facing from AI competition. While the business is clearly in distress, as evidenced by its stock price and declining revenue, this distress does not appear to translate into an immediate solvency or liquidity crisis. The risk is now confined to a 'black swan' event, such as the discovery of major fraud or a sudden, catastrophic legal judgment, rather than a predictable financial collapse. This new information makes the probability of a filing before July 1 substantially lower than I first estimated. I am therefore reducing my forecast from 5% to 3% to align with this stronger evidence base.",
