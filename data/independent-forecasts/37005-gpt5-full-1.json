  "information": "According to the 338Canada statistical model, the Liberal Party is projected to win between 188 and 196 seats. National polling data indicates Liberal support is at 40-45%, compared to 37-38% for the Conservative Party. Polls also show strong performance for the Liberals in Ontario and Quebec, which together account for 199 of the 338 seats in Parliament.\n\nHistorical results show the Liberal Party won 160 seats in the 2021 federal election and 157 seats in the 2019 federal election. The last time the Liberal Party won a majority government was in the 2015 election, when they secured 184 seats.\n\nIn Canada's 338-seat House of Commons, 170 seats are required for a majority government. The analysis was conducted with 8 days remaining before the election resolution date. At that time, advance voting was underway, with reports indicating a 36% increase in turnout compared to the 2021 election.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "~8–10 days (election day in about a week; unofficial seat counts expected election night, with final tallies within 1–2 days)",
    "status_quo_outcome": "Yes",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Late-breaking shift or polling error: Conservatives outperform in Ontario’s 905 and Southwestern Ontario; Bloc gains in Quebec at Liberal expense; NDP holds/expands urban strongholds. A 2–3 point national miss against the Liberals, combined with inefficient vote splits, pulls the Liberals down to ~160–171 seats.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Polling holds or breaks slightly toward Liberals: strong margins in the GTA, seat-efficient gains in Ontario, resilience in Quebec versus Bloc, and solid Atlantic results. Even with modest underperformance, they remain ≥172; with status-quo performance, they land ~180–195 seats.",
    "rationale": "I place extra weight on near-term, status-quo evidence because large opinion shifts are uncommon in the final week. The assistant’s report cites 338Canada projecting Liberals at 188–196 seats and national polling showing Liberals 40–45% vs Conservatives 37–38, with particular Liberal strength in Ontario and Quebec. If accurate, that positioning implies a comfortable cushion above the 172-seat threshold and a high likelihood of a Yes outcome.\n\nThat said, I am discounting somewhat for three reasons: (1) model and polling correlated error risk—Canada’s FPTP system can translate small national errors into large seat swings, especially via Ontario’s 905 and volatile Quebec races; (2) last-week dynamics (turnout differential, late deciders, or a late news cycle shock); and (3) prior-cycle baseline—through 2024, the Conservatives led national polls, so I retain some probability mass on the possibility that the current snapshot overstates a Liberal rebound or that the seat-efficiency assumptions are too favorable.\n\nWhy not higher: Even from a projected 188–196, a modest 1–2 point late shift, asymmetric turnout, or Bloc/NDP regional surprises could drop the Liberals below 172. Model ranges and systemic polling error argue against a 90%+ call.\n\nWhy not lower: Multiple independent indicators (national+regional polling, 338’s projection) suggest a lead translating into a majority-sized seat count; with ~8 days left, the base case is stability rather than reversal.\n\nWhat would move me up: Fresh high-quality polls (national and Ontario/Quebec regionals) confirming or widening the Liberal lead; 338/aggregators raising the Liberal seat floor to ≥175; evidence of turnout advantages in Liberal-leaning areas; credible riding-level data in the GTA and Montreal suburbs favoring Liberals.\n\nWhat would move me down: Credible polls showing a tightening race or Conservative lead; signs of a Bloc surge in Quebec or NDP consolidation in urban cores; reputable models cutting the Liberal seat floor below ~170; negative late-breaking news for Liberals or turnout signals favoring Conservatives.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill the Liberal Party win 172 or more seats in the 2025 Canadian federal election?\n\nQuestion background:\n[338Canada Federal Projection](https://338canada.com/federal.htm): \"The 338Canada project is a statistical model of electoral projections based on opinion polls, electoral history, and demographic data. This web site is a creation of Philippe J. Fournier, physics and astrophysics professor at Cégep de Saint-Laurent in Montreal.\"\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if the Liberal Party of Canada wins greater than or equal to 172 seats in the [2025 Canadian federal election](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2025_Canadian_federal_election).\n\n\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nAccording to the 338Canada statistical model, the Liberal Party is projected to win between 188 and 196 seats.

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
