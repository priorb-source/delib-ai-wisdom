    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Approximately 1 month and 22 days, as the resolution date is July 1, 2025.",
    "status_quo_outcome": "The recall status is 'Active' on the U.S. Department of Agriculture’s Food Safety and Inspection Service (FSIS) website.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "The recall remains 'Active' on the FSIS website on July 1, 2025. This could occur due to administrative delays at the FSIS, complexities in verifying that all product has been removed from commerce, or a lack of timely documentation from Johnsonville LLC.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "The FSIS completes its verification process and updates the recall status to 'Closed' on its website before July 1, 2025. This would happen if Johnsonville quickly and effectively manages the recall and the FSIS processes the closure in a standard timeframe.",
    "rationale": "My forecast is based on the typical timeline for FSIS recall closures. The recall was issued on April 5, 2025, providing a window of nearly three months until the July 1, 2025 resolution date. This is generally a sufficient period for a recall of this nature to be concluded. Most recalls of this type are closed within a few months, making a 'Yes' outcome the base case. Johnsonville is a large, established company with significant resources and experience in regulatory compliance, giving it the capability and incentive to manage the recall efficiently to restore consumer trust. The recall is for foreign matter contamination, which can often be a more straightforward issue to resolve than widespread pathogen contamination that might require more extensive investigation. No additional information suggesting unusual complexity was provided by my research assistant.\n\nMy forecast is not higher than 75% because administrative processes within government agencies like the FSIS can have unpredictable delays. There is always a non-trivial chance of unforeseen complications, such as difficulties in accounting for all 22,000 pounds of product, that could extend the 'Active' status beyond the deadline.\n\nMy forecast is not lower because there is no specific evidence to suggest this recall will be more complex than average. A lower probability would imply an expectation of significant problems, which is not warranted by the available information. The nearly three-month timeframe is a strong factor favoring resolution.\n\nI would increase my forecast if Johnsonville or the FSIS issued a statement indicating the recall was proceeding smoothly or that a high percentage of the product had already been recovered. I would decrease my forecast if there were reports of illnesses associated with the product or news that the recall was being expanded.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill the USDA-posted recall by Johnsonville LLC of cheddar bratwurst for foreign matter contamination issued April 5, 2025 be closed before July 1, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nReal Simple: [Over 22,000 Pounds of a Popular Sausage Brand Recalled Due to Contamination](https://www.realsimple.com/sausage-recall-2025-11711268)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if the status of the recall posted by the U.S. Department of Agriculture’s Food Safety and Inspection Service (FSIS) is changed from Active to Closed on [this page](https://www.fsis.usda.gov/recalls-alerts/johnsonville-llc-recalls-cheddar-bratwurst-product-due-possible-foreign-matter) before July 1, 2025. If the recall is still shown as Active when the link is accessed by Metaculus on or after July 1, 2025, this question resolves as **No**.\n\n\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nNo additional information available.\n\nToday is 2025-05-09.\n\nBefore answering you think:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n(e) You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
