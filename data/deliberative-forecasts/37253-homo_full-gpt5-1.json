    "review": "Both forecasters largely agree on the core: long inactivity since 2017, site likely capable but no public pre-test signatures, and only ~2 months left. Forecaster 2 adds two useful points I hadn’t explicitly weighed: the June 25 Korean War anniversary as a plausible timing hook within the window, and the weaker UNSC cohesion (China/Russia) modestly reducing expected costs; they also place more weight on DPRK’s ability to move quickly. Forecaster 3 closely mirrors my initial logic and keeps the probability low. I find F2’s added timing hook and cost environment arguments credible but not sufficient to double the probability in the absence of site activity. F3’s 7% aligns with my prior. Overall, their inputs justify a slight upward nudge, not a large move.",
    "rationale": "- Time window: ~61 days remain. Historically, DPRK nuclear tests are preceded by observable prep (vehicles, cable reels, portal sealing/pumping) days to weeks ahead; none are publicly reported now.\n- Capability vs intent: Punggye-ri is assessed operable (ROK NIS/U.S.), and fissile production is ongoing (IAEA), but 38 North reports no current prep activity. That keeps near-term intent unsubstantiated.\n- Strategic incentives: DPRK has escalated rhetoric and conventional/strategic tests in 2025, which raises background hazard. Yet a nuclear detonation still carries higher costs, notably potential Chinese displeasure—even if UNSC penalties are less cohesive than before—so Pyongyang can continue signaling without those costs.\n- Timing hooks: The June 25 anniversary provides a plausible focal date in this window, slightly increasing tail risk despite the current lack of signatures.\n- Balance: With no prep indicators and limited time, the base chance remains low. Accounting for weaker expected international punishment and a salient June date, I edge up slightly from my prior.\n- What would change my view: I’d move up quickly on credible imagery of Punggye-ri prep (vehicles/logistics surges, cables/instrumentation, portal sealing/pumping) or allied warnings of imminence; I’d move down if dormancy persists into mid-June or there are signs of Chinese pressure or DPRK prioritizing other provocations (e.g., a satellite launch) without Punggye-ri activity.",
