  "information": "Indian government officials announced in May 2025 their intention to submit fresh intelligence to the FATF concerning terrorist infrastructure operating within Pakistan. This development follows Pakistan's removal from the FATF Grey List in October 2022. At the time of its removal, the FATF noted that Pakistan should continue working with the Asia Pacific Group (APG) to improve its anti-money laundering and counter-terrorism financing systems. Separately, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) has also recently advised Pakistan to enhance its AML/CFT effectiveness.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Approximately one month. The FATF plenary is in June 2025, and the outcome will be announced at its conclusion near the end of the month.",
    "status_quo_outcome": "The FATF 'black list' (High-Risk Jurisdictions subject to a Call for Action) remains unchanged, consisting of North Korea, Myanmar, and Iran.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "The FATF plenary concludes without adding any new jurisdictions to the black list or removing any of the current three countries. The FATF determines that the situations in North Korea, Myanmar, and Iran have not substantially changed to warrant removal, and no other jurisdiction meets the criteria for being blacklisted.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "The FATF adds a jurisdiction to the black list due to its failure to address profound strategic deficiencies in its anti-money laundering/counter-terrorist financing (AML/CFT) regime. Alternatively, the FATF could remove Myanmar or Iran from the list following a successful on-site visit and verification of significant progress against their action plans.",
    "rationale": "My forecast is based on the significant institutional inertia of the FATF black list. Changes, whether additions or removals, are rare and require major, verifiable shifts in a country's AML/CFT framework or political situation. The status quo is the most probable outcome.\n\nRegarding the currently listed jurisdictions:\n- North Korea's removal is virtually impossible due to its international isolation and lack of engagement.\n- Iran's status is tied to broader geopolitical factors, and without a major political breakthrough, its removal is highly unlikely by next month.\n- Myanmar was added relatively recently (October 2022) following a military coup, and the ongoing internal instability makes it improbable that it has made sufficient, verifiable progress to be removed so soon.\n\nRegarding potential additions:\n- The research assistant's report on India submitting new intelligence on Pakistan is noted. However, this is unlikely to lead to blacklisting in June 2025. Pakistan was removed from the *grey* list in 2022. A direct move to the black list, bypassing the grey list, is an extreme measure reserved for catastrophic failures in cooperation or regime collapse. India's move is more likely a political pressure tactic that could, at most, start a conversation about re-evaluating Pakistan for the grey list in a future cycle, not immediate blacklisting.\n- No other country on the grey list appears to be at imminent risk of being escalated to the black list.\n\nWhy the probability is not lower: The world is unpredictable. A sudden geopolitical development concerning Iran, an unexpected policy shift from Myanmar's leadership, or a major new revelation about another state's financing of terrorism are low-probability events that could trigger a change.\n\nWhy the probability is not higher: The FATF process is deliberate and slow-moving. The bar for adding or removing a country is exceptionally high, and there are currently no strong indicators that any of the jurisdictions involved are close to crossing that threshold in either direction.\n\nI would increase my forecast for 'Yes' if credible, high-level reports emerged of a major political breakthrough with Iran or if FATF officials made public statements expressing extreme concern over a specific country's lack of progress, signaling a potential blacklisting.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill any jurisdictions be added to or removed from the FATF \"black list\" following the FATF Plenary meeting in June 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nWikipedia: [Financial Action Task Force blacklist](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Financial_Action_Task_Force_blacklist)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if following its June 2025 plenary, the Financial Action Task Force (FATF) has made any changes to its \"High-Risk Jurisdictions subject to a Call for Action\" list, which at the time of this question consists of North Korea, Myanmar and Iran. Resolves according to the [official list](https://www.fatf-gafi.org/en/countries/black-and-grey-lists.html).\n\nThe question may resolve according to [credible sources](https://www.metaculus.com/help/faq/#definitions) in case the website is unavailable or not timely updated.\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nIndian government officials announced in May 2025 their intention to submit fresh intelligence to the FATF concerning terrorist infrastructure operating within Pakistan.

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
