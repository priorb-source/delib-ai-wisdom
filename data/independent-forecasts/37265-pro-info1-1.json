  "information": "As of May 2, 2025, Tanzania holds a Level 2: Exercise Increased Caution travel advisory from the US State Department, last updated on September 9, 2024. The advisory cites crime, terrorism, and the targeting of LGBTQI+ persons as primary concerns. While the country is at Level 2 overall, specific regions such as Mtwara have a higher, Level 3 warning. In March 2025, the US Embassy issued an alert regarding coastal security.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Approximately 2 months (until July 1, 2025)",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No. The US State Department's travel advisory for Tanzania will remain at Level 2.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "The security situation in Tanzania remains broadly consistent with current conditions. The concerns regarding crime, terrorism, and LGBTQI+ targeting persist but do not escalate to a degree that warrants a nationwide upgrade. The March 2025 coastal security alert does not lead to a change in the overall country advisory level before the deadline.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "A significant event, such as a major terrorist attack in a tourist area (e.g., Dar es Salaam, Zanzibar, or a national park), a widespread increase in violent crime targeting foreigners, or significant political instability, occurs. This event prompts the US State Department to conclude that the risk profile for the entire country has fundamentally worsened, leading to an upgrade to a Level 3 advisory.",
    "rationale": "My forecast is based on the high inertia of State Department travel advisories and the short time remaining until the July 1, 2025 deadline. The current advisory is Level 2, and these levels tend to remain stable unless there is a significant, country-wide deterioration in security. The existence of a specific Level 3 advisory for the Mtwara region demonstrates that the State Department prefers a granular, regional approach rather than applying a blanket advisory, unless the threat is widespread. The March 2025 coastal security alert indicates active monitoring of risks but is a lower-level action than a full advisory change. For the country's overall level to change in the next two months, a significant catalyst would be required. My probability is not lower than 20% because the underlying risks (terrorism, crime) cited in the current advisory are real, and the recent security alert suggests a degree of volatility. A single major incident could be sufficient to trigger a change. My probability is not higher because the status quo is a powerful predictor over short timeframes, and there is no current evidence of an imminent, nation-wide crisis that would force a change. I would increase my forecast if there were credible reports of a specific, major terrorist plot, a significant political crisis, or an outbreak of widespread civil unrest. I would decrease it as the deadline approaches without any such incidents.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill Tanzania receive a \"Level 3 – Reconsider Travel\" travel advisory from the US State Department before July 1, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nTravel and Tour World: [Travel Advisory for Tanzania: How Increased Crime and Terrorism Threats Impact Tourists in Popular African Destinations](https://www.travelandtourworld.com/news/article/travel-advisory-for-tanzania-how-increased-crime-and-terrorism-threats-impact-tourists-in-popular-african-destinations/)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if the country of Tanzania has received a Level 3 [travel advisory](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/International-Travel-Country-Information-Pages/Tanzania.html) from the US Department of State before July 1, 2025.\n\n\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nAs of May 2, 2025, Tanzania holds a Level 2: Exercise Increased Caution travel advisory from the US State Department, last updated on September 9, 2024.

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
