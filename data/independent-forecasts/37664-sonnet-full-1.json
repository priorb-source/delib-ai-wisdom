  "information": "Anthropic's historical release cadence for major versions shows a lengthening gap: approximately 5 months between Claude 1 (March 2023) and Claude 2 (July 2023), and approximately 8 months between Claude 2 and Claude 3 (March 2024). Previous numbered Claude models have been made available to paid web users and via API within 48 hours of their announcement, without a public waitlist.\n\nAccording to reports from Cursor-IDE (May 15) and ZDNet (May 16), a next-generation Anthropic model codenamed 'Claude Neptune' completed its red-team testing phase on May 18.

In the past, Anthropic has used internal codenames that later became part of public branding, such as the codename 'Asimov' for the models released as the Claude 3 family.\n\nA February 2025 report from Sina Finance described plans for Claude 4 to be a hybrid model combining a general-purpose model with a reasoning model, which would allow users to adjust the computational resources used for a given task.

  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Approximately 6.5 weeks (until July 1, 2025)",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No - Claude 4 has not been released to the general public yet, and if nothing changes, it will not be available by July 1, 2025",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "The 'Claude Neptune' model completing red-team testing is released but branded as Claude 3.5 or retains the Neptune codename. Alternatively, technical issues or safety concerns delay any major release past July 1, or the release initially requires a waitlist period extending beyond the deadline.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Claude Neptune is officially released as 'Claude 4' in late May or early June 2025, made available to the general public via API and web interface within 48 hours of announcement without requiring a waitlist, consistent with Anthropic's historical release pattern.",
    "rationale": "This forecast faces significant uncertainty centered on naming conventions and release timing. The strongest evidence for a YES outcome comes from credible reports (Cursor-IDE, ZDNet) indicating a model codenamed 'Claude Neptune' completed red-team testing on May 18, 2025, with targeted general availability in late May or early June. This timeline provides comfortable margin before the July 1 deadline. Anthropic's historical pattern of making numbered Claude models available within 48 hours without waitlists supports rapid public access if released. However, critical uncertainty exists around whether Neptune will be branded as 'Claude 4'. The question explicitly requires both 'Claude' and '4' in the name. While past codenames like 'Asimov' became part of public branding (Claude 3 family), Anthropic could choose alternative naming like 'Claude 3.5' or maintain the Neptune designation. General tech publications describe Claude 4 as expected 'later in 2025' rather than May/June specifically, suggesting the near-term release might be a different product. Additionally, Anthropic's release cadence has lengthened (5 months, then 8 months between major versions), and only 2 months have passed since Claude 3 (March 2024), making another numbered release seem premature. The status quo is no release, and systems typically change slowly. This forecast would increase substantially (to 70-80%) with confirmation that Neptune will be called Claude 4, or with official Anthropic announcements of imminent Claude 4 release. It would decrease (to 25-35%) if Anthropic announces Neptune under a different name, or if they signal Claude 4 is planned for late 2025.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill Claude 4 be available to the general public before July 1, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nPromptLayer: [Everything we know: Claude 4](https://blog.promptlayer.com/claude-4/)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if a member of the general public can access Anthropic's Claude 4 model without first joining a waitlist or participating in an early access or testing phase. If Anthropic does not release Claude 4 before July 1, 2025, this question resolves as **No**.\n\nThe resolution will rely on [credible sources](https://www.metaculus.com/help/faq/#definitions), including that it may rely on the ability of Metaculus employees to access Claude 4. \"Access\" may be via API, the Anthropic website, or any other method that allows interaction with Claude 4. Models that do not include both \"Claude\" and \"4\" in the name will not be considered for resolution of this question.\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nAnthropic's historical release cadence for major versions shows a lengthening gap: approximately 5 months between Claude 1 (March 2023) and Claude 2 (July 2023), and approximately 8 months between Claude 2 and Claude 3 (March 2024).
