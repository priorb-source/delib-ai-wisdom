    "review": "Both forecasters largely mirror my base case: Berkshire’s multi-quarter net selling, record cash, and Buffett’s longstanding reservations about several Mag 7 names make a new, visible position unlikely. New/useful angles they emphasized: very low portfolio turnover, capital-intensity/valuation framing, and the practical impact of confidential treatment (even if they were buying, it might not show). Forecaster 3’s slight uptick (17%) leans on the autonomy of Todd/Ted and the fit of Alphabet/Meta; that’s the most credible path to Yes. Neither provided concrete, new signals (e.g., leaks or meeting hints). I find their reasoning sound and consistent with my priors; nothing here meaningfully raises the odds.",
    "rationale": "Time to resolution: ~8 days (13F due by May 15). Status quo outcome: No. Key points unchanged: (1) Track record—no reported Mag 7 adds beyond Apple/Amazon; (2) posture—net seller, record cash, high selectivity; (3) specific reservations—MSFT optics, Tesla skepticism, Nvidia valuation/AI caution, and past behavior (e.g., TSMC exit) all weigh against new positions; (4) process—if accumulating, confidential treatment could still mask it, resolving No. Counterpoint: Todd/Ted could start a small Alphabet or Meta stake; among the five, those best fit Berkshire’s framework. However, much of the notable Mag 7 weakness occurred in April (after Q1), reducing the likelihood that attractive Q1 entry points drove an initiation that would appear in this filing. With no credible reporting or meeting-era hints of ownership, I keep my prior. No change from 10%.",
