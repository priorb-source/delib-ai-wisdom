  "information": "On May 2, 2025, President Trump signed an executive order to stop all federal funding for National Public Radio (NPR) and the Public Broadcasting Service (PBS). The order directs the Corporation for Public Broadcasting (CPB) Board of Directors and all executive departments and agencies to cease federal financial support. The order requires the CPB Board to ensure its licensees and permittees do not use Federal funds for NPR and PBS. The White House stated the action was taken because the networks allegedly spread 'radical propaganda.' As of May 16, 2025, the Project 2025 Tracker still listed the objective as 'in progress.'\n\nThe Corporation for Public Broadcasting (CPB) has filed a lawsuit challenging the executive order, asserting that it is a private nonprofit corporation independent of federal executive control and not subject to the President's authority. The CPB's funding is allocated by Congress two years in advance; it has received $535 million for the current fiscal year, which provides funding through September 30, 2027. Following the executive order, the CPB notified affiliated stations that funding could be halted but simultaneously announced its legal challenge.\n\nThe executive action has prompted debate in Congress. Some Republican senators, including Lisa Murkowski of Alaska, have expressed support for public media, citing the importance of local programming and emergency alerts in rural communities. Federal funding is considered crucial for many local stations, with some receiving up to 25% of their annual revenues from the federal government. According to their respective CEOs, about 15% of the public network's budget comes from public funds for PBS, while NPR receives less than 5% of its budget from the CPB.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "About one and a half months, until July 1, 2025.",
    "status_quo_outcome": "The objective's status is 'in progress' in the tracker. If this does not change by the deadline, the question will resolve as No.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "The legal challenge filed by the Corporation for Public Broadcasting (CPB) against the executive order remains unresolved by the deadline. Due to the ongoing litigation and the fact that funding has not definitively ceased, the maintainers of the tracker leave the objective's status as 'in progress' past July 1, 2025.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "A court quickly rules in favor of the administration's executive order, or the CPB withdraws its lawsuit. In response to this decisive development, the tracker's maintainers update the objective's status to 'complete' before July 1, 2025.",
    "rationale": "My forecast is based on the significant legal and procedural hurdles that must be overcome for the objective to be marked 'complete' within the short, 45-day timeframe. The status quo is that the tracker shows 'in progress,' and this is the most likely outcome to persist. The key factor is the lawsuit filed by the Corporation for Public Broadcasting (CPB). Such legal battles, particularly those involving questions of executive authority over independent entities, are rarely resolved in a matter of weeks. The funding mechanism, with appropriations made two years in advance, further complicates the immediate and definitive cessation of funds, providing the CPB with a strong basis for its legal challenge. The community-run tracker is likely to adopt a cautious approach, waiting for the legal dust to settle before declaring the policy fully implemented. The probability is not lower than 15% because there remains a non-zero chance of a swift and unexpected legal victory for the administration or that the tracker's maintainers might decide the executive order alone is sufficient to mark the objective 'complete.' The probability is not higher because the inertia of the legal system and the active, credible resistance from the CPB make it highly improbable that the situation will be definitively resolved in favor of the administration before the July 1 deadline. My forecast would increase if the CPB's lawsuit is dismissed or withdrawn. Conversely, it would decrease if a court grants a preliminary injunction blocking the executive order.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill the Project 2025 Tracker spreadsheet have the objective of stopping funding for NPR and PBS marked as complete before July 1, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nAt the time of this question, the objective was marked as \"in progress.\" The 2025 Tracker is a project of the Keep_Track subreddit and is explained [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/Keep_Track/comments/1ii7tbr/project_2025_tracker_is_now_live/).\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if the Project 2025 objective to \"stop funding for NPR and PBS\" is marked as complete according to [this spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1QGG6wNHna-1tt91yXNkOauAJJ7snobFjfEnmxlmzhl4/edit?gid=0#gid=0) before July 1, 2025.

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
