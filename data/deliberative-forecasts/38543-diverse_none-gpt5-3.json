    "review": "Both forecasters emphasize the extremely tight timeline, the necessity of advance planning and public signaling for a presidential China visit, and the improbability of a secret trip. Forecaster 2 also notes the lack of flight-tracking chatter; Forecaster 3 underlines that absent a crisis, emergency summits of this sort are rare. I find their reasoning consistent with my own, and their stress on secrecy implausibility and daily decay in odds is persuasive. The only minor quibble is Forecaster 2’s framing of Trump as a private citizen; given the resolution text refers to “President Donald Trump,” the presidential travel protocols are the relevant benchmark—making a sudden unannounced China visit even less likely.",
    "rationale": "Time remaining is ~16 days. There are no credible announcements, leaks, or signs of an advance team; no suitable multilateral in China to serve as a natural anchor; and White House/MFA protocols typically provide lead time and media guidance for presidential travel. Secret presidential trips are reserved for war zones, not Beijing, and would be diplomatically counterproductive here. While a rapid breakthrough or crisis-driven summit is not impossible, it would almost certainly generate signals shortly beforehand. Given the continued signal vacuum, I edge my estimate down slightly from 2% to 1%. I would adjust up only with authoritative announcements or strong, corroborated reporting of imminent travel.",
