    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "The event window closes on July 1, 2025, which is in approximately 5 weeks. The final outcome will be known on or after that date.",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No. Neither Donald Trump nor Elon Musk have ever tweeted the exact phrase 'diversity visa'. The status quo is for them to not tweet this phrase.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "The period until July 1, 2025, passes without any major news or social media trends related to the Diversity Visa program that would be prominent enough to elicit a comment from either Donald Trump or Elon Musk. They continue to tweet about other political and business topics, and if they mention immigration, they do not use this specific phrase.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "A news story, political event, or crime involving a Diversity Visa recipient becomes a major topic of discussion on X (Twitter). In an effort to comment on immigration policy or attack political opponents, either Donald Trump quote-tweets a news article containing the phrase or Elon Musk replies to a viral post about the topic, using the exact words 'diversity visa' in their post.",
    "rationale": "My forecast is based on the strong historical precedent balanced against the volatile nature of the individuals in question and the short remaining time frame. The primary factor supporting a 'No' outcome is the base rate: neither Donald Trump nor Elon Musk has ever used the exact phrase 'diversity visa' in a tweet, according to the provided search parameters. Donald Trump has referred to the program as the 'Diversity Visa Lottery Program' in the past, indicating a preference for different terminology. This historical consistency is a strong predictor. The status quo is that this specific topic and phrasing is not part of their regular discourse. The primary factor supporting a 'Yes' outcome is the low barrier to action. Both individuals are prolific and often unpredictable tweeters on political topics. Immigration is a key issue, especially for Donald Trump's campaign. A significant news event could easily trigger a response. The background information notes Elon Musk follows an account that recently tweeted on the topic, suggesting it is within his information ecosystem. However, the requirement for the *exact wording* is a significant filter that dramatically lowers the probability. A tweet about the 'visa lottery,' for example, would not count. My forecast of 5% is low because the status quo and specific phrasing requirement make a 'No' outcome highly likely. It is not lower because the ~5 week window still allows time for a random catalyst, and the unpredictable, high-volume tweeting habits of both individuals create a non-zero chance of this specific event occurring. I would raise my forecast if a major news story specifically about the 'diversity visa' were to break, or if there were a significant public debate on the topic using this phrasing.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill Donald Trump or Elon Musk tweet (X post) about the Diversity Visa before April 1, 2025\n\nQuestion background:\n[Federal judge’s order leaves many visa lottery winners out of luck](https://www.siliconvalley.com/2020/10/01/judges-order-leaves-many-visa-lottery-winners-out-of-luck/) | Recent tweet [here](https://x.com/fentasyl/status/1894451029934039492) from a Twitter/X account followed by Elon Musk.\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if, before July 1, 2025 either Donald Trump or Elon Musk tweet using the exact words \"diversity visa\" as shown through [this search](https://x.com/search?f=top&q=%22diversity%20visa%22%20(from%3Arealdonaldtrump%20OR%20from%3Aelonmusk)&src=typed_query) on Twitter/X, which will be checked by Metaculus on or after July 1, 2025. If a tweet (now renamed to X post) containing the phrase is seen by a Metaculus Admin at that time, this question resolves as **Yes**. If not, it resolves as **No**.\n\n\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nNo additional information available.\n\nToday is 2025-05-22.\n\nBefore answering you think:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n(e) You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
