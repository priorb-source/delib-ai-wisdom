    "review": "The other forecasters introduced several key points I had not fully weighed. Forecaster 2's analysis was particularly impactful, highlighting Dan Osborn's own statement that he would 'decide by early summer' and the historical precedent of his 2024 campaign announcement in July, approximately 16 months before the election. These are strong, specific pieces of evidence that suggest a timeline extending beyond the June 1, 2025 deadline. Forecaster 3 provided a compelling counterargument, noting that Osborn is not a typical first-time challenger. He has existing name recognition, a proven fundraising base from his 2024 run, and, as an independent, is not constrained by a primary calendar, which could incentivize an early general election-style launch. Both analyses were convincing and added valuable context to my initial reasoning.",
    "rationale": "I am lowering my forecast from 40% to 33%. The evidence presented by Forecaster 2, particularly Osborn's own stated timeline of deciding by 'early summer' and the precedent from his 2024 campaign announcement timeline, significantly strengthens the case for a 'No' resolution. The phrase 'early summer' is ambiguous but more commonly points to June rather than May, and past behavior is often a good indicator of future actions. This new information makes an announcement before June 1 less likely than I had initially assessed. However, I am not lowering my forecast as far as Forecaster 2's 28%. Forecaster 3's points are a crucial moderator. Osborn's strong 2024 performance, existing fundraising network, and the strategic logic for an early launch as an independent candidate provide a credible path to a 'Yes' resolution. He is better positioned to make a quick decision than a candidate starting from scratch. My updated forecast of 33% reflects a synthesis of these views, weighing the specific evidence for a later announcement more heavily while still acknowledging the factors that could accelerate Osborn's timeline.",
