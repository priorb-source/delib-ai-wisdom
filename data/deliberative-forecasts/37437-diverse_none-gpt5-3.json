    "review": "Both forecasters convincingly emphasize the short time window, the extreme logistical complexity and observability of any PLA ground operation, and the massive economic and geopolitical costs that deter Beijing—points I agree with. They also note tail risks from miscalculation or sudden political shocks, which I already factor in. Useful additions from them include triggers like dramatic state-preparation rhetoric or a Taiwan independence move; however, neither offers evidence of such developments now. A key element they do not engage with is the resolution wording: it requires a U.S. public accusation of a ground invasion specifically involving PLA ground forces. Many plausible escalations (missile strikes, blockade, coast guard/seizure tactics) would not satisfy this, and even a limited landing on an offshore islet could prompt deliberately calibrated U.S. language that avoids the word “invasion,” further lowering the chance of resolving Yes. On balance, their arguments reinforce my low prior but do not introduce new evidence to raise it.",
    "rationale": "My baseline already weighted (1) the stringent resolution criterion (U.S. public accusation; ground forces), (2) the short horizon (~8 weeks), and (3) the absence of observable invasion indicators (large-scale amphibious mobilization, civilian Ro-Ro requisition, medical/fuel stockpiles, elevated coastal alerts). Forecasters 2 and 3 strengthen the deterrence/logistics case but do not supply new indicators or address the linguistic hurdle and the islets nuance. Given that many likely escalations would not meet the ground-forces threshold and that Washington may avoid the term “invasion” for limited seizures, my forecast remains very low. I would move higher only with clear signs of imminent PLA landing preparations or credible public warnings from U.S./Taiwan officials. I would move lower with continued routine exercises and explicit de-escalation. No such updates are present, so I do not change my forecast.",
