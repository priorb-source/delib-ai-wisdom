    "review": "My initial forecast of 45% was anchored in the general principle that diplomatic processes are slow and that a one-month window is very short. Forecasters 2 and 3 presented a compelling counterargument that I had not sufficiently weighted: a major public initiative, like the one from France and the UK, creates its own urgent momentum. Their reasoning that such an announcement implies a strategy to secure a quick follow-on action to demonstrate success and capitalize on the political moment is highly persuasive. Forecaster 3's point that the initiative provides 'political cover' for smaller nations, thereby lowering their risk and accelerating their timeline, was particularly insightful. They correctly argued that this event fundamentally disrupts the status quo, making a near-term recognition more likely than not. I found their analyses convincing because they focused on the specific strategic implications of the new information, whereas I had remained too attached to a general baseline of diplomatic inertia.",
    "rationale": "After reviewing the other experts' analyses, I am updating my forecast upwards. My initial assessment at 45% under-weighted the immediate catalytic effect of the joint France-UK initiative. The core argument from both other forecasters, which I now find more compelling than my own, is that such a high-profile announcement is not just a statement of intent but a strategic move designed to force action and maintain momentum. For the initiative to be seen as credible, it needs a near-term result. The month immediately following the announcement, June, is the most logical window for a smaller, aligned country (e.g., Belgium, Slovenia, Malta) to act, capitalizing on the political cover provided by the two larger powers.\n\nWhile the risks I initially identified—potential US pushback and internal political delays—remain valid, the other forecasters have convinced me that the pro-recognition momentum created by the Franco-British announcement is now the stronger force. The 'path of least resistance' for several European countries has indeed shifted. Therefore, I believe the probability of a new recognition in June is now greater than 50%.\n\nI am increasing my forecast from 45% to 60%. This substantial increase reflects my shift in perspective, acknowledging that a 'Yes' outcome is now the more likely scenario. I am not going as high as 65-70% because I maintain that a one-month delay due to unforeseen diplomatic friction or a concerted effort by the US to slow the process remains a significant possibility. However, the deliberative process has convinced me that my initial forecast was too cautious.",
