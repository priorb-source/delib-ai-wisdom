    "review": "Both forecasters make compelling mathematical arguments that I largely agree with. Forecaster 2's calculation showing a required 11-fold slowdown to miss the threshold is particularly striking. Forecaster 3's observation that even 0.3 objectives/day (less than half the recent rate) would reach 119 - just barely missing - effectively demonstrates how favorably the math tilts toward Yes. \n\nHowever, I notice an important nuance: Forecaster 3 correctly notes there are 46 days remaining from today (May 16), while Forecaster 2 uses 76 days from the last data point (April 16). This 30-day data gap is crucial uncertainty that both acknowledge but may not fully weight. We don't know if progress continued, stalled, or even accelerated during this period.\n\nAll three of us converged on the same key points: strong mathematical trajectory, meaningful pipeline of in-progress objectives, and risk of slowdown from easier objectives being completed first. The main difference is how much weight to give the data gap versus the mathematical momentum. Forecaster 2's 89% and Forecaster 3's 85% bracket my 80%, suggesting my caution may be slightly excessive given how strongly the fundamentals favor Yes.",
    "rationale": "Upon reflection, the other forecasters' analyses strengthen the case for Yes more than I initially credited. The key insight is that even very conservative extrapolations (0.3-0.5 objectives/day) nearly or comfortably reach 120, while the recent observed rate was 0.625/day. This means multiple independent slowdown scenarios still result in Yes.\n\nHowever, I maintain some additional caution for the 30-day data gap. During May 2025, several factors could have impacted progress: political developments, legal challenges, administrative changes, or tracker methodology adjustments. The gap represents nearly 40% of the remaining time window, creating meaningful uncertainty about current status.\n\nBalancing the strong mathematical case (which now seems even stronger after deliberation) against the real uncertainty from missing recent data, I'm updating modestly upward from 80% to 84%. This reflects greater confidence in the Yes outcome while maintaining appropriate epistemic humility about what occurred during the data blackout period. The math is compelling enough that I should be more confident than 80%, but not so overwhelming that the data gap becomes irrelevant.",
