  "information": "Airlines increased their capacity to the Canary Islands for spring 2025. Jet2.com announced it would offer 1.6 million seats for the summer season, an 8% increase from 2024, with new routes from Bournemouth and London-Luton starting in April. Vueling offered over 145,000 seats to and from the islands for the Easter period, a 10% increase from the previous year. Air Nostrum increased its seat offerings by 7% for the same period. Binter also launched new routes from Córdoba to Gran Canaria starting in mid-April 2025.\n\nPassenger arrival data for the Canary Islands showed year-over-year growth in the first quarter of 2025. AENA reported that traffic in the Canary Islands grew by 3.6% in Q1 2025 compared to Q1 2024. Monthly data showed a 2.2% increase in February and another 2.2% increase in March compared to the same months in 2024. The Easter holiday period in 2025 fell entirely within April, whereas in 2024, it was in late March.\n\nOn April 28, 2025, a massive power outage occurred on the Iberian Peninsula, affecting mainland Spain and Portugal. While the Canary Islands' power grid was not directly hit, the event caused significant disruptions to air travel. Reports indicated that air traffic at major hubs was operating at reduced capacity, leading to widespread flight delays and cancellations. Canary Islands airports experienced knock-on effects, with numerous flights connecting to the mainland being cancelled or delayed. One government official stated that 344 out of 6,000 scheduled flights in Spain were cancelled on that day.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Approximately 1 month. The April 2025 passenger arrival data is expected to be published in early June 2025.",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No - arrivals do not fall. Based on recent trends showing consistent growth in Q1 2025 (up 3.6% year-over-year, with February and March each up 2.2%), the status quo suggests continued growth rather than decline.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Airlines operate at their significantly increased capacity levels throughout April, with Jet2.com's 8% capacity increase, Vueling's 10% increase, and Air Nostrum's 7% increase materializing as planned. The favorable Easter timing (falling entirely within April 2025 versus late March 2024) provides a structural boost to April 2025 numbers. The April 28 power outage causes one day of disruption but doesn't significantly impact the monthly total. April 2025 arrivals equal or exceed April 2024 levels.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "The April 28 power outage causes more extensive and lasting disruptions than initially reported, with cascading cancellations and delays extending beyond the single day. Trump's tariff policies significantly reduce US tourist arrivals in ways not yet visible in the data. These combined factors, occurring in the final days of the month when Easter travel typically peaks, lead to April 2025 falling below April 2024 despite increased airline capacity.",
    "rationale": "The evidence strongly favors continued growth. Three key structural factors support this: (1) Airlines substantially increased capacity - Jet2.com by 8%, Vueling by 10%, Air Nostrum by 7%, with new routes launching in April; (2) Easter timing is highly favorable, falling entirely in April 2025 (April 20) versus late March 2024 (March 31), which should shift significant holiday travel into the comparison month; (3) The established growth trend shows Q1 2025 up 3.6% with February and March each up 2.2% year-over-year. The April 28 power outage represents a risk, but with 344 cancellations out of 6,000 scheduled flights across all of Spain on a single day (approximately 5.7% of one day), this equates to roughly 0.2% of the month's total traffic even assuming Canary Islands were proportionally affected. The mention of Trump's tariffs affecting US tourism is concerning but US visitors represent a smaller portion of Canary Islands tourism compared to European markets, and there's no concrete evidence yet of realized impact in the data. My forecast is not higher because: (1) the power outage did occur and could have unquantified knock-on effects; (2) it's possible capacity increases didn't fully convert to passengers; (3) unforeseen factors in the final two days of April could matter. My forecast is not lower because the fundamental trends, structural factors, and timing all point strongly toward growth, and one day's disruption is unlikely to overcome these advantages. To update higher toward NO, I'd need confirmation the power outage was isolated to one day with full recovery. To update toward YES, I'd need evidence of multi-day cascading disruptions or data showing US arrivals collapsed significantly.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill inbound airline passenger arrivals to the Canary Islands fall in April 2025 compared with April 2024?\n\nQuestion background:\n[Canarias braces for the consequences of Trump's policies on tourism, potentially leading to a decline in tourist arrivals from the US](https://diariodeavisos.elespanol.com/2025/04/turismo-aranceles/)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if the total number of passenger arrivals to the Canary Islands for the month of April 2025, as presented at the [Canary Islands Tourism Research site](https://investigacion.turismodeislascanarias.com/en/inbound-tourism-arrival-passengers/monthly-data), is lower than the total number for April 2024. If the number for April 2025 is greater than or equal to the number for April 2024, the question resolves as **No**.\n\nSpecifically, Metaculus will access \"Passenger arrivals (AENA). April 2025,\" which is expected to be posted in the beginning of June 2025. The numbers considered will be the monthly totals under Canary Islands. For example, in the [February 2025 report](https://investigacion.turismodeislascanarias.com/sites/default/files/2025-03/Promotur_AENA_febrero%202025_EN.pdf), the number shown for February 2025 is 2,248,198 and the number shown for February 2024 is 2,199,255. Thus, if the question had been comparing February 2025 with February 2024, it would have resolved as No, because the number went up.\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nAirlines increased their capacity to the Canary Islands for spring 2025.
