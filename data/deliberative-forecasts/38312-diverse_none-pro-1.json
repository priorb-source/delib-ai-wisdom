    "review": "All three forecasters correctly identify the central issue: the severe diplomatic strain between the host nation, Canada, and India. We all agree that the lack of an invitation at this late stage, especially while other non-G7 nations have been invited, is the single most important piece of negative evidence. Forecaster 2's analysis closely mirrored my own. Forecaster 3, however, introduced a crucial point that I had underweighted: the practical, logistical, and security complexities of arranging a last-minute, high-level Prime Ministerial visit. This practical friction significantly reduces the probability of a 'Yes' outcome, even if a late diplomatic breakthrough were to occur. Their reasoning that the current status quo is 'no invitation has been extended' is a more accurate framing than focusing on past attendance records. This makes their lower forecast of 7% very compelling.",
    "rationale": "My initial forecast was 20%. After reviewing the other analyses, I am lowering my forecast. The argument raised by Forecaster 3 regarding the significant lead time required for logistics and security for a head-of-state visit is a practical constraint that I had not sufficiently considered. This makes a last-minute invitation, while diplomatically possible, far more difficult to execute in reality. The window for a 'Yes' outcome is therefore even smaller than I first assessed. The current diplomatic standoff combined with these logistical hurdles makes non-attendance the very likely outcome. I am lowering my probability from 20% to 12%. I am not going as low as Forecaster 3's 7% because I maintain a slightly stronger belief in the possibility that other G7 members, particularly the U.S., could exert significant back-channel pressure on Canada to secure India's presence due to its geopolitical importance, potentially forcing a logistically challenging but still possible late arrangement.",
