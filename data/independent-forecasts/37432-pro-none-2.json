    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Less than 2 months. The question resolves on July 1, 2025. The current date is May 5, 2025.",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No. Ohio does not enact legislation expanding its verification requirements of a voter's citizenship, and the current laws remain unchanged.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "The Ohio General Assembly is preoccupied with passing the state's biennial operating budget, which has a constitutional deadline of June 30. This major legislative priority consumes all available time and political capital, leaving no room for a separate, controversial bill on voter verification to pass both chambers before the July 1 deadline.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Capitalizing on their supermajority, Republican leadership attaches the voter citizenship verification language as an amendment to the must-pass biennial budget bill. This allows the provision to bypass the traditional committee process and get enacted along with the budget just before the June 30 deadline.",
    "rationale": "My forecast is primarily driven by the extremely short timeline and the legislative calendar. The deadline for this question is July 1, 2025, which is less than two months away. This period, from May to late June, is dominated by one of the Ohio General Assembly's most critical and time-consuming constitutional duties: passing the state's two-year operating budget. The budget must be enacted by June 30, and it typically consumes the vast majority of legislative attention and floor time, making it very difficult for other significant, standalone legislation to navigate the full process in both chambers.\n\nWhile the Republican party holds a trifecta (control of the House, Senate, and Governorship) and has publicly stated its interest in this type of legislation, the procedural hurdles posed by the budget process represent a major obstacle. For a new bill to be introduced, go through committee hearings, and pass votes in both the House and Senate in this compressed, budget-focused window is highly improbable. The status quo, where no such legislation is passed, is the most likely outcome due to legislative inertia and competing priorities.\n\nMy probability is not lower than 10% because there is a plausible, albeit narrow, path to a 'Yes' outcome. The Republican majority could attempt to attach the citizenship verification requirements as a last-minute amendment to the must-pass budget bill. This procedural maneuver would bypass the need for a separate legislative track. Given the party's stated interest in election integrity issues, this remains a possibility.\n\nMy probability is not higher than 10% because attaching controversial, non-fiscal policy to the budget is politically risky. It can complicate negotiations, create dissent within the majority caucus, and threaten the timely passage of the entire budget, something legislative leadership typically seeks to avoid.\n\nI would increase my forecast if I saw credible reports that GOP leadership was planning to add this as an amendment to the budget or was otherwise fast-tracking a standalone bill. I would decrease my forecast if legislative leaders publicly state that this issue will be addressed after the budget recess.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nBefore July 1, 2025, will Ohio enact legislation expanding its verification requirements of a voter's citizenship?\n\nQuestion background:\nThe Ohio Senate: [Gavarone, Brenner Introduce Bill to Require Proof of Citizenship to Vote](https://ohiosenate.gov/members/theresa-gavarone/news/gavarone-brenner-introduce-bill-to-require-proof-of-citizenship-to-vote)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if, before July 1, 2025, the state of Ohio enacts legislation requiring voters to provide proof of US citizenship beyond the requirements at the time of this question, according to [credible sources](https://www.metaculus.com/faq/#definitions).\n\nAny subset of voters being required to provide such proof would count (for example if it only applied to first-time voter registrants or creating a new requirement for mail-in voters). An example of a bill that would count is [Senate Bill 153](https://www.legislature.ohio.gov/legislation/136/sb153). This question resolves upon enactment; therefore other questions such as when the legislation takes effect or whether it survives court challenges and is implemented is immaterial to this question's resolution. Please note that under Ohio law, a bill is considered enacted \"after both houses have passed and agreed on identical bills.\" ([Source](https://www.lsc.ohio.gov/assets/organizations/legislative-service-commission/files/chapter-5-enacting-legislation-10021971.pdf))\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nNo additional information available.\n\nToday is 2025-05-05.\n\nBefore answering you think:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n(e) You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
