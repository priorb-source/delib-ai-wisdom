    "review": "Both forecasters raised useful uncertainties I hadn’t explicitly weighed: possible 2025 boundary changes and the distribution/coverage of candidates (esp. Reform, Greens, Lib Dems). Forecaster 2 also anchored on Labour’s 2024 GE strength in Northampton North/South, which is a credible signal that Labour can dominate the town. Forecaster 3 highlighted Reform’s potential to split the right, but also the common pattern that in mixed urban–rural unitaries the Conservatives often remain the largest party even when losing control. I don’t find the boundary-change point decisive without confirmation; absent evidence, I won’t assume a Northampton-weighting shift. On Reform, my base case remains sparse local coverage, limiting their impact. The core disagreement is about whether a strong Labour sweep in Northampton is sufficient to overcome the large Conservative rural block. My seat arithmetic and structural read align more with Forecaster 3: Labour likely gains heavily in the town, but converting that into a council-wide plurality requires unusually deep rural inroads and limited fragmentation, both uncertain.",
    "rationale": "Status quo still matters: the Conservatives start from a large 2021 cushion and strong rural/suburban geography in Daventry and South Northants. Even with a hostile national environment for the Conservatives and likely Labour strength in Northampton, Labour becoming the largest group requires (a) sweeping most Northampton multi-member wards and (b) also making nontrivial gains beyond the town while avoiding heavy opposition vote-splitting. That’s plausible but not my base case. I explicitly considered the new arguments: 2024 GE results bolster Labour in Northampton; potential boundary changes could tilt the map if they increase urban weight, but we lack confirmation; Reform’s local presence could split the right but is likely limited by candidate coverage. Net, these points do not meaningfully erode the structural edge that often leaves Conservatives as largest in mixed urban–rural unitaries. Given this, I make a small upward tweak after revisiting seat arithmetic and alignment with F3’s framing. I’d move down if we learned of boundary changes favoring Northampton, comprehensive Reform slates in rural wards, or credible local polling/canvass showing Labour sweeping the town plus notable rural gains. I’d move up with evidence of fragmented opposition in town wards or incomplete Labour/Green/Lib Dem coverage.",
