    "review": "Both forecasters make compelling arguments that strengthen the case for exceeding 400 reports. Forecaster 3's daily rate breakdown is particularly insightful - the current ~17 reports/day vs the needed ~13.3/day provides a concrete 30% cushion that makes the margin clearer. The seasonality argument is also important: June is a summer month when outdoor activity and clear skies typically increase sightings, which I hadn't explicitly weighted. This is a positive factor that works in favor of the 'Yes' outcome. Forecaster 3's point about 16+ consecutive months at ≥450 further emphasizes the remarkable consistency of the trend. Both forecasters also appropriately note the operational risks (NUFORC technical issues, methodology changes) that prevent near-certainty. The convergence of all three forecasts in the 87-92% range suggests we've identified the right considerations and are calibrating similarly. The main substantive new insight for me is the seasonality factor combined with the concrete daily rate cushion.",
    "rationale": "Upon reflection, the seasonality argument merits more weight than I initially gave it. June being a summer month likely supports higher rather than baseline reporting due to increased outdoor activity and better viewing conditions. Combined with Forecaster 3's daily rate analysis showing a 30% cushion above the threshold requirement, the margin of safety is more robust than my initial assessment suggested. The 16+ month streak at ≥450 reports demonstrates extraordinary consistency. However, I maintain modest caution due to: (1) single-source dependency on NUFORC creates concentrated operational risk, (2) approximately 5 weeks remain until the outcome, introducing time-related uncertainty, and (3) while the 2025 data is strong, we're extrapolating from only 4 months. The seasonality boost and concrete cushion analysis warrant an upward adjustment, but not to the full 92% given remaining operational uncertainties and the forecast horizon.",
