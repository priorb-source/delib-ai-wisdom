  "information": "On May 6, 2025, Ramzan Kadyrov publicly stated that he was asking to be relieved of his duties, expressing a hope that his request would be supported to allow for new leadership in the region. He subsequently clarified on his Telegram channel that the final decision rests solely with Russian President Vladimir Putin, stating, \"I do not decide whether I will remain as the head of the Chechen Republic or not.\" By May 12, Kadyrov again addressed the rumors, attributing his recent serious demeanor not to a potential resignation, but to the ongoing special military operation in Ukraine, in which he said 11,000 Chechen troops were involved.\n\nMultiple media outlets, including Novaya Gazeta Europe, The Insider, and the Kyiv Independent, have reported on Kadyrov's deteriorating health, with some specifying conditions such as pancreatic necrosis and kidney problems. In parallel, reports indicate Kadyrov is engaged in succession planning. He has promoted his 17-year-old son, Adam Kadyrov, to several high-ranking positions, including secretary of the republic's security council and head of his own security department. Kadyrov's 26-year-old daughter, Aishat, also holds the position of vice-president of the Chechen government.\n\nRamzan Kadyrov met with Russian President Vladimir Putin on May 7, 2025. Following the meeting, Kadyrov stated he received \"full understanding and support,\" and Russian state media reported that Putin praised the Chechen Republic's achievements. This is not the first time Kadyrov has publicly discussed stepping down; similar statements were made in 2016, 2020, and 2022, none of which resulted in his departure. The authority to appoint or dismiss the Head of the Chechen Republic rests exclusively with the President of Russia. Kadyrov has held the position since April 2007.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Approximately 20 days, from May 12, 2025 to June 1, 2025",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No - Kadyrov remains head of the Chechen Republic",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Kadyrov continues in his role despite his public statements about wanting to step down. Putin either does not act on the resignation request or explicitly asks Kadyrov to remain in his position, similar to what happened with previous resignation statements in 2016, 2020, and 2022. Kadyrov's health concerns are managed or exaggerated, and the succession planning with his son is simply dynasty-building rather than immediate transition preparation.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Putin accepts Kadyrov's resignation request and quickly appoints a successor before June 1. This could be driven by Kadyrov's genuinely deteriorating health reaching a critical point, or by Putin deciding this is an opportune moment to transition leadership while maintaining control through Kadyrov's son Adam or another loyalist. The transition happens rapidly given Putin's sole authority over the appointment.",
    "rationale": "The base rate strongly favors the status quo. Kadyrov has made similar public statements about stepping down at least three times before (2016, 2020, 2022) without any actual resignation occurring, suggesting a pattern of political theater rather than genuine intent. Following his May 6 statement, Putin's response at their May 7 meeting was supportive praise rather than acceptance of resignation. By May 12, Kadyrov himself was already walking back the resignation narrative, attributing his demeanor to Ukraine war concerns rather than departure plans. The extremely short 20-day timeframe is a critical constraint. Leadership transitions in a strategically important region like Chechnya, especially during wartime when Chechnya is contributing 11,000 troops to the Ukraine operation, would typically require more time and planning. Russia generally prioritizes regional stability during conflict. However, several factors prevent me from going lower: the reported health issues (pancreatic necrosis, kidney problems) appear more specific and serious than in previous instances; the succession planning with his 17-year-old son Adam being promoted to multiple high-ranking positions is more concrete than before; and Putin does have sole authority to act quickly if he chose to. What would move my forecast higher: specific reports of Putin accepting the resignation, official announcements of succession, or Kadyrov being hospitalized. What would move it lower: Putin explicitly asking Kadyrov to stay, formal retraction of the resignation request, or simply time passing without action. Given the strong historical precedent, Putin's supportive response, wartime context, and extremely short timeframe, the probability remains heavily weighted toward Kadyrov maintaining his position.",
