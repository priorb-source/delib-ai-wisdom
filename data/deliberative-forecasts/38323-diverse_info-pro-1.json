    "review": "The other two forecasters provide valuable context on macroeconomic factors, such as the historically low nature of a sub-60 reading (Forecaster 2) and diverging signals from the Conference Board index (Forecaster 3). However, both of their analyses appear to be based on a critical misunderstanding of the provided data. They reason as if the May 2025 consumer sentiment reading was in the high 50s or even 'clearly above 60' (Forecaster 3). The research material explicitly states the final May 2025 reading was 52.2. This factual discrepancy invalidates the core of their high-probability forecasts; their reasoning that sentiment would have to deteriorate to fall below 60 is the inverse of the actual situation. The reality is that sentiment must improve by a historically rare margin to climb above 60.",
    "rationale": "I am updating my forecast upward, but only moderately. My initial 10% forecast was anchored heavily on the fact that the May 2025 final reading was 52.2, meaning the index would need to jump by nearly 8 points in a single month to resolve as 'Yes'. Historical data shows such a large increase is a very low probability event (under 3%). This core reasoning remains sound. However, the other forecasters introduced valid points I had not fully weighed. Specifically, Forecaster 3's mention of the sharply rising Conference Board confidence index is a significant piece of counter-evidence. This divergence suggests the weakness in the Michigan survey may be less entrenched and more susceptible to a sharp rebound if key data, like the upcoming CPI and jobs reports, come in favorably. This provides a more plausible narrative for a 'Yes' outcome than I had initially envisioned. Therefore, I am increasing my probability from 10% to 20%. I am not moving higher because the other forecasters' analyses are based on a flawed premise, and the 8-point leap required from a 52.2 starting point remains a statistically formidable challenge, especially with the high inflation expectations that continue to weigh on consumers.",
