    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Approximately 6 months. The latest possible date for the election is October 20, 2025.",
    "status_quo_outcome": "The Conservative Party wins the popular vote. They have held a consistent and significant lead in national polls for over a year.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "The incumbent Liberal Party successfully narrows the polling gap in the run-up to the election. This could be triggered by a major policy success, a series of gaffes from the Conservative campaign, or a shift in voter focus towards social issues where Liberals are traditionally stronger. A late surge by the NDP could also split the vote in unpredictable ways, resulting in the Liberals narrowly winning the popular vote.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "The Conservative Party's campaign successfully capitalizes on voter fatigue and persistent concerns about the cost of living and housing. They maintain their substantial polling lead throughout the campaign period, converting it into a clear popular vote victory on election day.",
    "rationale": "My forecast is primarily based on the Conservative Party's persistent, double-digit lead in national polling averages, a trend corroborated by the provided Politico article. In politics, such a durable lead this close to a mandated election is a strong predictor of the outcome. The status quo, which I weight heavily, points clearly to a Conservative victory. Key issues for voters, such as inflation and housing affordability, are areas of perceived weakness for the incumbent Liberal government, and Conservative leader Pierre Poilievre has effectively framed his party as the solution.\n\nMy research assistant's report indicated no additional information was available, so my forecast relies on publicly available data and historical precedents.\n\nThe probability is not higher than 85% because approximately six months remain until the election. This is sufficient time for a major political shift. Events such as a significant foreign policy crisis, a major scandal affecting the Conservatives, or an unexpectedly strong Liberal campaign could erode the current Conservative lead. Negative campaigning against the Conservative leader has not yet reached its peak and could prove effective in swaying undecided voters.\n\nConversely, the probability is not lower than 85%. The scale of the Liberal Party's polling deficit is substantial and would require a historic comeback to overcome. The underlying drivers of voter discontent—namely economic anxiety and a desire for change after nearly a decade of Liberal governance—are deep-seated and unlikely to dissipate quickly.\n\nI would update my forecast upwards if the Conservative polling lead expands further or if a significant scandal damages the Liberal Party. I would update downwards if multiple pollsters show a consistent trend of the gap narrowing to single digits or if a major unforced error from the Conservative campaign alters public perception.",

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
