    "review": "My initial forecast of 15% was anchored on the principle of status quo inertia over a short timeframe, balanced against the plausible risk of rapid deterioration. The other forecasters introduced two crucial points I had not fully weighted. Forecaster 2 provided a quantitative base rate, noting that only 6-13% of Level 3 countries are upgraded annually, which translates to a mere 1-2% probability over the two-month forecast window. This is a powerful anchor suggesting my initial forecast was too high. Forecaster 3 introduced a specific, timely piece of evidence: new US sanctions imposed on May 1, 2025, due to violence. This signals active, high-level US government concern and serves as a concrete factor pushing the probability up. Forecaster 2's reasoning is methodologically stronger due to the base rate, but Forecaster 3's specific evidence cannot be ignored. I find the synthesis of these two perspectives to be more robust than my original analysis alone.",
    "rationale": "I am updating my forecast downward from 15% to 10%. The core of this change comes from incorporating the quantitative base rate provided by Forecaster 2. The historical frequency of these upgrades is very low, especially over a short, two-month period. This makes a 'No' outcome the very strong default. My initial 15% did not adequately account for just how rare these changes are. However, I am not adopting Forecaster 2's lower 7% because I find the evidence of recent US sanctions, highlighted by Forecaster 3, to be significant. While sanctions and travel advisories are different tools, fresh sanctions signal that Ethiopia's instability is a high-priority, deteriorating issue for the US administration. This specific negative momentum justifies a higher probability than the base rate alone would suggest. My revised 10% forecast reflects a new anchor based on the low base rate, adjusted upward to account for both Ethiopia's known, ongoing conflicts and the very recent, concrete signal of heightened US concern.",
