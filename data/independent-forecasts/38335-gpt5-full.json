  "information": "As of early June 2025, the Republican primary field for the 2026 Florida gubernatorial race includes Congressman Byron Donalds, who launched his campaign with an endorsement from former President Donald Trump. On the Democratic side, former U.S. Representative David Jolly, a former Republican and critic of Donald Trump, announced his candidacy on June 5, 2025. Governor Ron DeSantis, who is term-limited, has not endorsed a successor in the Republican primary.\n\nWhen asked about her potential 2026 gubernatorial candidacy, Casey DeSantis has consistently responded with noncommittal phrases such as, \"We'll see.\" As of early June 2025, there have been no public reports of official campaign staff hires, fundraising filings with the Florida Division of Elections, or other formal preparations for a campaign launch. Polling from early 2025 indicated a high favorability rating for her among registered Republicans, with one poll showing her at 57% compared to Byron Donalds' 27%. However, a separate internal poll conducted by the Donalds campaign showed him with a narrow lead over DeSantis, 34% to 30%.\n\nCasey DeSantis is facing public scrutiny related to a House probe into the Hope Florida foundation, an initiative she launched. The investigation was reported by multiple news outlets in late May and early June 2025. The next major campaign finance deadline is June 30, which marks the end of the second fundraising quarter. Historically, major candidates for Florida governor typically announce their campaigns between 8 and 18 months prior to the primary election, which is scheduled for August 2026.",

    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Approximately 26 days (through June 30, 2025, before July 1)",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "She continues to say she’s considering it, avoids a formal declaration amid the House probe into Hope Florida and Trump’s endorsement of Byron Donalds, does not file or stage a launch event, and waits until later in 2025 (or not at all) to decide.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "She quickly greenlights a launch to capitalize on end-of-Q2 fundraising optics, issues a formal candidacy announcement mid-to-late June via video/press event, and begins donor outreach to post a strong June 30 report.",
    "rationale": "Baseline: As of early June 2025, Casey DeSantis has been noncommittal (“We’ll see”), with no public signs of a formal campaign build (no staff hires, filings, or evident launch prep). Byron Donalds has already entered with Trump’s endorsement, and there’s fresh scrutiny tied to a House probe into her Hope Florida initiative. Historically, Florida gubernatorial candidates often announce 8–18 months before an August primary, so June 2025 is within a plausible window, but not necessary. Weighting the status quo heavily suggests inertia over the next few weeks. Arguments for Yes before July 1: the June 30 fundraising deadline offers a tactical reason to announce quickly to show a strong Q2. If she intends to run, launching in June would provide a 14-month runway. A high-profile figure can announce rapidly without fully built infrastructure. Arguments for No: lack of observable pre-launch activity; Trump’s endorsement of a rival complicates her lane; launching amid the Hope Florida probe is suboptimal; she has ample time to announce later in 2025 or early 2026. Why not higher: We would expect clearer ramp-up signals (hiring, donor cultivation leaks, event holds) if a June launch were imminent; political headwinds (Trump’s endorsement of Donalds and ongoing probe) reduce near-term incentives. Why not lower: Open-seat governor races attract strong contenders; she retains high GOP name ID and could pivot fast; the Q2 deadline creates a natural near-term catalyst. Update signals upward: credible reports of staff hires or consultants retained, filings or committee moves, donor call-time ramp, venue holds/media advisories for a launch, or supportive signals from Ron DeSantis. Update signals downward: escalated probe coverage or legal/political complications, additional high-profile GOP entries consolidating anti-Casey lanes, or explicit statements indicating she will delay a decision beyond July.",
