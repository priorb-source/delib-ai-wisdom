    "review": "Both forecasters independently arrived at 18%, converging on a low probability. However, I notice they both appear to have significantly discounted or overlooked the Claude Neptune information from the research assistant's report. Forecaster 2 states 'we lack any public signals of imminent release' and Forecaster 3 says 'no announcements yet,' but the May 15-16 reports about Neptune completing red-team testing on May 18 with late May/early June general availability targets ARE recent public signals. These are not vague 'later in 2025' statements from months ago—they're concrete, near-term timelines reported just days before our current date.\n\nThat said, the other forecasters make valid points I initially underweighted: (1) Forecaster 3's observation about 'later in 2025' language from February-March reports provides important context, though this older information should be superseded by more recent May reports. (2) Both correctly note the absence of official Anthropic announcements, which distinguishes leaks/reports from confirmed launches. (3) Forecaster 2's historical cadence analysis is useful but doesn't invalidate recent signals of an actual imminent release.\n\nMy critical error was not being clear enough about the naming uncertainty being the dominant factor. The other forecasters may be implicitly treating Neptune reports skeptically precisely because of naming ambiguity, which is actually the right approach.",
    "rationale": "After deliberation, I'm updating downward but not as far as 18%. Here's my revised reasoning:\n\nThe Neptune reports (May 15-16) provide genuinely strong evidence of an imminent major model release. Red-team completion on May 18 with late May/early June GA targets is a concrete, specific, near-term timeline that both other forecasters appear to have discounted too heavily. These recent reports should carry more weight than older 'later in 2025' statements from February-March.\n\nHowever, the critical insight from deliberation is that the naming uncertainty is even more important than I initially weighted. The question ONLY resolves Yes for a model called 'Claude 4'—not Claude 3.5, not Claude Neptune, not anything else. While Asimov became Claude 3, there's no guarantee Neptune becomes Claude 4 rather than a Claude 3.x variant.\n\nMy updated probability calculation:\n- Probability a major Anthropic model reaches general availability before July 1: ~70% (based on Neptune timeline)\n- Probability that model is specifically named 'Claude 4': ~45% (accounting for possible 3.5 naming, Neptune branding, or other variants)\n- Combined: 0.70 × 0.45 ≈ 32%\n\nI'm updating down from 50% to 32%, acknowledging the naming uncertainty is more critical than I initially assessed, while maintaining that recent Neptune reports provide stronger positive evidence than the other forecasters credited.",
