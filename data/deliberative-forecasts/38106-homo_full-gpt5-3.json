    "review": "Both forecasters largely mirror my priors: tight timeline, no advance trip signals, strong optics/political constraints, and higher likelihood of a neutral venue even if there’s progress. They add emphasis on concrete logistical indicators (pool guidance, NOTAMs, advance teams) and allied optics, which strengthens the case against a June Moscow visit. Their up/down triggers match mine. I didn’t see materially new factual information, but I do find their added weight on the absence of logistics/pool signals and the White House choosing not to send a delegation to June 2 talks incrementally persuasive toward a slightly lower probability.",
    "rationale": "Time remaining is about one month. A high‑security presidential visit to Russia typically leaves observable traces or at least credible leaks; none are present. The White House’s decision not to send an official delegation to the June 2 Istanbul round suggests limited near‑term engagement. Trump’s late‑May rhetoric (“absolutely crazy,” “very disappointed”) and his stated two‑week wait‑and‑see window push any plausible engagement into mid‑June or later, compressing planning time further. Even with a June 2 breakthrough, a neutral site remains the most plausible venue for first in‑person talks or any initial signing, given domestic and allied optics and Ukraine’s role. A last‑minute, surprise Trump trip to Moscow is not impossible—his style and mutual invitations keep a non‑zero tail—but the lack of preparatory signals and the political costs during active hostilities dominate. Net effect: slight downward adjustment from my prior to reflect the added salience of logistics and the no‑delegation signal.",
