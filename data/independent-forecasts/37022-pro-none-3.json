    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "The outcome is determined by data from March 2025. Given that today is April 22, 2025, the data is historical and should be published by the resolution source, Trading Economics, shortly, if not already. The waiting period is minimal, pending the data update.",
    "status_quo_outcome": "The status quo is a continued increase in Ukraine's government debt, driven by the financial necessities of the ongoing war. Data from early 2024 showed the debt was already nearly 6 trillion UAH, thus the status quo outcome is a straightforward 'Yes'.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "For a 'No' outcome, Ukraine's total government debt would have needed to fall below 1.90 trillion UAH. This would have required an unprecedented and economically implausible event, such as the forgiveness of over 70% of its national debt combined with a sudden cessation of all borrowing during a period of intense conflict.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "A 'Yes' outcome requires the debt to be at or above 1.90 trillion UAH. This aligns with all economic indicators. Ukraine continued to finance its war effort and government operations through substantial international loans throughout 2024 and early 2025, causing the national debt to rise further from a baseline that was already three times the threshold.",
    "rationale": "This forecast is based on established historical data and fundamental economic drivers. Ukraine's government debt has been significantly above the 1.90 trillion UAH threshold for several years. As of March 2024, the debt stood at approximately 5.92 trillion UAH. The primary driver for its continued growth is the necessity of financing a large-scale war effort and managing a significant budget deficit, which is largely covered by loans from international partners like the IMF, World Bank, and the EU. Given that the conflict persisted through the forecast period, Ukraine's borrowing needs remained acute, guaranteeing that its total debt would increase, not decrease. Therefore, the March 2025 figure will be substantially higher than the 1.90 trillion UAH threshold. The probability is set at 99% instead of 100% to account for the remote possibility of a data reporting error, an unforeseen currency redenomination, or a technical issue with the resolution source, rather than any plausible economic scenario leading to a 'No' outcome.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill Ukraine's government debt be at least 1.90 trillion UAH in March 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\n[Ukraine is one step away from stagflation. And here's why](https://en.iz.ru/en/1868046/2025-04-10/ukraine-one-step-away-stagflation-and-heres-why)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if Ukraine's government debt is greater than or equal to 1.90 billion UAH Thousand (in other words, 1.90 trillion Ukrainian hryvnia for the month of March 2025, according to the number presented by [Trading Economics](https://tradingeconomics.com/ukraine/government-debt). Under 1.90 billion UAH Thousand resolves as **No**.\n\n\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nNo additional information available.\n\nToday is 2025-04-22.\n\nBefore answering you think:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n(e) You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
