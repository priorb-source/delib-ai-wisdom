    "review": "All three forecasters converged on 85% through similar reasoning, which provides validation that we're appropriately weighing the available evidence. Forecaster 3 raises a particularly strong point about industrial production 'rarely flipping signs YoY without a clear shock' - this reinforces the momentum argument. Forecaster 3 also identifies specific sector vulnerabilities (utilities/weather, aerospace, autos) that could create month-to-month volatility, though these are typically smoothed in the aggregate index. Both forecasters emphasize data persistence more explicitly than I initially did, which is warranted given the economics literature on industrial production autocorrelation. However, no forecaster has presented new hard data or evidence that would materially change the probabilistic assessment. The key factors remain: (1) strong April baseline at +1.488%, (2) record high index levels mentioned in background, (3) absence of reported shocks, (4) natural momentum in industrial production data, balanced against (5) potential for data surprises, (6) modest rather than robust growth rate, and (7) unknown base effects from May 2024.",
    "rationale": "After reviewing the other forecasters' analyses, I maintain my assessment. The convergence at 85% across all three independent analyses provides confidence that this probability appropriately captures the available information. The key insight from deliberation is that industrial production YoY growth rates exhibit strong persistence and rarely flip from positive to negative without observable economic shocks. April's +1.488% growth, combined with the Real Economy Blog noting record highs and the absence of reported disruptions in May, creates a strong baseline expectation for continued positive growth. The 15% probability assigned to a No outcome accounts for: (1) normal volatility in preliminary economic releases, (2) potential unfavorable base effects from May 2024, (3) sector-specific shocks that might not yet be widely reported, and (4) the modest rather than robust nature of April's growth rate. No new evidence or arguments from fellow forecasters warrant adjusting this probability.",
