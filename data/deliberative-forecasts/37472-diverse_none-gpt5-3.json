    "review": "Both forecasters largely align with my prior view: the short window, strong status quo forces, legal/safety risks, and India’s incentives all point to a NO. Forecaster 2’s emphasis on the interim government’s consolidation and destabilization risk from a return is persuasive. Forecaster 3’s point about extradition/return processes typically taking months (absent clear signals) also strengthens the case for a low probability. Neither provided concrete new evidence of imminent movement toward a return; instead they reinforced the inertia and hurdles. Their suggested update triggers (e.g., India signaling facilitation, visible negotiations, new charges/arrest warrants) are sensible and match my priors.",
    "rationale": "The resolution window (May 13–June 30) is very short, and there are no credible indications of a negotiated pathway, safe passage, or imminent travel plans. The interim government’s incentives to prevent a destabilizing return remain strong; immediate arrest risk for Hasina is high; and India is unlikely to force or facilitate a rapid return without substantial diplomatic groundwork. Extradition or formal processes typically take longer than weeks. While Hasina’s rhetoric keeps a nonzero chance alive and tail risks (sudden political shocks, elite bargains, or a symbolic, surprise return) exist, the absence of concrete signals so close to the window weighs heavily toward NO. In light of the other forecasters’ reinforcing arguments about consolidation and timelines, I’m nudging my estimate slightly down. I would move up on credible reports of a set date, safe-passage/bail arrangements, or India–Bangladesh coordination; I’d move down on fresh legal actions or explicit denials from Delhi/Dhaka.",
