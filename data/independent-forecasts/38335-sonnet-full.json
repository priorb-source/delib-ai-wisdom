  "information": "As of early June 2025, the Republican primary field for the 2026 Florida gubernatorial race includes Congressman Byron Donalds, who launched his campaign with an endorsement from former President Donald Trump. On the Democratic side, former U.S. Representative David Jolly, a former Republican and critic of Donald Trump, announced his candidacy on June 5, 2025. Governor Ron DeSantis, who is term-limited, has not endorsed a successor in the Republican primary.\n\nWhen asked about her potential 2026 gubernatorial candidacy, Casey DeSantis has consistently responded with noncommittal phrases such as, \"We'll see.\" As of early June 2025, there have been no public reports of official campaign staff hires, fundraising filings with the Florida Division of Elections, or other formal preparations for a campaign launch. Polling from early 2025 indicated a high favorability rating for her among registered Republicans, with one poll showing her at 57% compared to Byron Donalds' 27%. However, a separate internal poll conducted by the Donalds campaign showed him with a narrow lead over DeSantis, 34% to 30%.\n\nCasey DeSantis is facing public scrutiny related to a House probe into the Hope Florida foundation, an initiative she launched. The investigation was reported by multiple news outlets in late May and early June 2025. The next major campaign finance deadline is June 30, which marks the end of the second fundraising quarter. Historically, major candidates for Florida governor typically announce their campaigns between 8 and 18 months prior to the primary election, which is scheduled for August 2026.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "26 days (from June 5, 2025 to July 1, 2025)",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No announcement. Casey DeSantis has shown no formal signs of launching a campaign (no staff hires, no fundraising filings, no campaign infrastructure), and has given only noncommittal responses when asked about running.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Casey DeSantis continues her pattern of noncommittal responses and decides to wait at least until after the Hope Florida investigation progresses or concludes. She may want to see how Byron Donalds performs with Trump's endorsement, or she may decide the timing isn't right given the current scrutiny. The June 30 fundraising deadline passes without any announcement or filing from her campaign.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Casey DeSantis decides to enter the race quickly to take advantage of the upcoming June 30 campaign finance deadline, allowing her to raise funds in Q2 2025. She determines that getting ahead of the Hope Florida investigation with a campaign launch is strategically advantageous, or she receives encouraging internal polling or major donor commitments that prompt a rapid decision. She announces in late June with a minimal initial campaign structure.",
    "rationale": "The status quo strongly favors No. With only 26 days until the July 1 deadline, there are no visible signs of an imminent campaign launch. Key evidence: no official campaign staff, no fundraising filings, no formal campaign infrastructure, and consistently noncommittal public statements. The Hope Florida foundation investigation adds political risk that would typically delay a campaign launch. Byron Donalds has already launched with Trump's endorsement, shifting the competitive landscape. While the June 30 fundraising deadline is significant and could theoretically prompt an announcement, historically major Florida gubernatorial candidates signal their intentions more clearly before launching. The typical announcement window of 8-18 months before the primary (August 2026 is 14 months away) is within range, but announcing requires having already made preparations that aren't evident. Factors preventing a higher forecast: the very short 26-day window, absence of preparation signals, ongoing investigation, and Trump backing her opponent. Factors preventing a lower forecast: the June 30 deadline is coming up, she maintains high favorability among Republicans, and surprise announcements do occasionally happen. I would update higher with evidence of campaign infrastructure development, major staff hires, fundraising activity, or more definitive public statements. I would update lower if she explicitly ruled out running or if the investigation intensified.",

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
