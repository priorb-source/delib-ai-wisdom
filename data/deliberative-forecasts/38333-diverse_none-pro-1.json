    "review": "All three forecasters agree on the central facts: the only positive signal is a month-old article, and there is a complete lack of subsequent public evidence (staffing, fundraising, committee formation) that typically precedes a major campaign launch. We all correctly identify this as strong evidence for a 'No' outcome. However, I found Forecaster 3's reasoning particularly convincing for why the probability isn't in the single digits. They raised a crucial point I had not adequately considered: the strategic incentive to announce just before the June 30 quarterly fundraising deadline. This provides a very specific and plausible motive for a campaign to remain quiet before a late-month launch to maximize the impact of its first financial report. Forecaster 2's reasoning pointed in a similar direction but was less specific about the mechanism. The Q2 deadline argument is a strong counterpoint to my initial, heavily weighted view that 'no signals' automatically means 'no imminent launch'.",
    "rationale": "My initial forecast of 10% was based almost entirely on the short timeline and the strong negative signal from the lack of public preparation for a gubernatorial campaign. Major campaigns are complex operations that are difficult to launch from a standing start in under four weeks without any leaks or public activity. However, the deliberation has convinced me to update my forecast. Specifically, the argument raised by Forecaster 3 regarding the strategic value of an announcement just before the June 30 end-of-quarter fundraising deadline provides a compelling reason why a campaign might deliberately maintain radio silence. A late June announcement would allow Suarez to consolidate all his initial fundraising into a single, impressive Q2 report, creating a powerful media narrative of momentum. This possibility justifies increasing the probability of an announcement before July 1. While I still believe a launch in this timeframe is unlikely due to the significant logistical hurdles, the fundraising incentive is a strong enough factor to have made me reconsider my initial assessment. I am raising my forecast from 10% to 20% to account for this plausible strategic scenario.",
