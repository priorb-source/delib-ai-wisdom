    "review": "Both forecasters make compelling arguments that I should reconsider my relatively optimistic 55% forecast. Forecaster 3 introduces an important concept I underweighted: status quo bias. Since closure requires active FSIS verification and an explicit status change, there's inherent momentum toward remaining Active. This is particularly relevant given we're asking about a binary state change within a specific timeframe. Forecaster 2's emphasis on the frozen product complication is also well-taken - I acknowledged it but may have underweighted how this specifically affects FSIS effectiveness checks and verification processes. Both forecasters arrived independently at probabilities below 50% (40% and 48%), which suggests my weighting of the 'limited geography' factor may have been too generous. While New York-only distribution does simplify the recall, the substantial volume and 18-month production window could still present significant verification challenges even within a single state.",
    "rationale": "Upon reflection, I maintain that the historical data provides a genuine baseline near 50% - the 68-day window sits almost precisely at the median where roughly half of comparable recalls closed. However, I now believe I should weight three factors more heavily: (1) The status quo bias argument is compelling and forensically sound - FSIS must actively verify and change status, creating inertia toward Active; (2) The frozen product nature creates more complex verification challenges than I initially credited, as products can remain in commerce longer; (3) The 18-month production window (back to Nov 2023) adds traceability complexity that may offset the single-state advantage. Conversely, I still believe the cooperative/voluntary nature, zero illnesses, and misbranding classification (vs pathogen) are meaningful positive factors. Balancing these more carefully, I'm moving my forecast down to 50%, acknowledging this is essentially a coin flip with the deadline falling right at the historical median, but with status quo bias providing a slight edge to remaining Active that keeps me from going above 50%.",
