    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Approximately 4–7 months, when UFC 315 occurs (likely in late 2025).",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "UFC 315 is scheduled outside the U.S. (e.g., Abu Dhabi) or in a city Trump is less likely to visit, or he has schedule/security constraints; he therefore does not enter the venue grounds at any time.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "UFC 315 is in Las Vegas, Florida, or the NYC/NJ area; Dana White extends an invitation; Trump makes a brief appearance (e.g., sits cageside) and is physically present anywhere on the venue grounds.",
    "rationale": "Baseline: For any single UFC PPV, Trump’s attendance is the exception, not the rule. Over the past few years he has appeared at several UFC cards (e.g., Miami in 2023 and 2024, and as sitting president at UFC 244 in 2019), often when the location is favorable and the optics are helpful, and Dana White is welcoming. That suggests a non-trivial but still minority base rate per event. Without the exact UFC 315 location and date, the status quo is that he does not attend. Key drivers: (1) Location: If 315 is in Las Vegas or South Florida, attendance probability rises; if it’s overseas or in Canada, it drops sharply. (2) Schedule/security: If he is in office or heavily scheduled, sporadic sports appearances remain possible but less frequent. (3) Signaling: Public hints from Dana White, UFC promos, or Trump’s schedule meaningfully increase odds. Why not higher: He does not attend most UFC PPVs; uncertainty around 315’s location/date keeps the base rate low. Why not lower: He has a repeated pattern of showing up at UFC events a few times per year when conditions fit, and the organization is eager to host him. What would move me up: Confirmed Vegas/Miami/NYC-NJ location and credible reports or hints from UFC/Trump team; I’d move toward 35–45%. What would move me down: Confirmation of an overseas/Canadian venue, or a direct scheduling conflict, pushing me toward 5–10%. Research assistant provided no additional information beyond the AP note that he has recently attended UFC in Miami, which supports the pattern but not the specific event.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill Donald Trump attend UFC 315?\n\nQuestion background:\nAP [Trump sits cageside at Miami UFC event in his latest appearance at a sports event](https://apnews.com/article/trump-ufc-miami-fight-sports-6461901bb3d5f2eec477674d02333a7f)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if President Donald Trump is anywhere within the grounds of the venue where [UFC 315](https://www.ufc.com/event/ufc-315) takes place. Otherwise this resolves as **No**.\n\n\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nNo additional information available.\n\nToday is 2025-04-28.\n\nBefore answering you think:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n(e) You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
