  "information": "On May 14, 2025, the Nigerian House of Representatives passed a resolution urging the Federal Government to engage in dialogue with the Republic of Benin to resolve the blockade. The motion highlighted the strain on bilateral relations and the disruption to seasonal trade critical to the livelihood of border communities. As of late May 2025, neither the Nigerian nor the Beninese government had issued any public statements suggesting an imminent reopening. On May 30, an AFRICOM briefing noted a deteriorating security threat environment along the Benin-Nigeria frontier.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Approximately 31 days from May 31, 2025 to July 1, 2025",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No - the border remains closed",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "The security situation along the border remains unstable with continued threats from the Mahmuda terror group and arms smuggling concerns. Diplomatic negotiations between Nigeria and Benin proceed slowly through normal channels. Economic pressure builds but is insufficient to force rapid reopening. Security assessments indicate continued risk, and both governments maintain the closure through July 1 as they work on longer-term solutions to address terrorism, smuggling, and illegal exports.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Intensive diplomatic engagement between Nigeria and Benin yields a breakthrough security agreement. Either the terror threat is rapidly neutralized through joint military operations, or both nations agree to enhanced security protocols at border crossings that address smuggling concerns. Mounting economic pressure from disrupted trade and border communities forces political leadership to prioritize reopening. A negotiated settlement is announced, and crossings reopen before July 1.",
    "rationale": "The status quo heavily favors the border remaining closed. The closure occurred only 2-3 weeks ago in mid-May 2025, and border closures driven by serious security concerns typically require months, not weeks, to resolve. The cited reasons - attacks by terror group Mahmuda, arms smuggling, and illegal exportation - represent substantial security issues requiring coordinated solutions. Most concerning is the May 30 AFRICOM briefing noting a 'deteriorating security threat environment,' suggesting the situation is worsening rather than improving. As of late May, neither government has issued statements suggesting imminent reopening; the Nigerian House resolution merely urges dialogue, not announcing progress. With only 31 days remaining, the timeframe is extremely compressed for resolving complex bilateral security and trade disputes. Diplomatic processes typically move slowly, especially when multiple governments and security agencies must coordinate. My forecast is not higher because there are no positive signals of progress, security is deteriorating, and the issues are too serious for quick resolution. My forecast is not lower because economic pressure from disrupted trade could theoretically accelerate negotiations, and occasionally border closures serve as political posturing that can reverse quickly. For me to update higher, I would need credible reports of active high-level negotiations, security improvements, or statements from officials indicating progress toward reopening. To update lower, I would need reports of further security incidents or explicit statements that the closure will be long-term.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill Benin re-open its closed land border crossings with Nigeria's Kwara state before July 1, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\n[Exclusive: Benin Rep.

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
