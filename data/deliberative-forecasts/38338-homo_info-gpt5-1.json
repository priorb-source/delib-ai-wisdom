    "review": "New points I hadn’t explicitly considered: (1) reporting that Morgan has been actively working to form a new centrist party with lawyers and potential names, which does indicate serious infrastructure work; (2) David Jolly’s June 5 entry into the Democratic primary, which likely reduces any near-term pressure for Morgan to declare as a Democrat; (3) the reminder that there’s no cycle-driven deadline in June 2025. I find the logic about party formation cutting both ways persuasive: it signals seriousness but also suggests process steps (recognition, staffing, branding) that argue against an imminent announcement. I think Forecaster 2 and 3 are over-weighting the “seriousness” signal relative to the very short window and Morgan’s stated preference for a short campaign; absent concrete telltales (filings, scheduled event, senior hires), 27–30% feels high for a 25-day window. Still, the party-building intel nudges me slightly higher than my initial take.",
    "rationale": "Time left is ~25 days. The status quo is No. Morgan’s own May remarks about observing the field and running only a short campaign point away from a June 2025 announcement. His history of flirting and not pulling the trigger further lowers the near-term hazard. The new information about building a centrist party raises the overall likelihood he runs at some point, but it does not create a clear incentive to announce before July 1; if anything, formal party recognition and rollout may precede or coincide with a later candidacy announcement. Jolly’s entry into the Democratic primary reduces any incentive to quickly jump in as a Democrat, and an independent/third-party path has no June deadline. Given no visible signals of an imminent launch (e.g., filings, senior staff hires, event bookings, venue reservations, ad buys), I keep the probability low but nudge it up slightly to reflect genuine activity and the possibility of a splashy June reveal.",
