    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "About 46 days (until July 1, 2025)",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Despite having a license, Starlink does not flip Chad to “Available” on the map before July 1 due to remaining regulatory/implementation steps (e.g., import approvals, local partner terms, spectrum fee/payment issues), internal rollout prioritization elsewhere, or a last‑minute policy delay from Chadian authorities.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Starlink finalizes operational details and updates its availability map to show at least part of Chad (e.g., N’Djamena) as “Available,” possibly as part of a broader Africa rollout batch, leveraging inter-satellite links so no local gateway is needed.",
    "rationale": "- Time horizon: Only ~6 weeks remain, so the status quo (currently not “Available” on the map) deserves extra weight.\n- Evidence: Starlink reportedly secured a license in Chad in Nov 2024. In many African countries, once licensed, Starlink often moves to availability within a few months, sometimes quickly if no local gateway is mandated. That supports a meaningful chance of a flip before July 1.\n- Countervailing considerations: If six months have already elapsed without the map showing “Available,” that suggests lingering hurdles (import, commercial arrangements, regulatory fine print, or deprioritization). Such delays can persist beyond a few weeks. Some African markets with licenses have experienced drawn out timelines or reversals.\n- Base-rate intuition: From license to “Available” can be rapid (weeks–months), but when it doesn’t happen quickly, rollouts can stall for an extended period. With limited time left, the probability tilts modestly below even odds.\n- Why not higher: The status quo is No; any unresolved regulatory or operational step could push availability past July 1. The short remaining window lowers odds.\n- Why not lower: A license is already in hand, and Starlink has a history of switching on new African markets in batches without local gateways, meaning a late‑June flip is plausible. Only one area in Chad needs to show “Available” to resolve Yes.\n- What would move me up: Credible reports of Starlink accepting Chad addresses, local reseller announcements, government statements confirming service launch, or map-watchers noting imminent updates.\n- What would move me down: News of policy delays, import restrictions, fee disputes, or Starlink deprioritizing Chad/central Africa rollouts this quarter.\n- Research assistant summary: No additional information found; thus, forecast relies on license timing, typical rollout patterns, and the short time window.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill Starlink's website show Chad as a country with Starlink availability before July 1, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\n[SpaceX’s Starlink Secures License to Operate in Chad](https://spaceinafrica.com/2024/11/12/spacexs-starlink-secures-license-to-operate-in-chad/)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if, before July 1, 2025, the [Starlink Availability Map](https://www.starlink.com/us/map) has anywhere in Chad listed as \"Available.\"\n\n\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nNo additional information available.\n\nToday is 2025-05-15.\n\nBefore answering you think:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n(e) You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
