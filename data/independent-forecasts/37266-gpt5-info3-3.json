  "information": "As of early May 2025, the U.S. State Department has 'Level 4: Do Not Travel' advisories in effect for 21 countries. Reasons for these advisories include active conflicts, terrorism, civil unrest, kidnapping, and health emergencies. The list of countries includes Afghanistan, Belarus, Burkina Faso, Haiti, Iran, Iraq, North Korea, Russia, Somalia, South Sudan, Sudan, Syria, Ukraine, and Yemen. Some advisories have been updated recently; the advisory for South Sudan was elevated to Level 4 on March 8, 2025. In other instances, advisories are applied regionally, such as in Bangladesh, which has a country-wide Level 3 advisory but a Level 4 warning for the Chittagong Hill Tracts region.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "About 59 days (until 2025-07-01)",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No — Mozambique remains below Level 4 (country-level), with localized higher-risk warnings continuing for parts of Cabo Delgado.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Insurgency-related violence remains localized in Cabo Delgado; protests subside or remain sporadic; no nationwide breakdown in security, no embassy drawdown, and State keeps Mozambique at its current country-level rating (with regional cautions).",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "A sudden, nationwide deterioration: large-scale violent unrest or a major terror campaign expands beyond Cabo Delgado; significant attacks or kidnappings in Maputo/Beira/Pemba; the U.S. orders embassy drawdown or finds it cannot assist citizens; or a severe disaster/health emergency triggers countrywide instability—prompting State to elevate to Level 4 nationwide.",
    "rationale": "Baseline: Mozambique is currently below a country-wide Level 4. Historically, State has flagged specific parts of Cabo Delgado as Do Not Travel while keeping the national advisory at a lower level. The U.S. generally reserves Level 4 for countries with war-scale conflict, state collapse, or extreme, widespread targeting of foreigners. The research assistant notes 21 countries at Level 4 as of early May 2025, with occasional updates (e.g., South Sudan on Mar 8, 2025). These shifts are relatively infrequent, and often tied to clear triggers (armed conflict, mass unrest, or inability of the U.S. government to assist).\nRecent signals: ATTA issued an advisory amid protests, indicating elevated short-term risk, but industry advisories do not imply State will move to Level 4 nationally. Cabo Delgado’s insurgency remains the primary security concern; while there have been ebbs and flows, violence has stayed largely regional. Cyclone season is tapering, reducing the near-term risk of a disaster-driven security collapse.\nWhy not higher: The bar for a nationwide Level 4 is high, and the time horizon is short (~2 months). Base rates for a country moving to Level 4 over such a window are low absent a clear precipitating crisis. Mozambique’s security challenges have been chronic but geographically concentrated.\nWhy not lower: There is non-trivial tail risk. The insurgency could flare beyond Cabo Delgado; protests could escalate; or a major incident targeting foreigners or a significant embassy posture change (e.g., ordered departure) could occur. The SADC mission’s drawdown and fluctuating security in the north add uncertainty.\nWhat would raise my forecast: U.S. Embassy Maputo issues ordered/authorized departure, broad movement restrictions for staff, or multiple security alerts indicating deteriorating conditions outside Cabo Delgado; major terrorist attacks or kidnappings in southern/central cities; widespread violent protests; allied governments (UK, Canada, Australia) shift to “Avoid all travel” nationwide; large new health emergency.\nWhat would lower it: Weeks of calm nationwide with only localized incidents in Cabo Delgado; clear improvements in security; consistent embassy messaging without elevation in posture; other governments maintaining cautionary but not “avoid all travel” guidance.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill Mozambique receive a \"Level 4 – Do Not Travel\" travel advisory from the US State Department before July 1, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nMSN: [ATTA issues travel advisory for Mozambique amid protests](https://www.msn.com/en-za/travel/travel-preparation/atta-issues-travel-advisory-for-mozambique-amid-protests/ar-AA1wHavB?ocid=BingNewsVerp)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if the country of Mozambique has received a Level 4 [travel advisory](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/International-Travel-Country-Information-Pages/Mozambique.html) from the US Department of State before July 1, 2025.\n\n\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nAs of early May 2025, the U.S. State Department has 'Level 4: Do Not Travel' advisories in effect for 21 countries.

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
