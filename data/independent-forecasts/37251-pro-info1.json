  "information": "According to multiple South Korean industry and government sources from January 2025, South Korea and Vietnam were in the final stages of negotiating a deal for South Korea to export K9 self-propelled howitzers. The proposed agreement was reported to involve the sale of approximately 20 K9 units for a value of around $300 million. The deal was expected to be finalized in the first quarter of 2025 and would mark South Korea's first arms export to Vietnam. If completed, Vietnam would become the 10th foreign country to acquire the K9 system.",

    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "2 months",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No agreement has been announced. While negotiations were reported to be in their final stages, the current state is that no deal has been officially confirmed by either government.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "The negotiations, which have already missed their reported Q1 2025 finalization target, continue to be delayed by disagreements over final terms related to financing, technology transfer, or pricing. The complexity of the deal and internal bureaucratic processes in both countries push the official announcement past the July 1, 2025 deadline.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "The delay past Q1 2025 proves to be a minor setback in a complex negotiation process. Building on the strong political and strategic alignment between the two nations, officials from South Korea and Vietnam finalize the remaining details and publicly announce the K9 howitzer export agreement before July 1, 2025.",
    "rationale": "My forecast is based on strong but dated reporting. The key evidence from January 2025 indicated that a deal was in its 'final stages' and expected to be finalized in Q1 2025. This suggests that the major hurdles to an agreement had been overcome, making a final deal highly probable. The strategic rationale for both countries is strong: Vietnam seeks to diversify its military suppliers beyond Russia, and South Korea is eager to expand its footprint as a major global arms exporter. However, the fact that the Q1 2025 deadline has passed without an announcement is a significant counter-signal, indicating unforeseen complications or delays. These could be minor bureaucratic hurdles or more significant disagreements. I place moderate weight on the status quo, as international arms deals are complex and can easily be delayed. The probability is not higher because the missed deadline introduces considerable uncertainty about the timeline. The probability is not lower because the initial reports of the deal being in its 'final stages' came from multiple government and industry sources, suggesting that a collapse of the talks is less likely than a simple delay. For me to increase my forecast, I would need to see new reports of high-level diplomatic or defense meetings between the two countries. For me to decrease it, I would need to see reports of a rival nation securing a similar deal with Vietnam or any news of a breakdown in bilateral relations.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill Vietnam and South Korea announce an agreement for South Korea to export self-propelled howitzers to Vietnam?\n\nQuestion background:\nThe Korea Herald: [South Korea-Vietnam ties enter new strategic terrain, but need more detailed road map: Seoul envoy](https://www.koreaherald.com/article/10464718) \"Vietnam is reportedly in negotiations to import 20 units of K9 self-propelled howitzers from Korea in a deal valued at $300 million. If finalized, it would mark Korea’s first defense arms sale to the country.\"\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if, before July 1, 2025, the governments of Vietnam and/or South Korea announce an agreement for South Korea to export 2 or more self-propelled howitzers to Vietnam. If no such agreement is announced after the launch of this question and before July 1, 2025, this question resolves as **No**.\n\n\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nAccording to multiple South Korean industry and government sources from January 2025, South Korea and Vietnam were in the final stages of negotiating a deal for South Korea to export K9 self-propelled howitzers. The proposed agreement was reported to involve the sale of approximately 20 K9 units for a value of around $300 million.

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
