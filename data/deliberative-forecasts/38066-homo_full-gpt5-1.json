    "review": "Both forecasters converge on the same structural logic I used: attendance risk (especially for Musk), lack of an explicitly billed joint segment, and adversarial history. New/useful additions: (1) a clear multiplicative decomposition; (2) the point that a free, capacity‑limited, student‑focused event lessens YC’s need for a high‑drama PR moment; (3) emphasis on security/PR complexity and the likelihood organizers prefer controlled, separate segments; and (4) that absent explicit scheduling, P(shared|both attend) should be quite low. Forecaster 2’s conditional (25–40%) for shared stage feels high given no agenda signal; Forecaster 3’s 10–15% seems more realistic. I find Forecaster 3’s reasoning slightly more persuasive overall.",
    "rationale": "I’m revising down based on the decomposition. My prior implicitly assumed a higher P(shared|both). Incorporating the student-focused/cap-limited incentives and YC’s likely preference for minimizing confrontation, I now estimate: P(Musk attends in person) ~65%; P(Altman attends) ~92%; P(shared stage | both attend) ~15%. That yields ~9% overall. I modestly round up to 15% to account for the possibility of a surprise opening/closing moment or an engineered photo-op if relations thaw, but still well below my initial 20% given the absence of any agenda hints and Musk’s unpredictability. Upside triggers: official joint session, public hints from YC/Altman/Musk, credible détente reporting, or confirmed Musk travel/firm commitment. Downside triggers: published separate-only schedule, remote participation, renewed hostilities, or reports of security/contractual constraints.",
