    "review": "All three forecasters (including myself) converged on the same key evidence: the 94% historical base rate, Mozambique as a strong removal candidate, and British Virgin Islands as a strong addition candidate. The most compelling new argument raised by the other forecasters, particularly Forecaster 3, is the 'multiple independent paths' concept - for a NO outcome to occur, Mozambique would need to fail its exit despite positive April feedback, AND Nigeria would need to miss its end-of-May target, AND BVI would need to not be added despite its expired grace period and UK support, AND no other jurisdictions would be affected. This multiplicative logic makes the NO scenario less likely than I initially weighted. Forecaster 2 also helpfully emphasized that we're only 2-3 weeks from the plenary, making timing constraints more visible. However, I note that despite being this close, we haven't seen confirmations of exits or additions, which introduces some uncertainty about whether these candidates will actually materialize at the June meeting versus being delayed to October 2025 (as South Africa itself projected).",
    "rationale": "The 94% historical base rate remains the foundation of my forecast. The 'multiple independent paths' argument strengthens the case for YES - we have at least three plausible triggers (Mozambique removal, BVI addition, Nigeria removal), and only if ALL of them fail to materialize would we get a NO outcome. This is more compelling than I initially weighted. However, I maintain some caution because: (1) we're 2-3 weeks out with no confirmed announcements yet, suggesting potential timing uncertainty, (2) South Africa's own October 2025 projection shows that countries may have realistic insights about FATF timelines that suggest June might be premature for some candidates, (3) the February 2025 changes being recent could mean some pipeline clearing has occurred, and (4) international bureaucratic processes can introduce delays even when technical requirements are met. The balance of evidence supports a high probability but with meaningful execution risk remaining. I'm updating modestly upward from 87% to 89% to reflect the strength of the multiple independent paths argument while maintaining appropriate caution about whether these pathways will convert to actual changes at the June plenary.",
