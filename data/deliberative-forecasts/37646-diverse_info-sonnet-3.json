    "review": "Both forecasters raised critical points I underweighted. Forecaster 2's observation about laser backhaul technology eliminating the need for in-country ground stations is crucial - this removes a major infrastructure barrier that likely drove the 4-8 month African timelines I cited. Forecaster 3 provided key timeline details I missed: the license was granted in mid-April 2025 (very recently), accompanied by high-level public announcements from both Musk and the Somali government, with Starlink stating service would be available 'nationwide soon.' This is fundamentally different from countries languishing in 'Coming Soon' status for years. I also failed to properly distinguish between application-to-availability timelines versus license-to-availability timelines - the latter is much shorter. The Bangladesh precedent may represent Starlink's improved deployment capability rather than an outlier. My 15% forecast was anchored too heavily on older base rates without accounting for technological improvements and the specific circumstances of this case.",
    "rationale": "After reviewing both analyses, I'm significantly updating upward from 15% to 70%. The key factors driving this update are: (1) Laser backhaul technology means no in-country gateway is required - Somalia can be served from neighboring ground stations, dramatically reducing deployment complexity. (2) The license was granted very recently (mid-April 2025), only about a month ago, with explicit public commitments from both Musk and Somali government. (3) Starlink representatives stated service would be available 'nationwide soon' - this is a much stronger signal than I initially appreciated. (4) The resolution bar is low - only 'anywhere in Somalia' needs to show as Available. (5) Six weeks is within the typical range for license-to-availability when regulatory approval is secured. I'm not going as high as Forecaster 3's 85% because 'soon' remains ambiguous, Somalia's operational environment does present real challenges for payment rails and device imports, and we haven't yet seen concrete deployment evidence like terminals being shipped or the country appearing in order dropdowns. However, the combination of very recent regulatory clearance, technological advantages, and public commitments makes a sub-July deployment more likely than not.",
