  "information": "As of early June 2025, the U.S. total public debt outstanding is approximately $36.2 trillion, according to U.S. Treasury data cited by multiple news outlets. This figure was reported as having reached $36.216 trillion by January 2025. Estimates of the debt's growth rate vary; one source indicates it is increasing by approximately $1 trillion every 180 days, while another suggests a faster rate of over $1 trillion every 100 days. The debt has grown by more than $13 trillion since 2020.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "About 23 days (until June 27, 2025)",
    "status_quo_outcome": "Yes — recent pace of debt growth suggests crossing $37T by late June if trends persist",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "A binding debt-limit constraint or unusual month-end/TGA dynamics cap Total Public Debt Outstanding below ~$37T through June 27 (e.g., ongoing extraordinary measures keep the reported total near ~36.2T).",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Normal deficit-driven issuance continues (or a late-breaking debt-limit resolution triggers catch-up issuance), lifting Total Public Debt Outstanding to or above $37T by June 27.",
    "rationale": "- Baseline level and trend: The assistant report cites ~$36.2T in early June 2025 and ~$36.216T in January 2025. Typical recent growth estimates range from ~$1T per ~180 days (slower) to >$1T per ~100 days (faster). Even the slower 6‑month pace implies +$1T from January to late June, which would put the total near or above $37T by the target date. This makes the status quo outcome a Yes.\n- Why not higher than my forecast? There is material uncertainty about the current reading. If the early-June figure is indeed ~36.2T, reaching $37T by June 27 would require an unusually large jump (~$800B in ~3 weeks) absent a discrete event (e.g., end of extraordinary measures) — that’s aggressive for such a short window. Also, April tax receipts can temporarily reduce borrowing needs, and Treasury cash/TGA management can create short-term dips or plateaus.\n- Why not lower? Structural deficits and ongoing issuance have driven very rapid increases in 2023–2025. If the debt limit is not binding, the recent run-rate strongly favors crossing $37T by late June. If there is a debt-limit overhang that resolves in June, a catch-up in issuance could produce a step-up that pushes the total above $37T quickly.\n- What would move my forecast up: Confirmation from the Treasury’s Debt to the Penny series (or Treasury’s monthly borrowing estimates) that total debt is already ≥$36.7–$36.8T by mid-June; signs of heavy net marketable borrowing or an announced end to extraordinary measures with catch-up issuance before June 27.\n- What would move it down: Evidence that the debt limit is binding through late June (flatlining totals), or Debt to the Penny still near ~36.2–36.4T by mid/late June without indications of an imminent catch-up.\n- Summary of assistant inputs used: Starting point around $36.2T (Jan and early June references) and growth rates ranging from ~$1T/180 days to >$1T/100 days. These imply that under normal conditions the threshold would be crossed by late June, but a binding ceiling could delay that.\nTaking these together, I place more weight on the status quo upward trend but discount for the short window and possible ceiling/TGA dynamics.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill the US national debt be greater than $37 trillion on June 27, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nBase rate information can be found at [Merchant Wholesalers, Except Manufacturers' Sales Branches and Offices: Durable Goods: Furniture and Home Furnishings Inventories/Sales Ratio](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/R4232IM163SCEN).\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if the value for Total Public Debt Outstanding at the Debt to the Penny chart at the US Treasury's [Debt to the Penny](https://fiscaldata.treasury.gov/datasets/debt-to-the-penny/debt-to-the-penny) tracker for June 27, 2025 is greater than or equal to $37,000,000,000,000.\n\nIf the resolution source does not report that specific date, then the resolution will be based on the amount corresponding with the first date after it.\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nAs of early June 2025, the U.S. total public debt outstanding is approximately $36.2 trillion, according to U.S. Treasury data cited by multiple news outlets.

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
