    "review": "Both forecasters provide valuable analysis, but Forecaster 3 raises critical new information I had not considered. The 2023 local government results showing essential parity between parties is highly significant - this is much more recent than the 2020 general election and suggests the current political landscape is extremely competitive, not clearly favoring PNM. Forecaster 3 also identifies an important geographic vulnerability: PNM's weakened position in Tobago (based on THA election results), where losing both seats in a 41-seat parliament could be decisive in a close race. Forecaster 2's emphasis on incumbency advantage is valid but may be slightly overconfident given these recent electoral indicators. The 2023 local results particularly challenge the 'status quo bias' I originally employed - if the most recent electoral test showed parity, the status quo may not be as favorable to PNM as I initially assessed.",
    "rationale": "Upon reflection, I gave too much weight to incumbency advantage and not enough consideration to the possibility that more recent electoral data contradicts a clear PNM edge. The 2023 local government results showing even support between parties is a more current indicator than the 2020 general election's 22-19 result. Combined with identified vulnerabilities in Tobago and the persistent issues of crime and economic concerns that affect incumbents, this election appears to be essentially a toss-up rather than a modest PNM advantage. However, I don't go all the way to 50% because: (1) incumbency still provides some structural advantages in resources and organization, (2) the early election call might indicate the government sees a window of opportunity, and (3) in close two-party races, holding government power does typically provide a marginal edge. The appropriate forecast should reflect near-maximum uncertainty while giving the slightest edge to the incumbent.",
