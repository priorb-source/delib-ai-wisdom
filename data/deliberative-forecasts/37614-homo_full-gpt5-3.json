    "review": "Both forecasters largely mirror my base-rate-first approach and emphasize the unusually severe allegation, small-electorate dynamics, and the mail-ballot timing. The one notable addition I hadn’t explicitly factored was Forecaster 3’s explicit incorporation of a small-but-nonzero resignation risk prior to Election Day (which would resolve as No). Forecaster 2’s point about limited runway for late persuasion with ballots already out is also a useful reinforcement. I find their reasoning sound and aligned with my prior; there’s no credible pro-Metz counter-signal (endorsements, favorable new facts, or turnout data) presented that would justify moving upward.",
    "rationale": "Starting near the ~40% survival base rate for recalls that make the ballot, the specific facts (felony charges from an incident framed by law enforcement as unjustified, sustained media attention) push the probability of retention meaningfully below baseline in a very small electorate where motivated recall backers can dominate. Mail ballots have already been distributed, reducing the chance that late-breaking information swings sentiment. Incorporating the explicit (low) risk of a pre-election resignation, which would also produce a No outcome, nudges the probability of retention slightly lower than my prior. I still allow for variance from small-N dynamics, personal networks, and due-process sentiment, but absent positive signals for Metz, the structural headwinds dominate.",
