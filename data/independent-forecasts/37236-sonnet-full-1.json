  "information": "According to the US Census Bureau, the US trade deficit for goods reached a record $162 billion in March 2025, a 9.6% increase from February. This was driven by a surge in imports, which increased by $16.3 billion to $342.7 billion. This rise in imports was attributed to businesses stockpiling goods in anticipation of new tariffs. US exports of goods in March 2025 increased by $2.2 billion to $180.8 billion, a 1.2% increase from February and a 6.8% increase from March 2024.\n\nSweeping new tariffs were implemented by the US administration on April 2, 2025, which were followed by retaliatory measures from multiple countries. Subsequent shipping data showed that China-US bookings were down 45% year-over-year. Additionally, manufacturing PMI reports from the period indicated contracting activity in the sector.\n\nTotal US exports for February 2025 were reported at $278.5 billion. Historical data shows that between 79% and 93% of Aprils have seen a year-over-year gain in exports. The Atlanta Federal Reserve estimated that trade subtracted 3 percentage points from GDP in the first quarter of 2025.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Approximately 5-6 weeks. The US Census Bureau typically releases monthly trade data about 6 weeks after the month ends, meaning April 2025 data should be published in early-to-mid June 2025.",
    "status_quo_outcome": "Yes - historically, between 79% and 93% of Aprils have shown year-over-year export gains, and the recent trend through March 2025 showed goods exports up 6.8% year-over-year despite various economic headwinds.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "The sweeping tariffs implemented on April 2, 2025, and subsequent retaliatory measures severely disrupt US export activity throughout the month. The 45% year-over-year drop in China-US shipping bookings extends broadly across trading partners. Manufacturing contraction reduces available goods for export. The disruption is severe enough that April 2025 exports fail to exceed the $262.578 billion threshold from April 2024.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Despite the tariff shock, April exports exceed the threshold due to: front-loading of shipments in early April before tariffs fully took effect, resilient services exports that are less affected by goods tariffs, currency depreciation making US exports more competitive in non-retaliatory markets, and diversification to trading partners not subject to disputes. The historical base rate of April increases proves stronger than the one-month disruption.",
    "rationale": "The threshold of $262.578 billion represents April 2024 exports. With February 2025 total exports at $278.5 billion and March showing continued positive year-over-year trends (6.8% gain in goods), the baseline expectation would strongly favor a Yes outcome given the 79-93% historical success rate for April increases. However, April 2025 presents an extraordinary disruption: tariffs implemented on April 2nd affected most of the month, China-US bookings collapsed 45% year-over-year, and manufacturing PMI showed contraction. The timing is critical - the tariffs hit at the start of April, meaning nearly the entire month operated under the new regime and retaliatory measures. The 45% China booking drop is particularly concerning as it suggests massive export disruption to a major trading partner. While some front-loading may have occurred in early April, and services exports might prove more resilient than goods, the severity and breadth of the disruption likely overwhelms these mitigating factors. The forecast is not lower because the historical base rate is very strong, March trends were still positive, and we lack complete information about services exports or other market diversification. The forecast is not higher because the leading indicators (shipping bookings, manufacturing PMI, retaliatory measures) all point to severe disruption that started at the month's beginning. For me to update higher, I would need evidence of strong services export resilience or data showing rapid recovery in shipping activity. To update lower, I would need confirmation that the China booking collapse extended broadly or that services exports also contracted sharply.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill the US Census Bureau report an increase in US exports in April 2025 compared with April 2024?\n\nQuestion background:\n[Experts React: How the world is responding to Trump’s ‘liberation day’ tariffs](https://www.atlanticcouncil.org/blogs/new-atlanticist/experts-react/experts-react-how-the-world-is-responding-to-trumps-liberation-day-tariffs/)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below.

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any).
