  "information": "The third estimate for Q1 2025 GDP incorporates more comprehensive source data than was available for previous estimates. This includes complete data for March on international trade in goods and services, construction spending, and manufacturers' and trade inventories. The third estimate will also incorporate updated data on federal and state government spending, as well as the results of annual benchmark revisions to trade and services data which can affect the final figures.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Approximately 3-4 weeks. The third estimate for Q1 2025 GDP is typically released around three months after the quarter ends, which would place it in late June 2025.",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No - the advance estimate showed Q1 2025 real GDP declined at an annualized rate of -0.3%, which is negative growth. Without change, this would remain below 0.0%.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "The third estimate confirms or shows even weaker GDP growth, remaining at or below 0.0% annualized. More comprehensive data on March trade, construction, inventories, and government spending confirms the economic weakness suggested in the advance estimate, or annual benchmark revisions further reduce the growth rate.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "The third estimate revises GDP growth upward to positive territory (above 0.0%). More complete March data reveals stronger economic activity than initially captured, particularly in international trade, construction spending, or inventories. The comprehensive data and benchmark revisions result in an upward revision of at least 0.4 percentage points, turning the -0.3% into positive growth.",
    "rationale": "The advance estimate of -0.3% annualized GDP growth is critically close to the 0.0% threshold. Historical BEA data shows that the average absolute revision between advance and third estimates typically ranges from 0.5-0.6 percentage points, meaning a revision large enough to flip the sign from negative to positive is well within normal bounds. The research assistant's information is crucial here: the third estimate incorporates substantially more comprehensive data including complete March figures for trade, construction, inventories, and government spending, plus annual benchmark revisions. These represent major data additions that could materially change the estimate. However, I must weight the status quo appropriately - the advance reading was negative, and the burden of evidence should favor that outcome persisting. The fact that it was 'lower than expected' suggests genuine economic weakness in Q1, not just measurement error. Without seeing the second estimate (which would have been released around late May and would signal revision direction), I'm forecasting with incomplete information about the revision trajectory. The probability is not higher because: (1) the advance estimate was clearly negative, (2) we lack concrete evidence the revisions will be upward, and (3) status quo bias favors the current reading. The probability is not lower because: (1) -0.3% is extremely close to zero, (2) typical revision magnitudes frequently exceed what's needed to flip the sign, and (3) the comprehensive new data sources being incorporated represent substantial information that could shift the estimate meaningfully in either direction. I would update upward if the second estimate (if available) showed movement toward positive territory, or if March economic data releases indicated strength. I would update downward if the second estimate revised further into negative territory.",
