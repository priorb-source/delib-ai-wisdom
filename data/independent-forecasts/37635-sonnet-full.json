  "information": "According to reports from May 2025, Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum has achieved a 76% approval rating, making her the best-evaluated president since the 1994-2000 term. In specific areas, 63.4% of respondents positively evaluated her management of poverty reduction, and her administration's policies have been linked to a 24.9% reduction in homicides. However, on transparency and anti-corruption, 57.4% of respondents had a negative perception. Her administration has announced a $298 billion investment plan. Some polls cited her approval rating as high as 82%.\n\nA survey in Argentina conducted between April 28 and 30, 2025, by D'Alessio IROL/Berensztein indicated growing wear on Javier Milei's government. The survey showed his positive image has decreased to 44%, while his negative image has increased to 52%, for a net differential of -8%. 52% of respondents believe the economic situation is worse than the previous year. The evaluation of his government is divided, with 50% rating it as good and 48% as bad. Security Minister Patricia Bullrich has the highest positive image in the cabinet at 47%, as insecurity is the main social concern for 72% of respondents.\n\nAn international survey by Morning Consult conducted between January 21 and 27, 2025, placed Claudia Sheinbaum's approval rating at 66% and Javier Milei's at 65%. A later report from April 30, 2025, citing Morning Consult data, showed Milei's approval at 61% and Sheinbaum's at 60%. In the January survey, Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi had the highest approval rating at 75%.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Approximately 45 days (from May 14, 2025 to June 28, 2025)",
    "status_quo_outcome": "Yes - Milei currently leads Sheinbaum 61% to 60% in the most recent Morning Consult data from April 30, 2025",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Sheinbaum's approval rating increases or holds steady while Milei's continues to decline, reflecting his deteriorating domestic image (44% positive, 52% negative in Argentine polls) and public dissatisfaction with economic conditions. Her strong domestic approval (76-82% in Mexican polls) and $298 billion investment plan begin to show up more strongly in Morning Consult data, allowing her to overtake or tie Milei's rating.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Milei maintains his narrow 1-point lead or extends it over the next 45 days. The relative momentum from January to April continues, where both leaders declined but Sheinbaum dropped more significantly (6 points vs 4 points). Morning Consult's methodology continues to show ratings that diverge from domestic polling, maintaining Milei's slight advantage.",
    "rationale": "This is essentially a coin flip given the extremely tight 1-point margin between the two leaders (61% vs 60% as of April 30, 2025). The short time horizon of 45 days typically favors status quo outcomes - with such little time remaining, major shifts are less likely. However, several factors create uncertainty: (1) Recent trend analysis shows volatility - Sheinbaum dropped 6 points from January to April while Milei dropped 4 points, with the lead flipping between them. This demonstrates both leaders' ratings can move substantially. (2) Domestic polling shows stark divergence - Argentine polls show Milei struggling badly with 44% positive/52% negative image and economic dissatisfaction, while Mexican polls show Sheinbaum at 76-82% approval. If Morning Consult's next update captures these domestic sentiments more fully, we could see a reversal. (3) The margin is within typical polling error, making this statistically a toss-up. I'm not going higher because: the domestic polling divergence suggests vulnerability in Milei's position, the margin is razor-thin, and both have shown significant movement recently. I'm not going lower because: status quo persistence typically works over short time horizons, Milei currently holds the lead (however narrow), and Morning Consult methodology may not fully track domestic polling swings. For me to update higher (toward 60-70%), I'd need to see interim polling showing Milei extending his lead or evidence that domestic Argentine concerns aren't affecting his international approval ratings. To update lower (toward 30-40%), I'd need evidence that Morning Consult is beginning to reflect the domestic polling divergence, or any major political/economic crisis for Milei.",
