    "review": "All three forecasts cluster tightly in the 25-35% range, suggesting strong agreement on the core dynamics. The key insights from the other forecasters that I should incorporate: (1) Forecaster 3's historical precedent point that Samoa has extended emergencies month-to-month before (COVID example) is valuable context I didn't consider - this suggests institutional willingness to extend when circumstances warrant; (2) Forecaster 2's stronger framing that extensions are 'common' for critical infrastructure failures adds weight beyond my more tentative assessment; (3) Forecaster 3's consideration of alternative emergency scenarios (though rated low) identifies an additional probability path I missed entirely. However, I also note that all three of us are working with the same fundamental constraint: zero evidence about current power conditions, repair progress, or extension plans. The fact that we're 9 days from resolution with no signals about extension is itself somewhat informative, though not dispositive. The scheduled April 29 end date remains the anchoring fact, and the one-day gap to April 30 means the status quo clearly favors No.",
    "rationale": "After reviewing the other analyses, I'm updating slightly upward but remaining in the consensus range. The historical precedent argument is compelling - if Samoa has demonstrated willingness to extend emergencies on a rolling basis, that increases the base rate for extension. The stronger framing about infrastructure crisis extensions being common also merits more weight than I initially gave. However, three factors keep me from moving higher: (1) We're now 9 days from the resolution date with no reported signals about extension plans - in a functioning government, we'd typically see some indication by now if extension were likely; (2) The explicit April 29 end date was chosen for a reason and represents the government's best estimate at the time; (3) The complete lack of information about current conditions means we can't assess whether the crisis persists at a level requiring extension. The 30% forecast appropriately balances the practical difficulties of resolving infrastructure crises quickly against the clear status quo of scheduled expiration and absence of extension signals.",
