  "information": "In May 2025, HR tech firm Rippling raised $450 million in a Series G funding round, which increased its valuation to $16.8 billion. As part of this event, the company also committed to a tender offer to repurchase up to $200 million in equity from current and former employees. Reports indicate Rippling has surpassed $100 million in annual recurring revenue and doubled it to over $350 million by the end of 2023. The company serves over 20,000 customers and the new funds are intended for enhancing its workforce management products and expanding global revenue.\n\nIn multiple interviews in May 2025, following the company's Series G funding round, Rippling CEO Parker Conrad stated that the company has \"no specific plans to go public\" and an IPO is \"not imminent.\" He emphasized that Rippling would need to be profitable before going public, stating, \"in order to be successful in the public markets, your growth rates have to come down so that you can be profitable.\" Conrad also mentioned that the company plans to conduct annual secondary liquidity programs, such as tender offers, for employees and investors.\n\nThe broader market for tech IPOs in May 2025 is described as thawing but selective. Several other fintech companies have recently been active in financing and potential public listings. Airwallex closed on $300 million, Chime has filed to go public, and Klarna filed an amended prospectus. In other company news, Rippling is involved in a high-profile legal battle with its rival Deel, involving accusations of corporate espionage. The company is also focused on operational growth, including international office expansion, such as a recent lease in Bengaluru.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Just over one month, as the question deadline is July 1, 2025.",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No. Rippling remains a private company and does not make any official IPO announcements.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Following its recent $450 million funding round and the CEO's public statements, Rippling's management focuses on product development and global expansion. The company utilizes its fresh capital and provides liquidity to employees via planned tender offers, negating the immediate need for an IPO. The July 1, 2025, deadline passes without an S-1 filing or a formal announcement on its website.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Despite the CEO's recent public statements to the contrary, the company has been secretly preparing for a public offering. A sudden and significant improvement in the tech IPO market, or pressure from its board and major investors to seize a perceived market window, prompts a surprise announcement just before the July 1, 2025 deadline.",
    "rationale": "The foundation for a low probability is the direct and very recent communication from Rippling's CEO, Parker Conrad, in May 2025. He explicitly stated the company has 'no specific plans to go public' and an IPO is 'not imminent.' This is the strongest form of evidence against a 'Yes' outcome, especially given the short timeframe of just over one month until the deadline. His remarks also included a precondition for an IPO—profitability—which he suggested was a future goal after a period of high growth. The company's recent actions reinforce this stance. The May 2025 raise of $450 million provides a substantial capital runway, removing the most common short-term driver for an IPO. Furthermore, the company's commitment to annual secondary liquidity programs, such as the recent tender offer, addresses the need to provide returns for employees and early investors, another key pressure point for going public. The combination of explicit C-level statements and corporate financial actions strongly indicates the status quo will hold for the near future.\n\nMy forecast is not lower (e.g., 1%) because CEO statements about IPO timing can sometimes be strategic misdirection to manage expectations or for competitive reasons. The IPO market is described as 'thawing,' and a sudden positive shift could theoretically accelerate plans. However, my forecast is not higher (e.g., 15%) because the combination of a massive, recent private funding round, a commitment to alternative liquidity options, and direct, public statements from the CEO against an imminent IPO creates a very high barrier for a 'Yes' outcome within the next ~40 days. \n\nI would increase my probability if credible reports from sources like Bloomberg or The Information emerged that Rippling had engaged investment banks for an IPO underwriting process. I would decrease my probability if CEO Parker Conrad were to reiterate his 'no imminent IPO' stance in a subsequent interview before the deadline.",

These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question will resolve as **Yes** if Rippling, Inc., announces before July 1, 2025, that it is planning an initial public offering. In order to streamline the resolution of this question, there are two resolution sources for the IPO announcement: 1) The company filing an [SEC Form S-1](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/sec-form-s-1.asp) or 2) An announcement at the [news](https://www.rippling.com/blog) section of its website.

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
