  "information": "The 17th BRICS Summit is scheduled for July 6-7, 2025, in Rio de Janeiro. As the host nation, Brazil's presidential adviser Celso Amorim stated in a May 11, 2025 interview that BRICS_ 'should stabilise where it is' before admitting more members. Official draft agendas for the summit, circulated in late April 2025, prioritize financial-architecture reforms and Global South development funds, containing only non-committal language regarding further enlargement. Brazil has invited Mexico, Uruguay, and Colombia to attend the summit as non-members.\n\nAt the 16th BRICS Summit, a 'partner country' framework was introduced. Of the initial invitees, Indonesia has since become a full member. Algeria, Turkey, and Vietnam have not yet confirmed their participation in the partner framework. On May 30, 2025, Kazakhstan's President Kassym-Jomart Tokayev publicly ruled out seeking full membership, stating that his country would maintain its observer status. He cited the organization's lack of permanent structures and a formal charter as reasons for this decision.\n\nThe admission of new full members to BRICS requires the unanimous consent of all existing members. An indication of the current internal climate came at the April 2025 foreign ministers’ meeting, where the bloc failed to reach an agreement on a joint communiqué. Ahead of the July summit, the 11th BRICS Parliamentary Forum is scheduled for June 3-5 in Brasília to discuss topics including sustainable development, climate action, and multilateral governance.",

    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "About 38 days (until 00:00 on July 8, 2025, Rio de Janeiro time)",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Brazil keeps the agenda focused on financial architecture and Global South financing. With Brazil and India preferring a pause and unanimity lacking, leaders issue language about criteria and the partner-track but make no full-member invitations before or during the summit.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "In late June, a consensus forms to elevate one relatively uncontroversial partner (e.g., Nigeria, Malaysia, Thailand, or Belarus) from partner to full member, or to extend a first-time full invitation to a guest like Uruguay or Colombia. Brazil accepts a narrow, single-country addition as a compromise to show momentum, and the bloc announces the invitation at or just before the summit.",
    "rationale": "- Status quo favors no new invitation: Brazil’s top adviser (Amorim) said BRICS should “stabilise where it is.” Draft agendas reportedly downplay enlargement, prioritizing financial-architecture reforms. Unanimity is required and the April 2025 foreign ministers’ meeting couldn’t even agree on a joint communiqué—signs of limited consensus for another expansion in July. As host, Brazil has agenda and process leverage.\n- Candidate pool signals are weak: Of 13 partner countries named in 2024, several haven’t confirmed participation (Algeria, Turkey, Vietnam). Kazakhstan publicly ruled out seeking full membership. There have been no credible leaks that a specific partner is queued for promotion. Brazil invited Mexico, Uruguay, and Colombia as guests, but public indications of them seeking membership are thin, and Mexico in particular has incentives to avoid provoking the U.S.\n- Timing: With roughly five weeks left, a full-membership invitation would likely leak or appear in preparatory documents if it were imminent. The fact that Indonesia’s January 2025 accession moved quickly from partner to full proves upgrades can be swift when consensus exists, so the probability is not near zero—but that case appears exceptional and came amid clear enthusiasm for Indonesia specifically.\n- Why not higher? Host preference to pause, unanimity hurdles (notably India’s caution), lack of candidate momentum, and recent coordination difficulties all point against a July invitation.\n- Why not lower? The partner framework gives a ready-made on-ramp; Russia and China may push for at least one addition to sustain BRICS’ expansion narrative; a last-minute consensus on a single relatively uncontentious partner is plausible.\n- Up/Down triggers: I would raise the probability if (a) credible reports emerge that Brazil is open to one addition; (b) a partner country publicly announces having submitted a formal request with visible multi-member backing; or (c) a joint pre-summit statement hints at ‘welcoming a new member’. I would lower it if Brazil reiterates a freeze, if India publicly argues against new members now, or if summit documentation explicitly limits outcomes to partner-track cooperation without full invitations.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill a new country be invited to BRICS at the 17th BRICS Summit?\n\nQuestion background:\n[BRICS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BRICS) is an intergovernmental organization originally founded by Brazil, Russia, India, and China, which held their first formal summit in 2009. South Africa was invited to join in 2010, completing the original five-member grouping. BRICS serves as a forum for cooperation among major emerging economies, with a focus on economic development, political coordination, and reform of international institutions.\n\nAt the [15th BRICS Summit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/15th_BRICS_summit) in August 2023, the group announced a major expansion. Full membership invitations were extended to Argentina, Egypt, Ethiopia, Iran, Saudi Arabia, and the United Arab Emirates. Argentina later declined the invitation, while Saudi Arabia has not formally accepted. Egypt, Ethiopia, Iran, and the UAE officially joined on January 1, 2024.&#x20;\n\nAt the [16th BRICS Summit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/16th_BRICS_summit) in October 2024, held in Kazan, Russia, BRICS formally introduced a new partner country framework. Thirteen countries were invited as partners at the 16th Summit: Algeria, Belarus, Bolivia, Cuba, Indonesia, Kazakhstan, Malaysia, Nigeria, Turkey, Thailand, Uganda, Uzbekistan, and Vietnam. Algeria, Turkey, and Vietnam have not yet confirmed participation. Indonesia later joined as a full member on January 6, 2025.\n\nThe 17th BRICS Summit is scheduled to take place on July 6–7, 2025, in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. Many countries have formally expressed interest in joining BRICS, but new members can only be admitted with unanimous agreement from existing members. While expansion remains a stated goal of the bloc, no new invitations have been confirmed.\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question will resolve as **Yes** if at least one previously not invited country is invited to join BRICS as a full member during or before the 17th BRICS summit.\n\nThis question will only resolve based upon an invitation for full membership, not partner status or any other status in the organisation.\n\n* An invitation of a partner country to become a full member will resolve this question as **Yes**.\n* Reinvitation of Saudi Arabia or Argentina will not be sufficient to resolve this question as **Yes**.&#x20;\n* Whether or not a country accepts its invitation will have no impact on this question.\n* If the 17th BRICS summit is delayed, that will not impact this question unless the delay is to after August 31, 2025, in which case this question will be annulled.\n* The specific cutoff for resolution will be 00:00 following the final day of the summit. For example, if the summit is held as expected on July 6-7, the cutoff will be July 8, 00:00. This question will use the timezone of the summit's location, if the summit has no physical location, it will use UTC.\n* For the purposes of this question, \"country\" is defined as a UN member state.\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nThe 17th BRICS Summit is scheduled for July 6-7, 2025, in Rio de Janeiro.

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
