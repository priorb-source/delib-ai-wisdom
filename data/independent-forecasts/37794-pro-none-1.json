    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Approximately 13 days. The outcome will be determined by player statistics on June 1, 2025.",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No. Based on historical precedent and statistical regression, it is most likely that any player currently near a .400 average will see their average dip below that mark by June 1.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "The leading hitters in the league experience a normal and expected regression to the mean. A few games where a player goes 1-for-4 or 2-for-5, which are very good performances, are enough to pull their batting average below the .400 threshold over the final two weeks of May.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "A player, most likely a high-contact hitter, maintains an exceptionally hot streak through the end of May. Buoyed by consistent multi-hit games and a high batting average on balls in play (BABIP), they manage to keep their average at or above .400 on the resolution date.",
    "rationale": "My forecast is based on the inherent difficulty of maintaining a .400 batting average in modern baseball, balanced against the fact that the resolution date is relatively early in the season. The primary factor supporting a 'No' outcome is regression to the mean. Pitching analysis, defensive shifts, and the sheer length of the season make a .400 average an extreme statistical outlier. For any player currently at or near that mark, the overwhelming mathematical probability is that their average will decrease over any significant number of at-bats. However, the question resolves on June 1, only about two months into the season. This is a crucial detail, as small sample sizes can support such outliers. History shows this is plausible; Chipper Jones was hitting .409 on June 1, 2008, and Luis Arráez was over .400 as late as June 2, 2023. These recent examples demonstrate that while rare, the event is not impossible and occurs roughly once a decade. The existence of a player like Arráez, who specializes in high-contact hitting, increases the chances compared to a baseline from 15-20 years ago. My forecast of 25% reflects a 1-in-4 chance, acknowledging the event's rarity but giving significant weight to the recent historical precedents. The probability is not higher because of the strong statistical pull of regression that affects even the hottest hitters over a two-week period. It is not lower because it has happened multiple times in the last two decades, proving it is a repeatable, albeit infrequent, phenomenon. I would increase my forecast if a specific player had a significant cushion (e.g., a .425 average) with two weeks to go. I would decrease it if no player was currently over .390.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill any major league baseball player have a .400 batting average on June 1, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\ntheScore: [How long can Judge's .400 batting average last?](https://www.thescore.com/mlb/news/3284701/how-long-can-judges-400-batting-average-last)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if on June 1, 2025, any Major League Baseball player in the 2025 regular season has a batting average of greater than or equal to .400 according to the [ESPN baseball stats page](https://www.espn.com/mlb/stats)\n\n\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nNo additional information available.\n\nToday is 2025-05-19.\n\nBefore answering you think:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n(e) You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
