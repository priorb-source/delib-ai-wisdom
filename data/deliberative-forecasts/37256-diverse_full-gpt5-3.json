    "review": "Both forecasters largely corroborate my view: the short window, empty legislative calendar, competing crises, and lack of budget provisioning all point to inaction before July 1. They didn’t introduce new factual evidence, but their emphasis on the May–June order paper and the end-of-May checkpoint for further downgrades is a useful framing. I find their reasoning sound and consistent with observable bottlenecks. The consensus suggests my initial 10% may be a touch high given the multi-step process and legislative cadence.",
    "rationale": "I continue to see the base case as non-ratification by July 1. Procedural hurdles remain: tabling and passing a bill in an infrequently sitting legislature, securing presidential assent, and depositing instruments with the AU—all within ~60 days—while the government is preoccupied with a fiscal crisis, political instability, and election prep. No public scheduling or budgeting signals have surfaced. The pro-ratification rhetoric (Trade Minister, Chamber of Commerce, EAC technical support) keeps a non-zero chance of a fast-track push, and deposit logistics could be rapid if the political decision is made. However, with no bill on the order paper and fresh political turmoil, a swift, coordinated sequence is unlikely. Given peer consensus and the lack of any concrete procedural movement, I’m trimming my estimate slightly. I would move up if an AfCFTA ratification bill is tabled or expedited sessions are announced with a clear presidential push; I would move down if mid/late May passes with no movement or if further instability sidelines the Assembly.",
