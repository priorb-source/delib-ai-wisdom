  "information": "As of March 12, 2025, BC Hydro officially excluded Tesla products, including electric vehicle chargers, energy storage batteries, and inverters, from its CleanBC and BC Hydro rebate programs. The stated reason for the policy change is to preference Canadian goods and exclude U.S.-produced goods where practicable, as part of a broader trade dispute. The EV charger rebate for single-family homes covers up to 50% of the cost, to a maximum of $350. The policy was publicly defended by B.C. Premier David Eby and Energy Minister Adrian Dix. Products purchased or pre-approved before March 12, 2025, remain eligible for the rebate.\n\nIn the Canadian market, Tesla has experienced a significant downturn in early 2025. New vehicle registrations in Québec dropped by 85-90% in the first quarter of the year. Concurrently, a J.D. Power survey indicated a shift in Canadian consumer preference, with Tesla falling from second to eighth place among most-considered EV brands. Other manufacturers, such as General Motors, surpassed Tesla as the top seller of EVs in Canada during this period. Public sentiment has also been a factor, with protests occurring at a B.C. Tesla dealership on March 23, 2025, where participants called for a boycott of the company.\n\nThe exclusion of Tesla from B.C.'s rebate program occurred within a broader context of shifting trade policies and incentives. Canada's federal iZEV rebate program, which offered up to $5,000 for EV purchases, ended on March 31, 2025. A 25% tariff on U.S.-made electric vehicles is also in effect. The B.C. government's action to preference domestic goods extends beyond the EV sector; for instance, the province has also removed U.S. liquor products from the shelves of government-run liquor stores as part of the ongoing trade friction with the United States.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Approximately 1 month. Today is May 30, 2025, and the question will be resolved based on BC Hydro's website status on or after July 1, 2025.",
    "status_quo_outcome": "Yes - Tesla products remain excluded from BC Hydro's EV charger rebate program. The exclusion policy was implemented on March 12, 2025, and has been in effect for about 2.5 months with no indication of reversal.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "BC Hydro reverses its policy before July 1, 2025, due to resolution of U.S.-Canada trade tensions, legal or political pressure, or a change in government priorities. The website would either explicitly state Tesla is now eligible or remove language about Tesla being ineligible.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "The current policy remains unchanged through July 2025. The BC Hydro website continues to state that Tesla products are not eligible for the EV charger rebate program, consistent with the broader strategy to preference Canadian goods and exclude U.S. products where practicable.",
    "rationale": "The status quo strongly favors a Yes outcome. The exclusion policy has been in place since March 12, 2025, with strong political backing from Premier David Eby and Energy Minister Adrian Dix. This isn't an isolated policy but part of a broader trade response including 25% tariffs on U.S.-made EVs and removal of U.S. liquor products from government stores. The policy context suggests institutional commitment rather than a temporary measure. Tesla's significant market decline in Canada (85-90% drop in Quebec registrations, falling from 2nd to 8th in brand consideration) reduces political pressure for reversal. The federal iZEV rebate program also ended March 31, 2025, showing consistent multi-level government movement away from supporting non-Canadian EVs. With only 1 month until resolution, policy changes would require rapid action with no current evidence of such plans. My forecast is not higher (95%+) because 1 month allows time for unexpected policy shifts, trade negotiations can move quickly under pressure, and we lack complete information about behind-the-scenes discussions. It's not lower (70% or below) because the short timeframe, strong political backing, broader policy context, and complete absence of reversal signals all strongly support continuation. A reversal would require significant new developments we have no evidence for.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill BC Hydro still exclude Tesla from its EV charger rebate program for single-family homes in July 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nAccording to the resolution source, \"The Government of B.C. and BC Hydro are taking action to preference Canadian goods in our rebate programs going forward and to exclude, where practicable, U.S. produced goods. As of March 12, 2025, Tesla products (electric vehicle chargers, energy storage batteries and inverters) are not eligible for CleanBC and BC Hydro rebates. If you purchased or have received pre-approval for your Tesla product before March 12, 2025, it can still qualify for rebates and will be processed as normal.\"\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if BC Hydro at [this page](https://www.bchydro.com/powersmart/electric-vehicles/rebates-incentives/rebates-home-chargers.html) when checked by Metaculus on or after July 1, 2025, says that Tesla products are not eligible for the EV charger at home program. If it does not mention Tesla being ineligible, then this question resolves as **No**.\n\n\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nAs of March 12, 2025, BC Hydro officially excluded Tesla products, including electric vehicle chargers, energy storage batteries, and inverters, from its CleanBC and BC Hydro rebate programs.

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
