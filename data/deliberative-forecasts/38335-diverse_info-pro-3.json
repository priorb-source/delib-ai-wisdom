    "review": "The other forecasters introduced two compelling arguments that I had not fully weighed. Forecaster 2 highlighted the active House probe into Hope Florida, noting that politicians typically avoid launching major campaigns under the cloud of an investigation. This is a significant, concrete reason for delay. Forecaster 3 astutely pointed out that as a first-time candidate for office, Casey DeSantis would likely require more, not less, time to build a statewide operation, which tempers the idea that her high name recognition would allow for an unusually fast launch. Both forecasters also mentioned the June 30th (Q2) fundraising deadline as a potential motivator for a 'Yes' outcome, which is a valid point, though I believe they may be overweighting it relative to the strong countervailing factors.",
    "rationale": "I am updating my forecast downward. My initial 15% probability was based primarily on the rapidly closing timeline and the lack of any observable campaign preparations. The analyses from my colleagues have reinforced this view and added crucial context that makes an announcement before July 1 even less likely. The House probe into Hope Florida provides a strong political incentive to postpone a campaign launch to avoid having the announcement narrative consumed by an active investigation. Furthermore, the insight that a first-time statewide candidate typically needs a longer runway to launch undercuts the argument that her existing network and name ID would enable a surprise, last-minute entry. These new factors significantly strengthen the case for a 'No' resolution. The potential strategic benefit of an announcement to meet the Q2 fundraising deadline now seems minimal compared to the clear political and logistical downsides of a rushed launch under current circumstances. Therefore, I am reducing my probability from 15% to 8%.",
