  "information": "As of late May 2025, an International Monetary Fund (IMF) mission is in Beirut for formal negotiations with the Lebanese government. The first negotiating session took place on May 29-30, with a second round scheduled for June 10. According to officials, a draft 46-month Extended Fund Facility (EFF) worth approximately US$3 billion is being discussed. Lebanon's Finance Minister, Yassine Jaber, stated that there has been progress in the talks, describing them as being on a 'good track.' He also affirmed that the government's plan involves better collection of existing taxes rather than imposing new ones. The Lebanese negotiating team includes the Minister of Economy, the Governor of the Central Bank, and other experts, meeting with the IMF delegation led by Ernesto Rigo.\n\nThe IMF has conditioned an agreement on the implementation of several key reforms. While Lebanon has completed some prior actions, including passing amendments to the bank-secrecy law and establishing an electricity-tariff framework, significant obstacles remain. The passage of a bank-restructuring law and measures to control the cash economy are described as unresolved and politically contentious issues. The IMF has publicly characterized the progress in talks as 'slow' and has expressed specific concerns about provisions in the proposed banking reform law, including the composition of a 'Higher Banking Authority' and the scope of its powers.\n\nSeveral international actors are involved in Lebanon's economic recovery efforts. The European Union has announced that a 500 million euro aid payment is conditional on Lebanon restructuring its banking sector and securing an agreement with the IMF. Separately, the World Bank is in active discussions with Lebanese officials regarding a 'Lebanon Emergency Assistance Project' (LEAP) aimed at reconstruction. A meeting to present this project to donor countries and international institutions is scheduled for June 10. On the domestic front, Lebanese President Joseph Aoun has publicly emphasized the importance of reaching an agreement with the IMF before the summer of 2025.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "31 days until July 1, 2025",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No agreement announced. Negotiations continue but remain incomplete by the deadline.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Political gridlock on contentious banking reforms prevents consensus. Despite multiple negotiating rounds, the IMF's concerns about the bank-restructuring law provisions and cash economy controls remain unresolved. The 31-day timeframe proves too tight to overcome Lebanon's historical political dysfunction, and while talks continue, no formal agreement is announced by July 1.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "The current negotiating momentum accelerates. The June 10 second round produces breakthroughs on banking reform and cash economy issues. Facing intense pressure from President Aoun's 'before summer' deadline, EU conditionality, and domestic economic crisis, all parties make necessary compromises. The IMF and Lebanon announce a staff-level agreement or agreement in principle for the ~$3 billion Extended Fund Facility by late June.",
    "rationale": "This forecast balances competing signals from active negotiations against significant obstacles within a tight timeframe. FAVORING YES: Negotiations are literally happening right now (May 29-30 session), with a second round already scheduled for June 10. Lebanon's Finance Minister describes talks as on a 'good track' with progress. A draft $3B Extended Fund Facility already exists. President Aoun has explicitly emphasized reaching agreement 'before summer of 2025,' creating political urgency. The EU's conditional 500 million euro aid package provides additional external pressure. Critically, the question only requires an announcement, not full implementation—staff-level agreements or agreements in principle could count. FAVORING NO: The IMF publicly characterizes progress as 'slow' and has expressed specific concerns about the banking reform law. Key obstacles—the bank-restructuring law and cash economy controls—are described as 'politically contentious' and unresolved. Lebanon has a history of political paralysis; a 2022 IMF staff-level agreement was never implemented due to reform failures. Only 31 days remain, which may be insufficient for resolving complex technical and political issues even with motivation. The base rate for IMF agreements in similar contexts suggests caution. BALANCING: While the active negotiations and political pressure create real momentum, the IMF's characterization of 'slow' progress combined with Lebanon's track record suggests significant probability of missing the deadline. The distinction between announcement and full implementation provides some upside, but substantial unresolved issues remain. My forecast would increase if: IMF officials signal breakthrough progress after June 10 talks, banking reform law concerns are publicly resolved, or if there are leaked reports of imminent agreement. It would decrease if: June 10 talks are postponed/inconclusive, IMF issues stronger critical statements, or domestic political conflicts emerge over required reforms.",
