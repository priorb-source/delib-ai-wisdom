  "information": "The advance estimate for Q1 2025 annualized real GDP growth was -0.3%. The second estimate, released on May 29, 2025, was an upward revision to -0.2%. Key factors driving the contraction in the first quarter included a significant increase in imports, which subtracted 4.90 percentage points from GDP, and a reduction in government spending, which subtracted 0.12 percentage points. These negative factors were partially offset by positive contributions from investment (+3.98 percentage points) and consumer spending (+0.80 percentage points).\n\nHistorical analyses of BEA data by the St. Louis Fed show that revisions which change the sign of GDP growth from negative to positive are uncommon, happening in less than 20% of such cases. Another analysis covering the period from 1996 to 2024 indicates that when an advance estimate is between -0.5% and 0%, the third estimate turns positive in roughly 35-40% of instances. The typical absolute revision from the second to the third estimate is about 0.1 to 0.2 percentage points, while the absolute average revision from the advance to the third estimate is larger, at approximately 0.5 percentage points.\n\nThe third estimate for Q1 2025 GDP incorporates more comprehensive source data than was available for previous estimates. This includes complete data for March on international trade in goods and services, construction spending, and manufacturers' and trade inventories. The third estimate will also incorporate updated data on federal and state government spending, as well as the results of annual benchmark revisions to trade and services data which can affect the final figures.",

    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Approximately 3 weeks. The third estimate for Q1 2025 GDP is typically released around June 26, 2025, which is about 3 weeks from today (June 5, 2025).",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No. The current second estimate stands at -0.2% annualized real GDP growth. If the third estimate shows no significant change, it would remain negative and thus not show an increase greater than 0.0%.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "The third estimate remains at or below 0.0%. This could occur if the additional comprehensive source data (complete March international trade, construction spending, manufacturers' inventories, and annual benchmark revisions) either confirms the current negative reading or shows further downward pressure. The typical revision magnitude of 0.1-0.2 percentage points from second to third estimate might be insufficient or in the wrong direction to turn the number positive.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "The third estimate is revised upward by more than 0.2 percentage points, pushing the annualized real GDP growth above 0.0%. This could happen if the more complete data reveals stronger-than-initially-estimated economic activity in March, particularly in areas like services trade, construction spending, or inventory adjustments that offset the large import drag.",
    "rationale": "The current trajectory shows modest upward momentum: the advance estimate was -0.3%, revised up to -0.2% in the second estimate (+0.1 percentage point revision). For a Yes outcome, we need the third estimate to show an additional upward revision of more than 0.2 percentage points to turn positive.\n\nThe key evidence from my research assistant:\n1. Historical analysis shows that when advance estimates fall between -0.5% and 0%, roughly 35-40% turn positive by the third estimate\n2. Typical second-to-third estimate revisions are 0.1-0.2 percentage points in absolute terms\n3. Sign changes from negative to positive are uncommon overall (<20% of all cases), but more common in this narrow range\n4. The average absolute revision from advance to third estimate is ~0.5 percentage points\n\nThe current -0.2% reading is very close to the 0% threshold, requiring only a modest upward revision. We've already seen one upward revision, suggesting potential momentum. However, the status quo strongly favors negative growth remaining negative, as world changes slowly.\n\nMy forecast is not higher because: (1) most GDP sign changes don't occur, (2) the -0.2% is still meaningfully negative, (3) the large import drag (-4.90 percentage points) is a structural factor unlikely to be fully revised away, and (4) I must respect base rates and status quo bias.\n\nMy forecast is not lower because: (1) the historical 35-40% rate for this specific range is a strong empirical anchor, (2) we've already observed upward revision momentum, (3) we're very close to 0%, and (4) the third estimate incorporates more complete data that could reveal underestimated positive factors.\n\nTo update higher: I would need evidence of significant measurement errors in the import data, unexpected strength in March economic indicators, or news suggesting the benchmark revisions will be substantially positive.\n\nTo update lower: I would need preliminary data suggesting March was weaker than estimated, confirmation that import surge was accurate, or signals that benchmark revisions will be negative.",

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any).
