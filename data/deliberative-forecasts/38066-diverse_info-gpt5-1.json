    "review": "- Forecaster 2: I agree with the base-rate point that joint headliner sessions are uncommon and would likely be marketed if planned; that’s a solid, underappreciated signal against a joint appearance this close to the event. Their weighting of YC’s incentives and Altman’s YC ties mirrors my priors.\n- Forecaster 3: I’m skeptical of two key premises: (1) that there is an “active” Musk–OpenAI/Altman lawsuit as of late May 2025 (my understanding is Musk dropped his suit in 2024), and (2) a purported $97.4B hostile takeover bid, which seems unlikely and is uncorroborated here. If those claims are inaccurate, their argument overstates the degree of current, formal conflict. The rest (status quo programming norms, risk management by organizers) is reasonable.\n- Net: F2 adds a credible marketing/agenda signal that nudges down; F3’s strongest downward claims rely on facts I can’t verify and likely overstate the conflict, so I don’t adopt them.",
    "rationale": "- Baseline: Conferences generally schedule adversarial, high-profile figures separately; joint appearances are rare unless intentionally curated. With ~20 days to go and no published joint billing, odds favor separate slots.\n- Downside risks: Musk’s in-person attendance reliability and potential last-minute format changes (remote, no-show) create additional paths to No under the strict “share a physical stage” criterion.\n- Offsetting factors: YC’s incentive to engineer a headline moment at a new, student-focused event; Altman’s public olive branch in May 2025; and the substantial PR upside if they want to signal détente. These keep the probability meaningfully above a token single-digit.\n- Update vs. prior (24% → 23%): Slight nudge down due to F2’s point that a planned joint moment would likely be teased by now to maximize buzz. I do not incorporate F3’s stronger downward push because it hinges on contested or unverified facts about ongoing litigation and a takeover bid.\n- What would move me: Up if the agenda lists a joint interview/panel or credible reporting indicates a planned joint appearance and confirmed in-person attendance for both; down if the detailed schedule shows separate talks with no shared plenary/open/close, or if indications emerge that Musk will appear remotely or skip.",
