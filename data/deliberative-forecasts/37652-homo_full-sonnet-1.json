    "review": "All three forecasters converged on a remarkably narrow range of 65-72%, which increases my confidence that this range captures the true probability well. We all identified the same key drivers: Carney's honeymoon period (only 2 months into term by July 1), his pre-election 48% approval, Trump's historically constrained approval ceiling (typically 40-45%), strong anti-Trump sentiment in Canada (77% negative), and the short 6-7 week timeframe limiting dramatic shifts. Forecaster 2 raised a valuable point about uncertainty regarding whether Morning Consult's specific methodology aligns with general polling trends, adding measurement uncertainty. Forecaster 3 correctly noted we lack current May 2025 Morning Consult baseline data for either leader, meaning we're extrapolating from March general polling. However, both these uncertainties cut both ways - we don't know if actual current data would favor Carney more or less than our estimates. All three analyses identified similar risks (deficit concerns, trade war economic impact) and similar reasons for not going higher (unexpected events, lack of current data) or lower (strong honeymoon effect, short timeframe). The convergence itself is informative and validates the core reasoning.",
    "rationale": "After reviewing the other forecasters' analyses, I find no compelling arguments to significantly update my forecast. The three-way convergence around 65-72% suggests this range is well-calibrated. The key dynamics remain: (1) Carney is definitively in his honeymoon period with only 9 weeks in office by July 1, (2) honeymoon periods rarely end in such short timeframes absent major crises, (3) Trump's approval has structural constraints in the low-to-mid 40s based on historical data, (4) Canadian anti-Trump sentiment provides additional support for Carney's relative positioning. The measurement uncertainty points raised by Forecasters 2 and 3 are valid but don't clearly push the probability in either direction. The deficit and trade war risks exist but seem unlikely to fully erode a honeymoon bounce in just 6 weeks. While I acknowledge we're working without current Morning Consult baseline data, the available evidence strongly suggests Carney will maintain higher approval than Trump on July 1, 2025. My original 70% forecast sits appropriately in the middle of the forecaster range and reflects both the strong baseline case for Yes and the non-trivial risks that prevent higher confidence.",
