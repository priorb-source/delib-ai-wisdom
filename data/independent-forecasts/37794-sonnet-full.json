  "information": "As of mid-May 2025, New York Yankees player Aaron Judge's batting average was reported at various points between .402 and .423. On May 17, after a 2-for-4 game, his average reached .414, though a subsequent 0-for-5 game lowered it. By May 18, Judge had accumulated 15 home runs and 41 RBI for the season, leading the league in several offensive categories. An analysis by MLB.com noted that achieving a .414 batting average with over 15 home runs within a team's first 44 games is a rare historical feat, with parallels to seasons by Mickey Mantle in 1956 and Manny Ramirez in 2001.\n\nAccording to a list of National League batting leaders published on May 18, 2025, Freddie Freeman of the Los Angeles Dodgers was leading with a .375 average. Other top hitters included Will Smith (Los Angeles Dodgers) at .336, Brendan Donovan (St. Louis Cardinals) at .330, and Manny Machado (San Diego Padres) at .323. In the American League, David Alonso of the New York Mets had a team-high batting average of .308 as of May 17. In Triple-A, Chicago Cubs prospect Matt Shaw was reported to be hitting .400 over his last eight games.\n\nThe last Major League Baseball player to finish a season with a batting average of .400 or higher was Ted Williams, who hit .406 in 1941. One analysis noted that modern players face challenges in reaching this mark, such as higher strikeout rates; early in the 2025 season, Aaron Judge had 31 strikeouts, whereas Williams had only 27 in his entire 1941 season. Another factor is Batting Average on Balls In Play (BABIP). The major league-wide BABIP in 2025 is .288, compared to .300 in 1930. In 2000, Ichiro Suzuki recorded a .387 batting average but was limited to 105 games due to an injury.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "13 days - the question resolves on June 1, 2025, and today is May 19, 2025",
    "status_quo_outcome": "YES - Aaron Judge currently has a batting average of approximately .414, which is well above the .400 threshold",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Aaron Judge goes into a significant slump over the next 11-13 games, hitting below .350 during this stretch, causing his average to drop below .400 by June 1. No other player manages to reach .400 during this period.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Aaron Judge maintains his current hot hitting, going at least 12-for-35 (.343) or better over his next approximate 35 at-bats to keep his average at or above .400 through June 1. Alternatively, another player like Freddie Freeman (.375) goes on an exceptional hot streak.",
    "rationale": "The status quo strongly favors a YES outcome. Judge is currently at .414, significantly above the .400 threshold with only 13 days remaining. With approximately 11-13 games left (roughly 35-40 at-bats), he has considerable cushion. Using rough math: if Judge has around 58 hits in 140 at-bats (.414), he would need to hit approximately .343 or better over his next 35 at-bats to maintain a .400 average. This is below league average but not an extreme slump. Working against this: (1) Batting averages naturally regress toward league mean (.240-.260 range), (2) Judge already has 31 strikeouts suggesting some volatility, (3) Historical precedent shows .400 averages are extremely rare - no one has finished above .400 since Ted Williams in 1941, and (4) modern challenges like higher strikeout rates and lower BABIP (.288 vs .300 in 1930). Working in favor: (1) Very short timeframe - variance works both ways over 13 days, (2) Judge has been consistently hot all season, not just a few-game fluke, (3) His lead performance (15 HR, 41 RBI) suggests genuine skill elevation, (4) The next closest NL player (Freeman at .375) would need an extraordinary run. The probability is not higher because baseball has high game-to-game variance and Judge could easily go 1-for-15 over 3-4 games, dropping him well below .400. The probability is not lower because the timeframe is very short and his current cushion is substantial. I would revise upward if Judge goes 8-for-15 or better in his next few games. I would revise downward if he goes 2-for-15 or worse.",
