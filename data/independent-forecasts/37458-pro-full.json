  "information": "The last mutually acknowledged phone call between Donald Trump and Xi Jinping took place on January 17, 2025. Since then, Trump has claimed to have spoken with Xi on multiple occasions, but China's Foreign Ministry has repeatedly and publicly denied that any leader-to-leader calls have occurred. On May 5, 2025, President Trump stated he had 'no immediate plans to speak with Chinese President Xi Jinping.' Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Guo Jiakum reiterated that 'the two heads of state have not called each other recently' and that no negotiations on tariffs are underway.\n\nThe US and China are engaged in an ongoing trade war. The Trump administration has imposed tariffs of up to 145% on most Chinese imports, and China has retaliated with tariffs of up to 125% on US goods. On May 6, 2025, Trump stated that Chinese officials want to negotiate, but on the same day, US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent told Congress that no official negotiations have begun between the two countries. High-level trade talks between Treasury Secretary Bessent and Chinese Vice Premier He Lifeng are scheduled to take place in Geneva on May 10-11, 2025.\n\nIn March 2025, news outlets including The Wall Street Journal reported that the US and China were in the early stages of discussing a potential 'birthday summit' for June, as Trump's birthday is on June 14 and Xi's is on June 15. The status of these discussions is uncertain. In early May 2025, Chinese President Xi Jinping is on a state visit to Russia from May 7 to 10 to meet with President Vladimir Putin and attend Victory Day celebrations. Topics for their discussion include strategic relations and the US tariff war.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "About 5 weeks, with the resolution period ending June 15, 2025.",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No. The current state of relations is defined by high tariffs, mutual distrust, and a lack of acknowledged high-level communication for months.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "The high-level trade talks in Geneva on May 10-11 conclude without a major breakthrough. Diplomatic friction continues, the 'birthday summit' idea does not materialize, and both leaders revert to communicating through public statements and lower-level officials. No mutually acknowledged call occurs by the June 15 deadline.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "The Geneva trade talks yield an unexpected breakthrough on key tariff issues. To solidify the agreement and manage the public announcement, President Trump and President Xi hold a phone call in late May or early June, which is subsequently confirmed by both governments.",
    "rationale": "My forecast is based on the strong status quo of non-communication at the highest level. The last acknowledged call was in January 2025, and since then, the relationship has been characterized by public friction. China has repeatedly denied Trump's claims of more recent calls, and Trump himself stated on May 5 that he has 'no immediate plans' to speak with Xi. The resolution criteria are strict, requiring acknowledgment from both sides, which raises the bar for a 'Yes' outcome given the current environment of distrust. Therefore, the baseline forecast is 'No'.\n\nHowever, I am assigning a non-trivial probability to 'Yes' primarily due to the upcoming high-level trade talks in Geneva on May 10-11. These talks represent a significant opportunity for a shift in the status quo. A major breakthrough could necessitate a leader-level call to finalize an agreement, while a severe breakdown could prompt an emergency call to de-escalate. The previously reported discussions about a 'birthday summit' in June, while uncertain, also provide a potential context for a preparatory call during the resolution period.\n\nMy forecast is not lower than 25% because the Geneva talks are a concrete, scheduled event that could plausibly change the dynamic between the two countries within the forecast window. A substantive outcome from those talks is the most likely path to a 'Yes'.\n\nMy forecast is not higher than 25% because the existing obstacles are significant and recent. The public statements from both sides currently point away from a call, and overcoming the deep-seated trade disagreements and diplomatic mistrust in just a few weeks would require a major political shift. The default outcome remains that the talks in Geneva will not be decisive enough to require immediate leader-level intervention. I would increase my forecast if credible reports emerge of a breakthrough in Geneva or a revival of the summit plans. I would decrease it if the Geneva talks end in a public stalemate.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill Donald Trump and Xi Jinping speak on the phone with each other before June 15, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nCBS News: [Trump says he's talked with Xi about tariffs.
