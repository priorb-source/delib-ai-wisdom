    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Approximately one month, until July 1, 2025.",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No. Senator Fetterman will continue to caucus with the Democrats through the deadline.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Despite media reports highlighting his independent streak and friction with some members of his party, Senator Fetterman continues to caucus with the Democrats through June 2025. The practical benefits of caucus membership, such as committee assignments and legislative influence, along with his public commitment not to resign, lead him to maintain the status quo.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Triggered by a significant and unexpected health issue, or due to the mounting personal and political pressures described in recent reporting, Senator Fetterman makes the difficult decision to resign from the Senate before July 1, 2025, thereby ceasing to caucus with the Democrats.",
    "rationale": "The strong default position in a forecast of this nature is the status quo. U.S. Senators very rarely resign or switch parties mid-term. The institutional and political inertia is immense. Senator Fetterman was elected as a Democrat in a swing state, and leaving the caucus would severely damage his political future and alienate his voter base. Furthermore, Fetterman has explicitly and recently stated he will not resign in response to media speculation.\n\nMy probability is not lower than 3% because there are specific, non-trivial risk factors at play. Firstly, Senator Fetterman has a well-documented and serious health history, including a stroke and a bout of clinical depression. This history creates a higher-than-average tail risk of a health-related resignation. Secondly, the provided articles from May 2025 describe a senator who is unusually 'isolated' and 'angry', indicating a level of personal and political stress that could, in an extreme scenario, lead to an unexpected decision. These factors elevate the probability above the near-zero baseline for a typical senator.\n\nMy probability is not higher than 3% because the timeframe is very short (approximately one month), and the barriers to a 'Yes' outcome are extremely high. A party switch is politically implausible. A resignation would go directly against his recent public statements. The most likely path to a 'Yes' outcome is a sudden health crisis, which is inherently a low-probability event in any given month.\n\nI would increase my forecast upon learning of a new, serious health concern or receiving credible reports from his inner circle that he is reconsidering his position. I would decrease my forecast if Fetterman were to make further public statements reaffirming his commitment to the party or if reporting suggested a reconciliation with the Democratic caucus leadership.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill Senator John Fetterman cease caucusing with the Democrats before July 1, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\n[Fetterman says he won’t resign, gets support from McCormick as article blowback continues](https://www.pennlive.com/news/2025/05/fetterman-says-he-wont-resign-gets-support-from-mccormick-as-article-blowback-continues.html) | [An isolated, angry Fetterman is yet another challenge for Democrats](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2025/05/16/john-fetterman-senate-relationships/)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if, before July 1, 2025, John Fetterman ceases caucusing with the [Senate Democrats](https://www.democrats.senate.gov/about-senate-dems/our-caucus) for any reason, whether because he switches parties, resigns, or any other reason.\n\n\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nNo additional information available.\n\nToday is 2025-05-29.\n\nBefore answering you think:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n(e) You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
