  "information": "Tourism in the Turks and Caicos Islands grew significantly in 2024, with the islands welcoming nearly two million visitors across air and cruise travel. This total represents a 10.66% increase in air arrivals and a 30.48% increase in cruise passengers compared to the previous year. New airline routes have been added to accommodate the demand, including a nonstop American Airlines service from Miami to South Caicos launched in March 2025. Concurrently, the U.S. Department of State maintains a Level 2 \"exercise increased caution\" travel advisory for TCI, first issued in July 2023, citing crime levels and reminding travelers of the islands' strict laws against firearms and ammunition.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "About 60 days (until July 1, 2025)",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Authorities continue to deem app-based ride-hailing unlicensed; taxi associations oppose rideshare; the government maintains or steps up enforcement against “illegal taxis,” and Uber does not list Turks and Caicos on its website or app.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Uber secures government permission or a workaround by integrating licensed taxis, announces a launch, and adds Turks and Caicos to its website/app location list; local media and Uber communications confirm availability before July 1, 2025.",
    "rationale": "- Baseline/status quo: Turks and Caicos has historically not allowed Uber; taxis are tightly regulated and influential. The linked April 2025 warning to tourism stakeholders about encouraging illegal taxis signals an enforcement posture contrary to near-term rideshare legalization or tolerance. Given how slowly regulatory environments typically change, the default is No by July 1.\n- Market size and timing: TCI’s population is small, though tourism demand is high. Uber tends to prioritize larger, scalable markets or jurisdictions where taxi-integration is feasible. A 60-day window is short for regulatory change, partner onboarding, and formal listing on Uber’s website.\n- Pathways to Yes exist but are narrow: The most plausible would be a taxi-integration model (Uber Taxi) blessed by regulators and associations. That would likely produce public signals (Uber newsroom post, local government or tourism board announcement, recruitment, or drivers publicly onboarding) ahead of launch. None are indicated here.\n- Research assistant’s info: Strong tourism growth in 2024/25 increases demand but doesn’t overcome regulatory constraints; the government’s emphasis on law-and-order (e.g., firearms strictness; Level 2 advisory context) is consistent with a cautious stance toward unlicensed transport.\n- Why not higher: Lack of public signals of regulatory change or Uber activity; explicit recent warnings against illegal taxis; short lead time.\n- Why not lower: Uber has recently expanded taxi integrations globally and can launch with limited SKUs if a deal is struck; tourism reliance gives some incentive for formalized, trackable transport options.\n- What would move me up: Credible local reporting or official statements about rideshare legalization or a pilot; Uber adding a TCI landing page or listing, recruitment/job postings for TCI, or app geofencing showing provisional coverage; announcements from taxi associations about partnering with Uber.\n- What would move me down: Further government crackdowns, new fines/legislation against app-based rides, or explicit statements rejecting Uber launches in 2025.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill Uber be available in the Turks and Caicos Islands on July 1, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\n[Tourism Stakeholders Warned About Encouraging Use of Illegal Taxis](https://magneticmediatv.com/2025/04/tourism-stakeholders-warned-about-encouraging-use-of-illegal-taxis/)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if Uber is available in Turks and Caicos as shown on the [Uber website](https://www.uber.com/us/en/search-results/?query=TURKS+AND+CAICOS) or according to [credible sources](https://www.metaculus.com/faq/#definitions).\n\n\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nTourism in the Turks and Caicos Islands grew significantly in 2024, with the islands welcoming nearly two million visitors across air and cruise travel.

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
