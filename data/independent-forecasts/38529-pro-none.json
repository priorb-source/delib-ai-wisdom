    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Approximately 2-3 weeks. The primary is on June 24, 2025, and the presumptive nominee should be known within a few days to a week after the election, depending on the closeness of the race and vote-counting procedures.",
    "status_quo_outcome": "Andrew Cuomo is the frontrunner according to the most recent polling information. If the current trajectory of the race holds without major shifts, his existing lead and superior name recognition would likely carry him to victory.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Zohran Mamdani's momentum accelerates in the final two weeks of the campaign. Progressive and younger voters turn out in unexpectedly high numbers, while renewed media focus on Cuomo's past scandals causes his support among moderate voters to collapse. Mamdani consolidates the anti-Cuomo vote and wins the primary.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Andrew Cuomo's campaign successfully blunts Mamdani's momentum with a combination of effective advertising and a strong get-out-the-vote operation. Cuomo's high name recognition and support from more moderate, reliable primary voters provide a durable base that withstands the late challenge, and he wins the nomination.",
    "rationale": "My forecast is based on the single provided data point: a poll indicating Andrew Cuomo has a narrowing lead over Zohran Mamdani. As the current frontrunner with universal name recognition and significant establishment connections, the status quo favors a Cuomo victory. Historically, frontrunners with these advantages, even when facing headwinds, are difficult to unseat in a short timeframe. The primary is only two weeks away, which limits the time for Mamdani to close the remaining gap, build his name recognition further, and persuade undecided voters.\n\nMy probability is not higher than 65% because the information explicitly states Mamdani is gaining ground. Momentum is a powerful force in the final days of a campaign, and it currently favors the challenger. Cuomo also carries significant political baggage from the scandals that led to his resignation as governor, making his support potentially soft and susceptible to late-breaking attacks or shifts in public sentiment. A surge in progressive turnout could easily flip the outcome.\n\nMy probability is not lower than 65% because overcoming a lead held by a political figure as established as Cuomo in just two weeks is a formidable task. He possesses the resources and experience to counter Mamdani's surge. Unless Mamdani's momentum is truly exponential, the most likely outcome remains that Cuomo's existing lead, however diminished, will be sufficient to win.\n\nI would increase my forecast for 'Yes' if new polls showed Cuomo's lead stabilizing or widening. I would decrease it if high-quality polling showed the race as a statistical tie or if Mamdani secured a major, game-changing endorsement.",

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any).
