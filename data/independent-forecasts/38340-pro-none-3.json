    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Less than one month. The deadline is July 1, 2025.",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No. Sudan has not ratified the AfCFTA and is currently engaged in a civil war that has paralyzed its state institutions, making the legislative process for ratification impossible.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "The civil war in Sudan continues through June 2025. The government remains dysfunctional and preoccupied with the conflict, and no legislative action is taken on the AfCFTA. The July 1, 2025 deadline passes without ratification.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "A sudden and comprehensive peace agreement is reached in early June 2025. A transitional government is rapidly formed and, as a sign of its commitment to re-engaging with the international community, it fast-tracks and completes the ratification of the AfCFTA before the July 1 deadline.",
    "rationale": "My forecast is overwhelmingly driven by the civil war that has engulfed Sudan since April 2023. The country lacks a functioning government and legislative body capable of carrying out the complex process of ratifying a major international trade agreement. The status quo is one of intense conflict and institutional collapse, making non-essential state functions like this impossible. While there was some pre-war movement on a draft implementation strategy in 2022, that momentum has been completely halted. The extremely short timeframe—less than a month until the July 1, 2025 deadline—further cements the improbability of ratification. A 'Yes' outcome would require a political miracle: an immediate end to the war and the instant formation of a functional government that prioritizes this specific treaty. Given the lack of any signs of de-escalation, the probability is exceptionally low. I have set the forecast at 1% rather than 0% to account for highly improbable, unforeseen events, but the confidence in a 'No' outcome is very high. I would only increase this forecast upon seeing credible evidence of an imminent, stable peace deal and the restoration of governmental functions.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill Sudan ratify AfCFTA (the pan-African free trade agreement) before July 1, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\n[Draft National AfCFTA Implementation Strategy for Sudan Reviewed and Validated by Stakeholders](https://igad.int/draft-national-afcfta-implementation-strategy-for-sudan-reviewed-and-validated-by-stakeholders/)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if Sudan ratifies the African Continental Free Trade Area (AfCFTA) Agreement before July 1, 2025.\n\n\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nNo additional information available.\n\nToday is 2025-06-06.\n\nBefore answering you think:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n(e) You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
