    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "About 32 days (until July 1, 2025)",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No arrest",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "The Secret Service inquiry over the “86 47” post ends with no action; no new criminal investigations surface; Comey keeps a low profile and June passes without incident.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "A rapid escalation from the Secret Service inquiry leads to an arrest for an alleged threat against the President; or an unrelated legal incident (e.g., contempt-related custody, local protest-related arrest, or an unforeseen matter) results in a custodial arrest reported by credible sources before July 1.",
    "rationale": "Time is short and the base rate is extremely low. There are ~32 days left, and there is no publicly known active criminal case against James Comey. The cited NYT report describes the Secret Service asking about an ambiguous social media post; such interviews rarely culminate in an arrest without clearer evidence of a prosecutable true threat. Post-Counterman v. Colorado, prosecutors generally need at least recklessness as to a threatening meaning; “86 47” is likely too ambiguous absent more context. Prior efforts to criminally pursue Comey (e.g., the Durham probe) ended without charges, suggesting limited legal exposure absent new facts. High-profile arrests of former top federal law enforcement leaders are exceptionally rare, and building a case, obtaining approval, and executing an arrest within a month would be unusual. The question resolves only on an arrest reported by credible sources, reducing chances that a mere detention would qualify. Reasons my probability isn’t higher: no indictments or charges in the pipeline, due process timelines, and the ambiguity of the noted conduct. Reasons it isn’t lower: the political environment raises tail risk; the ongoing Secret Service attention is a live vector; and the resolution criterion counts any arrest anywhere for any reason, so unrelated or low-probability incidents still contribute a small chance. What would move me up: credible reporting of charges or a grand jury action, issuance of a warrant, a clear statement from SS/DOJ indicating probable cause, or an announced plan for custodial interview. What would move me down: reporting that the SS inquiry is closed with no action, explicit public exoneration, or the passage of time into late June with no developments. Research assistant provided no additional information, consistent with no visible escalation.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill James Comey be arrested before July 1, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\n[Secret Service Is Asking Comey About a Photo of Seashells Spelling ‘86 47’](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/16/us/politics/secret-service-comey-social-media-trump.html)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if former FBI director James Comey is arrested before July 1, 2025, according to [credible sources](https://www.metaculus.com/faq/#definitions).\n\nIn order to streamline this question's resolution, please note that an arrest anywhere in the world, for any reason, will resolve this question as Yes. For purposes of this question, we define \"arrest\" using the definition [posted at Nolo](https://www.nolo.com/legal-encyclopedia/justifies-arrest-probable-cause.html): \"An arrest requires taking someone into custody, against that person's will, in order to prosecute or interrogate. It involves a physical application of force, or submission to an officer's show of force. In sum, the arrestee must not be free to leave. Whether the act by the police is termed an arrest under state law is not relevant. When deciding whether someone has been arrested, courts apply the 'reasonable man' standard. This means asking whether a reasonable person, in the shoes of the defendant, would have concluded that he or she was not free to leave.\"\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nNo additional information available.\n\nToday is 2025-05-30.\n\nBefore answering you think:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n(e) You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
