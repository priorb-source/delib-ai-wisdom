    "review": "Both forecasters rightly foreground tariff timing/implementation and the knife‑edge around $338.5B. Forecaster 3’s point about front‑loading if tariffs are announced before taking effect is valuable and could push April up. However, both lean on “tariffs raise prices so nominal imports might rise,” which is weaker for this metric: the Census/BEA import value excludes duties (customs value), so higher tariffs don’t mechanically inflate the recorded nominal import value. Neither weighs services imports (notably travel) as a potential offset; services could keep total imports buoyant even if goods soften. Still, their emphasis on policy risk and the possibility tariffs were already in force by April is a helpful corrective to an overly trend‑based view.",
    "rationale": "Threshold: $338.483B (Apr 2024). Base rate: with steady demand, nominal imports often grow low single digits YoY, which would clear the bar. Offsetting headwinds are (i) potential broad tariffs in effect by April that reduce goods import volumes and lower recorded customs values, (ii) a potentially stronger USD/import price disinflation, and (iii) energy price moves that could pull down petroleum import values. Offsetting supports are (i) possible pre‑implementation/front‑loading if effective dates are May or later, (ii) services imports (especially travel) likely trending up YoY, and (iii) generally resilient US demand. Given genuine uncertainty about tariff breadth/effective dates and recognizing that duties don’t boost the recorded import value, I trim my prior slight-Yes lean but still keep a modest edge to Yes based on base rates plus potential front‑loading and services strength. This is a close call around the threshold.",
