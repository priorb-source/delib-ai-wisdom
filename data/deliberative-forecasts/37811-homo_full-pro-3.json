    "review": "The deliberation reveals a strong consensus among all three forecasters. We all identify the same key factors driving the forecast: the institutional inertia of a government website, the extremely short timeframe until resolution, and the countervailing political risk from an administration that has demonstrated hostility towards climate science. Critically, we all agree that the most important piece of evidence is the explicit and recent (April 4, 2025) statement from a NOAA spokesperson confirming that the sites will remain online.\n\nThe only notable difference is the weight assigned to the political risk, resulting in a tight forecast range of 90-95%. Forecaster 2's analysis at 90% provides a useful point about the distinction between the actions taken so far (decommissioning a specialized database, staff cuts) and taking down a main public-facing domain. They correctly note that a full takedown of Climate.gov would be more visible and politically costly. I find this argument convincing, and it actually reinforces my confidence in the higher probability, suggesting that the administration may prefer less overt methods of undermining the agency's mission.",
    "rationale": "After reviewing my peers' analyses, I am maintaining my forecast of 95%. The deliberation has strengthened my conviction in the original reasoning rather than altering it. There is unanimous agreement that the specific, direct, and recent statement from a NOAA spokesperson promising to keep research sites online is the single most powerful piece of evidence. This public commitment creates a significant and direct barrier to a takedown that would require a specific, countervailing order to overcome.\n\nThe short timeframe of approximately 40 days is the second most critical factor. Bureaucratic and technical inertia make it unlikely for such an order to be issued and fully executed in this period, even in a volatile political environment.\n\nWhile the political risk from the administration's demonstrated actions (staffing cuts, decommissioning the 'Billion-Dollar Disasters' database) is real, the discussion highlighted that these actions have been less publicly visible than shuttering a primary domain would be. This suggests a potential preference for a 'death by a thousand cuts' strategy over a highly symbolic and politically costly public takedown. The 5% chance of a 'No' outcome adequately accounts for the small but non-zero possibility of a sudden, high-level executive directive overriding all other factors.",
