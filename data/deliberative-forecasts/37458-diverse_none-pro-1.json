    "review": "I have reviewed the analyses from two other forecasters, who assigned probabilities of 40% and 24%. Both correctly identify Donald Trump's unconventional diplomatic style and the possibility of a crisis (e.g., over tariffs or Taiwan) as the primary drivers for a potential 'Yes' outcome. They also both correctly note that the requirement for mutual public acknowledgment is a significant barrier to resolution, citing China's past denials of such talks. However, I believe both forecasts are far too high because they significantly underweight the single most important factor: Donald Trump is currently a private citizen, not a sitting head of state. Their reasoning seems to improperly extrapolate from his actions *as president* to his current capacity. High-level, publicly acknowledged contact between a head of state like Xi Jinping and a non-incumbent opposition candidate is an extreme departure from standard diplomatic protocol and risks a severe diplomatic incident with the current U.S. administration. I find their arguments for such a high likelihood unconvincing as they do not adequately address this fundamental structural barrier.",
    "rationale": "After deliberation, I am maintaining my original forecast of 5%. My core reasoning remains that the diplomatic protocol against a serving head of state holding a publicly acknowledged phone call with a foreign opposition candidate is exceptionally strong. The Chinese government is historically cautious and protocol-bound in its formal diplomacy and is highly unlikely to take such a step, which would risk antagonizing the incumbent Biden administration. The provided background from CBS News, where China denied Trump's claims of talks, serves as a powerful piece of evidence for their likely playbook: deny or ignore any such claims to avoid being drawn into U.S. domestic politics. The other forecasters raised valid points about potential catalysts like a sudden tariff dispute or a geopolitical crisis. I agree these are the most plausible, albeit low-probability, pathways to a 'Yes' outcome. However, in such a crisis, official communication would overwhelmingly flow through the established channel—the current U.S. administration. While I have considered these 'tail risk' scenarios, they are not sufficient to overcome the immense structural and diplomatic barriers. Therefore, my 5% forecast, reflecting a very unlikely but not impossible event, remains the most grounded estimate.",
