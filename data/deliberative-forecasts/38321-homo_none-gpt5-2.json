    "review": "Both forecasters largely mirror my base-rate and incentive-driven view. New/useful additions: (1) explicit emphasis that a date shift out of June would resolve the question as No, which is a distinct tail risk worth acknowledging; (2) Trump’s tendency to truncate multilateral events—though I’d note that even brief in-person presence would still resolve this as Yes, so truncation shouldn’t materially lower odds; (3) clear update triggers (WH travel guidance, NATO attendee lists, pooled press logistics) that I agree would meaningfully move probabilities. I find their reasoning sound; the postponement/date-shift risk feels very low this close to the event, while the “send a surrogate” or last-minute norm-breaking risk is the main residual uncertainty. Net, their points don’t change my bottom line materially.",
    "rationale": "Base rate strongly favors attendance: U.S. presidents, including Trump in his prior term, almost always attend NATO summits. The political/diplomatic incentives for Trump to appear are high—pressuring allies on defense spending and leveraging a high-visibility platform align with his agenda. We are weeks out, and absent credible reporting of a planned skip, attendance is the status quo. Key residual risks: Trump’s willingness to break norms by delegating to VP/State; an acute domestic or international crisis; or health/security disruptions. A postponement beyond June would flip this to No under the resolution criteria, but that appears unlikely this close to the slated timing. Truncating or contentious participation would still count as Yes, which modestly offsets concerns about his multilateral behavior. Without fresh, confirming schedule information, a modest uncertainty buffer remains appropriate.",
