  "information": "In April 2025, several protests occurred in India related to land and religious laws. On April 14, protests against a Muslim land law in eastern India turned violent, resulting in three reported deaths. Separately, from April 8-12, violent protests against the Waqf Act took place in Murshidabad, West Bengal. Muslim communities also held symbolic \"Lights Off\" protests against the Waqf (Amendment) Act, 2025. Ongoing communal tensions have been noted in West Bengal and Uttarakhand.\n\nReports from various news outlets indicate several planned or recent mobilizations. The Free Press Journal reported on a planned march involving 10,000 farmers. India Today has covered rallies organized by the Trinamool Congress (TMC) for teachers. Additionally, a global housing action day protest was scheduled for April 26, 2025, with events planned in multiple countries, including India.\n\nIndia has a history of large-scale demonstrations that have exceeded 10,000 participants, including the farmers' protests of 2020-2021 and the anti-CAA protests of 2019-2020. The Global Protest Tracker recorded 145 anti-government protests worldwide in the 12 months preceding May 2025. Reports also indicate that authorities in India have used technologies such as drones with facial recognition to identify participants in farmer protests and subsequently confiscate their passports.",

    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "About 60 days (until 2025-07-01)",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No — the Global Protest Tracker does not add a new India protest (≥10,000 participants) with a start date after this question’s launch before July 1, 2025.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Protests in India through May–June remain localized or below 10,000 participants, or the major actions that do occur are continuations of April events (pre-launch start dates). The Global Protest Tracker either does not create any new India entries in this window or only adds an entry dated to April 2025, which would not count.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "A distinct, large mobilization begins after launch and before July 1 — for example, a nationwide bandh, a major farmers’ ‘Delhi Chalo’ march, or mass rallies around the Waqf/land-law issue — draws well over 10,000 participants with broad national or international coverage. Carnegie’s Global Protest Tracker adds a new India entry with a May/June 2025 start date and a size category of at least tens of thousands.",
    "rationale": "Starting point: The Global Protest Tracker (GPT) is selective and typically adds entries for large, nationally salient protest movements rather than every big rally. Historically, India gets entries irregularly (e.g., anti-CAA 2019–20, farmers’ protests 2020–21, farmers’ mobilizations in 2024), implying far fewer than one new India entry every couple of months. Over a ~60-day window, the status quo (no new qualifying entry) is therefore the base case.\n\nRecent context: Reuters (Apr 14) reported violent protests in eastern India over a Muslim land/Waqf-related law, with several deaths. Your research assistant notes Apr 8–12 protests in Murshidabad (West Bengal), symbolic “Lights Off” actions, and broader communal tensions, plus reports of planned mobilizations (a farmers’ march of 10,000, TMC teacher rallies, Global Housing Action Day on Apr 26). These indicate elevated protest potential, but crucially, the notable April events began before this question’s launch and would not count even if the GPT later adds them with April start dates. Planned events are uncertain and may not reach the ≥10,000 threshold or the salience GPT requires.\n\nFactors raising the probability: India’s very large population and frequent mass actions; current flashpoints (Waqf/land law, farmers’ demands) that could spawn a new, distinct post–May 2 protest; the fact that GPT sometimes adds entries for nationwide bandhs or large marches. If unions/farmer coalitions call a coordinated national action in May/June and crowds exceed 10,000 in a focal location, GPT inclusion becomes more likely.\n\nFactors lowering the probability: The narrow time window; India’s summer heat, which can suppress turnout; preventive restrictions and policing that limit large gatherings; GPT’s selectivity and potential lag in adding entries; and the requirement that the tracker characterize the size as at least 10,000 (it may avoid precise numbers unless clearly documented). Also, if the main movement is seen as a continuation of April unrest, GPT may date it to April, which would not qualify.\n\nWhy not higher: Despite visible unrest, the tracker’s inclusion bar and timing constraints make a new qualifying entry within ~60 days far from assured. Many sizeable rallies won’t be captured as a new GPT entry with a fresh May/June start date and ≥10,000 size tag.\n\nWhy not lower: India’s propensity for large demonstrations, combined with active issues (farmers’ demands, communal/land-law disputes), creates a real possibility of a new, distinct mobilization in the next two months that meets GPT’s salience and size thresholds.\n\nWhat would move me up: Credible announcements of nationwide strikes/bandhs or a major farmers’ march scheduled for May/June; early reports of crowds clearly exceeding 10,000 in a single location; international coverage by outlets like Reuters/AP/AFP; signs that GPT is actively updating with multiple recent entries.\n\nWhat would move me down: No sign of large coordinated actions by mid-June; evidence of stringent restrictions (e.g., Section 144 orders) preventing big assemblies; heatwave conditions depressing turnout; GPT showing slower update cadence or framing current India unrest as a continuation of April events only.",

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower.
