    "review": "Forecaster 2 adds a key, potentially decisive claim: UFC 315 is scheduled for Perth, Australia. If correct, that sharply lowers the chance of attendance given Trump’s history of attending only U.S.-based UFC events and the significant logistics/security/optics of international travel for a sporting event. Forecaster 3’s base-rate framing is sound and highlights that Trump attends a minority of PPVs, supporting a lower prior than my initial 30%. I find F2’s logic highly persuasive if the Perth detail is accurate, though I cannot independently verify it here. F3’s reasoning is consistent with the general prior even if the location were U.S.-based.",
    "rationale": "I’m updating down from 30% to account for two points: (1) base-rate correction (he attends a small fraction of PPVs), and (2) the possibility—raised by F2—that UFC 315 is in Perth, which would make attendance very unlikely. Using a simple mixture: if 315 is U.S.-based, I’d put attendance around 20–30% (higher if Las Vegas/Miami/NYC); if it’s international, especially Australia, around 1–5%. Given some chance F2 is correct about Perth and absent contrary evidence, I weight international more than I did initially and set an overall estimate near the low teens. I would update sharply upward if 315 is confirmed in a favorable U.S. location with public hints from Dana White/Trump, and sharply downward if Perth (or another non-U.S. venue) is confirmed or if a clear schedule conflict appears.",
