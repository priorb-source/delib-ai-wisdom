  "information": "Donald Trump has a history of attending high-profile sporting events. His recent UFC appearances include UFC 309 in November 2024 and UFC 314 on April 13, 2025. His attendance at UFC 314 was noted on his official public schedule. The time between UFC 314 in Miami and UFC 316 in Newark is less than two months. Some analyses of his past behavior suggest he rarely attends two UFC events in such close succession.\n\nUFC 316 is scheduled for June 7, 2025, at the Prudential Center in Newark, New Jersey. The event's main fight is a bantamweight title rematch between Sean O'Malley and Merab Dvalishvili. Donald Trump and UFC President Dana White have a long-standing public friendship. In the past, Trump hosted early UFC events at his properties, including the Trump Taj Mahal in Atlantic City. White has publicly supported Trump, including an appearance at the 2024 National Republican Convention.\n\nAt UFC 314 in Miami on April 13, 2025, Donald Trump was seen with Dana White and Elon Musk. Reports also mentioned the presence of political figures such as Kash Patel, Robert F. Kennedy Jr., Tulsi Gabbard, Kristi Noem, Ted Cruz, and Marco Rubio. Trump was greeted by Shaquille O'Neal and Joe Rogan, and he entered the arena to the song 'American Bad Ass' by Kid Rock, receiving a positive reaction from the crowd.",

    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "About 5 weeks (≈38 days) until June 7, 2025",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "The President spends the weekend at Bedminster or Camp David, or travels for official duties/fundraising; security or optics concerns steer him away; no listing on the public schedule and no late-breaking reports of attendance emerge.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "From Bedminster, he makes a short trip to Newark, appears cageside or backstage with Dana White at the Prudential Center during UFC 316, which is then reported by media and attendee social posts.",
    "rationale": "Baseline: For any single UFC PPV, even with strong ties to Dana White, the status quo is non-attendance. Over the last couple of years he’s appeared at selected, high-visibility cards but not most events. That pushes the default toward No.\nUpward pressures: (1) Geography/logistics—UFC 316 is in Newark, within easy range of Bedminster, making a short, low-effort trip plausible. (2) Relationship with Dana White and the UFC; prior attendance at UFC 309 (Nov 2024) and UFC 314 (Apr 13, 2025) shows a continuing pattern of choosing splashy cards. (3) The main event (O’Malley vs. Dvalishvili) is marquee and likely to draw significant attention, which aligns with his preference for high-visibility appearances.\nDownward pressures: (1) Recency—he just attended UFC 314; historically he does not appear at UFC events in such quick succession. (2) Presidential scheduling and security constraints can cause late changes or conflicts; unless it shows up on the public schedule or credible reporting leaks, the base case remains non-attendance. (3) Not every East Coast card gets a presidential visit, so proximity alone isn’t decisive.\nWhy not higher: The base rate for attendance at any one card is still low, and the short interval since UFC 314 plus uncertainties in a presidential calendar weigh against a Yes. Why not lower: Newark’s proximity to Bedminster materially reduces logistical friction, and the UFC/White relationship has repeatedly produced appearances, especially on big cards.\nWhat would move me up: (a) White or reliable MMA reporters hinting he’ll be there; (b) credible local security prep reports or law-enforcement coordination memos; (c) the appearance added to the public schedule or WH/pool notes; (d) sightings of advance team activity at Prudential Center. What would move me down: (a) a conflicting official trip added to the schedule; (b) reports of health, security, or political reasons to avoid the event; (c) signals from UFC that VIP logistics won’t accommodate a presidential visit.",
