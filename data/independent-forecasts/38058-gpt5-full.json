  "information": "U.S. President Donald Trump has postponed the implementation of a 50% tariff on goods from the European Union, moving the deadline from June 1 to July 9, 2025. The delay came after a request from European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen, who stated more time was needed for negotiations. U.S. officials have expressed frustration with the EU's cautious approach and lack of specific proposals in the trade talks. A key U.S. demand for a new trade agreement is a commitment from the EU to impose tariffs on Chinese industrial goods, which has not yet been agreed to.\n\nDomestically, U.S. tariff policy has drawn media commentary. The New York Post's editorial board warned of 'tariff burnout' among President Trump's supporters due to inconsistent implementation. The Wall Street Journal's editorial board has also criticized the tariffs, suggesting they would primarily benefit lobbyists and could be used by politicians to leverage campaign contributions. Internationally, Vietnam is reportedly fast-tracking a $1.5 billion Trump golf resort, a move linked to efforts to secure a new trade agreement with the U.S. and avoid potential tariffs as a 90-day pause on trade levies approaches its end.\n\nThe discussions around U.S. tariff policy have had observable economic effects. President Trump's announcement to delay the EU tariffs led to a positive shift in market sentiment and a surge in U.S. stock futures. In early April 2025, after the signing of an executive order for a 10% 'minimum benchmark tariff', there were reports of U.S. consumers stockpiling goods in anticipation of price increases. According to an estimate by the Tax Foundation, the proposed tariffs could cost U.S. households an additional $830 in 2025, reduce the nation's GDP by 0.4%, and result in the loss of 350,000 jobs.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "About 36 days remain (from May 26 through June 30, 2025).",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No — the word “tariff(s)” keeps appearing on at least one of the two front pages every day through June 30.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Tariff coverage remains a daily drumbeat: WSJ’s “What’s News” or NYT’s front page carries at least one item using the literal word “tariff” (or “tariffs”) every single day, driven by continual White House statements, incremental policy moves, business reactions, or international responses.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "On at least one day in June, other stories dominate and any trade coverage avoids the literal word (“tariff(s)”) in headlines/blurbs (using “duties,” “levies,” “trade taxes,” etc.), so neither NYT nor WSJ’s digital front page includes “tariff(s).” Weekends or slow news days are prime candidates.",
    "rationale": " framing: The question resolves Yes if there is at least one day in the remaining window when neither front page contains the literal word “tariff” or “tariffs.” We already know (per the prompt) that from May 20–25 there was no such day, implying elevated recent mention frequency. Still, the bar for Yes is low: we only need one clean day by June 30.\n\nforces for No (continued daily mentions):\n- Policy salience: Tariffs are a signature policy. WSJ, in particular, often places tariff-related items in “What’s News,” raising the chance of daily appearances.\n- Ongoing negotiations and reactions: Even without a hard deadline, there can be frequent incremental developments (companies’ responses, lobbying, international pushback), which can sustain daily mentions across one paper or the other.\n\nforces for Yes (at least one clean day):\n- The EU 50% tariff decision is now delayed to July 9 (after our window), reducing immediate deadline-driven headlines in June. That should dampen daily front-page urgency.\n- Wording matters: The resolver requires the literal word “tariff(s).” Front pages may discuss trade using synonyms (“duties,” “levies”), which do not count, increasing the chance of a clean day even if trade is covered.\n- Competing news: June will have many non-trade focal points (e.g., jobs/CPI prints, geopolitics, domestic politics, court decisions). On slower news days or weekends, both papers could easily omit the literal term.\n\nevidence from the research assistant:\n- Trump postponed EU tariffs to July 9, undercutting near-term urgency.\n- Editorial chatter is high (WSJ, NY Post), but editorials don’t directly determine the front-page word choice. Market and consumer reactions were notable earlier, but the immediate burst may fade in June.\n\nwhy not higher: From May 20–25, every day had the word on at least one front page, showing currently high salience. WSJ’s format (“What’s News”) increases daily odds of a mention. If the administration keeps up near-daily tariff talk, a clean day may be rare.\n\nwhy not lower: The event only needs one day; the EU deadline slippage reduces immediate triggers; synonyms often replace “tariff(s),” and weekend front pages may be lighter. Over 36 days, even a small per-day chance that both omit the word compounds into a solid cumulative chance of at least one clean day.\n\nupdate signals:\n- Upward (toward Yes): Multiple consecutive days where one of the two omits “tariff(s),” style guides or headlines trending to “duties/levies,” or news cycles crowded out by unrelated major events.\n- Downward (toward No): New concrete tariff actions/timelines within June (e.g., surprise announcements, enforcement steps), or a clear pattern that WSJ/NYT are using the exact word “tariff(s)” almost daily despite the EU delay.\n\nOverall, given the single-day requirement, the delayed EU deadline, and the synonym effect, I expect at least one day in June when both omit the literal word, but not with overwhelming confidence given the past week’s persistence and WSJ’s format.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill the word \"tariff\" disappear from the front pages of The New York Times and Wall Street Journal before July 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nWhether reading the newspaper or social media or watching the news, it is highly likely you are going to see something about tariffs - mainly due to US President Donald Trump's [renewed love](https://www.france24.com/en/live-news/20250401-tariff-man-trump-s-long-history-with-trade-wars) for this somewhat antiquated form of taxation.\r\n\r\nThe New York Times and the Wall Street Journal are two of the largest print newspapers in the US.
