    "review": "Both forecasters raise critical information that significantly changes my analysis. Most importantly, Forecaster 2 clarifies that the license was granted March 13, 2025—not in November 2024 as I mistakenly inferred. This means only ~2 months have elapsed, not 6+ months. This fundamentally undermines my 'if it hasn't happened yet, something is wrong' reasoning. Forecaster 3 provides invaluable precedent data: DRC at 10 weeks, Malawi/Zambia at 16 weeks, and Benin at 24 weeks. Chad's 15.5-week window from license to deadline places it right at the Malawi/Zambia benchmark. The most significant new information is the May 2025 SpaceX-Airtel partnership specifically designed to accelerate African kit distribution. This is a material positive development I hadn't considered. However, I note some caution: we're already 9 weeks into a 15.5-week window with no launch, suggesting Chad may track toward the slower end of precedents. The Airtel partnership is very recent and its operational impact on Chad specifically remains speculative. Forecaster 2's point about government support and mature Starlink operations is well-taken, but doesn't fully address why launch hasn't occurred yet after 2 months.",
    "rationale": "I was fundamentally wrong about the timeline, having assumed 6 months had passed when only 2 months have elapsed since the March 13 license. This changes my analysis dramatically. The precedent data shows Chad's 15.5-week window is tight but feasible—DRC managed 10 weeks, though Malawi/Zambia needed 16 weeks. At 9 weeks elapsed with 6.5 remaining, we're at 58% through the window with no launch signal yet, which suggests Chad is tracking closer to the 16-week precedent. The Airtel partnership announced in May 2025 is a genuine positive signal for accelerated rollouts, though its immediate impact on Chad is uncertain given how recent it is. The status quo remains 'No', and we need concrete action in the next 6.5 weeks. While my original pessimism was based on faulty timeline assumptions, I'm also not fully convinced by the 55-60% forecasts—being past the halfway point with no launch is concerning, and the 16-week precedent exceeds Chad's available time. I'm updating significantly upward from 32% but settling below the other forecasters at 47%, reflecting that this is genuinely close to a coin flip with slight headwinds from elapsed time but tailwinds from the Airtel partnership.",
