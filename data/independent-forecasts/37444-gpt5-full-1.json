  "information": "On May 2, 2025, U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio explicitly denied a Politico report that the administration was considering lifting sanctions on Nord Stream 2, calling the claim 'unequivocally false.' Both Rubio and U.S. Secretary of the Interior Doug Burgum are reported to be opponents of the idea. Furthermore, reports from May 5, 2025, indicated that President Trump is considering a bipartisan bill that would impose 500% tariffs on countries importing Russian energy and expand existing sanctions.\n\nA Politico report from April 24, 2025, citing multiple sources, claimed the White House was discussing the possibility of lifting sanctions on the Nord Stream 2 pipeline as part of negotiations to end the conflict in Ukraine. The report stated that U.S. Special Envoy Steve Wietkoff was the main proponent of the initiative and had instructed his team to compile a list of all energy sanctions imposed on Russia. Other reports have mentioned proposals from American investors and the former CEO of Nord Stream 2 AG to restart the pipeline with U.S. participation.\n\nThe European Union has expressed a lack of interest in restoring the pipeline's operation, and is reportedly preparing new sanctions against Russia. Nord Stream 2 AG has also faced legal and financial setbacks in Europe. In April 2025, a German court upheld a bank's decision to terminate the company's accounts due to U.S. sanctions risks. The company is operating under a moratorium on bankruptcy in Switzerland and has been making payments to small creditors to facilitate a larger financial settlement. One of the two pipeline strings was severely damaged in an attack in September 2022.",

    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "~56 days (until July 1, 2025)",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No — Nord Stream 2 AG remains on the OFAC SDN List when checked on/after July 1, 2025",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "The administration maintains or tightens Russia energy sanctions amid the ongoing war in Ukraine. Rubio and other senior officials continue to oppose delisting; Congress and allies signal resistance; EU prepares additional sanctions; no interagency push emerges within Treasury/State to delist, so NS2 AG remains on the SDN list.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "As part of a rapid Ukraine settlement or broader deal with Russia and/or European partners, the White House directs OFAC to delist Nord Stream 2 AG, framing it as a leverage-for-peace concession or as legally warranted by changed circumstances; OFAC publishes a delisting notice before July 1, 2025.",
    "rationale": "- Time horizon is short. With less than two months left, significant policy reversals that require interagency review and allied coordination are unlikely absent a major diplomatic breakthrough.\n- Status quo bias: SDN listings tend to persist unless clear policy or legal grounds for delisting appear. Nord Stream 2 AG’s listing has symbolic and practical value in the current Russia sanctions regime.\n- Political signals point against delisting. According to the assistant’s report, Secretary of State Marco Rubio called the Politico story about lifting sanctions “unequivocally false” (May 2), and Interior Secretary Doug Burgum is also opposed. Reports (May 5) indicate President Trump is considering a bipartisan bill imposing 500% tariffs on importers of Russian energy and expanding sanctions—directionally the opposite of delisting.\n- Limited policy upside: The EU is reportedly not interested in restoring Nord Stream operations and is preparing new sanctions. One pipeline string was severely damaged in 2022, and Nord Stream 2 AG faces legal/financial headwinds (bank accounts closed due to sanctions risk; Swiss moratorium). Even if delisted, practical restart is doubtful, reducing incentives to spend political capital on delisting.\n- What would raise my probability: Credible, on-the-record confirmation from Treasury/State of an imminent delisting review; text of a negotiated Ukraine ceasefire/peace package explicitly trading energy sanctions relief; coordinated US–EU messaging supporting limited energy sanctions rollback; an OFAC notice of intent or leak of draft delisting rationale.\n- What would lower it: Public commitment from the White House or Treasury ruling out delisting; Congressional movement to codify or expand sanctions on Russian energy; EU adoption of tighter Russia energy measures; further adverse legal/insolvency developments for Nord Stream 2 AG; escalation in Ukraine prompting broader sanctions.\n- Why not higher: The combination of senior-level denials, a hardening sanctions posture under consideration, EU disinterest, the physical/financial state of the asset, and the very short timeline makes delisting improbable.\n- Why not lower: The Politico report suggests at least some internal discussion, and the administration’s transactional style leaves a small tail risk of a sudden policy pivot tied to a larger geopolitical deal. OFAC can technically process delistings quickly if directed.\n",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill the US lift its sanctions on Nord Stream 2 before July 1, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\n[White House debates lifting sanctions on Russian energy assets, Nord Stream](https://www.politico.com/news/2025/04/23/white-house-debating-lifting-sanctions-on-russian-energy-assets-00306486)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if NORD STREAM 2 AG does not appear at Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) [Sanctions List Search tool](https://sanctionssearch.ofac.treas.gov/) when checked by Metaculus on or after July 1, 2025. If it does appear on the Specially Designated Nationals and Blocked Persons (SDN) List at that time, then this question resolves as **No**.\n\nAt the time of this question, the current listing of Nord Stream 2 by OFAC can be found [here](https://sanctionssearch.ofac.treas.gov/Details.aspx?id=31926).\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nOn May 2, 2025, U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio explicitly denied a Politico report that the administration was considering lifting sanctions on Nord Stream 2, calling the claim 'unequivocally false.'

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
