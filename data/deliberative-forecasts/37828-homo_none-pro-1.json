    "review": "The other two forecasters provided analyses that were remarkably similar to my own, converging on the same key points. We all agree that the primary driver for a low probability is the extremely short timeframe—just over five weeks remain until the July 1, 2025 deadline. We also all noted the complete absence of any public signaling, such as media reports, credible rumors, or company statements, which typically precede an IPO announcement for a high-profile company. Their reasoning is highly convincing as it reinforces the core tenets of my initial analysis. They did not introduce new evidence, but their unanimous consensus on a lower probability (2% vs. my initial 5%) serves as a strong signal for recalibration.",
    "rationale": "After reviewing the other experts' analyses, I am lowering my forecast from 5% to 2%. My initial reasoning remains the same: the short deadline and lack of public evidence make an IPO announcement highly unlikely. However, the other forecasters' convergence on 2% has convinced me that my initial 5% was slightly too high and gave too much weight to the possibility of a 'surprise' announcement. A 2% probability (a 1-in-50 chance) better reflects the extreme unlikelihood of a complex corporate event like an IPO being announced with no prior public build-up in such a compressed timeframe. The consensus view has helped me fine-tune my estimate to a more precise level of improbability.",
