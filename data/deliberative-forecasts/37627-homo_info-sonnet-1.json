    "review": "Forecaster 2 raises an important point about the May 15 Istanbul talks as a potential catalyst, though I don't have independent verification of this event from my research. The logic about Trump's schedule conflict necessitating phone coordination is compelling if true, but relies on assumptions I cannot verify. The 70% forecast seems optimistic given they just spoke 3 days ago. Forecaster 3 provides valuable perspective on status quo bias - most diplomatic work does proceed through intermediaries rather than direct leader calls. The acknowledgment requirement is indeed a meaningful hurdle. The emphasis on the 30-day ceasefire timeline creating urgency is well-taken, though this was already part of the May 10 discussion. The 57% forecast appears more carefully calibrated. Both forecasters appropriately recognize the 33-day window as substantial, which I may have underweighted in my initial analysis.",
    "rationale": "Upon reflection, my initial 50% forecast was likely too anchored to the recent May 10 call and didn't sufficiently weight the active peace negotiation context. The ongoing diplomatic activity creates more catalysts for contact than a typical period. However, I'm not moving to 70% because: (1) the Istanbul talks cited by Forecaster 2 aren't confirmed in my source material, (2) the 'both must acknowledge' requirement is a real constraint, (3) they could meet in person or use intermediaries, and (4) having just spoken 3 days ago reduces immediate pressure for another call. Forecaster 3's status quo bias point is crucial - even during crises, most coordination happens through staff channels. The 33-day window is meaningful, but not so long that it guarantees contact. Balancing the active diplomatic situation against the recency of their last call and operational realities of high-level diplomacy, a modest upward revision is warranted.",
