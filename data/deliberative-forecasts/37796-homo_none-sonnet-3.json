    "review": "The other forecasters present well-reasoned analyses that align closely with my original thinking. A few points stand out as particularly valuable: (1) Forecaster 2's emphasis on 'inherent dynamism' - jurisdictions are grey-listed specifically because they've committed to action plans, creating natural pressure toward completion and removal over time. This is an important structural factor I understated. (2) Both forecasters explicitly note the ~4-month interval between February and June plenaries is standard and provides reasonable time for progress without being so long that multiple waves of changes would be expected. (3) The convergence at 72% from two independent analyses suggests this may be better calibrated than my initial 70%. Their reasoning contains no significant flaws - all three of us identify the same key factors: recent February changes demonstrating active list management, 25 jurisdictions providing multiple candidates for change, the low bar requiring only ANY change, and historical patterns of regular updates. Neither forecaster introduces fundamentally new evidence that wasn't available to me, but their framing of certain points (particularly the action plan dynamics) is compelling.",
    "rationale": "Upon reflection, I may have been slightly too conservative at 70%. The 'inherent dynamism' argument is stronger than I initially weighted - countries don't stagnate on the grey list indefinitely, they're actively implementing reforms. The February 2025 changes (one removal, two additions) demonstrate both removal and addition pathways remain active. With 25 jurisdictions monitored and a 4-month working period since the last update, the probability that at least one jurisdiction either completes sufficient progress for removal OR that FATF identifies a new jurisdiction requiring increased monitoring is substantial. The question's low resolution bar (ANY change) significantly favors a Yes outcome. The convergence of three independent forecasts around 70-72% suggests this range is well-calibrated. I don't see compelling reasons to deviate significantly from this consensus, though I also don't see any missed factors that would push the probability materially higher (75%+) or lower (65%). The main uncertainty remains whether the February changes addressed the most immediate candidates, potentially making June quieter, versus representing ongoing momentum that continues through June.",
