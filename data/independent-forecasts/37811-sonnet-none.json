    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "41 days (from May 21, 2025 to July 1, 2025)",
    "status_quo_outcome": "Yes - Climate.gov remains online",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "The Trump administration follows through on removing climate information from government websites, specifically targeting Climate.gov for removal or making it inaccessible before July 1, 2025. This could involve shutting down servers, redirecting the domain, or otherwise making the site unreachable.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Climate.gov continues operating normally through July 1, 2025. The site remains accessible either because no action is taken to remove it, bureaucratic processes delay any removal efforts beyond July 1, legal or institutional resistance prevents removal, or the administration decides to maintain the site.",
    "rationale": "The status quo strongly favors a Yes outcome. As of May 7, 2025 (14 days ago), Climate.gov was confirmed UP and reachable. With only 41 days remaining until the resolution date, this is a relatively short timeframe for implementing significant changes to government infrastructure. While the National Security Archive article raises legitimate concerns about the Trump administration removing climate data from government websites, several factors support continued operation: (1) Government websites exhibit strong institutional inertia and typically persist unless actively removed; (2) Taking down established government websites requires navigating bureaucratic processes, inter-agency coordination, and potential legal challenges; (3) The fact that Climate.gov remains operational in late May 2025 suggests either removal efforts haven't been prioritized or face implementation barriers; (4) Similar government information resources often survive administration changes due to their institutional foundations and ongoing operational mandates. My forecast is not higher (not 95%+) because the documented concerns about data removal represent a genuine risk that cannot be dismissed. The Trump administration has shown interest in removing climate information, creating meaningful uncertainty. My forecast is not lower (not below 75%) because the combination of short timeframe, current operational status, and bureaucratic inertia makes sudden removal unlikely. To update higher, I would need evidence of explicit protections or statements confirming Climate.gov's continuation. To update lower, I would need reports of active removal efforts, preliminary decommissioning steps, or similar climate websites being taken offline.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill NOAA's Climate.gov still be online on July 1, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nNational Security Archive: [Disappearing Data: Trump Administration Removing Climate Information from Government Websites](https://nsarchive.gwu.edu/briefing-book/climate-change-transparency-project-foia/2025-02-06/disappearing-data-trump)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if Climate.gov is online according to [Is It Down Right Now?](https://www.isitdownrightnow.com/climate.gov.html) when accessed by Metaculus on or after July 1, 2025.\n\nAs of May 7, 2025, the resolution source returns the message, \"Climate.gov is UP and reachable by us.\"\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nNo additional information available.\n\nToday is 2025-05-21.\n\nBefore answering you think:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n(e) You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
