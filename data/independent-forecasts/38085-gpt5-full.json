  "information": "According to data from Drought.gov on May 29, 2025, 14.5 million Florida residents, representing 73.9% of the state's population, were in drought-affected areas. Reports from late April 2025 indicated that 84% of the state was classified under moderate to extreme drought conditions, a severity level not seen since April 2012. The state has recorded its 12th driest April-to-March period since 1895, and some regions are 6-10 inches below their average rainfall since mid-October 2024.\n\nThe drought has caused significant ecological and public safety consequences. The Everglades is experiencing its worst drought in 13 years, causing some areas to dry up completely, which has led to the suspension of tourism activities like airboat tours. As of early May 2025, elevated fire risk resulted in over 100 active wildfires burning more than 3,600 acres of vegetation. In response to the dry conditions, at least 21 counties have issued burn bans.\n\nThe forecast period coincides with the start of Florida's typical rainy season on June 1, which is also the official start of the Atlantic hurricane season. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) has forecast a 60% chance of an above-average 2025 hurricane season, with 13-19 named tropical storms expected. This is attributed to factors like warmer ocean temperatures and low wind shear. However, a separate NOAA forecast from March 2025 also predicted that drought conditions in South Florida would likely persist from April through June.",

    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "~30 days (until Metaculus accesses the Drought.gov Florida page on/after 2025-06-28)",
    "status_quo_outcome": "Yes — as of 2025-05-29, Drought.gov reports ~14.5M Floridians in drought (≥14.0M).",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "The wet season quickly establishes statewide and a soaking tropical disturbance or several weeks of widespread convection substantially erode D1–D3 coverage, dropping the “population in drought” below ~14.0M (~62% of the state) by the late-June US Drought Monitor update.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Rains are intermittent and localized; no early-season tropical system provides a broad statewide soak. Drought persists especially in South/Central Florida, keeping ≥62% of the population in D1–D4 on the late-June USDM releases, so the Drought.gov tally stays ≥14.0M when checked on/after June 28.",
    "rationale": "Status and threshold: On 2025-05-29, Drought.gov shows ~14.5M Floridians (73.9%) in drought. The question resolves Yes if that figure is ≥14.0M (~61.9%). To flip to No requires roughly a 12 percentage-point reduction in the share of population in D1–D4 within about four weeks, which is a large, statewide improvement.\nEvidence from RA report: • 84% of Florida was in moderate to extreme drought in late April, worst since 2012; Everglades at worst in 13 years; burn bans and wildfires widespread. • The April–March period ranked 12th driest since 1895; deficits of 6–10 inches since mid-October in places. • NOAA outlook (issued in March) called for drought persistence in South Florida through April–June. • As of May 29, the statewide drought-affected population is 14.5M.\nSeasonality and dynamics: Florida’s rainy season typically ramps up in June, and the Atlantic season could deliver relief; however, early-season (June) tropical cyclone impacts on Florida are relatively infrequent. Absent a soaking tropical disturbance, US Drought Monitor classifications often improve gradually; statewide reductions of ~12 percentage points in four weeks are possible but not the base case.\nWhy not higher than my estimate: The rainy season onset is imminent, and just one organized tropical wave/TD could rapidly reduce drought across large swaths, making a sharp drop plausible. The resolution uses whatever the page shows when accessed on/after June 28, so a late-June/early-July downpour could be reflected if admins check after a new USDM release.\nWhy not lower: The margin is sizable (14.5M vs 14.0M), implying a large statewide improvement is needed. NOAA’s persistence outlook through June and the depth of antecedent dryness argue for slower recovery without a significant event. Weekly USDM changes typically chip away rather than erase drought statewide.\nUpdate triggers:\n• Downside to Yes (toward No): NHC 7–10 day outlooks showing a tropical disturbance likely to track across much of Florida before the June 26 USDM release; observed multi-inch, multi-day rainfall totals statewide; mid-June USDM showing drought share already ≤65%.\n• Upside to Yes: Continued below-normal rainfall over South/Central Florida; absence of organized tropical systems in model guidance; June 12 and June 19 USDMs still showing ≥68–70% of population in drought.\nOn balance, persistence plus the required magnitude of improvement make Yes more likely than not by late June.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill Florida have 14.0 million or more residents living in drought on June 28, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nUSA Today: [14 million Florida residents are under drought conditions, some extreme: What to know](https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2025/04/28/florida-drought-conditions-what-to-know/83328368007/)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if Drought Monitor at [this link](https://www.drought.gov/states/florida) lists greater than or equal to 14.0 million Florida residents in areas of drought, when the link is accessed by Metaculus on or after June 28, 2025. If the number is below that, this question resolves as **No**.\n\nThe question will resolve as soon as the page is accessed by Metaculus Admins on the resolution date. However, if there are issues accessing the page, then resolution will wait up until the end of the tournament's scoring at which point if Metaculus has still not been able to access the resolution source, this question will be **annulled**.\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nAccording to data from Drought.gov on May 29, 2025, 14.5 million Florida residents, representing 73.9% of the state's population, were in drought-affected areas.

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any).
