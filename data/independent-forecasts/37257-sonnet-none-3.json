    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Approximately 2 months (until July 1, 2025)",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No - The government of Republika Srpska has not announced a date for an independence referendum, and there is no public information indicating such an announcement is imminent.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Republika Srpska leadership, despite ongoing separatist rhetoric, decides not to announce a referendum date due to international pressure, economic concerns, or strategic calculations. The leadership continues using independence threats as political leverage without taking concrete steps toward scheduling an actual referendum.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Republika Srpska President Milorad Dodik or another authorized official announces a specific date for an independence referendum, potentially in response to a political crisis, domestic pressure, Russian encouragement, or as an electoral strategy. The announcement occurs regardless of its legality under Bosnian constitutional law.",
    "rationale": "The base rate strongly favors NO. Despite years of separatist rhetoric from RS leadership, particularly Milorad Dodik, they have historically stopped short of officially scheduling independence referendums. Such announcements would trigger severe international consequences including sanctions, diplomatic isolation, and potential EU membership obstacles. With only 2 months remaining, there's limited time for such a major political move, and my research assistant provided no information suggesting imminent escalation. However, the probability is not negligible because: (1) announcing a referendum requires only a statement from authorized officials, not implementation; (2) regional geopolitical tensions and Russian influence create potential catalysts; (3) Dodik has previously made surprise escalatory moves; (4) two months is sufficient time for a political announcement if desired. The question's low bar (only requiring an announcement, not legality or implementation) increases the probability somewhat. For me to update higher, I would need evidence of: active referendum preparations, explicit statements about scheduling timelines, acute political crisis in Bosnia, or strong Russian pressure. For me to update lower, I would need evidence of: de-escalation commitments, international diplomatic breakthroughs, or clear statements ruling out referendums. Given the strong status quo bias, limited timeframe, and absence of current crisis indicators, but accounting for regional volatility and the low threshold for resolution, I estimate this at 12%.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nBefore July 1, 2025, will the government of Republika Srpska officially announce a date for an independence referendum?\n\nQuestion background:\nFair Observer: [Balkan Tinderbox: How Russia’s Moves Could Reignite Bosnia](https://www.fairobserver.com/politics/balkan-tinderbox-how-russias-moves-could-reignite-bosnia/)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if, before July 1, 2025, a referendum on the independence of Republika Srpska from Bosnia and Herzegovina is officially scheduled. If this does not occur before that date, this question resolves as **No**.\n\nFor purposes of this question, the referendum will be considered \"officially scheduled\" when it is announced by a person or entity with the authority to do so within Republika Srpska. Please note that broader legality, such as within Bosnia and Herzegovina, will be considered irrelevant for this question, so if the Bosnian government declared the referendum illegal, the question would still resolve as Yes.\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nNo additional information available.\n\nToday is 2025-05-02.\n\nBefore answering you think:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n(e) You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
