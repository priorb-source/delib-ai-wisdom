  "information": "According to multiple polls from early 2025, Reform UK's support has grown significantly. A YouGov poll in early February showed Reform UK taking the lead over Labour for the first time, with 25% of the vote compared to Labour's 24% and the Conservatives' 21%. It found that one in four Conservative voters from the July 2024 election would now vote for Reform. Later polls from late April by sources like YouGov and More in Common showed Reform UK and Labour tied at 25%, or Reform slightly ahead at 26%. Polling expert Sir John Curtice noted the unprecedented unpopularity of both Labour (24% average rating) and the Conservatives (22%), with Reform narrowly ahead at 25%. A poll by Find Out Now in late January also placed Reform UK in the lead with 26% of the vote, ahead of the Conservatives at 23% and Labour at 22%. By contrast, the Politico poll-of-polls, the resolution source for the question, was reported in one analysis as showing Reform UK at 14.1%, significantly behind Labour (33.7%) and the Conservatives (23.7%).\n\nOn May 1, 2025, local elections are scheduled to take place in England, representing the first major electoral test since the Labour party's landslide victory in the July 2024 general election. Voters will elect over 1,600 councillors and mayors across 23 local authorities. In conjunction with these elections, a UK parliamentary by-election is being held in Runcorn and Helsby. Opinion polls for the by-election in early April indicated a lead for Reform UK, with 28% support, putting them 6 points ahead of Labour (22%) and 8 points ahead of the Conservatives (20%). It was also reported that up to 60 council candidates had defected from the Conservative party to run for Reform UK in the May elections.\n\nRecent reports indicate a significant shift in the British political landscape. Patrick English, director of political analytics at YouGov, described the emergence of 'five party politics,' observing that both Labour and Conservative support levels are declining while support for Reform UK, the Liberal Democrats, and the Green Party is rising. A poll by More In Common found that 41% of voters lack faith in any of the main party leaders, and an Ipsos poll from March 2025 found that 36% of British adults were considering voting for Reform UK. Public sentiment is reportedly characterized by disillusionment with the traditional parties, with key voter issues including immigration, local infrastructure like potholes, and economic concerns. Polling data shows only 60% of those who voted for Labour in the July 2024 election would do so again.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Approximately 2 months (until July 1, 2025)",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No - Reform UK remains below first place in the Politico poll-of-polls or fails to achieve a 4+ point lead",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "The Politico poll-of-polls continues showing Reform UK substantially behind Labour and/or the Conservatives through June 2025. While individual polls may show Reform UK competitive or even leading, the Politico aggregate methodology results in more modest gains. Reform UK reaches perhaps 18-22% in the Politico average but Labour maintains a lead around 28-32%, preventing Reform from achieving both first place AND a 4-point margin simultaneously.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Today's local elections deliver strong results for Reform UK, creating massive momentum that translates into a surge in the Politico poll-of-polls. The pollster aggregate rapidly updates to reflect Reform UK's gains, jumping from 14.1% to over 30% within weeks. Labour and Conservative support collapses further as voter disillusionment peaks and more defections occur. By mid-to-late May or June, Reform UK consistently polls at 31-35% while their nearest competitor drops to 25-27%, creating the required 4+ point gap.",
    "rationale": "The critical challenge is the enormous gap between Reform UK's current position in the resolution source versus what's needed. According to the research assistant, Politico's poll-of-polls shows Reform UK at just 14.1%, far behind Labour (33.7%) and Conservatives (23.7%). To resolve Yes, Reform UK needs to reach approximately 34%+ to be first by 4 points - requiring a ~20 point jump in just 2 months. While individual polls from YouGov, More in Common, and Find Out Now show Reform at 25-26%, there's a stark discrepancy with Politico's aggregate. This suggests either methodological differences, lag time in Politico's averaging, or that these individual polls aren't weighted heavily in Politico's model. Even if we assume Reform UK's 'true' support is closer to 25% than 14%, they still need an 8-9 point gain in 2 months to reach the required threshold. Historical precedent strongly favors the status quo: political party support in stable democracies rarely moves 20+ points in 8 weeks. The UK doesn't have the volatility seen in some newer democracies. Factors supporting a higher probability include genuine Reform momentum (defections from Conservatives, voter disillusionment, today's local elections potentially providing tailwinds) and unprecedented unpopularity of both major parties. However, these factors are already somewhat reflected in individual polls yet haven't translated to Politico's aggregate. My forecast isn't higher because the gap is simply too large given the timeframe and the specific resolution source lags individual polls. It's not lower because Reform UK does have real momentum and political earthquakes, while rare, do occasionally occur. To update higher, I'd need to see Politico's poll-of-polls showing Reform above 20% within the next 2-3 weeks, indicating their methodology is catching up to individual polls. To update lower, I'd need to see Reform UK's support stalling or declining in May polling.",
