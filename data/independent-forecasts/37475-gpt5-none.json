    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "About 52 days (until 2025-07-01)",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No — the recall is currently listed as Active; if it remains Active on July 1, the outcome is No.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "The recall remains Active past July 1 because FSIS needs more time to complete effectiveness checks, an expansion occurs (more lots/retailers/dates), or distribution tracing/recovery remains unresolved.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "FSIS completes effectiveness checks and closes the recall in May or June, which is common for foreign-matter recalls once product is accounted for and hazards are controlled.",
    "rationale": "Baseline: FSIS foreign-matter recalls (often Class II) are frequently closed within roughly 4–12 weeks after the initial notice, assuming no injuries and no expansion. This recall was posted April 5, giving about 12+ weeks until July 1. Johnsonville is a large brand with broad retail distribution, which can lengthen effectiveness checks, but foreign-matter events without reported injuries typically resolve within the window. There is no information suggesting hospitalizations or a complex supply chain (e.g., exports) that would systematically prolong closure. On the other hand, large volume (22,000+ lbs) and nationwide retail reach create some risk of slower recovery or a follow-on expansion, either of which could push closure past July 1. Research assistant provided no additional updates beyond the initial report. Why not higher: Risk of recall expansion, additional lots discovered, or extended verification across many retailers could delay closure. Why not lower: Base rates for FSIS foreign-matter recalls closing within 2–3 months are fairly strong, and there’s no evidence of complications so far. Updaters: I would lower the forecast if FSIS posts an expansion, reports injuries, or indicates distribution complexities; I would raise it if FSIS posts successful effectiveness checks, no expansion by early June, or similar 2025 recalls are closing within ~6–8 weeks.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill the USDA-posted recall by Johnsonville LLC of cheddar bratwurst for foreign matter contamination issued April 5, 2025 be closed before July 1, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nReal Simple: [Over 22,000 Pounds of a Popular Sausage Brand Recalled Due to Contamination](https://www.realsimple.com/sausage-recall-2025-11711268)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if the status of the recall posted by the U.S. Department of Agriculture’s Food Safety and Inspection Service (FSIS) is changed from Active to Closed on [this page](https://www.fsis.usda.gov/recalls-alerts/johnsonville-llc-recalls-cheddar-bratwurst-product-due-possible-foreign-matter) before July 1, 2025. If the recall is still shown as Active when the link is accessed by Metaculus on or after July 1, 2025, this question resolves as **No**.\n\n\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nNo additional information available.\n\nToday is 2025-05-09.\n\nBefore answering you think:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n(e) You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
