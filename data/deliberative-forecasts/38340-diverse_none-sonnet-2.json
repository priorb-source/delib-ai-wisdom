    "review": "All three analyses converge on the core constraints: Sudan's civil war has crippled state capacity, the 24-day timeline is extremely compressed, and there are no public signals of imminent ratification. Forecaster 2's emphasis on the absence of a functioning parliament is important but may be overstated - Forecaster 3 correctly identifies that Sudan's Sovereign Council could theoretically ratify by decree, bypassing parliamentary procedures. This is a crucial procedural pathway I didn't explicitly examine in my initial analysis. Forecaster 3's point about potential timing around AU meetings or diplomatic events is also valuable - symbolic acts can sometimes be expedited for diplomatic purposes. However, I find Forecaster 2's characterization of the May 2023 implementation strategy as 'outdated and irrelevant' given state collapse to be accurate. The critical question is whether the decree authority pathway, combined with possible diplomatic incentives, makes ratification sufficiently more plausible than my initial assessment suggested.",
    "rationale": "After deliberation, I'm updating my forecast slightly upward from 3% to 4%. The key insight from Forecaster 3 is that decree authority provides a procedurally viable path that doesn't require parliamentary action - this is more plausible than I initially considered. Additionally, the possibility of timing ratification around AU diplomatic events (though speculative) represents a scenario where even a conflict-affected government might expedite symbolic acts. However, I'm not moving as high as 6% because: (1) there are zero public signals of imminent action, (2) even decree procedures require operational bandwidth that Sudan's fragmented government likely lacks during active conflict, (3) AfCFTA implementation offers no immediate wartime benefits and would be deprioritized versus urgent security needs, and (4) the 24-day timeline remains extraordinarily compressed even for expedited procedures. The lack of any recent diplomatic communications or AU Commission statements about Sudan's ratification suggests this is simply not on anyone's active agenda. While I acknowledge decree authority as a mechanism, the overwhelming probability remains that status quo will persist through the deadline.",
