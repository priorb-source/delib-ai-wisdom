  "information": "Several states are pursuing federal waivers to restrict the use of SNAP benefits for certain items. Nebraska became the first state to receive a waiver to ban the purchase of soda and energy drinks, with the ban taking effect on January 1, 2026. Following this, Idaho submitted a similar waiver on May 16, 2025, to ban soft drinks and candy, with a decision expected in the coming weeks. Arkansas is seeking USDA clearance to make candy and soda ineligible starting in July 2026, while also proposing to add rotisserie chicken to the list of eligible foods. Indiana is also pursuing similar restrictions.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Approximately 6 weeks. The outcome will be known on or after July 1, 2025.",
    "status_quo_outcome": "Yes. The USDA's 'What Can SNAP Buy?' page currently lists 'snack foods' as an eligible item category. If no changes are made to the webpage by the resolution date, the outcome will be Yes.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "In response to political pressure to address nutrition and public health concerns, the USDA's Food and Nutrition Service enacts a swift change to its public guidance. It removes specific examples of items considered less nutritious, such as 'snack foods,' from its website to signal a policy shift, even if the underlying federal regulations have not yet been formally amended.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Bureaucratic inertia prevails. Despite ongoing discussions about SNAP restrictions at both state and federal levels, the multi-step process of changing federal policy and updating official web content, however minor, does not conclude by the July 1, 2025 deadline. The webpage remains unchanged from its current version.",
    "rationale": "My forecast is heavily weighted towards the status quo. The primary factor supporting a 'Yes' outcome is bureaucratic inertia. Federal agencies, including the USDA, typically move slowly, and changes to established programs like SNAP involve lengthy regulatory processes, often including public comment periods. With a resolution date only six weeks away, it is highly improbable that a formal policy change could be proposed, finalized, and reflected on a public-facing website. The research regarding state-level waivers for future dates (Nebraska in Jan 2026, Arkansas in July 2026) supports this view; change in this area is slow and incremental, and proceeds via specific state exemptions rather than immediate, sweeping federal changes to the core program guidance. While there is political will within the current administration to enact such restrictions, as indicated by the NY Post article, translating that will into an actual change on a specific webpage within this timeframe is unlikely. Therefore, I assign a high probability to the page remaining unchanged. My probability is not higher than 95% because there is a small but non-zero chance of a politically motivated, preemptive update to the website's language. An administration could order a quick, cosmetic change to the text to signal its policy direction, even ahead of a formal rule change. If the USDA were to announce a formal review process with a timeline extending past July 2025, I would increase my probability. Conversely, if a high-level USDA official explicitly announced an immediate change to SNAP guidance in the coming weeks, I would significantly decrease my probability.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill the USDA still list \"snack foods\" on its \"What Can SNAP Buy?\" page on July 1, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nNY Post: [Americans on food stamps could be banned from buying ‘bad food and sugary drinks,’ Trump USDA chief says](https://nypost.com/2025/02/14/us-news/americans-on-food-stamps-could-be-banned-from-buying-bad-food-and-sugary-drinks-trump-usda-chief-says/)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if \"snack foods\" is specifically listed on the United States Department of Agriculture's [What Can SNAP Buy?](https://www.fns.usda.gov/snap/eligible-food-items) webpage as something that is explicitly mentioned as something that can can be purchased by recipients of the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program. (Forecasters please note that it *is* explicitly mentioned as of May 5, 2025.) If it is *not* explicitly mentioned when checked by Metataculus on or after July 1, 2025, this resolves as **No**.\n\nIn order to streamline resolution, synonyms will not count; the phrase must specifically be \"snack foods.\" The question will resolve as soon as the page is accessed by Metaculus Admins on the resolution date. However, if there are issues accessing the page, then resolution will wait up to the end of the question resolutions period, at which point if Metaculus has still not been able to access the resolution source, this question will be **annulled**.\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nSeveral states are pursuing federal waivers to restrict the use of SNAP benefits for certain items.

Indiana is also pursuing similar restrictions.\n\nToday is 2025-05-20.\n\nBefore answering you think:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n(e) You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
