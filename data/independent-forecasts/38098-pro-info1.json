  "information": "Incumbent Republican Senator Lindsey Graham, in office since 2003, has commenced his 2026 re-election campaign. He has secured endorsements from prominent party figures, including former President Donald Trump, Governor Henry McMaster, and Senator Tim Scott. On the Democratic side, Dr. Annie Andrews, a pediatrician who ran for a House seat in 2022, announced on May 29, 2025, that she would be a candidate in the 2026 Senate race.",

    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Approximately one month, until the deadline of July 1, 2025.",
    "status_quo_outcome": "Ralph Norman has not declared his candidacy for the US Senate, so the question would resolve as 'No'.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Ralph Norman assesses the political landscape, notes the powerful endorsements for incumbent Lindsey Graham from figures like Donald Trump, and decides against launching a difficult and costly primary challenge. The July 1, 2025, deadline passes without an announcement of his candidacy.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Despite Lindsey Graham's endorsements, Ralph Norman believes a significant portion of the Republican primary electorate desires a more conservative challenger. Having prepared behind the scenes, he launches his campaign in June 2025 to capitalize on this sentiment before the deadline.",
    "rationale": "The status quo, in which Rep. Norman has not declared a Senate candidacy, is the most likely outcome. The barriers to a successful primary challenge against a long-term incumbent like Lindsey Graham are exceptionally high. The research indicates Graham has solidified his position by securing crucial endorsements from former President Trump, Governor McMaster, and Senator Scott. In a Republican primary, Trump's endorsement alone is a formidable obstacle for any challenger. Furthermore, the deadline is just over a month away. Launching a credible statewide campaign requires significant time for fundraising, organization, and messaging, and there is no public evidence that such a campaign is imminent. The Axios article speculating on a run is from September 2023, and the lack of recent, concrete steps from Norman suggests the initial consideration may have waned.\n\nMy forecast is not lower than 5% because primary challenges from ideological wings of a party are not impossible, and Norman may still be keeping his options open for a last-minute entry if he perceives a sudden weakness in Graham's position. He may have a campaign structure ready to activate on short notice.\n\nMy forecast is not higher than 5% because the combination of a very short timeline and the united front of establishment and MAGA support for Graham makes a challenge a very low-probability event. The path to victory for a challenger appears extremely narrow at this moment.\n\nI would increase my forecast if there were credible leaks about Norman hiring statewide campaign staff, a sudden increase in anti-Graham advertising from a group linked to Norman, or if Graham were to make a significant political gaffe. I would decrease it if Norman were to publicly endorse Graham or explicitly rule out a run.",
