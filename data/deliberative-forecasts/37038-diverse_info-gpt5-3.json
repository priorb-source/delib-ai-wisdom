    "review": "Forecaster 2 introduces a critical, specific claim: that a 17% additional duty for Israel is already codified and visible on HTS (9903.01.48), with implementation suspended. If accurate, this is decisive because the resolution counts a suspended listing as Yes, and inertia favors it remaining visible through June 1. Their argument that removal would require a diplomatic deal plus an administrative reversal within ~5 weeks is persuasive. Forecaster 3 appears to misunderstand the setup: they assume a general 10% tariff baseline and no Israel-specific measure, and they question the specificity of 17%, which contradicts the reported 17% figure and the suspension window to July 9. I largely discount Forecaster 3’s analysis.\n\nGiven the research assistant’s note about a US announcement and a defined suspension to July 9, Forecaster 2’s claim is plausible and fits the pattern of a published proclamation with HTS modifications posted ahead of effect. I cannot independently verify 9903.01.48 here, so I won’t go all the way to 90%, but I do meaningfully update upward on the strength of that evidence and the inertia argument.",
    "rationale": "Key points shaping my update:\n- The resolution hinges on whether HTS shows +17% for Israel on or after June 1, regardless of suspension. If the line already exists on HTS, the default path is Yes unless removed in May.\n- The research assistant’s report (US announcement; suspension until July 9) supports the existence of a formal, codified measure likely reflected as a Chapter 99 entry. That aligns with Forecaster 2’s 9903.01.48 reference.\n- Bureaucratic and political incentives: With implementation suspended until July 9, there is less urgency to remove the listing before June 1 even if talks progress. Removing it early would forfeit leverage before a finalized deal. Rapid rescission is possible via proclamation but not the default.\n- Residual risks: (1) Forecaster 2’s specific HTS citation could be mistaken; (2) a swift diplomatic breakthrough in May could prompt immediate HTS removal; (3) edge-case interpretation risk about how HTS presents the 17% and what Metaculus will see on the site. These keep me below 90%.\n\nNet effect: I raise my forecast from 62% to 83%, reflecting substantial weight on the claim that the 17% line is already posted and suspended, plus the strong inertia toward it remaining visible through June 1.",
