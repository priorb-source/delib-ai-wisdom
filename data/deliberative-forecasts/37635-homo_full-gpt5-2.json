    "review": "Both forecasters emphasize the same core mechanics I used: tiny MC gap, week-to-week noise, and the tie-as-No asymmetry. They also lean on domestic context—Mexico’s honeymoon polling vs. Argentine wear on Milei—and note plausible 1–3 point moves over six weeks. New to me was not evidence but framing: their stress on series “stickiness” around ~60% and the implied elevated tie risk on a specific check date, which I agree with. I do think they may slightly over-weight the January vs April flip as symmetric noise; my base still assigns a mild negative drift to Milei vs a flat-to-slightly-positive drift for Sheinbaum. Conversely, I probably underweighted two factors they highlighted: (1) MC’s tendency to rate Milei higher than domestic polls, and (2) the near-term possibility that visible Argentine macro/legislative wins keep him at ~60–61 while Sheinbaum ticks down a point. Net: their reasoning is solid and broadly consistent with mine; it nudges me a touch upward but still below 50 given the tie penalty and fundamentals.",
    "rationale": "Time left: ~45 days. Latest cited MC snapshot (Apr 30) has Milei 61 vs Sheinbaum 60. Fundamentals suggest a mild negative drift for Milei (domestic wear, reform friction) and flat-to-slightly-positive for Sheinbaum (early-term halo), but MC tends to smooth and sit below Mexico’s domestic highs while showing Milei stronger than many Argentine polls. Over the next six weeks, I expect movements on the order of 1–2 points for each series, implying the distribution of the difference is centered near zero with SD ~2 points. With a small expected drift against Milei, the probability he’s strictly above Sheinbaum on the check date lands below even. The tie-as-No rule and MC rounding further shave the Yes odds when the spread is ≤1 point. I’m nudging up from 38% to 40% to reflect: (a) the immediate status quo Milei lead; (b) MC’s historical relative generosity to Milei vs domestic Argentine polls; and (c) the possibility of Argentine macro headlines or a legislative win preserving his ~60–61 while Sheinbaum prints 59–60. Still, Sheinbaum’s honeymoon and the asymmetric tie risk keep me clearly below 50%.",
