    "review": "Both forecasters provide valuable historical context I hadn't fully considered, particularly Forecaster 2's claim that 35-40% of advance estimates between -0.5% and 0% turn positive by the third estimate, and both noting that typical absolute revisions of 0.5-0.6 pp from advance to third are within normal bounds. However, there's a critical information gap: neither forecaster appears to have access to the second estimate data that my research assistant provided. The second estimate, released May 29, 2025, revised the figure upward from -0.3% to -0.2%. This is crucial because: (1) it establishes an upward revision trajectory, suggesting the initial estimate was too pessimistic, and (2) it means we now need only a 0.3+ pp revision from the second to third estimate, not from the advance to third. Historical patterns show that second-to-third revisions are typically smaller than advance-to-second revisions (often 0.1-0.2 pp) since more data has already been incorporated. This means the 0.3+ pp remaining revision needed is actually larger than typical second-to-third movements, even though it's within normal bounds for advance-to-third revisions.",
    "rationale": "The upward revision from -0.3% to -0.2% in the second estimate is a moderately bullish signal that wasn't available to the other forecasters. It confirms the revision trajectory is positive and suggests data improvements are occurring. The historical base rates cited by Forecaster 2 (35-40% for this range) are higher than I initially estimated and provide good anchoring. However, I must carefully distinguish between advance-to-third revisions (typical 0.5-0.6 pp) and second-to-third revisions (typical 0.1-0.2 pp). Since we're at -0.2% after the second estimate, we need the third estimate to add approximately 0.3-0.4 pp to clearly exceed 0.0%, which is larger than the typical second-to-third revision. The upward momentum is encouraging, but the magnitude still required is substantial. Balancing the positive revision trajectory, the historical base rates for sign changes in this range, and the fact that we still need an above-average second-to-third revision, I'm updating modestly upward from my initial 25% to account for the stronger historical precedent while maintaining caution about the remaining revision size needed.",
