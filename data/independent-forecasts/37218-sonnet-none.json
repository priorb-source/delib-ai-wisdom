    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Unknown - UFC 315 date not specified in available information. UFC events typically occur 2-3 times per month, so this could be weeks to months away depending on the current UFC schedule.",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No - Trump does not attend. While Trump has demonstrated interest in UFC events and has attended some in the past, he does not attend the majority of UFC events. The default expectation for any given UFC event is non-attendance.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Trump has scheduling conflicts with campaign events, other political obligations, or personal commitments. The event may be in a location that presents logistical challenges, or the fight card may not feature marquee matchups that would draw his interest. Security concerns or lack of invitation could also prevent attendance.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "UFC 315 features a major championship fight or high-profile card that interests Trump. The event is scheduled at a convenient time and location. Dana White extends a personal invitation as he has done previously. Trump uses the appearance for public visibility and to connect with his fan base, similar to his documented attendance at previous UFC events in Miami and elsewhere.",
    "rationale": "Trump has a documented history of attending UFC events and maintains a close relationship with UFC President Dana White, as evidenced by the recent Miami event mentioned in the background. However, several factors limit the probability: (1) Trump does not attend most UFC events - there are roughly 40+ UFC events per year and he attends only a small fraction; (2) Without specific information about UFC 315's date, location, or card significance, I cannot assess whether this particular event would be attractive to him; (3) As a former president and political figure, his schedule is highly constrained by campaign activities, security requirements, and other obligations; (4) The base rate for attendance at any random UFC event must account for the fact that non-attendance is the norm. The forecast is not higher because there's no evidence this is a particularly significant event (like a major Las Vegas pay-per-view with title fights), nor information suggesting Trump has particular interest in this specific card. The forecast is not lower because Trump has demonstrated genuine interest in UFC and has the means and connections to attend when he chooses. I would update upward if: (1) UFC 315 is announced as a major pay-per-view event with significant title fights, (2) the event is in a location convenient to Trump's schedule, (3) reports emerge of Trump planning to attend. I would update downward if: (1) the event conflicts with major political events, (2) it's in a remote location, (3) it's positioned as a smaller Fight Night card rather than a major event.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill Donald Trump attend UFC 315?\n\nQuestion background:\nAP [Trump sits cageside at Miami UFC event in his latest appearance at a sports event](https://apnews.com/article/trump-ufc-miami-fight-sports-6461901bb3d5f2eec477674d02333a7f)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if President Donald Trump is anywhere within the grounds of the venue where [UFC 315](https://www.ufc.com/event/ufc-315) takes place. Otherwise this resolves as **No**.\n\n\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nNo additional information available.\n\nToday is 2025-04-28.\n\nBefore answering you think:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n(e) You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
