    "review": "All three forecasters converge on similar reasoning and forecasts (60%, 62%, 65%), which increases my confidence in this range. Forecaster 3 introduces a valuable data point about historical prison escape recapture rates exceeding 90%, though this likely refers to longer timeframes than our 46-day window. Forecaster 2 makes an important observation about trails cooling after initial intensive manhunt days and the difficulty fugitives pose once they survive the early period - we're already 14 days in, which is concerning. Both forecasters appropriately emphasize the selection effect: these remaining two are demonstrably harder to catch. However, I notice my forecast may be slightly too pessimistic. The modern surveillance capabilities point is well-taken, and 32 remaining days is actually more than double the time that has already elapsed, providing substantial opportunity for the intensive, well-funded manhunt to succeed.",
    "rationale": "Upon reflection, I maintain concern about three key factors: (1) the compound probability requirement that BOTH must be captured, (2) Massey's extraordinary escape history suggesting genuine expertise, and (3) the 14-day head start these fugitives now have. However, the other forecasters correctly emphasize that 32 days remains substantial time, the resources deployed are exceptional, and modern surveillance makes long-term evasion increasingly difficult. The clustering of forecasts at 60-65% suggests this range appropriately captures the competing dynamics. I'm moving my forecast up slightly from 60% to 62%, aligning with Forecaster 3's analysis. This acknowledges that while Massey's history and the compound probability are serious concerns, the overwhelming resources, support network disruption through 14 accomplice arrests, strong tip flow, and adequate remaining timeframe provide better than even odds for both recaptures. The forecast remains below 70% because the selection effect is real - these are the two most difficult captures - and Massey's proven evasion skills represent a genuine wild card.",
