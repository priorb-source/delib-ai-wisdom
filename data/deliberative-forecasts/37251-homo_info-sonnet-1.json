    "review": "Forecaster 2 provides crucial new information I had missed: Vietnamese troops completed K9 howitzer training in November 2024. This is the strongest positive signal in the entire analysis - such training typically only occurs when procurement is nearly finalized, representing concrete commitment beyond mere negotiations. This is far more significant than 'reported negotiations' and substantially increases the probability. Forecaster 2 also notes the deal has been under discussion since at least 2023 (not just January 2025), and that we're now 6 months past that training without announcement, which is concerning. Forecaster 3 correctly emphasizes the tight 2-month timeline and notes the Korea Herald's observation that relationships 'need more detailed road map,' suggesting incomplete frameworks. Their point about 6-12+ month typical timelines from advanced negotiations to announcement is valid. All three of us converged on 40-55% range, recognizing both the strong positive indicators and significant timing concerns.",
    "rationale": "The November 2024 training revelation is a game-changer that significantly strengthens the case for Yes. Military training on specific systems is expensive and only conducted when procurement is highly likely - this isn't speculative discussion but concrete preparation. Combined with the specific deal parameters ($300M, 20 units), elevated strategic partnership status, and Vietnam's strategic need to diversify from Russian suppliers, the fundamentals strongly support deal completion. However, three major concerns remain: (1) Six months have passed since November training without announcement, suggesting unexpected obstacles; (2) We're already past the Q1 2025 expected timeline; (3) Only 2 months remain for finalizing a $300M first-time arms sale between these countries, which typically requires complex approvals, financing arrangements, and diplomatic coordination. The absence of any announcement despite being in 'final stages' four months ago and having completed training six months ago indicates either significant complications emerged or the timeline was overly optimistic. Two months is workable but not generous for such a deal. I'm updating from 40% to 48% - the November training substantially increases probability, but the persistent delays prevent me from going higher.",
