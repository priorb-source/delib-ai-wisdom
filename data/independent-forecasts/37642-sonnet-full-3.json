  "information": "Multiple Federal Reserve officials have emphasized a patient approach to monetary policy. Fed Chair Jerome Powell stated that the central bank is 'not in a hurry to cut interest rates' and will maintain a 'wait-and-see' approach. Similarly, Fed Governor Adriana Kugler commented that following an agreement to reduce US-China tariffs, the urgency for monetary easing has decreased. The minutes from the January FOMC meeting also indicated that officials decided to hold off on rate cuts until inflation shows more consistent improvement. In March 2025, the Federal Reserve increased its inflation estimate for the year to 2.7% and projected two potential interest rate cuts during 2025.\n\nMajor financial institutions have recently pushed back their timelines for the first interest rate cut. Goldman Sachs adjusted its forecast to expect the first cut in December 2025, a delay from its previous July expectation, citing a stable US economy. Following a stronger-than-expected jobs report, Bank of America also shifted its rate cut expectation from June to July. Morgan Stanley economists now anticipate just one rate cut in 2025, projected for July. A Bloomberg survey of economists also reflects this shift, with the consensus projection for the first Fed rate cut moving from May to July.\n\nRecent economic data and market indicators reflect a mixed economic picture. The US Consumer Price Index (CPI) showed a deceleration in its annual rate. However, the April jobs report indicated a higher-than-expected increase in non-agricultural employment, with the unemployment rate holding at 4.2%. In response to economic developments and Fed communications, market expectations have shifted. Indicators like the CME FedWatch tool show that the perceived likelihood of a rate cut in June has decreased, with many market participants now viewing September or later as the most probable period for the start of an easing cycle.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Approximately 6.5 weeks until July 1, 2025. There are likely 1-2 FOMC meetings remaining before the resolution date, with meetings typically scheduled in mid-to-late May and mid-June.",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No - The Federal Reserve maintains its current interest rate policy without cutting rates before July 1, 2025.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "The Fed continues its patient 'wait-and-see' approach as officials have signaled. Inflation remains above the 2% target at 2.7%, and the strong labor market (4.2% unemployment) provides no urgency for easing. The June FOMC meeting results in the committee voting to hold rates steady, citing the need for more consistent inflation data before beginning rate cuts, with the first cut coming in July or later as most forecasters now project.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Incoming inflation data in May shows significant and unexpected deceleration, with core CPI falling notably below expectations. Simultaneously, signs of economic softening emerge - perhaps weaker retail sales, declining business sentiment, or softening labor market indicators. This combination convinces the FOMC at their June meeting that they have sufficient evidence of inflation trending sustainably toward the 2% target, leading them to announce a 25 basis point rate cut before July 1.",
    "rationale": "The evidence strongly favors the Fed maintaining rates through the end of June. Fed Chair Powell has explicitly stated the central bank is 'not in a hurry to cut interest rates,' and multiple officials have emphasized patience. The January FOMC minutes indicated holding off until 'inflation shows more consistent improvement.' Critically, major financial institutions have systematically pushed back their rate cut forecasts: Goldman Sachs now expects December, Bank of America shifted from June to July, and Morgan Stanley projects July. Market pricing via CME FedWatch shows low probability for June cuts, with September or later viewed as more likely. The March 2025 Fed projection increased the inflation estimate to 2.7%, above target, which argues against immediate cuts. Recent economic data is mixed - CPI is decelerating (positive for cuts) but the April jobs report was stronger than expected with unemployment at 4.2% (reducing urgency). With approximately 6.5 weeks remaining and likely only 1-2 FOMC meetings before July 1, the timeline is compressed. The status quo bias is particularly strong here given the explicit Fed communication and the fact that institutional forecasters who previously expected June/July cuts have now pushed expectations later. My forecast is not higher because: (1) Fed guidance has been unambiguous about patience, (2) inflation remains above target, (3) labor market strength provides no urgency, (4) market pricing reflects low expectations, and (5) major banks have delayed their forecasts. My forecast is not lower because: (1) there are still 1-2 meetings before the deadline, (2) the Fed did project two cuts in 2025, (3) CPI is showing deceleration, (4) economic data can shift rapidly, and (5) some forecasters mention July, suggesting late June isn't impossible. To update higher, I would need: significant inflation undershoot in May data, unexpected economic weakness, or dovish Fed communication. To update lower, I would need: inflation persistence, continued labor market strength, or more explicit Fed guidance ruling out near-term cuts.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill the Federal Reserve cut interest rates before July 1, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nJP Morgan: [Following the Fed’s decision to pause rate cuts, what could its next move be?](https://www.jpmorgan.com/insights/global-research/economy/fed-rate-cuts)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below.
