    "review": "Both forecasters largely mirror my reasoning: very little time left, Morgan’s stated preference for a late/short campaign, no forcing deadlines, and a history of flirting without entering. They add a useful emphasis on Florida’s qualifying timelines (mid-2026) and the absence of any June 2025 trigger, which further supports a No. They also highlight that a party launch could be paired with a candidacy announcement, preserving a non-trivial upside tail. No materially new facts emerged beyond what I considered, but their calibration slightly higher than mine (12–13%) nudges me to modestly adjust upward to reflect the small chance of a surprise party-plus-candidacy rollout.",
    "rationale": "The base case is inaction: Morgan has signaled he’ll watch the field and prefers a three-month campaign, pointing to a much later start. The recent entries (Jolly, Pizzo) and GOP dynamics give him more reason to wait rather than announce in June. His track record of not entering after public flirtations also weighs against a near-term declaration. Countervailing factors: he has resources, enjoys media moments, and could tie a new party launch to a candidacy announcement on short notice. With ~3.5 weeks left and no external deadline, that upside scenario exists but remains unlikely. Given the peers’ arguments and calibration, I slightly raise my estimate to reflect that tail without over-weighting it.",
