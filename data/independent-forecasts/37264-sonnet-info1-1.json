  "information": "The U.S. State Department uses a four-level travel advisory system: Level 1 (Exercise Normal Precautions), Level 2 (Exercise Increased Caution), Level 3 (Reconsider Travel), and Level 4 (Do Not Travel). Advisories are issued based on risks such as crime, terrorism, civil unrest, and health concerns. Level 3 and Level 4 advisories are reviewed at least every six months. As of early May 2025, there were 21 countries with a Level 4 advisory, including Afghanistan, Burkina Faso, Haiti, Iran, Iraq, Libya, Mali, Russia, Somalia, South Sudan, Syria, Ukraine, and Yemen.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Approximately 2 months (from May 2, 2025 to July 1, 2025)",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No - Niger maintains its current travel advisory level (likely Level 3) and does not receive a Level 4 advisory",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Niger maintains its current security situation with no major deterioration. While terrorism, crime, and instability persist at current levels, the State Department continues to assess that these risks warrant a Level 3 (Reconsider Travel) advisory rather than escalating to Level 4 (Do Not Travel). The country's security situation remains distinct enough from neighbors Mali and Burkina Faso to justify the differentiated advisory level.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Niger experiences a significant security deterioration in the next two months - such as a major terrorist attack targeting Western interests, a dramatic increase in kidnappings of foreigners, escalation of post-coup violence, or direct threats to American citizens - prompting the State Department to upgrade to Level 4 before July 1, 2025.",
    "rationale": "My research assistant confirms that as of early May 2025, Niger is NOT among the 21 countries with Level 4 advisories, though neighboring Mali and Burkina Faso both have this designation. This indicates Niger currently holds a lower advisory level (very likely Level 3 given the mentioned risks of terrorism, crime, and limited medical care). This is the crucial status quo that anchors my forecast. The Sahel region faces severe security challenges, and Niger experienced a coup in July 2023 that removed security partnerships with Western nations. These factors create elevated risk. However, several considerations suggest maintaining the status quo is most likely: (1) Despite significant regional instability, the State Department has deliberately kept Niger at a lower level than its neighbors, suggesting they see meaningful differences; (2) The timeframe is only 2 months - very short for major policy shifts; (3) Advisory changes to Level 4 typically require either catastrophic events or prolonged deterioration; (4) If conditions warranted Level 4, the six-month review cycle suggests it might have already occurred. My forecast is not higher because the status quo has held despite ample reasons to escalate, and government advisory systems change slowly. It's not lower because the regional context is genuinely dangerous, post-coup instability persists, and there's non-trivial risk of a security incident. I would update higher if there were reports of specific threats to Americans, major terrorist attacks, or State Department signals of reconsideration. I would update lower if security conditions stabilized or if recent reviews explicitly maintained Level 3 status.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill Niger receive a \"Level 4 – Do Not Travel\" travel advisory from the US State Department before July 1, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nTravel and Tour World: [Niger Faces Growing Travel Risks: U.S. Travel Advisory Highlights Terrorism, Crime, and Limited Medical Care for Tourists in the Country](https://www.travelandtourworld.com/news/article/niger-faces-growing-travel-risks-u-s-travel-advisory-highlights-terrorism-crime-and-limited-medical-care-for-tourists-in-the-country/)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if the country of Niger has received a Level 4 [travel advisory](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/International-Travel-Country-Information-Pages/Niger.html) from the US Department of State before July 1, 2025.\n\n\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nThe U.S. State Department uses a four-level travel advisory system: Level 1 (Exercise Normal Precautions), Level 2 (Exercise Increased Caution), Level 3 (Reconsider Travel), and Level 4 (Do Not Travel).

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
