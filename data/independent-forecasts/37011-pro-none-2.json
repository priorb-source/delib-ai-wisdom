    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Approximately 10 days. The election is held on May 1, 2025, with results expected within a day or two.",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No. The Conservative Party currently holds a large majority on Derbyshire County Council with 45 out of 64 seats following the 2021 election. Reform UK holds zero seats.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "The Conservative and/or Labour parties win the most seats. Despite a national surge in support for Reform UK, their vote is not concentrated enough in individual council divisions to win a plurality of seats under the First Past The Post system. Labour, as the main opposition party, is the primary beneficiary of a decline in Conservative votes, or the Conservatives manage to retain the highest number of seats despite significant losses.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "A historic collapse of the Conservative vote in Derbyshire occurs, with the vast majority of these voters switching directly and effectively to Reform UK. This surge allows Reform to win numerous traditionally Conservative seats across the county, out-polling a Labour party that fails to sufficiently capitalize on the anti-government mood, thus securing the most seats on the council.",
    "rationale": "My forecast is heavily weighted by the status quo. The Conservative party holds a commanding majority on the council (45/64 seats), while Reform UK holds zero. For Reform to win the most seats requires an electoral event of historic proportions. The primary obstacle is the First Past The Post electoral system, which structurally favors established parties and penalizes newer parties whose support, while broad, may not be sufficiently concentrated in individual divisions to win seats. The Labour Party, as the established opposition with 14 seats and significant local infrastructure, is in a much better position to benefit from any collapse in the Conservative vote. Historical precedent for challenger parties like UKIP shows that high national polling does not easily translate into winning the most seats on a county council from a standing start of zero. My forecast is not lower than 5% because the current political environment is highly volatile. Reform's strong national polling indicates a genuine level of support that could, in an exceptional scenario, lead to a major political upset. This small probability accounts for a potential electoral 'earthquake'. My forecast is not higher because this would understate the immense structural advantages of the incumbent Conservative and Labour parties, the inertia of the electoral system, and the organizational challenge Reform faces in converting national sentiment into coordinated local victories across an entire county.",

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
