    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Approximately 6 months. The 2025 Viennese state election is expected to take place in October 2025, following the standard 5-year electoral cycle from the last election held in October 2020.",
    "status_quo_outcome": "The SPÖ wins the most seats. Vienna has been governed by the Social Democratic Party continuously since 1945, making it one of their strongest bastions. In the 2020 election, the SPÖ won 46 out of 100 seats (41.6% vote share), maintaining a comfortable lead over the second-place Greens (24 seats) and the ÖVP (22 seats).",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "A major swing occurs toward the FPÖ (Freedom Party), riding national populist momentum that has grown across Austria. Alternatively, the ÖVP consolidates center-right support and urban middle-class voters concerned about economic issues. The SPÖ could also lose ground due to coalition tensions with the Greens, policy failures on housing affordability, or a major local scandal involving SPÖ leadership. Another party gains 20+ seats at SPÖ's expense.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "The SPÖ maintains its traditional urban stronghold, benefiting from Vienna's left-leaning demographics, effective governance on social housing and public services, and strong organizational infrastructure. The party successfully frames the election around defending Vienna's social democratic model against right-wing populism. Opposition votes remain split among ÖVP, FPÖ, Greens, and NEOS, preventing any single party from challenging SPÖ's plurality.",
    "rationale": "The SPÖ has an extraordinarily strong historical position in Vienna, having governed continuously for 80 years. This represents one of the most durable political arrangements in European democracy. In 2020, they won with a 17-percentage-point margin over the second-place party. Vienna's demographics - urban, diverse, with strong union presence and beneficiaries of social housing - structurally favor the SPÖ. While Austria nationally has seen a surge in FPÖ support, Vienna has historically been more resistant to right-wing parties than rural Austria. Metropolitan areas tend to be less receptive to populist messaging. The SPÖ would need to lose approximately 20 seats for another party to overtake them for plurality - a massive swing that rarely occurs in 6 months absent major shocks. The reference to a March 2025 poll suggests recent data existed, though specifics weren't provided. The main risks to this forecast are: (1) underestimating national political trends that could penetrate Vienna's left-wing firewall, (2) potential SPÖ complacency or governance failures, (3) effective opposition consolidation. However, status quo bias strongly suggests continuity. I'm not forecasting higher (85%+) because electoral surprises do happen, coalitional dynamics can shift, and 6 months allows time for developments. I'm not lower (65%-) because the historical and structural advantages are simply too strong to ignore - it would require an unprecedented collapse.",
