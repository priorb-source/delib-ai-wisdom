    "review": "My initial forecast of 40% was based on the tension between significant Iranian concessions and the extremely short timeline. The other forecasters introduced critical, and somewhat conflicting, new information. Forecaster 2's focus on a maximalist US position (14 'non-negotiable' conditions, including complete dismantlement) and ongoing new sanctions provides a compelling case for why a deal is nearly impossible, pushing the probability down. This argument is strong, as it highlights the vast gap that needs to be bridged. In contrast, Forecaster 3 introduced the concept of an imminent, hard deadline set by President Trump, which completely reframes the situation. This deadline explains the current high tempo of negotiations and the Israeli intelligence assessment of a 'high chance' of a deal. It transforms the short timeline from a bug into a feature—a deliberate forcing mechanism. Forecaster 3's reasoning that this pressure makes a deal likely is convincing, though their 70% probability seems to underestimate the risk of a high-pressure negotiation collapsing, especially given the US maximalist stance described by Forecaster 2.",
    "rationale": "I am updating my forecast upwards from 40% to 55%. The new information, particularly the imminent deadline described by Forecaster 3, is the most impactful variable. My initial concern about the short timeline being a primary obstacle is now mitigated; the timeline is intentionally short to force a resolution. This makes a definitive outcome before July 1—either a deal or a collapse—much more likely than a continuation of the status quo. The question is which outcome is more probable. While Forecaster 2 makes a powerful case for failure based on the rigid US public stance, such positions are often softened in final, closed-door negotiations. The combination of the specific, significant Iranian concessions described in my initial report (eliminating the HEU stockpile), the high tempo of talks, and the external validation from Israeli media (which now makes more sense in the context of a forcing deadline) leads me to believe a 'Yes' outcome is now more likely than not. I am not raising my forecast as high as Forecaster 3 because the risk of collapse is very real; the US could hold to its maximalist demands, or domestic hardliners in either country could scuttle a last-minute compromise. My new forecast of 55% reflects that the deadline has made a deal the marginal favorite, but the situation remains highly uncertain and close to a coin flip.",
