  "information": "According to the US Census Bureau, U.S. imports reached a record high of $342.7 billion in March 2025, a 5% increase from February. This surge was attributed to businesses front-running impending tariffs. The import of consumer goods rose 55.5% year-over-year to $102.8 billion, and automotive vehicle imports also jumped. This activity led to the U.S. trade deficit for goods increasing by 9.6% to a record $162 billion in March. A similar, though smaller, surge was observed in January 2025, when imports reached $320 billion, with notable increases in shipments from China, Canada, and Mexico.\n\nNew tariffs, referred to as the 'Liberation Day' tariffs, took effect in April 2025. These included a 10% baseline tariff on most imports, with higher rates on certain categories like automobiles and specific Chinese products, where tariffs reached up to 145%. Following the implementation, early reports in April indicated a 64% collapse in new U.S. import orders. Real-time data showed significant drops in trade activity, including a 35% fall in scheduled container arrivals at the port of Los Angeles, a 30% plunge in U.S.-China imports according to Project 44, and a 40% decline in overall imports reported by Drewry. The S&P Global PMI also indicated a slowdown in U.S. business activity in April. Despite these indicators, the U.S. Treasury collected $16.5 billion in tariff revenue between April 1 and April 28.\n\nData from the shipping and logistics sector in April 2025 reflected the impact of new tariffs. Freightos and Hillebrand data showed that Asia-U.S. container rates had fallen by 5%. Shipping lines reported an increase in 'blank sailings' (cancelled voyages) and vessels from China that were only half-full. In 2024, China accounted for approximately 36% of U.S. imports, with its share being higher at key ports like Los Angeles (51%) and Long Beach (61%). Port data indicated that the number of ships scheduled to arrive in May 2025 had decreased significantly. Separately, Mexico had become the U.S.'s top trading partner in early 2025, with its exports to the U.S. growing 9.6% in January to a record $41.68 billion.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Approximately 5-6 weeks. The official data for April 2025 from the US Census Bureau is scheduled to be released in early June 2025.",
    "status_quo_outcome": "The implementation of significant new tariffs in April 2025 has fundamentally altered the status quo. The new baseline expectation, given this major policy shock, is for a substantial reduction in import volumes and value compared to the previous year.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "The 'Liberation Day' tariffs, which took effect on April 1, 2025, dramatically increase the cost of imported goods. Businesses anticipated this by front-loading orders into March, causing a record high that month and subsequently depressing demand in April. Multiple real-time indicators, such as a collapse in new import orders and a sharp drop in shipping container volumes, reflect this new reality, causing the total import value to fall significantly below the April 2024 level.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Despite the new tariffs and evidence of a slowdown, the total value of imports exceeds the April 2024 figure. This happens because the decline in the volume of goods is more than compensated for by a massive surge in the import of very high-value items (e.g., commercial aircraft, pharmaceuticals, or specialized industrial machinery) whose delivery was not affected by the tariffs. In this scenario, the real-time container data proves to be a poor indicator of the total import value.",
    "rationale": "My forecast is for a 'No' outcome with very high confidence. The central reason is the implementation of the broad and significant 'Liberation Day' tariffs at the beginning of April 2025. This policy shift is supported by compelling evidence of its immediate impact. First, the record-high imports of $342.7 billion in March 2025 demonstrate a clear 'front-running' behavior by businesses, which pulled demand forward from April, creating an inevitable drop. Second, multiple, independent real-time data streams for April all point to a severe contraction: a reported 64% collapse in new import orders, a 35-40% decline in shipping volumes from key partners, and an increase in cancelled 'blank sailings'. The most conclusive piece of data is the $16.5 billion in tariff revenue collected in April. Even at the baseline 10% tariff rate, this would imply total imports of only $165 billion, far below the $338.5 billion threshold. The probability is not lower than 5 to account for the remote possibility of major errors in the real-time data or an unobserved surge in extremely high-value, non-containerized goods. The probability is not higher because the evidence from policy, business behavior, and real-time data is overwhelmingly aligned and points to a significant decrease in imports. I would only increase my probability of 'Yes' if it emerged that the tariff revenue data was fundamentally flawed or if contradictory data showed a massive influx of high-value capital goods.",
