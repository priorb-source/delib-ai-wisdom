  "information": "Saipan has become a popular destination for Korean tourists, who constituted 70% of the island's visitors in 2024. The Governor of Saipan, Arnold Palacios, has identified the Korean tourist market as a primary focus for growth and sustainability. In line with this, the Mariana Visitors Authority launched a marketing campaign titled 'This is the Marianas' for the Korean market. The 2025 Saipan Marathon attracted over 200 Korean participants out of 612 runners from 19 countries. Additionally, KB Kookmin Card initiated a promotional event for its Visa cardholders traveling to destinations including Saipan, offering discounts on flights, hotels, dining, and shopping starting from July 18.\n\nThe weakness of the Japanese yen poses a challenge to tourism in the Northern Mariana Islands (NMI), as Japanese travelers tend to prefer non-U.S. dollar destinations. Japanese visitor numbers to the CNMI were 7,762 in 2023 and 13,779 in 2024, with the increase largely due to cruise ship arrivals. In response, United Airlines has launched a digital advertising campaign for its Narita-Saipan route, and the Marianas Visitors Authority has partnered with Japanese travel agencies. The islands also received diving awards at the 'Marine Diving Fair 2025' in Tokyo, highlighting their appeal. Separately, Hong Kong Airlines lists Saipan as one of its destinations, and travel platform Expedia noted a significant increase in search volume for Saipan from Hong Kong travelers.\n\nAs of mid-May 2025, flight tracking websites indicate that Saipan International Airport (SPN) has three to four non-stop flight destinations. These are Guam (GUM), served by United Airlines; Seoul-Incheon (ICN), served by Jeju Air, T’way Air, and Jin Air; Busan (PUS), served by Jeju Air; and an intermittently listed service to Tokyo-Narita (NRT), operated by United Airlines. A report by the Mastercard Economics Institute notes a general surge in travel within the Asia-Pacific region. Saipan's tourism appeal is supported by sightseeing opportunities related to its history, nature, and culture, including tours of WWII battlefields and natural sites like Managaha Island and The Grotto.",

    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "About 42 days (until July 1, 2025)",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "FlightsFrom.com lists only Guam (GUM), Seoul-Incheon (ICN), Busan (PUS), and possibly Tokyo-Narita (NRT), totaling 3–4 destinations, with no additional routes loaded into schedules by July 1, 2025.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "At least one additional destination beyond GUM, ICN, PUS, and NRT is loaded into global schedules and appears on FlightsFrom.com by July 1, 2025 (e.g., a new Korean city like Daegu or Cheongju, or a resumed Japan/Hong Kong/Philippines route). If NRT is absent, two new destinations would need to appear.",
    "rationale": "As of mid-May 2025, Saipan (SPN) shows 3–4 non-stop destinations: GUM, ICN, PUS, and an intermittently listed NRT. The resolution source is FlightsFrom.com on/after July 1, which typically reflects any scheduled service loaded in OAG/GDS over the next 12 months. To resolve Yes (>4), SPN needs to show at least five destinations by that check. Given the short lead time (~6 weeks) and the absence of clear announcements of new routes, inertia favors the current 3–4. Korean demand is the strongest pillar (70% of visitors in 2024; targeted marketing; strong Korean participation in local events), so a last-minute seasonal Korean LCC addition (e.g., TAE/CJJ/MWX) is the most plausible path to a fifth destination. However, weak Japanese outbound demand (yen depreciation) makes additional Japan routes less likely, and the termination of CNMI’s parole program for PRC visitors limits prospects for China-mainland routes. Hong Kong interest exists (HK Airlines lists SPN; search interest up), but no confirmed scheduled launch is evident, and airlines typically announce and load routes weeks to months in advance. Therefore, the base case is No. I’m not lower because summer-peak Korean carriers can add routes with relatively short notice, and only one additional destination (assuming NRT remains listed) would be enough. I’m not higher because there’s no concrete evidence of a new route loaded yet, and if NRT drops from the listing, two new destinations would be needed. Upside update triggers: a Korean LCC (Jeju, T’way, Jin Air) loads another Korean city to SPN for summer; Hong Kong Airlines/HK Express or a Japanese carrier announces and loads SPN; United’s NRT-SPN shows consistently for the forward schedule. Downside triggers: NRT disappears from FlightsFrom or any currently listed route is suspended in schedules by July 1.",
