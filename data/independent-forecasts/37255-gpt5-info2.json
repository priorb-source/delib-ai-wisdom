  "information": "As of late April 2025, the African Continental Free Trade Area (AfCFTA) has achieved a 92% consensus on trade rules. Forty-nine of the 54 African countries have joined the agreement, with 23 having commenced implementation of the new trade rules. Supporting infrastructure includes the Pan-African Payment and Settlement System (PAPSS), which now connects over 20 central banks and 160 commercial banks, enabling easier payment for goods in local currencies. Additionally, Afreximbank is organizing specialized training programs to help African businesses understand the AfCFTA's commercial implications and regulatory landscape.",

    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "About 61 days (until June 30, 2025; outcome known July 1, 2025)",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Libya’s split institutions (GNU in Tripoli and the HoR/administration in the east) do not prioritize AfCFTA. No parliamentary ratification vote is scheduled or concluded, inter-governmental friction delays treaty processing, and no instrument of ratification is deposited with the AU Commission by June 30.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "A political window opens: the cabinet endorses AfCFTA, the House of Representatives quickly approves, and Libya deposits the instrument of ratification with the AU Commission before July 1—potentially spurred by AU/AfCFTA Secretariat pressure or linkage to upcoming AU meetings and economic reform messaging.",
    "rationale": "Time is short and the status quo favors inaction. Libya has generally been listed as a signatory that has not yet ratified AfCFTA, and ratification requires coordination across divided institutions plus the formal deposit of the instrument with the AU Commission. With only two months left, the base rate of a country moving from non‑ratified to deposited in that window is low absent clear political impetus.\n\nSupporting context from the research assistant: AfCFTA is advancing continent‑wide—49 of 54 countries have joined (interpretable as ratified), with 23 implementing aspects, PAPSS is scaling, and Afreximbank is supporting private‑sector readiness. This broad momentum slightly raises the odds that outliers move to ratify to avoid being left behind, but it does not by itself overcome Libya’s domestic constraints or guarantee rapid legislative action.\n\nWhy not higher: Libya’s internal political fragmentation, limited legislative bandwidth, and the need for both approval and timely deposit make a swift ratification unlikely. There has been no widely reported, time‑bound commitment from Libyan authorities to complete ratification by mid‑2025.\n\nWhy not lower: Continental pressure and reputational incentives increase as AfCFTA nears near‑universal ratification. If Libya wants to signal economic normalization or align with AU priorities ahead of mid‑year engagements, a fast‑track is conceivable.\n\nWhat would move me up: credible reports of (1) cabinet approval and submission to the HoR; (2) the HoR scheduling and passing the ratification; and (3) the Foreign Ministry/Presidential Council preparing immediate deposit with the AU. Public statements from senior Libyan officials committing to deposit before July 1, or AU/AfCFTA Secretariat announcements of imminent Libyan ratification, would also raise odds.\n\nWhat would move me down: renewed political standoffs, legislative recess or boycotts, or signals that ratification is being deferred to broader economic or constitutional reforms.\n",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill Libya ratify AfCFTA (the pan-African free trade agreement) before July 1, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nWikipedia: [African Continental Free Trade Area](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/African_Continental_Free_Trade_Area)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if Libya ratifies the African Continental Free Trade Area (AfCFTA) Agreement before July 1, 2025.\n\n\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nAs of late April 2025, the African Continental Free Trade Area (AfCFTA) has achieved a 92% consensus on trade rules.

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
