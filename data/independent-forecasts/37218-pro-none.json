    "no_outcome_scenario": "Donald Trump does not travel to Perth, Australia for the event, as the long journey and time commitment conflict with his schedule or are deemed not to be a political priority.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Leveraging his strong relationship with UFC CEO Dana White, Donald Trump decides to attend the event, potentially as part of a wider tour of the region or simply as a dedicated fan, and is seen at the venue in Perth.",
    "rationale": "My forecast is primarily driven by the event's location. While Donald Trump has a consistent and well-documented history of attending major UFC events, these appearances have been exclusively within the United States. The provided article about his attendance in Miami confirms this pattern of leveraging domestic sporting events for visibility. However, UFC 315 is scheduled to take place in Perth, Australia. The logistical hurdles, significant time commitment, and security complexities associated with a former or sitting US President traveling internationally for a single sporting event are substantial. The political benefit of appearing before an Australian crowd is also likely lower compared to a domestic audience. The status quo is that Trump attends US-based UFC events, not international ones, making 'No' the more probable outcome. My probability is not lower because of Trump's unpredictability and his very strong personal relationship with Dana White, which leaves a small chance for an extraordinary arrangement to be made for his attendance. My probability is not higher because the immense practical barrier of intercontinental travel is an overwhelmingly strong factor that breaks his established pattern of attendance. I would significantly raise my forecast if information emerged that Trump was planning other engagements in Australia or the wider Asia-Pacific region around the same time. Conversely, confirmation of conflicting domestic commitments would lower my forecast further.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill Donald Trump attend UFC 315?\n\nQuestion background:\nAP [Trump sits cageside at Miami UFC event in his latest appearance at a sports event](https://apnews.com/article/trump-ufc-miami-fight-sports-6461901bb3d5f2eec477674d02333a7f)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if President Donald Trump is anywhere within the grounds of the venue where [UFC 315](https://www.ufc.com/event/ufc-315) takes place. Otherwise this resolves as **No**.\n\n\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nNo additional information available.\n\nToday is 2025-04-28.\n\nBefore answering you think:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n(e) You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
