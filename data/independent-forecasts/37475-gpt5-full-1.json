  "information": "The recall was initiated by Johnsonville LLC on April 5, 2025, for approximately 22,672 pounds of its cheddar bratwurst product due to potential contamination with hard plastic. The affected products were produced on a single date, February 5, 2025, and bear the establishment number 'Est. 1647'. The U.S. Department of Agriculture’s Food Safety and Inspection Service (FSIS) classified this as a Class I recall, indicating a high health risk. The recall was prompted by two consumer complaints, but no confirmed injuries have been reported. The product was distributed to retail locations in ten states: Georgia, Indiana, Kansas, Kentucky, Michigan, Minnesota, Ohio, Tennessee, Virginia, and Wisconsin. The FSIS has noted concerns that the product may still be in consumers' freezers.\n\nThe FSIS follows a structured process for closing recalls. This process involves verifying that the recalling firm has notified all its customers, confirming that the product has been removed from circulation, conducting effectiveness checks to ensure the product is no longer available to consumers, and verifying that the company has implemented corrective actions. For Class I recalls, which are deemed high-risk, the FSIS enforces more rigorous verification requirements before it can be closed. Recalls involving foreign material contamination necessitate a comprehensive investigation into the source of the contaminant and the implementation of effective preventive measures.\n\nHistorical data on similar FSIS recalls provides context for typical closure timelines. Many previous recalls handled by Johnsonville were closed within 4 to 8 weeks. Broader data for Class I meat recalls of a similar size often shows closure within 2 to 4 months after the announcement. However, some cases can take longer; a recall for Tyson Fun Nuggets in 2023 took approximately four months to close. A January 2025 report from the Plastic Pollution Coalition also mentioned that several recalls from 2024 involving plastic contamination remained ongoing for several months after their initiation.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "About 53 days (until 2025-07-01)",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No — the FSIS page currently shows Active; if nothing changes by July 1, the question resolves No.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "FSIS effectiveness checks uncover product still in commerce or freezers, the firm’s root-cause/corrective actions take longer, or the recall is expanded to additional lots or geographies. Any of these delays keep the status as Active past July 1 or FSIS updates the page to Closed only after July 1.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "The issue is limited to the single Feb 5 lot; Johnsonville completes notifications, recovery, and corrective actions; FSIS effectiveness checks pass smoothly; and FSIS updates the recall status to Closed in mid-to-late June.",
    "rationale": "This recall (initiated Apr 5, 2025) is a Class I foreign-material event limited to one production date (~22,672 lbs, 10 states). The research assistant notes Johnsonville’s past recalls often closed in 4–8 weeks, and broader Class I meat recalls of similar size frequently close in 2–4 months. July 1 is about 86 days post-announcement (~2.8 months), which sits within the common closure window. That favors a modestly-above-even chance of closure by the cutoff.\nCountervailing factors: Class I foreign-material recalls can take longer due to root-cause investigations and preventive measures; FSIS flagged concern that product may remain in consumers’ freezers; and some plastic-related recalls have stayed open for several months. There is also publication-timing risk: even if actions are complete, the status might not flip to Closed on the webpage before July 1.\nWeighting the status quo: The current state is Active, and many recalls do run beyond two months. Still, the limited scope (single-day lot, established firm) and Johnsonville’s track record support a better-than-50% chance of timely closure. I therefore forecast a moderate edge to Yes, but not high.\nWhy not higher: risks of effectiveness-check delays, potential expansion, or page-update lag. Why not lower: constrained lot/date, moderate size, and Johnsonville’s historically faster closures.\nWhat would move me up: evidence of successful effectiveness checks, no expansion, and FSIS/firm updates indicating corrective actions completed; similar 2025 recalls of this profile closing within ~6–8 weeks. What would move me down: any expansion, additional complaints/injuries, indications of product still on shelves/freezers in late June, or silence/Active status persisting near end of June.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill the USDA-posted recall by Johnsonville LLC of cheddar bratwurst for foreign matter contamination issued April 5, 2025 be closed before July 1, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nReal Simple: [Over 22,000 Pounds of a Popular Sausage Brand Recalled Due to Contamination](https://www.realsimple.com/sausage-recall-2025-11711268)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below.

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any).
