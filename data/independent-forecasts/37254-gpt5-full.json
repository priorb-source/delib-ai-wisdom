  "information": "The United States and Ukraine have signed an agreement establishing a fund for reconstruction and granting the US administration access to Ukraine's mineral resources, including rare earth minerals. In an official statement about the deal, the US Treasury Department mentioned the 'large-scale invasion' of Ukraine by Russia. In parallel, the US has urged both Russia and Ukraine to accept its peace proposal during a UN Security Council meeting. On February 24, 2025, the US voted against a UN resolution demanding the immediate withdrawal of Russian troops from Ukrainian territory, aligning with Russia and North Korea. The US presented an alternative resolution that called for a 'swift end' to the conflict without mentioning Russian aggression.\n\nUkrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky has issued warnings that Russia may be preparing a new wave of aggression under the guise of the upcoming 'West-2025' military exercises in Belarus. The potential targets mentioned in these warnings include a further invasion of Ukraine, or an attack on Lithuania or Poland. Zelensky stated that intelligence reports indicate Russia is building up its military forces in Belarus, with as many as 150,000 soldiers, for a potential invasion of a NATO country. In response, Ukraine's State Border Guard Service is closely monitoring the border with Belarus and tracking the movement of Russian units.\n\nRussia's recent history of military invasions includes Georgia in 2008, the annexation of Crimea and intervention in Eastern Ukraine in 2014, and the full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022. The US has historically been prompt in publicly accusing Russia of military aggression when it occurs. Currently, Russia's military remains heavily committed in Ukraine. Reports from various think tanks and news organizations, including RUSI, CSIS, Politico, and the BBC, do not indicate any new, significant Russian troop buildups for operations in countries other than Ukraine.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "About 61 days (through June 30, 2025)",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Russia keeps its ground forces focused on Ukraine and continues hybrid activities elsewhere (cyber, sabotage, disinformation) without overtly sending regular troops into another sovereign country without consent; the US makes no such accusation.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "A sudden overt move by Russian regular forces beyond existing deployments, most plausibly from Transnistria into Moldova-proper or a fresh incursion deeper into Georgia beyond the occupation lines, or an extremely risky border incursion into a NATO state (e.g., Lithuania/Poland) that Washington publicly labels an invasion.",
    "rationale": "- Time window is short. With roughly two months left, the base rate of a brand-new overt Russian invasion starting (and being publicly accused by the US) in that period is low.\n- Force posture and constraints: Russia remains heavily tied down in Ukraine and is still reconstituting equipment and manpower. Opening a new overt front would be costly and risky, particularly against NATO. OSINT from major think tanks and media (RUSI, CSIS, Politico, BBC) does not show large, new deployments for operations outside Ukraine.\n- Likely theaters:\n  • NATO states (Baltics/Poland): Extremely unlikely due to Article 5 deterrence; any incursion would risk immediate escalation. \n  • Belarus: Russian presence there is with Minsk’s consent, so not an invasion per the criterion. \n  • Moldova/Transnistria: A conceivable flashpoint, but Russia’s ability to reinforce is constrained (no land corridor; Ukrainian air defenses complicate airlift). While a provocation is possible, it remains a tail risk in the next 60 days. \n  • Georgia: Russia already occupies territory; a new, clear expansion deeper into Georgia is possible but there are no credible indications of imminent action.\n- US accusation threshold: If Russia did send regular ground forces without consent, the US would almost certainly accuse quickly. Thus the binding constraint is the event itself.\n- Research assistant input: \n  • Warnings about “West-2025” exercises and possible use of Belarus as cover to strike a NATO state increase theoretical risk but those exercises are later in the year; there’s no corroborated OSINT of a 150,000-strong buildup in Belarus now. \n  • The claim that the US voted with Russia and North Korea at the UN against a resolution on Russian withdrawal appears inconsistent with public record and does not affect this forecast. \n- Why not higher? Because new overt invasions are rare events, Russia is already engaged in high-intensity war, there’s strong NATO deterrence, and no credible, large-scale preparatory movements are evident.\n- Why not lower? Russia has a track record of opportunistic moves (Georgia 2008; Ukraine 2014/2022), and there are plausible, if low-probability, paths (e.g., a Transnistria-triggered incident) that could prompt a US accusation.\n- What would move me up: Verified OSINT of significant Russian force movements into staging areas near Moldova/Georgia or NATO borders; unusual airlift activity toward Transnistria; mass evacuation alerts; US/European intelligence warnings of false-flag plans; Russian legal/political steps signaling imminent annexation/invasion.\n- What would move me down: Clear de-escalatory signals; significant Russian force attrition or domestic constraints reducing expeditionary capacity; convincing diplomatic assurances backed by observable drawdowns.",

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
