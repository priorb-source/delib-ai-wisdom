    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Approximately 13 days until June 15, 2025, when the FRED data for May 2025 year-over-year growth will be available for checking.",
    "status_quo_outcome": "Yes - positive year-over-year growth continues",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Industrial production experiences a significant decline in May 2025 compared to May 2024, possibly due to an unexpected economic shock, major manufacturing slowdown, severe supply chain disruption, or the negative effects of tariffs causing a sharp contraction that wasn't evident in earlier months.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Industrial production maintains its positive trajectory, with May 2025 activity remaining above May 2024 levels. The momentum from April 2025's 1.48803% year-over-year growth continues, supported by stable economic conditions and manufacturing activity sustaining the trend mentioned in the background article about record highs.",
    "rationale": "The most critical factor is that April 2025 showed robust positive year-over-year growth of 1.48803%, and the background article explicitly mentions industrial production hitting record highs. Since we're forecasting what May 2025 data will show (May has already occurred but data isn't released until mid-June), this is essentially a nowcast rather than a forecast of future events.\n\nIndustrial production typically exhibits momentum and doesn't swing dramatically from positive to negative month-over-month without major economic disruptions. The absence of any reported major shocks or crises in May 2025 in the available information strongly suggests continuity with April's positive trend.\n\nReasons my forecast isn't higher (closer to 95%): Economic data can contain surprises, preliminary numbers occasionally show unexpected volatility, and we lack granular information about May 2025 conditions. Manufacturing indices and other leading indicators could have shown weakness not yet reflected in our information.\n\nReasons my forecast isn't lower (closer to 70%): The strong recent positive trend, record highs mentioned in the background, and the absence of any information suggesting deterioration make a sudden reversal unlikely. Industrial production showed positive growth, and absent evidence of a shock, mean reversion wouldn't be expected to turn growth negative within a single month.\n\nI would update higher if: Information emerged confirming strong manufacturing activity or positive leading indicators for May 2025. I would update lower if: Evidence of an economic shock, manufacturing contraction, or other negative developments in May 2025 came to light.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill monthly US Industrial production have positive year-over-year growth for May 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nThe Real Economy Blog: [Industrial production index hits record high amid tariffs](https://realeconomy.rsmus.com/industrial-production-index-rises-to-record-amid-tariffs/)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if the monthly number displayed at FRED [Industrial Production: Total Index (INDPRO)](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/INDPRO#) for year-over-year growth is greater than 0.0 for May 2025, when checked by Metaculus on or after June 15, 2025.\n\nWhen accessing the data, ensure settings are Units: Percent Change from Year Ago, Seasonally Adjusted and Frequency: Monthly. For example, the number for April 2025 was 1.48803 as of May 27, 2025.\n\nSince the numbers presented by FRED are expected to be preliminary numbers from the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, please note that subsequent revisions to the number will not cause this question to re-resolve.\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nNo additional information available.\n\nToday is 2025-06-02.\n\nBefore answering you think:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n(e) You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
