    "review": "Both forecasters lean more on the Electoral Calculus/Find Out Now projection and the general volatility narrative than I do. Useful points they raised: (1) acknowledging a lower threshold than a majority for “most seats” (though F2’s 35–40 seat figure seems too high for largest party in a fragmented field); (2) the possibility that defections signal some local organisational gains. What’s missing: neither quantifies candidate coverage/division‑level ground game for Reform, which is critical for FPTP conversion; neither engages with 2024 local/GE evidence that Reform underperforms expectations in sub‑national contests without strong local infrastructure; and both arguably overweight a single, experimental local MRP/projection with limited track record for county divisions. I agree the EC call creates a real tail, but 25% looks too high given conversion barriers. The 18% case is closer to my view but still seems to over‑credit the projection and underweight organisational constraints.",
    "rationale": "Core view unchanged: to be the largest party, Reform likely needs 20+ wins across coastal and some semi‑urban divisions, materially exceeding UKIP’s 2013 peak (17), while simultaneously benefiting from a broad Conservative collapse and persistent three‑ or four‑way splits that deny Labour/Lib Dem/Greens local breakthroughs. FPTP conversion, candidate quality/coverage, and incumbency remain major hurdles. The EC/Find Out Now projection points to a non‑trivial upside, but its methodology for county divisions is unproven and sensitive to assumptions; absent triangulating evidence (e.g., division‑level polling, canvass returns, near‑full credible slate), I treat it as an outlier rather than a base case. I modestly adjust upward to reflect: (a) the possibility that the conservative vote fragments enough to let low‑to‑mid 20s seat totals top the table, and (b) the pattern of defections giving Reform a few incumbent footholds. Countervailing factors: Reform’s historical local underperformance versus national VI, limited time for further gains, and likely opposition from Labour/Lib Dem/Greens in different geographies that constrains Reform’s ceiling. Net: a small upward nudge, but still a clear No‑favoured outcome.",
