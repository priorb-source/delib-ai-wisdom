    "review": "Both forecasters largely mirror my initial take: tiny market, short runway, regulatory headwinds, and lack of prelaunch signals make a near-term Uber launch unlikely. Forecaster 2 adds useful comparators (Uber Taxi integrations elsewhere, emphasis on partnerships) and the historical resistance in small islands with fixed-fare regimes; Forecaster 3 underscores that the April 2025 crackdown speaks to enforcement posture and that any legitimate Uber entry would likely generate visible signals (MoUs, taxi-association announcements, job postings). None of their arguments suggest a higher probability than I had; if anything, they reinforce my base case. No materially new pro-Yes evidence surfaced.",
    "rationale": "Time remaining is about 60 days. Status quo is No. A Yes would almost certainly require an Uber Taxi-style integration with licensed taxis plus regulator/taxi-association buy-in, followed by a public listing on Uber’s site. Given the April 2025 warnings and fines for facilitating illegal taxis, the government’s posture is to channel rides into regulated, local frameworks (including the new “Rate Your Ride” and the existence of GetMe Ride and Conch Cab). Uber’s recent expansion cadence favors larger or clearly regulated markets, and small Caribbean islands with strong taxi lobbies have been slow to adopt Uber unless a formal taxi-integration deal is struck—and those deals typically leave traces beforehand. I see no such signals. A rapid pilot is not impossible, but absent any credible reporting or Uber-facing artifacts (newsroom posts, city page, job listings, association statements), the path-to-Yes before July 1 remains narrow. Therefore I keep my forecast unchanged.",
