  "information": "As of early June 2025, India has not received an official invitation to the G7 summit scheduled to take place in Canada from June 15-17. Multiple media outlets, including The Tribune and the Hindustan Times, have reported this, citing official sources. These reports indicate that no advance preparations for a high-level visit from India are underway. This is contrary to the protocol for such trips, which are typically planned weeks in advance for security and logistical coordination. Canada has extended invitations to other non-G7 countries, including Australia, Ukraine, South Africa, and Brazil.\n\nDiplomatic relations between India and Canada were impacted following the killing of Khalistani separatist leader Hardeep Singh Nijjar in Canada in June 2023. The previous Canadian government under Justin Trudeau had made allegations regarding Indian government involvement, which India denied. Following a change in government, new Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney and Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi exchanged messages expressing a desire to strengthen bilateral ties. However, Indian officials have stated concerns regarding the activities of Khalistani elements in Canada and expect Ottawa to guarantee the safety of Indian diplomats.\n\nSikh organizations in Canada, including the 'Sikh Federation' and the 'World Sikh Organization', have publicly demanded that the Canadian government not invite Prime Minister Modi to the G7 summit. They have cited the Indian government's alleged involvement in the murder of Hardeep Singh Nijjar and other human rights concerns. In a letter to Prime Minister Mark Carney, the World Sikh Organization of Canada stated that inviting the Indian Prime Minister would be an 'irresponsible decision' and would signal that Canada is willing to ignore foreign interference.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "12-14 days (G7 Summit is scheduled for June 15-17, 2025)",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No - Modi will not attend. As of June 3, 2025, India has not received an invitation and no advance preparations are underway.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "India never receives an invitation, or receives one too late for proper security and logistics coordination. Strained India-Canada relations and domestic political pressure from Sikh organizations prevent Canada from extending an invitation, or cause India to decline if one is offered.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Canada extends a last-minute invitation within the next 1-2 days, motivated by geopolitical considerations or the new Prime Minister's desire to reset relations. India accepts despite short notice, and Modi decides to attend to demonstrate diplomatic engagement, with both sides fast-tracking security and logistics arrangements.",
    "rationale": "The evidence strongly suggests Modi will not attend. First, with only 12-14 days until the summit, India has not received an invitation, and high-level diplomatic visits of this nature require weeks of advance planning for security and logistics. The research assistant confirms no preparations are underway, which is telling given standard protocol. Second, Canada has selectively invited other non-G7 countries (Australia, Ukraine, South Africa, Brazil) but not India, suggesting a deliberate decision. Third, strained India-Canada relations following the Nijjar killing allegations create significant political obstacles. Fourth, Sikh organizations are actively lobbying against Modi's invitation. The new Canadian PM Mark Carney might theoretically extend an unexpected invitation to reset relations, but doing so this late would violate diplomatic protocol and create serious security/logistics challenges. Even if invited immediately, Modi would need to accept on short notice despite poor optics and domestic political risks in Canada. For my forecast to increase significantly, I would need to see: (1) an official invitation extended within 24-48 hours, (2) clear signals from both governments of acceptance, and (3) evidence of expedited security preparations. For it to decrease further, I would need explicit statements ruling out India's participation. I'm forecasting low but not near-zero because diplomatic surprises occasionally occur and both nations have expressed interest in improved relations.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill India's PM Narendra Modi attend the G7 Summit in June 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nTimes of India: [Canada invites Australia, Ukraine for G7 meet but no call for India yet](https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/canada-invites-australia-ukraine-for-g7-meet-but-no-call-for-india-yet/articleshow/121398906.cms)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below.
