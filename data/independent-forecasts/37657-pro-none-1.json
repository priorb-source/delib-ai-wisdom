    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "About 1.5 months (the question resolves on July 1, 2025, and today is May 16, 2025).",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "The virus remains within its animal reservoir hosts (likely bats), and no spillover event leading to a diagnosed and reported human infection occurs before the deadline. Or, a spillover event occurs but is either asymptomatic, not detected, or not officially reported by a credible source before July 1, 2025.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "A person, such as a researcher, farmer, or someone living near bat habitats in China, becomes infected with HKU5-CoV-2 through contact with an infected animal. The individual develops symptoms, seeks medical care, and advanced diagnostics (like genetic sequencing) identify the novel virus. This case is then confirmed and officially reported by an organization like the WHO or CDC before the resolution date.",
    "rationale": "My forecast is overwhelmingly guided by the extremely short timeframe and the base rate for zoonotic spillover events. The status quo is that there are no known human cases of HKU5-CoV-2, and with only about six weeks until the resolution date, it is highly probable this will not change. Zoonotic spillover from a newly discovered animal virus to a human is a rare event. For this question to resolve 'Yes,' a complex chain of events must occur rapidly: spillover, infection, symptom development, medical consultation, correct diagnosis of a novel virus, and official reporting by a major public health body. While global surveillance for novel pathogens has improved post-COVID-19, the probability of this entire sequence completing for a previously unknown virus in such a short window is exceptionally low.\n\nMy forecast is not lower than 1% because spillover events are not impossible, and post-COVID surveillance systems are more sensitive, making rapid detection of an unusual case more plausible than it was in the past. There is a non-zero chance of a lab accident or a field researcher becoming infected and being quickly diagnosed.\n\nMy forecast is not higher because there is currently no evidence to suggest HKU5-CoV-2 is primed for human transmission. We lack information about its affinity for human receptors, its prevalence in animal reservoirs, or any signs of an outbreak in intermediate hosts that have high contact with humans. Without such evidence, the high barrier of the short deadline remains the dominant factor.\n\nI would increase my forecast if reports emerged of unusual pneumonia clusters in the regions where the virus was discovered, or if genetic analysis showed mutations suggesting adaptation to human cells.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill there be any human cases of the novel coronavirus, HKU5-CoV-2, before July 1, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\n[Discovery of HKU5-CoV-2, a Novel Coronavirus in China](https://assure-test.com/discovery-of-hku5-cov-2-a-novel-coronavirus-in-china/)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if before July 1, 2025, there are any human cases reported anywhere globally of HKU5-CoV-2.\n\nQuestion resolves according to [credible sources](https://www.metaculus.com/help/faq/#definitions), especially the World Health Organization or US Centers for Disease Control.\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nNo additional information available.\n\nToday is 2025-05-16.\n\nBefore answering you think:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n(e) You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
