  "information": "According to reports from sources including The New York Times, Bloomberg, and Ars Technica in March 2025, Discord is planning an initial public offering (IPO) for 2025. The company is reportedly in discussions with investment banks Goldman Sachs and JP Morgan Chase to prepare for a potential listing. While some sources describe the talks as exploratory, others mention the hiring of a new CEO with IPO experience as a signal of late-stage readiness. Discord's valuation was estimated at approximately $15 billion in 2021, and it has over 200 million monthly active users.\n\nDiscord had previously considered going public in 2021 but postponed those plans due to market volatility. That same year, Microsoft offered to acquire Discord for $10 billion, but the company's leadership rejected the offer and a potential IPO was considered as an alternative. Responding to the recent 2025 IPO reports, a Discord spokesperson stated that the company does not comment on rumors or speculation. Discord's revenue is generated through a 'freemium' model, selling subscriptions for premium features.\n\nThe environment for technology IPOs in 2025 is described with mixed signals. Some reports mention a favorable IPO window, noting that other tech firms like CoreWeave, Klarna, and Figma have recently filed to go public. Other reports highlight market volatility, pointing to a recent 7-8.7% drop in the tech-heavy Nasdaq index and uncertainty surrounding Fed rate and trade policies as potential headwinds for companies considering a public launch.",

    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "About 38 days (until end of June 30, 2025)",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Discord continues preparing privately (including any confidential submissions) but does not publicly file an S-1 or post a specific IPO plan on its News/Blog before July 1, citing market volatility or targeting a later 2025 window.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Discord publicly files an S-1 on EDGAR in late May or June, or posts a specific News/Blog announcement that it plans to go public (e.g., acknowledging a proposed IPO or a filed registration statement).",
    "rationale": "- What we know: Credible reports (NYT, Bloomberg, Ars Technica) in March 2025 said Discord is planning a 2025 IPO and working with Goldman Sachs and JPMorgan. There are hints of late-stage readiness (leadership with IPO experience), but there has been no official announcement. A spokesperson said they don’t comment on rumors.\n- Resolution criteria: This question only resolves Yes via (1) a public S-1 on EDGAR or (2) a specific IPO announcement on Discord’s News/Blog. In practice, large tech firms rarely pre-announce IPO plans on their blog because of quiet-period concerns; the most likely qualifying trigger is a public S-1 filing. Confidential submissions would not count.\n- Timing realities: With roughly five-and-a-half weeks left, a Yes requires a filing or specific blog post by June 30. Many companies targeting a fall IPO publicly file an initial S-1 weeks to months in advance and amend later, so a late-June public S-1 isn’t impossible even if pricing is in Q3/Q4. However, if Discord aims for a later 2025 listing, it may prefer to delay the public filing until closer to that date. \n- Market backdrop: The assistant notes mixed conditions—some peers moving toward listings, but also Nasdaq volatility and uncertainty on rates/trade. That environment doesn’t force a rush to file by July 1 and slightly favors waiting unless the window feels particularly attractive in June.\n- Base-rate/Status-quo weighting: As of May 23, there is no S-1 on record and no official statement. Most of the time, the status quo persists over short horizons; given just ~5 weeks remain, the default path is no filing before July 1.\nWhy not higher: We lack an official step (S-1) so far; the window is short; blog-only announcements are unlikely; markets are choppy.\nWhy not lower: Reputable reporting indicates 2025 IPO planning with top-tier banks and signs of readiness. It’s plausible Discord publicly files an initial S-1 in late June to start the clock even if pricing is later.\nWhat would move me up: Credible reports of an imminent S-1 (“as soon as weeks”), evidence of a confidential submission moving to public, notable market rally and strong peer IPO performance, or a company communication hinting at near-term filing. \nWhat would move me down: Renewed market selloff, negative company-specific news, a fresh private funding round that reduces urgency to go public, or reporting that the target is explicitly Q4 with a planned public filing after July 1.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nBefore July 1, 2025, will Discord announce that it is planning an IPO?\n\nQuestion background:\nArs Technica: [Discord is planning an IPO this year, and big changes could be on the horizon](https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2025/03/report-discord-partners-with-jp-morgan-chase-goldman-sachs-for-a-2025-ipo/)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question will resolve as **Yes** if Discord, Inc., announces before July 1, 2025, that it is planning an initial public offering. In order to streamline the resolution of this question, there are two resolution sources for the IPO announcement: 1) The company filing an [SEC Form S-1](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/sec-form-s-1.asp) or 2) An announcement at the [news](https://discord.com/blog) section of its website. If there is no such announcement before that date, this question resolves as **No**.\n\nPlease note that for an announcement on the news section of the company's website to resolve the question as Yes, the announcement must be specific. Vague statements such as \"someday becoming a public company\" will not count. If there is any doubt, then greater weight will be placed on whether an S-1 has been filed.\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nAccording to reports from sources including The New York Times, Bloomberg, and Ars Technica in March 2025, Discord is planning an initial public offering (IPO) for 2025.

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
