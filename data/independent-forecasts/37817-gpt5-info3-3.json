  "information": "Tourism in Palau is in a recovery phase. Visitor numbers from Europe reached 3,442 by December 2024, approaching pre-pandemic levels. The Palau Visitors Authority is promoting the destination by leveraging increased flight frequency with partners like China Airlines. Hong Kong Airlines also lists Koror as a destination within its network. Prior to the pandemic, several South Korean airlines, including Air Seoul and T'way, operated services to Palau. A previous service between Narita and Koror operated by Delta Air Lines was suspended in May 2018.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "About 6 weeks (≈41 days)",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No (5 or fewer direct destinations)",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Only the currently established routes (e.g., Taipei with China Airlines and Guam with United, possibly Yap and a seasonal Seoul flight) are operating, totaling no more than five destinations listed on flightsfrom.com on July 1, 2025.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Multiple additional services are scheduled and loaded into GDS by July 1—e.g., confirmed summer-season flights from Seoul (and possibly Busan), a resumed Hong Kong service, United’s Yap sector active, and perhaps a Philippines route (Clark/Manila)—bringing Koror’s total to six or more listed destinations on flightsfrom.com.",
    "rationale": "Baseline conditions suggest Koror still has a thin network post‑pandemic. The durable routes are Taipei (China Airlines) and Guam (United). Yap may or may not be operating regularly, and Korean services (Air Seoul/T’way/Jeju Air) have been intermittent/seasonal. The Marketplace piece (Apr 2024) highlights that South Korean tourism hasn’t bounced back due to limited flights, and the PRC group-tour restriction on Palau continues to dampen prospects for Mainland China-linked demand, which also reduces the odds that Hong Kong Airlines prioritizes a Palau restart. The research assistant’s note that China Airlines increased frequency helps capacity but doesn’t add destinations; Hong Kong Airlines “listing” Koror is not evidence of active scheduled service. Delta’s former Narita route is long gone.\n\nTo get a Yes (>5 destinations), Koror would likely need at least three of the following to be scheduled by July: a robust Korean service (ICN and/or PUS), a true Hong Kong resumption, United’s Yap leg showing as scheduled, and a Philippines link (MNL/CRK). With only ~6 weeks left and no widely reported announcements, that stack of events is unlikely. Flightsfrom.com relies on filed schedules; ad-hoc charters typically won’t count. The status quo tends to persist over short horizons, and for a small market like Palau, network expansions usually come with notice.\n\nWhy not higher: Achieving six or more destinations requires multiple independent resumptions in a short window with limited demand signals and geopolitical constraints (PRC tour ban). Why not lower: There is a non-trivial chance that summer seasonal Korean flights plus a Hong Kong or Philippines restart and a Yap sector could all be visible in July schedules, especially if local authorities pushed hard for peak-season capacity.\n\nWhat would move me up: Confirmed, loaded July schedules from Korean carriers (ICN and/or PUS), a published Hong Kong Airlines (or HK Express) schedule, United’s Yap service clearly bookable, or a Philippines carrier publishing CRK/MNL–ROR in GDS. What would move me down: News of continued suspension of Yap, absence of any new filings by early June, or reductions by United/China Airlines.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill there be greater than 5 direct flight destinations from Koror, Palau on July 1, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nMarketplace: [Why hasn’t tourism recovered in Palau?

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
