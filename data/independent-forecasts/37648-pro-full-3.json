  "information": "Ali Shamkhani, an advisor to Iran's Supreme Leader, has stated that Iran is ready to accept a new nuclear agreement with the United States in exchange for the immediate lifting of all economic sanctions. According to Shamkhani, Iran would commit to never producing nuclear weapons, eliminate its stockpile of highly enriched uranium, and limit uranium enrichment to civilian levels under international oversight. Iran is currently enriching uranium to 60%. In a separate proposal presented during talks in Oman, Iran suggested the creation of a permanent joint nuclear enrichment company with regional Arab countries and American investors. Under this plan, Iran would continue to enrich uranium to a low level for civilian use and export it to other Arab nations, subject to increased international monitoring. Iranian officials have stated that the complete dismantlement of its nuclear program is a 'red line' but they are willing to cooperate to maintain their right to develop a peaceful civilian program.\n\nThe U.S. administration has outlined 14 non-negotiable 'red lines' for any new nuclear deal with Iran. These conditions include the complete removal of all of Iran's enriched uranium, the dismantling of its centrifuges, and the absence of any 'sunset clauses' that would allow restrictions to expire. President Trump has stated he is open to a deal to make the region safer, but his administration has also recently imposed new sanctions on Iran. Iran's Ministry of Foreign Affairs has called the introduction of new sanctions during negotiations 'unacceptable.' Vice President J.D. Vance has publicly stated that Iran acquiring a nuclear weapon is 'completely off the table.' The U.S. negotiating position emphasizes the need for a 'strong agreement' with robust verification measures.\n\nSince April 2025, the United States and Iran have engaged in multiple rounds of indirect negotiations, mediated by Oman. The talks have been held in Muscat, Oman, and Rome, Italy, with the most recent fourth round taking place in Muscat on May 11. A fifth round of negotiations has been agreed upon. Both sides have described the discussions with terms such as 'constructive,' 'productive,' and 'difficult but useful,' with an Iranian official stating that the parties' positions have 'converged' and 'progress has been made.' In parallel, Iran is also scheduled to hold talks with the 'Euratrium'—the UK, France, and Germany—in Istanbul. The negotiations are proceeding under a deadline reportedly set by President Trump in March, which gave Iran two months to reach an agreement.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Approximately 6.5 weeks. The deadline is July 1, 2025, and today's date is May 15, 2025.",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No agreement exists. The U.S. maintains significant economic sanctions on Iran, while Iran continues to enrich uranium to high levels (60%) and advance its nuclear program. Indirect negotiations are ongoing, but no breakthrough has been achieved.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "The fundamental gap between the U.S. 'red lines' (complete dismantlement of Iran's program) and Iran's 'red lines' (maintaining a peaceful civilian program) proves insurmountable in the short time remaining. The fifth round of talks stalls, new U.S. sanctions undermine trust, and domestic hardliners in both countries prevent negotiators from making the necessary concessions. The July 1 deadline passes with no agreement announced.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Pressure from the looming deadline and a mutual desire to de-escalate leads to a breakthrough. The parties announce a limited, interim agreement rather than a comprehensive deal. For instance, Iran agrees to halt enrichment at 60% and increase international monitoring in exchange for the U.S. easing specific economic sanctions. This allows both sides to claim a diplomatic victory and sets the stage for future negotiations on a more permanent solution.",
    "rationale": "My forecast leans towards a 'Yes' outcome primarily due to the intensity and positive tenor of the ongoing negotiations, coupled with the broad resolution criteria which would be satisfied by even a limited, interim deal. Since April 2025, four rounds of indirect talks have occurred, with a fifth planned. Language from negotiators describing the talks as 'constructive' and noting that positions have 'converged' indicates genuine momentum. The report that senior Israeli ministers believe there is a 'high chance' of a deal is a significant external indicator supporting this view. Both sides have strong incentives: Iran desperately needs sanctions relief for its economy, and the Trump administration would secure a major foreign policy achievement. The short deadline could force both parties to accept a less-than-perfect interim agreement to de-escalate the situation. \n\nMy probability is not higher because the publicly stated positions of both countries remain worlds apart. The U.S. demand for complete dismantlement of Iran's program and removal of all enriched uranium directly contradicts Iran's stated 'red line' of maintaining its right to a peaceful civilian program. The recent imposition of new U.S. sanctions during negotiations is a contradictory and detrimental action that could easily derail the process. The status quo of 'no deal' has been entrenched for years, representing a powerful force of inertia.\n\nMy probability is not lower because the high frequency of talks and optimistic language from negotiators cannot be dismissed. A complete diplomatic collapse seems less likely at this stage than either a limited agreement or a mutual decision to extend the deadline. The broadness of the resolution criteria makes a 'Yes' outcome more plausible, as it does not require a comprehensive, long-term treaty.\n\nI would increase my forecast if credible reports emerge that the U.S. is willing to waive some of its 14 'red lines' in favor of an interim deal. I would decrease it if the fifth round of talks is cancelled or ends acrimoniously, or if either Supreme Leader Khamenei or President Trump makes a public statement rejecting the current path of negotiations.",
