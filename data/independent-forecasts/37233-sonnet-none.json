    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "33 days until June 1, 2025",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No - Ouattara has not declared his candidacy, and if nothing changes in the next 33 days, the resolution will be No",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Ouattara does not declare his candidacy before June 1, 2025, either because he decides not to run for another term (possibly due to his advanced age of approximately 82-83 years), or he strategically delays his announcement until closer to the October/November election date, which is typical practice for Ivorian presidential candidates",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Ouattara formally announces his candidacy for the 2025 presidential election within the next 33 days, potentially motivated by pressure from his political party to declare early, a desire to solidify his position ahead of potential challengers, or to begin campaign activities sooner than usual",
    "rationale": "The base rate strongly favors No given the absence of any reported indication that Ouattara plans to declare candidacy imminently. With only 33 days remaining until the June 1 deadline, and the presidential election not scheduled until October/November 2025, early June represents approximately 4-5 months before the election - potentially earlier than typical candidacy declaration timelines in Ivorian politics. My research assistant provided no information suggesting an imminent declaration or even signs that Ouattara intends to run again. At 82-83 years old, age and health considerations could reasonably factor into his decision-making. While Ouattara has previously run despite constitutional controversies (notably in 2020 regarding term limits), the complete absence of signals about a 2025 run combined with the short timeframe makes a pre-June 1 declaration unlikely. My forecast is not lower because: (1) 33 days is still sufficient time for a declaration announcement, (2) sitting presidents often seek re-election, and (3) lack of information doesn't mean lack of intention. My forecast is not higher because: (1) no evidence suggests imminent declaration, (2) June 1 may be earlier than strategically optimal for an announcement, and (3) his advanced age presents natural questions about another term. I would update higher with reports of party meetings discussing his candidacy, public statements hinting at running, or insider information about declaration timing. I would update lower if he made statements suggesting retirement or if alternative candidates from his party emerged prominently.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill Alassane Ouattara declare his candidacy for president of Ivory Coast (Côte d’Ivoire) before June 1, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nAfrica Center for Strategic Studies: [Côte d’Ivoire: Efforts to Forge Resiliency Face Stiff Test](https://africacenter.org/spotlight/2025-elections/cotedivoire/)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if Alassane Ouattara declares his candidacy for the [2025 Ivorian presidential election](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2025_Ivorian_presidential_election), according to credible sources, before June 1, 2025.\n\n\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nNo additional information available.\n\nToday is 2025-04-29.\n\nBefore answering you think:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n(e) You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
