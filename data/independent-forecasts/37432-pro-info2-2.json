  "information": "The Ohio legislature has Republican supermajorities in both the Senate (26-7) and the House (67-32). Senators Theresa Gavarone and Andrew Brenner are key sponsors pushing for stricter election laws. In early 2023, Governor Mike DeWine signed HB 458, a voter ID law. However, Governor DeWine has also expressed some hesitation regarding the current proof-of-citizenship proposals. Organizations such as the ACLU are actively opposing the new legislation. The Ohio General Assembly has session days scheduled through late June 2025, ahead of the July 1, 2025 resolution deadline.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Less than 2 months.",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No new legislation expanding voter citizenship verification is enacted by the deadline.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Despite Republican supermajorities, the legislative clock runs out before the July 1, 2025 deadline. A combination of procedural delays by the Democratic minority, disagreements between the House and Senate on the bill's final language, and Governor DeWine's public hesitation prevents the bill from passing both chambers in identical form in time.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Republican leadership in the General Assembly makes the bill a top priority for the remainder of the session. They use their supermajorities to fast-track the legislation, limiting debate and quickly reconciling any differences between the House and Senate versions. The bill passes both chambers in late June, and Governor DeWine, despite his reservations, signs it into law to avoid a public veto override fight with his party's legislative leaders.",
    "rationale": "My forecast of 25% is primarily driven by the extremely tight timeline. With today being May 5, 2025, there are less than two months until the July 1 deadline. The legislative process is inherently slow, with multiple potential veto points including committee hearings, floor votes, and bicameral reconciliation. Passing a controversial bill in this short timeframe is a significant challenge, making the status quo (no enactment) the most likely outcome.\n\nThe primary factors supporting a 'Yes' outcome are the strong Republican supermajorities in both the Ohio House (67-32) and Senate (26-7), and the clear motivation from key sponsors like Senators Gavarone and Brenner. This political power means that if leadership makes this bill a top priority, they have the votes to push it through. The passage of a voter ID law (HB 458) in 2023 demonstrates this legislature's capacity to enact stricter election laws.\n\nHowever, several factors weigh against enactment. The most significant is the clock. Secondly, Governor Mike DeWine's reported hesitation introduces a crucial obstacle. While his veto could be overridden, his opposition could slow the process, require time-consuming negotiations, or persuade a small number of moderate Republicans to withhold support, complicating the path to passage. Lastly, even within a supermajority, there can be internal disagreements on the details of legislation, which take time to resolve.\n\nMy probability is not lower than 25% because a united Republican caucus could use its power to suspend rules and accelerate the legislative process, making passage before the deadline possible, though difficult. My probability is not higher because the timeline is the dominant constraint; the high procedural barriers and Governor DeWine's position make failure to enact the bill more probable than success. I would increase my forecast if the bill quickly passed one of the chambers with a veto-proof majority. I would decrease it if legislative leaders indicate it is not a priority for the remaining session.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nBefore July 1, 2025, will Ohio enact legislation expanding its verification requirements of a voter's citizenship?\n\nQuestion background:\nThe Ohio Senate: [Gavarone, Brenner Introduce Bill to Require Proof of Citizenship to Vote](https://ohiosenate.gov/members/theresa-gavarone/news/gavarone-brenner-introduce-bill-to-require-proof-of-citizenship-to-vote)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if, before July 1, 2025, the state of Ohio enacts legislation requiring voters to provide proof of US citizenship beyond the requirements at the time of this question, according to [credible sources](https://www.metaculus.com/faq/#definitions).\n\nAny subset of voters being required to provide such proof would count (for example if it only applied to first-time voter registrants or creating a new requirement for mail-in voters). An example of a bill that would count is [Senate Bill 153](https://www.legislature.ohio.gov/legislation/136/sb153). This question resolves upon enactment; therefore other questions such as when the legislation takes effect or whether it survives court challenges and is implemented is immaterial to this question's resolution. Please note that under Ohio law, a bill is considered enacted \"after both houses have passed and agreed on identical bills.\" ([Source](https://www.lsc.ohio.gov/assets/organizations/legislative-service-commission/files/chapter-5-enacting-legislation-10021971.pdf))\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nThe Ohio legislature has Republican supermajorities in both the Senate (26-7) and the House (67-32).

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
