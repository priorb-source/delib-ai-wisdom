    "review": "Both forecasters correctly emphasize Article 21(2) GG, that only the Federal Constitutional Court can ban a party, and that proceedings historically take months to years (their added examples of SRP ~1 year and KPD ~5 years strengthen the timeline argument beyond my NPD focus). They also explicitly noted who can file (Bundestag, Bundesrat, or Federal Government), and that mere parliamentary debate or a motion does not initiate, let alone conclude, a ban. I find their reasoning solid and aligned with mine. One additional nuance I’d underline is that even extraordinary interim measures by the Court would likely not constitute a “ban” under the resolution criteria, further shrinking the already tiny tail. I therefore don’t see new evidence pushing the probability up; if anything, their historical timelines reinforce the near-zero view.",
    "rationale": "Time to deadline is ~60 days. There is no public indication of a filed case, docketing, or expedited schedule. Party bans are rare, constitutionally weighty, and procedurally intensive; the shortest historical example still exceeded the remaining time. Only a final decision by the Federal Constitutional Court would satisfy the resolution, and interim measures would likely not qualify as an official ban. Given the absence of process milestones and the Court’s typical cadence, a ban before July 1, 2025 is effectively foreclosed. I keep a minimal tail for an unprecedented, shocking development coupled with an extraordinary, clearly labeled final decision—an outcome for which there is no precedent or signal. Accordingly, I do not change my forecast.",
