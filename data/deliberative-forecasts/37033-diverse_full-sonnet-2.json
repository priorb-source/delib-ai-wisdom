    "review": "The other forecasters raise several valuable points I should weigh more carefully. Forecaster 3's distinction between bond issuance versus cash payments is crucial - the resolution criteria's reference to 'additional such disbursements' and the cash payment example suggests cash tranches are what count, not the 10-year bonds covering the 99% balance. Both forecasters appropriately emphasized the February $20M BIPPA payment as evidence of Zimbabwe's capacity to execute politically sensitive payments, though I note this was planned as the first of multi-year allocations through 2028, suggesting a measured pace rather than rapid-fire tranches. Forecaster 3's observation that the April payment coincided with IMF/World Bank Spring Meetings is insightful - it suggests payments are strategically timed for maximum diplomatic impact, not necessarily on an accelerated schedule. Both forecasters center their analysis around 35-42% probabilities, arguing the $6.9M budget remainder and political incentives balance against the short timeframe and fiscal pressures. However, I believe they may be underweighting the significance of the timeframe constraint and the government's likely preference to space payments over the remainder of 2025.",
    "rationale": "After reviewing the other analyses, I maintain that the 5-6 week timeframe is the dominant constraint. While the $6.9M budget allocation exists and Zimbabwe has demonstrated capacity through the February $20M and April $3.1M payments, several factors support a more conservative forecast: (1) No public announcement of an imminent second tranche exists, (2) The government faces a declared drought emergency that will consume administrative attention and foreign currency, (3) Making two payments within 7-8 weeks total would be exceptionally rapid by normal government standards, especially for a country facing severe liquidity constraints, (4) The first payment likely fulfilled the immediate signaling need for international re-engagement - the urgency for a rapid follow-up is lower, (5) The payment structure (1% cash upfront, 99% via 10-year bonds) suggests the April cash payment may have satisfied the immediate cash component for the first batch. I should update slightly upward from my initial 28% to acknowledge the demonstrated payment capacity and available budget, but the short window and lack of announced schedule remain powerful constraints. The base rate for governments making two separate compensation payments within 8 weeks, while facing economic crisis and competing emergencies, is low.",
