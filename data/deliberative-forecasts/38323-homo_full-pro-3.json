    "review": "The other two forecasters presented analyses that are highly consistent with my own, arriving at the same 15% probability. Their reasoning is sound and convincing. I found their specific articulation of the methodological differences between the University of Michigan and Conference Board surveys particularly useful. They correctly noted that the UMich index is more sensitive to personal finances and inflation expectations—the main sources of current consumer weakness—while the Conference Board's index is more reactive to the labor market. This provides a strong rationale for discounting the conflicting positive signal from the Conference Board, an argument that strengthens the case for a 'No' outcome. The strong consensus reinforces my confidence in the initial assessment, as we all identified the same key drivers: the historically large jump required from a low baseline, the negative trend, and the weak underlying economic data points like inflation expectations and hiring.",
    "rationale": "I am maintaining my forecast of 15%. The deliberation with my peers has reinforced my initial analysis rather than altering it. The core of the forecast remains unchanged: the Index of Consumer Sentiment (ICS) would need to increase by at least 7.9 points from its May 2025 level of 52.2 to resolve this question as 'Yes'. A single-month jump of this magnitude is historically rare, having occurred less than 3% of the time in the 2010-2019 period. The fundamental economic picture continues to support a pessimistic outlook. Consumers' one-year inflation expectations are at a four-decade high, private-sector hiring has slowed significantly, and financial stress is evident in rising student loan delinquencies. The key piece of conflicting data, a rise in the Conference Board's consumer confidence index, was convincingly addressed during deliberation; its differing focus on the labor market makes it less indicative of the UMich index's likely path, especially given the high inflation and personal finance concerns that disproportionately affect the UMich survey. The unanimous agreement among all three forecasters on both the probability and the underlying reasoning gives me greater conviction in my initial forecast.",
