    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "About 2 weeks (primary scheduled for June 17, 2025)",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No — another Democrat narrowly wins a multi-candidate primary, likely on Northern Virginia strength",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "A well-funded opponent with a strong Northern Virginia base (e.g., a high-profile prosecutor) consolidates suburban voters and wins a plurality while Jones underperforms outside Hampton Roads.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Jones consolidates African American voters statewide, performs strongly in Hampton Roads and Richmond, and remains competitive enough in Northern Virginia to win a plurality in a split field.",
    "rationale": "Timing: With roughly two weeks to go and no fresh public polling in the research summary, the priors and structural factors loom large.\n\nBase rates and structure: Open Virginia Democratic statewide primaries often hinge on regional turnout, particularly Northern Virginia, and on whether any candidate can consolidate a key demographic bloc. Jay Jones is credible statewide (he took a substantial share against an incumbent AG in 2021), is well known in Hampton Roads, and could unify a significant portion of Black voters. Those are meaningful advantages. On the other hand, if there is a prominent Northern Virginia contender (e.g., a sitting/commonwealth’s attorney with prosecutorial credentials), NOVA’s outsized turnout can be decisive. Electability and public-safety narratives could also advantage a prosecutor over a former delegate.\n\nStatus quo leaning: In the absence of new data, the status quo slightly favors “No” because (a) NOVA often dominates Democratic primaries, (b) a prosecutor opponent can frame experience as more directly relevant for AG, and (c) Jones previously lost to an incumbent and must broaden beyond his base. That said, his past statewide performance and potential to consolidate a key demographic bloc keep his chances substantial.\n\nWhy not higher: Lack of evidence that Jones has locked down NOVA or clear statewide polling leads; the likelihood of at least one strong opponent with a large regional base; and the possibility that public-safety framing benefits a prosecutor rival.\n\nWhy not lower: Jones has meaningful name recognition, prior statewide vote share, potential to consolidate Black voters, and a strong base in Hampton Roads that can be decisive in a split field.\n\nWhat would move this up: Credible polling showing Jones ahead or surging; high-profile, broad endorsements (especially from NOVA leaders); clear fundraising dominance; signs that other candidates split the NOVA vote or face late-breaking controversies.\n\nWhat would move this down: Polls showing a NOVA-based opponent leading outside Hampton Roads; major endorsements consolidating around a rival; fundraising or field data indicating Jones is lagging in NOVA/Richmond suburbs; or negative news about Jones.\n\nResearch assistant summary: No additional information was provided, so this forecast leans on structural priors, 2021 precedent, and typical Virginia primary dynamics.",

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
