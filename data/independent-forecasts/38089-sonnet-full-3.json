  "information": "According to a visual analysis of a Morning Consult snapshot from May 8, 2025, Pedro Sánchez's approval rating was 35%, while Recep Tayyip Erdoğan's was 32%. A separate survey from January 21-27, 2025 by the same source, reported by El Economista, listed both leaders as having high disapproval rates. Regarding economic indicators, reports noted that Turkey's consumer confidence gained 5% in April, contrasted with a slump in Europe, and that Spain was experiencing an economic recovery.\n\nSpanish Prime Minister Pedro Sánchez has taken a vocal stance on the conflict in Gaza, describing the situation as a 'genocide' and vowing to raise Spain's voice to end the 'massacre.' In May 2024, his government officially recognized the State of Palestine, and Spain is expected to impose sanctions on Israel. Sánchez is also pushing for stronger EU action, including a review of the EU-Israel Association Agreement. Domestically, his activities include efforts for Catalan language recognition and social policies such as early retirement reforms.\n\nTurkish President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan has initiated work on a new constitution, appointing a team of legal experts to draft it. Erdoğan stated the current constitution is outdated, while critics raised concerns the move could be intended to extend his presidency beyond 2028, a claim he has denied. Erdoğan also ruled out early elections. In foreign affairs, he publicly criticized Pedro Sánchez for showing support for the detained Istanbul Mayor, Ekrem İmamoğlu. The two leaders met in Istanbul in May 2025 to discuss bilateral relations, including trade, security, and the situation in Gaza.",

    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Approximately 33 days until July 1, 2025",
    "status_quo_outcome": "Yes - Based on the most recent Morning Consult data from May 8, 2025, Pedro Sánchez has a higher approval rating (35%) than Recep Tayyip Erdoğan (32%), a 3 percentage point lead",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Erdoğan's approval rating increases or Sánchez's decreases by at least 3 points in the next month. This could occur if Turkey's improving economic indicators (consumer confidence up 5% in April) translate into higher approval, if Erdoğan's constitutional reform initiative proves popular, or if Sánchez faces backlash over his Gaza stance or domestic policies. Alternatively, Spain's economic recovery could stall, reducing support for Sánchez",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Sánchez maintains or extends his current 3-point lead through July 1. This would occur if Spain's economic recovery continues supporting his approval, if his vocal stance on Gaza/Palestine resonates positively with Spanish voters, or if his domestic policies (Catalan language recognition, retirement reforms) maintain support. Erdoğan's approval could also decline if concerns grow about his constitutional reform being a power grab to extend his presidency beyond 2028",
    "rationale": "The status quo strongly favors a Yes resolution. As of May 8, 2025 (21 days ago), Sánchez held a 3-percentage-point advantage. With only 33 days remaining and Morning Consult updating monthly, likely only one or two data updates will occur before resolution. Approval ratings typically change slowly month-to-month absent major crises or scandals. Supporting factors for maintaining the status quo include Spain's ongoing economic recovery and no mention of major scandals affecting Sánchez. Risk factors include the relatively narrow 3-point margin, both leaders having high disapproval rates suggesting potential volatility, and Erdoğan's improving economic indicators (Turkey's consumer confidence gains). However, Erdoğan's constitutional reform faces criticism as a potential power grab, which could suppress his ratings. The short timeframe combined with typical approval rating stability heavily weights toward the current outcome. My forecast is not higher because the 3-point gap is narrow enough to flip with one bad month for Sánchez or good month for Erdoğan. It's not lower because historical patterns show approval ratings rarely shift dramatically within a single month without extraordinary events, and the status quo clearly favors Yes. I would revise upward if new polling shows Sánchez extending his lead or if major negative news emerges about Erdoğan. I would revise downward if polling shows the gap narrowing, if Sánchez faces a major scandal, or if Erdoğan receives a significant domestic popularity boost",
