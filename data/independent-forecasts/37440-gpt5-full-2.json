  "information": "Several bills concerning voter citizenship verification were considered in Florida's legislature. HB 831 would require state-issued IDs to indicate non-citizen status. HB 1381 would require voters to provide proof of citizenship, such as a passport or birth certificate, for new or updated registrations. SB 1330 would require first-time voters to present similar documentation. The 2025 regular legislative session concluded without enacting these bills. A comprehensive bill containing similar provisions, CS/HB 1381, was withdrawn from consideration on May 3, 2025. An extended legislative session, constitutionally required to pass the state budget, began on May 12, 2025.\n\nFlorida's legislature is controlled by a Republican supermajority in both chambers. Governor Ron DeSantis has a history of supporting and signing legislation described as strengthening election integrity. In May 2025, DeSantis signed a law that creates new hurdles for the citizens' initiative process, including a ban on non-citizens and non-residents from gathering signatures for petitions. This followed the enactment of SB 7016 in April 2025, which also restricts ballot initiatives.\n\nThe push for expanded voter citizenship verification in Florida aligns with a broader national trend. The U.S. House of Representatives passed the Safeguard American Voter Eligibility (SAVE) Act, which would require proof of citizenship for voter registration nationwide, though it is unlikely to pass the Senate. Separately, President Donald Trump signed an executive order to impose stricter verification requirements. Other states have also advanced similar legislation; Wyoming passed a law requiring proof of citizenship to vote that is set to become effective on July 1, and a bill in Tennessee to create a citizenship verification portal for election workers has advanced in its state house.",

    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "About 56 days (until July 1, 2025)",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No enactment before July 1, 2025",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "The regular session has adjourned without passing any relevant bill; the budget-extension session remains narrowly focused on appropriations; no special session is called that includes voter-citizenship verification; bills like HB 831/SB 1330/HB 1381 remain withdrawn or die and nothing similar is revived before July 1.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Legislative leaders and/or the Governor call or expand a special/extended session agenda to include “election integrity” and quickly pass a narrowly tailored bill (e.g., requiring documentary proof for first-time registrants or flagging non-citizen status on state IDs) that qualifies as expanding voter citizenship verification; the Governor signs it before July 1.",
    "rationale": "- Where things stand: The 2025 regular session ended without enactment of HB 831, HB 1381, or SB 1330; CS/HB 1381 was withdrawn May 3. An extension beginning May 12 is to finish the budget. In Florida, once Sine Die occurs for policy, moving substantive new policy typically requires a special session or leadership explicitly broadening the scope of an extension. That makes new enactment before July 1 structurally harder.\n- Politics: Republicans hold supermajorities and Gov. DeSantis favors “election integrity” measures. Florida recently enacted new hurdles for citizen initiatives (May) and earlier initiative restrictions (SB 7016), showing willingness to legislate on related topics. National GOP momentum (e.g., U.S. House passage of the SAVE Act; a Trump executive order in this scenario) adds pressure. These factors keep the probability above “near-zero.”\n- Headwinds: (1) Timing—only ~8 weeks left. (2) The main vehicles were withdrawn; reviving complex election policy outside regular order is nontrivial. (3) Legal/administrative risk—documentary proof-of-citizenship faces NVRA complications and near-certain litigation; election officials may push back on implementation burden. Even though legality doesn’t affect resolution, it affects legislators’ incentives to rush a bill. (4) The budget extension is likely confined to appropriations; adding controversial policy would be unusual.\n- Why not higher: Session dynamics and short runway dominate. If leadership truly wanted this in 2025 regular session, they likely could have moved it; withdrawal suggests internal friction or strategic delay. Passing something substantial now would require a special session specifically scoped to elections or immigration.\n- Why not lower: The GOP trifecta, the Governor’s track record, and national alignment mean a special session is plausible. Florida has used special sessions for high-priority partisan objectives before. The bar for this question is “any expansion,” so even a limited requirement (e.g., first-time registrants, mail voters, or ID notation like HB 831) would qualify.\n- What would move me up: Announcement of a special session or broadened extension agenda that includes elections/immigration; public commitments by the Governor, Speaker, or Senate President to pass proof-of-citizenship provisions; filing of a new strike-all or amendment reviving HB 831/HB 1381/SB 1330 language; credible reporting that leadership is whipping votes. \n- What would move me down: Clear statements that no policy will be taken up in the extension; adjournment without special session call; leadership signaling the issue is punted to 2026; evidence of strong administrative or legal concerns deterring near-term action.\n\nBottom line: With regular session closed for policy and only a narrow window left, passage before July 1 requires a special procedural move. Politically plausible but procedurally uphill.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nBefore July 1, 2025, will Florida enact legislation expanding its verification requirements of a voter's citizenship?\n\nQuestion background:\nTallahassee Democrat: [Florida may require proof of citizenship to vote under new legislation echoing Trump](https://www.tallahassee.com/story/news/local/state/2025/04/02/got-id-proof-of-citizenship-may-soon-be-needed-to-vote-in-florida/82756919007/)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if, before July 1, 2025, the state of Florida enacts legislation requiring voters to provide proof of US citizenship beyond the requirements at the time of this question, according to [credible sources](https://www.metaculus.com/faq/#definitions).\n\nAny subset of voters being required to provide such proof would count (for example if it only applied to first-time voter registrants or creating a new requirement for mail-in voters). An example of a bill that would count is [HB 831](https://www.flsenate.gov/Session/Bill/2025/831). This question resolves upon enactment; therefore other questions such as when the legislation takes effect or whether it survives court challenges and is implemented is immaterial to this question's resolution.\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nSeveral bills concerning voter citizenship verification were considered in Florida's legislature.

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower.
