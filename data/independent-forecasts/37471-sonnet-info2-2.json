  "information": "Data from the U.S. Census Bureau and the Department of Housing and Urban Development for March 2025 showed that new single-family home sales reached a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 724,000, which is up 6% year-over-year. The median sales price of new homes sold was $403,600, a decrease of 7.5% from the same period in the previous year. According to Freddie Mac, the 30-year fixed mortgage rate averaged 6.65% in March 2025 and rose to 6.83% in April 2025.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Approximately 6-7 weeks. The May 2025 data from FRED is typically released in late June 2025.",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No. The February 2025 figure was 500,000 new single-family homes for sale. If the inventory grows at a moderate pace consistent with recent trends, it would likely reach 520,000-540,000 by May, falling short of the 550,000 threshold.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Inventory growth moderates or plateaus as spring/summer buying season increases absorption rates. Builders may also slow new construction starts given already elevated inventory levels. Rising mortgage rates that were 6.83% in April could stabilize or decline slightly, spurring enough demand to prevent inventory from reaching 550,000. Seasonal factors work against continued inventory buildup.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "The strong upward trend in inventory continues unabated. Mortgage rates remain elevated or increase further, keeping demand suppressed while builders continue adding supply to the market. The inventory grows by approximately 17,000 units per month from February through May, reaching or exceeding the 550,000 threshold. Economic uncertainty or affordability concerns keep buyers on the sidelines.",
    "rationale": "The key data point is that new single-family homes for sale reached 500,000 in February 2025, the highest since November 2007. To exceed 550,000 by May requires a 10% increase (50,000 units) over just 3 months, or roughly 3.3% monthly growth. This is a substantial acceleration. While the broader trend over recent years has been strongly upward (tripling from 142,000 over 13 years), we're now at historically elevated levels where growth may naturally moderate. The research assistant's report shows mortgage rates rising from 6.65% in March to 6.83% in April, which could continue dampening demand and allowing inventory to build. However, May falls in the peak spring/summer buying season when absorption typically increases, working against continued inventory buildup. The recent sales rate of 724,000 annually suggests decent demand exists despite high rates. Given we're already at multi-decade highs and need significant additional growth in a short timeframe during peak season, I believe the probability is below 50%. However, the strong recent upward momentum and elevated mortgage rates make this scenario plausible. My forecast would be higher if we had more recent data showing March/April inventory levels, or if mortgage rates were increasing more dramatically. It would be lower if there were signs of inventory stabilization or if we were earlier in the year when seasonal factors favor inventory accumulation.",

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower.
