  "information": "The relationship between Elon Musk and Donald Trump has recently shown signs of strain. After investing heavily in Trump's 2024 campaign, Musk was appointed co-director of the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE). However, disagreements arose over Musk's proposals for drastic government spending cuts and his support for policies like H-1B visas, which conflicted with Trump's agenda. In May 2025, Musk announced he would reduce his political involvement and spending to focus on his businesses, leading to a mutually agreed-upon withdrawal from his role in DOGE. Correspondingly, analyses show that Trump has not mentioned Musk on his Truth Social account in over a month, a significant decrease from his previous frequency.\n\nThe Trump administration's current immigration policy focus is on a new 'Gold Card' visa plan designed to attract foreign investors with at least $5 million in funds. The plan, which is not yet passed by Congress, would grant permanent residence and work rights. Elon Musk confirmed on the social media platform X that the government is conducting a 'silent test' of the application website. The proposal has sparked debate on whether it will replace or supplement the existing EB-5 investment visa program. Separately, the administration opened the registration period for the H-1B visa program, which both Trump and Musk have supported, for the 2026 fiscal year in March 2025.\n\nRecent activity shows a shift in the priorities and communication styles of both Elon Musk and Donald Trump. An analysis of Musk's posts on X revealed that his content has shifted away from U.S. government and politics, with only 19% of his posts in May being on these topics compared to 51% in February. He is now posting more about his business ventures, including space travel, electric vehicles, and AI. Meanwhile, Donald Trump primarily uses Truth Social for his communications, with reports noting that posts from his account on X are rare.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "About 1 month. The resolution will be checked on or after July 1, 2025.",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No. The deadline of April 1, 2025, has passed, and available information indicates neither individual tweeted the specific phrase before this date.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Prior to the April 1, 2025 deadline, both Donald Trump and Elon Musk focused on other issues. Trump, who rarely posts on X, concentrated his policy communications on his 'Gold Card' visa plan via Truth Social. Musk actively reduced his political content on X to focus on his companies. The topic of the 'diversity visa' did not become a salient issue for either of them, so the period lapsed without the phrase being used.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "In early 2025, a major political debate or news story specifically about the Diversity Visa program occurred, compelling a comment. Either Trump made a rare post on X to attack the program using the exact phrase, or Musk used the phrase in a reply to another user while arguing for merit-based immigration, triggering a 'Yes' resolution.",
    "rationale": "My forecast is a high-confidence 'No'. The key factor is that the event's deadline, April 1, 2025, has already passed according to the current date of May 22, 2025. The research assistant's report strongly suggests the conditions for a 'Yes' outcome were not met. \n\nSeveral pieces of evidence support this conclusion: \n1. Platform Usage: Donald Trump primarily uses Truth Social, making any post on X highly improbable. \n2. Shifting Focus: Elon Musk's content on X has pivoted significantly away from U.S. politics (from 51% of posts in February to 19% in May) towards his business ventures. \n3. Policy Priorities: The administration's and Musk's documented focus was on other immigration tracks, such as the new 'Gold Card' investor visa and the H-1B program, not the Diversity Visa.\n4. Specificity: The question requires the exact phrase 'diversity visa', making an accidental trigger unlikely.\n\nThe probability is not zero because both individuals are famously unpredictable on social media, and a significant, unreported news event before the deadline could have prompted a reactive post that the intelligence summary missed. The probability is not higher because the combined evidence of platform preference, stated priorities, and content analysis for the relevant period makes a 'Yes' outcome exceptionally unlikely. I would only update this forecast higher if I received new information showing a major public debate on this specific visa program occurred before April 1, 2025.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill Donald Trump or Elon Musk tweet (X post) about the Diversity Visa before April 1, 2025\n\nQuestion background:\n[Federal judge’s order leaves many visa lottery winners out of luck](https://www.siliconvalley.com/2020/10/01/judges-order-leaves-many-visa-lottery-winners-out-of-luck/) | Recent tweet [here](https://x.com/fentasyl/status/1894451029934039492) from a Twitter/X account followed by Elon Musk.\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if, before July 1, 2025 either Donald Trump or Elon Musk tweet using the exact words \"diversity visa\" as shown through [this search](https://x.com/search?f=top&q=%22diversity%20visa%22%20(from%3Arealdonaldtrump%20OR%20from%3Aelonmusk)&src=typed_query) on Twitter/X, which will be checked by Metaculus on or after July 1, 2025. If a tweet (now renamed to X post) containing the phrase is seen by a Metaculus Admin at that time, this question resolves as **Yes**. If not, it resolves as **No**.\n\n\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nThe relationship between Elon Musk and Donald Trump has recently shown signs of strain.

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
