  "information": "China's Consumer Price Index (CPI) has registered three consecutive months of year-on-year deflation: -0.7% in February, -0.1% in March, and -0.1% in April 2025. The Producer Price Index (PPI), a measure of factory-gate prices, has also shown sustained deflationary pressure, declining for 31 consecutive months. In April, the PPI fell by 2.7% year-on-year, the largest decline in six months. Core CPI, which excludes food and energy, has remained positive but low, at around +0.5% year-on-year.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Approximately 8 days. China typically releases CPI data around the 10th of the following month, so May 2025 CPI data should be released around June 10, 2025.",
    "status_quo_outcome": "Yes - continuation of deflationary trend into a 4th consecutive month",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "May CPI registers at 0% or positive year-on-year growth. This could occur if consumer demand strengthens unexpectedly, food prices rise seasonally, government stimulus measures gain traction, or favorable base effects from May 2024 push the index into positive territory despite underlying weakness.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "May CPI remains negative year-on-year, continuing the deflationary trend. This occurs if weak consumer demand persists, factory-gate deflation continues to suppress retail prices, economic recovery remains sluggish, and no significant price increases materialize in food, energy, or other major CPI components.",
    "rationale": "China has experienced three consecutive months of year-on-year deflation, establishing a clear deflationary trend. However, critical nuances suggest we're at an inflection point: (1) The magnitude of deflation has decreased significantly from -0.7% in February to just -0.1% in both March and April, (2) Core CPI remains positive at +0.5%, indicating underlying price pressures aren't severely negative, (3) At -0.1%, we're barely in deflationary territory and could easily flip to 0% or slightly positive. The persistent PPI deflation (-2.7% in April, 31 consecutive months) creates continued downward pressure on consumer prices. However, when deflation is this marginal (-0.1%), small changes in methodology, seasonal adjustments, or component weights can shift the outcome. The status quo strongly suggests continuation since deflation has persisted for three months and China's demand recovery remains weak. However, the decreasing magnitude and positive core CPI indicate the deflationary force is weakening. My forecast is not higher because: the established trend, weak consumer demand, and persistent PPI deflation all support continued deflation. My forecast is not lower because: at -0.1% we're at the margin, core CPI is positive, and the trend is improving (less negative). I would revise upward if I learned of strong retail sales data for May, significant food price increases, or aggressive stimulus announcements. I would revise downward if May showed further economic weakness or continued PPI deterioration.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill China experience a 4th month in a row of deflation in its May CPI report?\n\nQuestion background:\nSCMP: [China’s consumer prices fall in April, fuelling fears of deflation](https://www.scmp.com/economy/economic-indicators/article/3309834/chinas-consumer-prices-fall-april-fuelling-fears-deflation)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if the \"Percent Change from Year Ago, Not Seasonally Adjusted\" data presented at [FRED Consumer Price Indices (CPIs, HICPs), COICOP 1999: Consumer Price Index: Total for China (CHNCPIALLMINMEI)](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/CHNCPIALLMINMEI#) is negative for May 2025.\n\n\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nChina's Consumer Price Index (CPI) has registered three consecutive months of year-on-year deflation: -0.7% in February, -0.1% in March, and -0.1% in April 2025. The Producer Price Index (PPI), a measure of factory-gate prices, has also shown sustained deflationary pressure, declining for 31 consecutive months. In April, the PPI fell by 2.7% year-on-year, the largest decline in six months.

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
