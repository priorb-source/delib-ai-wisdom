    "review": "All three forecasters are in strong agreement on the core facts and reasoning. We all identify the same key drivers for a 'No' outcome: the extremely short timeline of one month, the complete lack of any preparatory campaign activity by Ralph Norman, his reported interest in the 2026 governor's race, his office's explicit denials of a Senate run, and the strength of the incumbent, Lindsey Graham, who has already secured key endorsements. There is no substantive disagreement on the evidence. The only difference is in the final probability, with Forecaster 2 at 2% and myself and Forecaster 3 at 5%. I found Forecaster 2's argument that the situation is an 'extreme long shot' to be particularly convincing, especially when emphasizing the near-insurmountable logistical hurdles of launching a major campaign in under 30 days. This perspective caused me to re-evaluate whether my initial 5% gave slightly too much weight to the possibility of a political surprise.",
    "rationale": "After reviewing the other forecasts, I am lowering my probability from 5% to 3%. My initial reasoning remains sound, but the deliberation has helped me refine the specific probability. The consensus is clear that Norman is highly unlikely to declare. Forecaster 2's analysis persuaded me that the operational and logistical barriers to launching a credible Senate primary challenge in less than 30 days are so significant that even a major political shock (e.g., a scandal involving Graham) would likely not be enough to precipitate an announcement before the deadline. My initial 5% forecast, while low, perhaps did not fully account for these practical constraints. Lowering the forecast to 3% better reflects the combined unlikelihood of both the political will materializing and the logistical capacity being created in such a compressed timeframe. I am not lowering it to 2% because I still believe a hasty, surprise announcement, even without a full campaign structure in place, remains a remote but non-trivial possibility in today's political environment.",
