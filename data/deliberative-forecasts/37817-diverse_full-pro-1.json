    "review": "My initial forecast of 5% was anchored on a stable base of four destinations, making the required two additional routes highly improbable in the short timeframe. Forecaster 2 (28%) arrived at a much higher probability by placing significant weight on possibilities, such as an unannounced Hong Kong service being active or charters qualifying, which I find overly optimistic given the lack of concrete evidence and the short deadline. Forecaster 3's analysis (15%) was the most convincing and impactful. They introduced a crucial piece of information I had missed: the potential for a route to Yap (YAP), operated by United. This, combined with the Manila (MNL) route, creates a plausible scenario where the starting number of destinations is already five (Guam, Taipei, Brisbane, Manila, Yap). Forecaster 3 also rightly tempered this by questioning the post-pandemic consistency of the Manila and Yap routes, creating uncertainty around the baseline. Their reasoning provides a more nuanced view: the path to a 'Yes' outcome is narrow but more plausible than I first thought if the baseline is five, as only one new route would be needed. Conversely, the baseline could also be lower than I initially assumed, making a 'Yes' even less likely. F3's forecast skillfully balances these competing possibilities.",
    "rationale": "I am updating my forecast upwards from 5% to 15%. The primary reason for this change is the new information and perspective provided by Forecaster 3 regarding the potential for the current number of destinations to be five. My initial analysis was based on a solid count of four routes, requiring two additions—an extremely high bar. However, the potential existence of scheduled services to both Manila (MNL) and Yap (YAP), in addition to the confirmed routes to Guam (GUM), Taipei (TPE), and Brisbane (BNE), creates a scenario where the baseline is five. In this case, only one additional scheduled service would be needed to meet the resolution criteria of 'greater than 5'. While adding even one new international route in the next ~40 days is unlikely, it is substantially more probable than adding two. The prospect of Hong Kong Airlines or a South Korean carrier launching a service becomes a pivotal factor rather than one of two necessary miracles. My updated forecast of 15% reflects this newly identified, albeit narrow, path to a 'Yes' resolution. It remains low because it is contingent on the Manila and Yap services both being active and listed, which is uncertain, and on a new service commencing imminently, which is also a low-probability event.",
