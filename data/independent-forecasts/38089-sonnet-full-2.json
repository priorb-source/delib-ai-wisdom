  "information": "According to a visual analysis of a Morning Consult snapshot from May 8, 2025, Pedro Sánchez's approval rating was 35%, while Recep Tayyip Erdoğan's was 32%. A separate survey from January 21-27, 2025 by the same source, reported by El Economista, listed both leaders as having high disapproval rates. Regarding economic indicators, reports noted that Turkey's consumer confidence gained 5% in April, contrasted with a slump in Europe, and that Spain was experiencing an economic recovery.\n\nSpanish Prime Minister Pedro Sánchez has taken a vocal stance on the conflict in Gaza, describing the situation as a 'genocide' and vowing to raise Spain's voice to end the 'massacre.' In May 2024, his government officially recognized the State of Palestine, and Spain is expected to impose sanctions on Israel. Sánchez is also pushing for stronger EU action, including a review of the EU-Israel Association Agreement. Domestically, his activities include efforts for Catalan language recognition and social policies such as early retirement reforms.\n\nTurkish President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan has initiated work on a new constitution, appointing a team of legal experts to draft it. Erdoğan stated the current constitution is outdated, while critics raised concerns the move could be intended to extend his presidency beyond 2028, a claim he has denied. Erdoğan also ruled out early elections. In foreign affairs, he publicly criticized Pedro Sánchez for showing support for the detained Istanbul Mayor, Ekrem İmamoğlu. The two leaders met in Istanbul in May 2025 to discuss bilateral relations, including trade, security, and the situation in Gaza.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Approximately 33 days (from May 29, 2025 to July 1, 2025)",
    "status_quo_outcome": "YES - Based on the most recent data from May 8, 2025, Pedro Sánchez had a 35% approval rating while Erdoğan had 32%, giving Sánchez a 3 percentage point lead",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Erdoğan's approval rating increases or Sánchez's decreases in the next month, closing or reversing the current 3-point gap. This could occur through successful framing of Erdoğan's constitutional reform efforts, positive developments in Turkey's economy, or domestic political challenges for Sánchez that erode his support. A tie would also resolve as NO.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Sánchez maintains or extends his current 3-point lead over Erdoğan through July 1st. This would likely involve continuation of current trends, with Spain's economic recovery supporting Sánchez while Erdoğan faces skepticism over constitutional reforms potentially designed to extend his presidency.",
    "rationale": "The most recent data from May 8, 2025 shows Sánchez leading Erdoğan 35% to 32% - a 3 percentage point advantage. With only about one month until resolution, I apply the principle that the world changes slowly and status quo outcomes deserve significant weight. However, several factors create meaningful uncertainty: (1) The 3-point gap is relatively narrow and could easily flip, (2) Both leaders have low approval ratings in the 30s range, indicating neither has strong public support, (3) Both face significant political challenges - Erdoğan's controversial constitutional reform efforts have raised concerns about power consolidation, while Sánchez navigates complex domestic issues around Catalan recognition and maintains a vocal stance on Gaza. The short timeframe (1 month) generally favors maintaining current relative positions, as dramatic shifts in approval ratings typically require major events or extended periods. Turkey's improved consumer confidence contrasts with European economic concerns, but Spain is reportedly experiencing recovery. The narrow gap prevents me from going higher than 65% - approval ratings at these levels can be volatile and a 3-point swing is certainly plausible. I'm not going lower because the status quo clearly favors YES, there's no evidence of an imminent crisis for Sánchez or breakthrough for Erdoğan, and one month is a relatively short period for reversals. To update higher, I'd need polling showing Sánchez extending his lead or evidence Erdoğan's approval is declining. To update lower, I'd need evidence the gap is closing or new polling showing Erdoğan ahead.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill Spanish Prime Minister Pedro Sánchez have a higher approval rating than Turkey's President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan on July 1, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nResolution source updates monthly. According to Morning Consult for January 2025: \"The latest approval ratings are based on data collected from Jan. 21-27, 2025. Ratings reflect a trailing seven-day simple moving average of views among adults in each country surveyed.\"\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if Pedro Sánchez has a higher approval rating than Recep Tayyip Erdoğan according to [Morning Consult](https://pro.morningconsult.com/trackers/global-leader-approval) when checked by Metaculus on or after July 1, 2025.
