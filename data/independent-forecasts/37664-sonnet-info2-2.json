  "information": "According to reports from Cursor-IDE (May 15) and ZDNet (May 16), a next-generation Anthropic model codenamed 'Claude Neptune' completed its red-team testing phase on May 18. The same reports indicate a target for general availability in late May or early June. In the past, Anthropic has used internal codenames that later became part of public branding, such as the codename 'Asimov' for the models released as the Claude 3 family.",

    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "46 days until July 1, 2025",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No - Claude 4 is not currently available to the general public and would not be available by the deadline if nothing changed",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Anthropic releases Claude Neptune but calls it 'Claude 3.5 Opus' or another name without '4' in it, or the release is delayed beyond July 1, or the initial release requires a waitlist that extends past the deadline",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Anthropic releases Claude Neptune as 'Claude 4' in late May or early June with immediate general availability (no waitlist), allowing anyone to access it via API or website before July 1",
    "rationale": "The research assistant reports strong near-term signals: Claude Neptune completed red-team testing on May 18 (just 2 days from now) with reports indicating late May/early June general availability. This timeline fits comfortably within the 46-day window until July 1. Red-team completion is typically a late-stage milestone suggesting imminent release. However, three significant uncertainties temper my confidence: (1) Naming convention - the codename 'Neptune' doesn't obviously map to 'Claude 4'. While Anthropic used 'Asimov' for Claude 3, they could call this 'Claude 3.5' or use海王星-themed branding instead. The question specifically requires 'Claude' and '4' in the name. (2) General availability requirement - the question excludes waitlists or early access phases. Anthropic has sometimes done phased rollouts, and ensuring truly general availability without any gating within the timeframe adds risk. (3) Corporate launch delays - even with strong signals, product launches frequently slip from initial targets. Late May/early June targets reported in mid-May are aspirational. The status quo strongly favors 'No' since Claude 4 doesn't currently exist. For me to move significantly higher (70-80%), I'd need confirmation of the 'Claude 4' naming or clearer evidence of Anthropic's versioning strategy. To move lower (20-30%), I'd need evidence of delays in the launch timeline or signals that this will be positioned as a Claude 3.x release. The timing evidence is strong, but naming uncertainty and general availability requirements create substantial doubt.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill Claude 4 be available to the general public before July 1, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nPromptLayer: [Everything we know: Claude 4](https://blog.promptlayer.com/claude-4/)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if a member of the general public can access Anthropic's Claude 4 model without first joining a waitlist or participating in an early access or testing phase. If Anthropic does not release Claude 4 before July 1, 2025, this question resolves as **No**.\n\nThe resolution will rely on [credible sources](https://www.metaculus.com/help/faq/#definitions), including that it may rely on the ability of Metaculus employees to access Claude 4. \"Access\" may be via API, the Anthropic website, or any other method that allows interaction with Claude 4. Models that do not include both \"Claude\" and \"4\" in the name will not be considered for resolution of this question.\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nAccording to reports from Cursor-IDE (May 15) and ZDNet (May 16), a next-generation Anthropic model codenamed 'Claude Neptune' completed its red-team testing phase on May 18.

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
