    "review": "Forecaster 2’s argument is well-anchored: starting near ~605 and needing a ≥22-rig decline over ~5–6 prints implies an unusually fast drop absent a commodity shock. Their emphasis on supportive oil prices and structural-but-gradual downward pressures matches historical behavior; 25% feels reasonable. Forecaster 3 overweights short-term momentum and doesn’t anchor firmly to the likely starting level. A three-week slide is common noise in Baker Hughes data and, without quantifying the magnitude or the current total, a 60% Yes probability implies either we’re already near/below 590 or an imminent shock—neither established here. The internal logic (“if significantly above 583, five weeks may not be enough”) conflicts with a 60% Yes call. I find Forecaster 2 more convincing.",
    "rationale": "My base case remains that late-April U.S. total rigs are about 605–615. To finish below 583 by May 30 requires a decline of roughly 22–32 rigs in 5–6 reports, i.e., a sustained average of ~4–6 rigs down per week. That is possible but not the norm without a clear catalyst. Oil-directed activity is supported by relatively firm WTI, while gas-directed rigs are already depressed, limiting incremental downside. Structural drags (M&A, capital discipline) create a slow grind, not a cliff on this short horizon.\n\nI’m nudging my probability slightly lower (from 24% to 22%) after considering Forecaster 2’s framing of the required weekly pace and the short time left. I would raise the probability if: (a) the next print(s) show the total ≤595, (b) WTI drops decisively below ~$75, and/or (c) we see consecutive ≥5–7 rig weekly declines. I would lower it if prints hold ≥605 or if oil strengthens further.",
