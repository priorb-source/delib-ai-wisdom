  "information": "Beyond Meat's financial results for the first quarter of 2025 showed a 9.1% year-over-year decline in net revenues to $68.7 million. The company reported a net loss of $52.9 million and a gross loss of $1.1 million, resulting in a gross margin of -1.5%. While the company's international business revenue grew, its U.S. retail channel revenue fell by 15.4%. Citing weak consumer demand and macroeconomic volatility, Beyond Meat withdrew its annual sales forecast for 2025 and issued a revised outlook for the second quarter with expected net revenues between $80 million and $85 million.\n\nAs of March 2025, Beyond Meat had $116 million in cash on hand. The company's liabilities included $1.15 billion in convertible bonds maturing in 2027, which were reported to be trading at 17 cents on the dollar. On May 7, 2025, the company announced it had secured a new $100 million senior secured financing facility. The loan has an initial term of 4.75 years with an interest rate of 12% until February 2030, payable in kind, meaning interest is added to the loan's principal instead of being paid in cash during this period.\n\nIn response to its financial performance, Beyond Meat has implemented several operational changes, including a 17% workforce reduction for non-production staff and a suspension of its operations in China. Management stated its strategic priorities include restoring product distribution within the U.S. market and improving consumer perception through new marketing campaigns. The stated long-term goal for the company is to achieve EBITDA-positive operations by the end of 2026.",

    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "54 days, from May 8, 2025 to July 1, 2025",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No - Beyond Meat has not filed for bankruptcy and continues operations",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Beyond Meat utilizes its $116 million cash reserve plus the newly secured $100 million financing facility to meet operational needs and debt obligations through July 1, 2025. The company continues implementing cost-cutting measures including the workforce reduction and China operation suspension, maintaining sufficient liquidity to avoid bankruptcy filing in this short timeframe.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Beyond Meat experiences an unexpected liquidity crisis in the next 54 days, such as major customer contract terminations, vendor payment demands they cannot meet, or acceleration clauses triggered in existing debt agreements. Unable to access sufficient capital or meet immediate obligations, management files for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection before July 1.",
    "rationale": "The critical factor here is the extremely short timeframe - only 54 days until resolution. Beyond Meat just announced securing a $100 million senior secured financing facility yesterday (May 7, 2025), which provides significant near-term liquidity when combined with their $116 million cash on hand. This fresh capital injection totaling $216 million is a strong signal that sophisticated lenders assessed the company's immediate situation and determined it viable enough to extend credit. The loan structure with payment-in-kind interest until February 2030 means no immediate cash interest burden. While Beyond Meat's overall financial health is clearly distressed - evidenced by negative gross margins, declining revenues, withdrawn guidance, and convertible bonds trading at 17 cents on the dollar - these chronic issues don't necessarily translate to imminent bankruptcy in the next two months. The Q1 net loss of $52.9 million suggests a quarterly cash burn rate, but even at that pace, their combined liquidity provides several months of runway. Companies typically exhaust all alternatives before filing bankruptcy, and the successful securing of $100 million just yesterday indicates they still have options. My forecast is not higher because: the new financing provides a substantial buffer, the timeframe is very short, and status quo bias strongly favors continuation of current operations over dramatic action in 54 days. My forecast is not lower because: the underlying financial distress is severe, unexpected shocks can occur (major customer losses, vendor actions, creditor enforcement), and the desperate nature of the financing terms (12% rate, secured) indicates genuine distress. I would update higher if we see reports of vendor payment issues, customer contract terminations, or failed conditions on the new facility. I would update lower with successful facility drawdowns, stabilizing revenue trends, or additional capital secured.",
