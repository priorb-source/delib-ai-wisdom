    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Approximately 46 days from May 16, 2025 to July 1, 2025",
    "status_quo_outcome": "Fewer than 120 objectives marked as Done, as major policy implementation typically requires more than 5 months to substantially complete",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "The Trump administration, despite being in office for about 5 months by July 1, has only completed 80-100 objectives. Many objectives require legislative action, face legal challenges, or need extensive regulatory processes. The tracker maintainers use strict criteria for 'Done' status, requiring full implementation rather than just initiation of actions.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "The administration prioritizes rapid executive action in its first months, with many objectives being simple executive orders, appointments, or reversals of prior policies that can be completed quickly. The tracker counts 120+ objectives as Done by July 1, including quick wins like withdrawing from international agreements, issuing executive orders, making key appointments, and implementing immediate policy changes that don't require legislation.",
    "rationale": "Without current data on how many objectives are already marked as Done, I must rely on base rates for policy implementation. By July 1, 2025, the Trump administration will have been in office approximately 5 months. While some objectives (executive orders, appointments, withdrawals from agreements) can be completed quickly, achieving 120 'Done' objectives in this timeframe represents aggressive implementation. Key considerations: (1) Unknown current completion rate - if already at 80-100, reaching 120 is plausible; if at 20-30, it's much less likely. (2) Definition of 'Done' matters greatly - if it means 'substantially completed' vs 'fully implemented,' the bar is different. (3) The tracker is maintained by Keep_Track, which tends toward thorough documentation, suggesting they may use rigorous criteria. (4) Historical precedent shows new administrations can act quickly on executive priorities but face constraints on substantive policy changes. I'm not forecasting higher because 5 months is relatively short for completing 120 policy objectives even with aggressive action, and 'Done' likely requires meaningful implementation. I'm not forecasting lower because some objectives may be simple executive actions, and we don't know the current baseline or total number of objectives.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill the Project 2025 Tracker classify at least 120 objectives as \"Done\" on July 1, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nThe 2025 Tracker is a project of the Keep_Track subreddit and is explained [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/Keep_Track/comments/1ii7tbr/project_2025_tracker_is_now_live/).\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if the [Project 2025 Tracker](https://www.project2025.observer/) has ≥120 Objectives classified as Done when accessed by Metaculus on or after July 1, 2025. If it is less than 120, this resolves as **No**.\n\n\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nNo additional information available.\n\nToday is 2025-05-16.\n\nBefore answering you think:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n(e) You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
