    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Two months.",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No. The Labour party, as the current government, maintains a significant lead in the Politico polling average. While Reform UK's polling has increased, it remains in third or a distant second place, far from being the leading party, let alone by a 4-point margin.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "The Labour government's polling lead erodes slightly but remains substantial through June 2025. The Conservatives and Reform UK continue to compete for the right-of-centre vote, splitting the opposition and preventing either from challenging Labour for the top spot in the polls.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "A major political or economic crisis in May-June 2025 causes a catastrophic collapse in the Labour government's popularity. Simultaneously, the Conservative party implodes, with its voters switching en masse to Reform UK. Nigel Farage effectively capitalizes on the situation, and polls rapidly swing to show Reform UK surpassing Labour with a lead of 4 points or more.",
    "rationale": "My forecast is based on the high degree of political inertia and the unlikelihood of such a dramatic and rapid shift in public opinion. The status quo, with a new Labour government holding a polling lead, is the most probable state of affairs. For a 'Yes' outcome, Reform UK would not only have to close what is likely a double-digit gap with Labour but also establish a 4-point lead within a very short two-month window. This would be unprecedented in modern British politics. The Politico Poll of Polls, being an average, is slow to move and resistant to outlier results, meaning a sustained, cross-pollster trend would be required. While the rise of Reform UK indicates political volatility, the scale of the required swing is enormous. A 'Yes' scenario would necessitate a 'black swan' event, such as a major government-ending scandal or a sudden economic crash, for which there is currently no evidence. My forecast is not lower than 5% because the collapse of the Conservative vote has created a political vacuum on the right, and Nigel Farage is a uniquely effective populist campaigner who could capitalize on an unforeseen crisis. My forecast is not higher because it would be irrational to predict such a historic polling event without clear drivers. I would increase my forecast if a major scandal broke and polling averages began to show a rapid narrowing of the gap between Labour and Reform to under 10 points. I would decrease it if the political situation remains stable through May.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nBefore July 1, 2025, will Reform UK be the highest polling party in the UK by at least 4 points, according to Politico?\n\nQuestion background:\nThe Hill: [Nigel Farage’s Reform UK is upending British politics](https://thehill.com/opinion/international/5163853-how-nigel-farages-reform-uk-is-upending-british-politics/) | Wikipedia: [Reform UK](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reform_UK)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if Reform UK reaches #1 in the polling averages, exceeding the 2nd place by 4 or more percentage points [according to Politico](https://www.politico.eu/europe-poll-of-polls/united-kingdom/), after April 30, 2025 and before July 1, 2025.\n\n\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nNo additional information available.\n\nToday is 2025-05-01.\n\nBefore answering you think:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n(e) You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
