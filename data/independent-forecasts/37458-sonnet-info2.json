  "information": "The US and China are engaged in an ongoing trade war. The Trump administration has imposed tariffs of up to 145% on most Chinese imports, and China has retaliated with tariffs of up to 125% on US goods. On May 6, 2025, Trump stated that Chinese officials want to negotiate, but on the same day, US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent told Congress that no official negotiations have begun between the two countries. High-level trade talks between Treasury Secretary Bessent and Chinese Vice Premier He Lifeng are scheduled to take place in Geneva on May 10-11, 2025.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "The question resolution window opens in 5 days (May 12, 2025) and closes in 38 days (June 14, 2025), providing approximately 33 days for the outcome to occur.",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No - Trump and Xi do not speak on the phone. Currently there are no confirmed phone calls between the two leaders, and China is actively denying Trump's claims about ongoing talks.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "The Geneva talks between Treasury Secretary Bessent and Vice Premier He Lifeng proceed at the technical level without producing sufficient breakthrough to warrant direct leader engagement. Communications continue through diplomatic channels and intermediaries. Trade tensions persist but both sides avoid direct leader-to-leader contact during this period, either due to lack of progress, scheduling conflicts, or strategic decisions to keep negotiations at lower levels.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "The May 10-11 Geneva talks produce meaningful progress or a framework that prompts both leaders to directly engage. The severity of the economic impact from the trade war (145% and 125% tariffs) creates urgency for direct communication. Trump initiates or accepts a phone call with Xi to discuss next steps, and both governments publicly acknowledge the conversation occurred, as the high stakes make transparency valuable for signaling to markets and domestic audiences.",
    "rationale": "The base rate suggests no direct communication, as evidenced by the current dispute where Trump claims talks are happening while China denies them. This fundamental disagreement about the state of negotiations signals poor communication channels and makes mutual acknowledgment of a phone call less likely.\n\nHowever, several factors increase the probability above baseline: (1) The scheduled May 10-11 Geneva talks could serve as a catalyst, creating momentum for leader-level engagement; (2) The extreme severity of the trade war (145% tariffs) creates strong economic incentives for direct communication; (3) The 33-day window provides substantial time for such a call to occur; (4) Trump has historically shown willingness to engage directly with foreign leaders, even adversaries.\n\nThe critical constraint is the requirement that both sides must acknowledge the call. In the current climate of disputed communications, this is a high bar. China's denial of Trump's claims about ongoing talks suggests reluctance to publicly confirm engagement, possibly for domestic political reasons or negotiating leverage.\n\nMy forecast is not higher (50%+) because: there's no current indication of plans for such a call, the status quo is no direct communication, and the mutual acknowledgment requirement is difficult given current tensions. My forecast is not lower (25%-) because: the Geneva talks are imminent, the economic stakes are extraordinary, the time window is adequate, and both sides ultimately have strong incentives to communicate directly to resolve the crisis.\n\nI would update higher if: the Geneva talks produce a joint statement about progress, either side publicly proposes a leader call, or market/economic pressures intensify dramatically. I would update lower if: the Geneva talks fail or are postponed, rhetoric escalates, or either side signals unwillingness to engage at the leader level.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill Donald Trump and Xi Jinping speak on the phone with each other before June 15, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nCBS News: [Trump says he's talked with Xi about tariffs. China has denied talks are taking place](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/trump-xi-china-tariffs/)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if, after May 12, 2025 and before June 15, 2025, Donald Trump and Xi Jinping speak on the phone with each other, according to [credible sources](https://www.metaculus.com/faq/#definitions).\n\nBoth sides must acknowledge the phone call took place for it to count. \"Speak on the phone with each other\" is defined as both individuals, from different physical spaces, orally uttering words intended for the other individual into a telephone or equivalent device, those words being converted into electrical or digital signals in real time, and then transferred to the other individual via telecommunications links, where they are reconverted into sound waves at the other individual's listening device.\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nThe US and China are engaged in an ongoing trade war.

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
