    "review": "The analysis from the other two forecasters strongly aligns with my own initial assessment. We all identified the low historical base rate of 1-2 reports per year from South America as the key driver and recognized the reporting friction caused by NUFORC being a US-based, English-language platform. The primary new consideration came from Forecaster 3, who introduced a Poisson distribution to model the probability of a rare event. This provided a more formal mathematical justification for anchoring the forecast at the low end of the estimated probability range (8-17%). Their calculation for a rate of 1 event per year (λ=1/12) yielded a probability of approximately 8% for one or more events in a given month, which I found to be a convincing and more rigorous approach than my initial, more intuitive estimation.",
    "rationale": "My initial forecast of 10% was based on the historical data of 1-2 relevant reports per year, which translates to a monthly probability between 8.3% and 16.7%. After reviewing the other forecasters' analyses, I am revising my forecast downward. Both other forecasters arrived at 8%, and I found Forecaster 3's reasoning particularly compelling. Their application of a Poisson distribution to model the probability of a rare event provides a strong quantitative justification for anchoring the forecast at the lower end of the possible range. Specifically, assuming a conservative rate of one report per year (a monthly rate λ of 1/12), the probability of one or more occurrences in June is calculated as 1 - e^(-1/12), which is approximately 8.0%. This model better captures the nature of rare, random events than my initial rough-and-ready estimate. The consensus and the stronger quantitative argument have convinced me to adjust my forecast from 10% to 8%, reflecting a more precise interpretation of the low base rate.",
