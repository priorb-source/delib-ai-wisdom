    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Approximately 6 weeks (42 days), until July 1, 2025",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No - if no presidential action mentioning the Diversity Visa is issued by the deadline, the question resolves as No",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "President Trump continues addressing immigration policy through other means but does not issue a formal presidential action that specifically mentions the 'Diversity Visa' program by July 1, 2025. He may focus on border security, asylum reform, or other immigration priorities instead, or address the diversity visa program through different terminology or channels that don't meet the resolution criteria.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "President Trump issues an executive order, presidential memorandum, or proclamation specifically targeting the Diversity Visa Lottery program with restrictive measures such as suspending the program, implementing additional vetting requirements, or advocating for its elimination. The action uses the exact phrase 'Diversity Visa' and is published on the White House presidential actions website before July 1, 2025.",
    "rationale": "Trump has historically opposed the Diversity Visa program, and the provided background articles show conservative advocacy for its cancellation. However, several factors moderate the probability: (1) Trump has already been in office for 4 months without issuing such an action, suggesting it may not be among his highest immigration priorities; (2) The research assistant provides no information about pending actions on this topic; (3) The resolution criteria are specific - requiring the exact phrase 'Diversity Visa' in a formal presidential action, not just general immigration policy or social media statements; (4) While 6 weeks provides reasonable time for such action, the status quo bias suggests that things that haven't happened yet often don't happen. Trump may be prioritizing border security, deportations, or asylum reform over the diversity visa program. The probability is not higher because there's no evidence of imminent action and 4 months have passed without movement. It's not lower because Trump's known opposition to the program and sufficient remaining time create real possibility.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill President Trump issue a new presidential action mentioning the Diversity Visa before July 1, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\n[Federal judge’s order leaves many visa lottery winners out of luck](https://www.siliconvalley.com/2020/10/01/judges-order-leaves-many-visa-lottery-winners-out-of-luck/) | The American Conservative: [Trump Should Cancel the Diversity Visa Program](https://www.theamericanconservative.com/trump-should-cancel-the-diversity-visa-program/) | Mint: [US Green Card Diversity Visa 2026 Lottery results released: What you need to know](https://www.livemint.com/news/us-news/us-green-card-diversity-visa-2026-lottery-results-released-what-you-need-to-know-11746381683106.html)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if, before July 1, 2025, President Donald J. Trump issues a [presidential action](https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/) mentioning the \"Diversity Visa\" (using exactly those words). If this does not occur before that date, this resolves as **No**.\n\nTo count, the presidential action must be published and publicly accessible (appearing on the presidential actions section of the White House website) before the specified time. A verbal statement or other written announcement besides a presidential action (for example a post on social media), is not sufficient.\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nNo additional information available.\n\nToday is 2025-05-20.\n\nBefore answering you think:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n(e) You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
