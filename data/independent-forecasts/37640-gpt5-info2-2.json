  "information": "The Energy Star program was launched in 1992 as a voluntary public-private partnership to certify energy-efficient products. Over its 33-year history, government figures and expert analyses estimate the program has saved consumers over $500 billion in energy costs and prevented 4 billion metric tons of greenhouse gas emissions. The program's annual cost is approximately $32 million, while it is credited with saving the average household around $450 per year.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "About 48 days (until July 1, 2025).",
    "status_quo_outcome": "Yes — the site remains online and reachable, possibly with updated or placeholder content.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "EPA quickly decommissions the energystar.gov domain or disables hosting before July 1, leading to DNS failure or persistent server errors when checked by Is It Down Right Now.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Even if the program is curtailed, EPA leaves energystar.gov up (perhaps with a notice, archival content, or a redirect) and the domain responds normally when checked on or after July 1.",
    "rationale": "- Baseline/status quo: As of May 7, the resolution source reports the site is up. Government websites typically persist even amid program changes; content may be removed or replaced while the domain stays live. Decommissioning a .gov site usually involves notice, records management, and coordination with CISA/GSA, which rarely completes within a few weeks. The check is “on or after July 1,” which slightly reduces the risk that a brief outage at a single moment causes a No. \n- Political/organizational context: The reported plan to eliminate Energy Star signals policy change, but removing a 33-year-old, highly visible program’s web presence by July 1 is a heavier lift than announcing elimination. The program’s broad market use and the assistant’s noted cost savings ($32M annual cost; large consumer savings) increase the chance of delay, archiving, or a soft-landing page rather than a hard takedown. DOE co-stewardship for some product categories also points toward continuity of at least some web presence. \n- Measurement detail: IsItDownRightNow typically counts a domain as “up” if it responds (even with a redirect or placeholder). A 301/302 to epa.gov would still almost certainly register as reachable. A true No requires DNS removal, network blocking, or persistent server failure at the time of Metaculus’s check. \n- Why not higher: The administration may move fast to make a symbolic point by pulling the domain, or consolidate under epa.gov and misconfigure the root temporarily. There is non-zero risk of a hosting or DNS change causing downtime precisely when checked. \n- Why not lower: Historical precedent (e.g., 2017 EPA climate content removals) favored content alteration over domain disappearance; bureaucratic and records requirements slow full removals. The short runway (≈7 weeks) makes a clean decommission less likely. \n- Updaters: I would raise the forecast if (1) EPA/DOE publicly commits to maintaining an archive or redirect for Energy Star; (2) the site remains stably up in late June; or (3) reporting indicates the “elimination” is phased over months. I would lower it if (1) credible reporting or Federal Register/agency notices indicate an imminent shutdown of energystar.gov before July; (2) DNS records begin changing to null targets; or (3) repeated outages appear in third-party uptime monitors in June.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill the EPA's EnergyStar.gov still be online on July 1, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nAccording to the [New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/06/climate/epa-energy-star-eliminated.html), \"'The Energy Star program and all the other climate work, outside of what’s required by statute, is being de-prioritized and eliminated,' Paul Gunning, the director of the E.P.A. Office of Atmospheric Protection, told employees during the meeting, according to the recording obtained by The New York Times. Mr. Gunning’s office itself is also slated for elimination.\n\nFor the past 33 years, Energy Star has been known for its recognizable blue label, which shows that an appliance has met energy efficiency standards set by the federal government.\"\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if EnergyStar.gov is online according to [Is It Down Right Now?](https://www.isitdownrightnow.com/energystar.gov.html) when accessed by Metaculus on or after July 1, 2025.\n\nAs of May 7, 2025, the resolution source returns the message, \"Energystar.gov is UP and reachable by us.\"\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nThe Energy Star program was launched in 1992 as a voluntary public-private partnership to certify energy-efficient products. Over its 33-year history, government figures and expert analyses estimate the program has saved consumers over $500 billion in energy costs and prevented 4 billion metric tons of greenhouse gas emissions. The program's annual cost is approximately $32 million, while it is credited with saving the average household around $450 per year.\n\nToday is 2025-05-14.\n\nBefore answering you think:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n(e) You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
