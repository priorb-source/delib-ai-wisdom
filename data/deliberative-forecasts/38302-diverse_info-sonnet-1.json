    "review": "Forecaster 2 provides excellent granular detail on CPI components, particularly the regulated nature of China's domestic energy prices and high pork inventories. The point about energy price caps and lags limiting pass-through from global oil markets is well-taken and something I underweighted. Their 63% forecast aligns closely with mine. Forecaster 3's 80% confidence seems excessive given we're at just -0.1% deflation. While their points about manufacturing PMI (49.5) showing contraction and the 8.6% drop in new-home sales are valid indicators of weak demand, these conditions existed in March and April too, which still only produced -0.1% readings. At such marginal deflation with positive core CPI (+0.5%), claiming 80% confidence overlooks how easily small compositional or base effects could flip the outcome. The 'strong momentum' argument doesn't fully account for the fact that the magnitude has stabilized at barely-negative levels rather than accelerating downward.",
    "rationale": "After reviewing both forecasts, I'm making a modest upward revision. Forecaster 2's specific details on high pork inventories and regulated energy prices with limited pass-through strengthen the case for continued deflation. The manufacturing PMI at 49.5 and property sales down 8.6% YoY (from Forecaster 3) provide additional evidence of weak demand that I should weight more heavily. However, I resist moving to 80% because the fundamental constraint remains: at -0.1%, we're barely in deflationary territory. Core CPI at +0.5% indicates underlying price pressures aren't deeply negative. The trend from -0.7% to -0.1% shows deflation weakening, not accelerating. Forecaster 2's note that May 2024 had a low base actually makes it slightly harder to print negative in May 2025. The regulated energy price insight is important but doesn't dramatically alter the outlook - it explains why oil price increases won't rescue the headline, but I already expected muted pass-through. The balance of evidence supports continued deflation more than I initially weighted, but the marginal nature of current readings (-0.1%) and positive core prevent high confidence.",
