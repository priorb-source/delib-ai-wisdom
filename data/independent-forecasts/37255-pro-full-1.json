  "information": "Libya's Economy and Trade Minister, Muhammed Huveyc, announced in May 2025 that the country aims to increase its trade volume with Turkey from $3.7 billion to $10 billion. To facilitate this, joint committees have been established to address issues such as the return of Turkish companies to projects in Libya and the resolution of bank guarantees. The two countries are also working towards eliminating taxes and establishing a free trade zone, with the stated goal of using Libya's strategic location to facilitate the transport of Turkish industrial products to the broader African market.\n\nAs of late April 2025, the African Continental Free Trade Area (AfCFTA) has achieved a 92% consensus on trade rules. Forty-nine of the 54 African countries have joined the agreement, with 23 having commenced implementation of the new trade rules. Supporting infrastructure includes the Pan-African Payment and Settlement System (PAPSS), which now connects over 20 central banks and 160 commercial banks, enabling easier payment for goods in local currencies. Additionally, Afreximbank is organizing specialized training programs to help African businesses understand the AfCFTA's commercial implications and regulatory landscape.\n\nImplementation of the AfCFTA faces several challenges. Six years after its inception, key decisions regarding tariff liberalization and rules of origin remain pending for a number of state parties. Some countries, including South Africa, have not yet submitted full tariff offers for sensitive goods, pending the finalization of rules of origin for key sectors such as automotive and textiles. The deadline for finalizing these rules is October 2025. The overall target for the removal of tariffs on 90% of goods has been moved back to 2034. Some analysts note that production-related challenges, like low industrial output and poor infrastructure, must be addressed before the full benefits of tariff removal can be realized.",

    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "2 months",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Libya's political factions remain deadlocked, preventing the unified legislative action required for treaty ratification. The government's attention and administrative resources remain focused on the bilateral trade deal with Turkey. The July 1, 2025 deadline passes without Libya depositing its instrument of ratification.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "A surprising and rapid political reconciliation occurs between Libya's rival governments, enabling the legislature to convene and fast-track key legislation. Seeing a strategic advantage in being an early mover or seeking an international diplomatic victory, the unified government prioritizes and successfully ratifies the AfCFTA agreement just before the deadline.",
    "rationale": "My forecast is based on four key factors. First, the extremely short two-month timeframe is a significant barrier for any legislative process, let alone for a major international treaty. Second, Libya's protracted political fragmentation and the existence of rival governing bodies create a state of legislative paralysis, making the ratification of any treaty highly improbable. Third, the current stated priority of Libya's Economy and Trade Ministry is the finalization of a bilateral free trade agreement with Turkey, which diverts political and administrative focus away from the pan-African agreement. Fourth, there is little external pressure to ratify immediately, as key components of the AfCFTA itself, such as rules of origin for major sectors, are not scheduled to be finalized until October 2025. The status quo is one of non-ratification, and the barriers to changing this status before the deadline are exceptionally high. My probability is not lower than 5% because there remains a small chance of a sudden political deal or a symbolic executive action to ratify by decree for diplomatic purposes, even if its domestic legitimacy were questionable. My probability is not higher because the confluence of political deadlock, competing priorities, and the short timeline makes ratification a very remote possibility. I would raise my forecast significantly upon seeing credible reports of a power-sharing agreement that explicitly includes reconvening the legislature to pass pending treaties.",

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
