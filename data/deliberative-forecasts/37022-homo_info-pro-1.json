    "review": "My initial analysis was based on a critical and significant error in the data provided by my research assistant, which stated the debt was 1.869 trillion UAH in February 2025. This made the forecast a close call based on month-over-month fluctuations. Forecasters 2 and 3 correctly pointed out this foundational error. Their analyses, based on publicly available data, show Ukraine's government debt was already several times higher than the 1.90 trillion UAH threshold for a long time (e.g., ~5.5 trillion UAH in early 2024). Their reasoning is entirely convincing. They correctly identified that the central issue is not a small monthly change but the enormous, pre-existing gap between the actual debt level and the question's threshold. The arguments about ongoing war financing needs and currency depreciation further cementing a 'Yes' outcome are also valid and crucial context that my initial faulty premise prevented me from properly weighing.",
    "rationale": "I am completely revising my forecast based on the deliberation. The new information from my peers reveals my initial premise was fundamentally flawed. The actual government debt was not hovering just below the 1.90 trillion UAH threshold; it had surpassed it by a factor of three or more by early 2025. Given that the debt was already in the 5.5-7.0 trillion UAH range, for the question to resolve 'No', the debt would have had to decrease by an unprecedented and impossible amount (over 4 trillion UAH) in a single quarter during a war. All economic drivers, including massive budget deficits financed by international aid and domestic bonds as mentioned by Forecaster 2, point towards a continued increase, not a catastrophic drop. The scenario for a 'No' outcome is not just unlikely; it's practically impossible, barring a massive data error or an unannounced multi-trillion UAH debt jubilee. Therefore, I am abandoning my previous reasoning and updating my forecast to align with the overwhelming evidence presented by the other forecasters.",
