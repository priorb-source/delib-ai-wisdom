    "review": "Both forecasters converge on the same structural constraints I used, but Forecaster 2 rightly leans harder on the near-zero feasibility of statutory termination by July 1 and the lack of any imminent legislative vehicle. Forecaster 3’s 18% seems high given the tracker’s current “in progress” status despite prior executive action—this is strong evidence the moderators require actual termination, not just narrowing or announced intent. That point weakens my earlier allowance for a looser editorial interpretation. The legislative calendar (no must-pass vehicle before July 1) and the negotiated rulemaking timeline (first session June 30–July 2; final rules later) further support a very low probability. I find F2’s reasoning most convincing; F3 adds a useful inference about the tracker’s standards that pushes me lower, not higher.",
    "rationale": "I initially allowed a nontrivial chance that the tracker might deem an aggressive administrative “functional end” as completion. The fact that the tracker remains “in progress” after a March 7 EO to limit eligibility, plus the formal negotiated rulemaking schedule that won’t produce final rules before July 1, makes it unlikely the moderators would mark “terminate” as complete absent statutory repeal or a definitive legal action actually ending PSLF. Congressional repeal by July 1 faces severe timing and procedural hurdles; there’s no evident must‑pass vehicle on that timeline, and even unified government would struggle to clear Senate rules that quickly. The only plausible Yes path is a surprise repeal tucked into a fast-track bill with clear leadership backing and votes lined up in both chambers—currently low probability. Accordingly, I’m moving down from 10% to reflect stricter tracker criteria and the compressed timeline.",
