    "review": "All three forecasters independently arrived at 2%, which is striking and increases my confidence. The convergence suggests this is a well-calibrated estimate. Forecaster 2's explicit calculation that 57 days would consume only ~$2 million against $225.6 million in cash (less than 1% of reserves) is particularly compelling. The emphasis on the recency of the NEVI funding (May 2025, just days ago) is a positive development I noted but perhaps underweighted. Forecaster 2's mention of the exceptionally low base rate for public companies filing bankruptcy in any 2-month period is a valuable framing I should have emphasized more. All three of us identified the same key factors: substantial cash, dramatically improved burn rate, no near-term debt, and the very short timeframe. The NYSE non-compliance issue is consistently recognized as a stock price problem, not a liquidity crisis. The arguments are mutually reinforcing rather than contradictory, and no forecaster raised evidence or reasoning that would warrant moving the probability significantly in either direction.",
    "rationale": "Upon review, I remain confident in 2% as the appropriate forecast. The financial data is unambiguous: $225.6 million in cash with only $3 million quarterly burn would sustain operations for years, not months. For the 57-day period in question, approximately $2 million in cash usage against over $225 million in reserves represents less than 1% depletion. The convergence of three independent analyses at 2% reinforces this estimate. The probability is not lower (closer to 0%) because: (1) unexpected corporate crises occasionally occur, (2) the sub-$1 stock price indicates market concern about something, and (3) complete certainty is inappropriate in forecasting. The probability is not higher because: (1) the cash runway is objectively massive relative to the timeframe, (2) burn rate improved dramatically rather than deteriorated, (3) no debt maturities exist until 2028, and (4) the company just secured additional funding in May 2025. For me to update higher, I would need evidence of sudden massive cash outflows, discovery of hidden liabilities, or credible reports of imminent liquidity crisis. For me to update lower, I would need additional capital secured or categorical statements from management about liquidity strength.",
