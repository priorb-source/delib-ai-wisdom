    "review": "All three analyses converge on the core challenge: inventory needs to increase by 47,000 units (9.4%) in just two months, when the Feb-Mar increase was only 3,000. Forecaster 3 makes the strongest mathematical argument, noting this would require unprecedented monthly gains of 20-30k outside bubble periods - roughly 8x the recent pace. Forecaster 2 correctly emphasizes supply-side constraints (starts down 14.2%, permits down 2%, HMI at 42) that will limit future inventory growth. However, an important distinction: the recent decline in starts/permits affects supply 6-18 months out, not immediately. Homes started in late 2024 are completing now and adding to current inventory regardless of March's construction slowdown. Forecaster 3's point about 'firm sales' (724k SAAR) reducing inventory accumulation probability is insightful - if sales remain steady while completions flow in, inventory won't balloon. The key insight I'm updating on is the mathematical improbability: moving from a 3k monthly increase to averaging 23.5k/month represents an extreme acceleration that would require a near-perfect storm of collapsing sales and surging completions. While rising mortgage rates (6.83%) create demand-side risk, sales have remained resilient so far. The scenario requiring Yes needs multiple unlikely events: April inventory already jumping significantly (unknown), sales collapsing in April-May, and completions surging - not just one factor but all three aligning within an 8-week window.",
    "rationale": "After reviewing the other forecasters' arguments, particularly Forecaster 3's statistical framing, I'm persuaded the probability should be lower than my initial 18%. The mathematical reality is stark: we need roughly 8x acceleration in monthly inventory growth compared to the Feb-Mar pace. The only plausible path requires simultaneity of demand collapse and completion surge that we haven't yet observed. Leading indicators point the opposite direction on supply. While I acknowledge tail risks (April data could surprise, revisions possible, demand could crater faster than expected with elevated rates), these don't justify 18%. However, I don't go as low as 7% because: (1) we lack April data which could show acceleration, (2) the upward trend is established even if slow, (3) mortgage rates have continued rising into April which could impact sales more sharply, and (4) completions from last year's construction continue flowing in regardless of recent starts decline. The appropriate probability reflects high unlikelihood while acknowledging non-trivial tail risk scenarios. I'm updating to 12%.",
