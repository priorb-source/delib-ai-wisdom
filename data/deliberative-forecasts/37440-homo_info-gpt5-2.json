    "review": "Forecaster 2 added concrete procedural detail I hadn’t explicitly incorporated: CS/HB 1381’s May 3 withdrawal and the likelihood that the extended May session is budget-focused. That lowers near-term odds. Forecaster 3’s distinction between database-based verification and documentary proof is also important—the former wouldn’t resolve this as Yes, which trims probability. I find F2’s timeline/process constraints persuasive; F3’s 30% feels high given session dynamics and lack of signals for a special session on elections, though their point about multiple qualifying paths (any subset of voters) is fair.",
    "rationale": "Time left: ~8 weeks to July 1. Regular session ended without passage of proof-of-citizenship language; a key bill (CS/HB 1381) was reportedly withdrawn May 3, signaling low leadership priority or unresolved legal risk. The anticipated extended session appears budget-centric, making insertion of election policy atypical. A separate special session is possible but would require clear leadership will, and there are no public signals yet. \n\nPolitics favor some chance (GOP trifecta, governor alignment, national GOP pressure), and the resolution threshold is broad—any subset of voters being required to provide documentary proof would count, including a targeted cure process for flagged registrants. However, legal friction under NVRA/Inter Tribal Council makes documentary-proof approaches riskier; Florida could instead opt for database verification, which would not satisfy this question. \n\nNet: With session constraints, absence of passage, and legal caution, the short-window enactment odds are modest. I trim my prior 18% slightly to reflect the withdrawal info and the likely narrow scope of the extended session.",
