  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "About 46 days (until July 1, 2025)",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No — as of today Claude 4 is not publicly available; if nothing changes by July 1, it resolves No.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Anthropic slips the launch to July or later due to extended safety reviews or product polish; or they roll out only to enterprise/closed pilots or with a waitlist; or they release the new model under a different name (e.g., “Claude Neptune” or “Claude Next”) that does not include “4,” which would not count for resolution.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Anthropic announces and ships “Claude 4” (possibly variants like Claude 4 or 4o) in late May or early June, making it available on the web app and/or API to regular paid users without a waitlist; Metaculus staff can sign up and use it directly.",
    "rationale": "I put significant weight on the status quo (default No), but multiple recent signals push the odds strongly toward a near-term public launch. Historically, Anthropic’s major numbered releases (Claude 1→2→3) were made generally available (web/API) within roughly 48 hours of announcement and did not use a public waitlist. The gap between Claude 2 (Jul 2023) and Claude 3 (Mar 2024) was ~8 months; we are now ~14 months past Claude 3, so timing is favorable for a major release. The research assistant cites reports (Cursor-IDE, ZDNet mid-May) that a next-gen model codenamed “Claude Neptune” finished (or was slated to finish) red-team testing around May 18, with general availability targeted for late May or early June. Anthropic has previously used internal codenames (e.g., “Asimov”) that later mapped to public Claude releases. While some sources earlier in 2025 framed Claude 4 as “later in 2025,” the more recent, specific reports about red-team completion and late-May/June GA are more probative for the next 4–6 weeks. Key risks keeping the probability below certainty: (1) Naming risk — the model must include both “Claude” and “4” in the official name; if Anthropic brands it as “Claude Neptune” or a “Claude 3.x”/“Claude Next” without a “4,” it won’t count. (2) Rollout risk — they could restrict access to enterprise/partners or use a waitlist initially, which fails the criterion. (3) Schedule slippage from safety, reliability, or product-integration hurdles that push GA into July. What would raise my forecast: an official Anthropic teaser/press invite with explicit “Claude 4” branding; documentation or console entries referencing “Claude 4”; developer pricing pages updated with “Claude 4”; reports corroborating no waitlist at launch. What would lower it: credible reporting that the release is delayed to July/August; indications the initial release is enterprise-only or behind a waitlist; or branding guidance that the next model family will not use the “4” moniker. Balancing the strong recent launch signals against naming/rollout/slip risks, I forecast a high but not overwhelming probability of Yes before July 1.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill Claude 4 be available to the general public before July 1, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nPromptLayer: [Everything we know: Claude 4](https://blog.promptlayer.com/claude-4/)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if a member of the general public can access Anthropic's Claude 4 model without first joining a waitlist or participating in an early access or testing phase. If Anthropic does not release Claude 4 before July 1, 2025, this question resolves as **No**.\n\nThe resolution will rely on [credible sources](https://www.metaculus.com/help/faq/#definitions), including that it may rely on the ability of Metaculus employees to access Claude 4. \"Access\" may be via API, the Anthropic website, or any other method that allows interaction with Claude 4. Models that do not include both \"Claude\" and \"4\" in the name will not be considered for resolution of this question.\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nAnthropic's historical release cadence for major versions shows a lengthening gap: approximately 5 months between Claude 1 (March 2023) and Claude 2 (July 2023), and approximately 8 months between Claude 2 and Claude 3 (March 2024).
