  "information": "Recent data for the US Industrial Production Index (INDPRO) shows accelerating year-over-year (YoY) growth through early 2025: -0.2% in January, +0.45% in February, +0.85% in March, and +1.49% in April. The April rebound was largely driven by a 1.2% increase in oil extraction and a 2.2% rise in oil processing. In contrast, civil non-energy processing industries have seen a persistent decline since the beginning of the year, averaging a 0.7% monthly fall between January and April.\n\nForward-looking indicators for May 2025 presented a mixed picture. The flash ISM manufacturing PMI for May was above the 50-point growth threshold, and the S&P Global PMI also rose. However, the Conference Board’s Leading Economic Index (LEI) fell by 1.0%, its largest drop since March 2023, and the core Producer Price Index (PPI) saw its first decline since 2020. Hard data proxies were also varied: aggregate hours worked in manufacturing were flat in April, while May's rail car-loadings and electricity output were tracking close to April's levels. Auto assemblies rebounded following shutdowns in the first quarter.\n\nThe global economic environment shows signs of slowing. The U.S. Energy Department forecasts that global oil consumption growth will be less than 1 million barrels per day in 2025 and 2026, a significant drop from the historical average, partly due to economic slowdowns in Asia. China's manufacturing PMI for May rose to 49.5 but remained in contractionary territory for the second straight month, although sub-indexes for production and new orders improved. In the Eurozone, industrial production grew in early 2025, but the outlook is considered uncertain due to potential U.S. tariffs.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Approximately 2 weeks. The outcome will be determined by data for May 2025, which is expected to be released around June 15, 2025.",
    "status_quo_outcome": "Yes. The year-over-year growth has been positive and accelerating for the three months leading up to May 2025, with the most recent figure for April 2025 at +1.49%. Continuing this trend would result in a 'Yes' outcome.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "The negative signals from leading indicators like the sharp drop in the Conference Board's LEI and the first decline in core PPI since 2020 materialize into a swift contraction. Weakness in non-energy processing industries deepens and is compounded by slowing global demand, causing a significant month-over-month decline in May that is large enough to erase the year-over-year gains from May 2024.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "The strong positive momentum from early 2025 continues. Robust activity in the energy and automotive sectors, as indicated by recent rebounds, drives overall production higher. The positive flash manufacturing PMIs for May accurately predict a modest expansion in output, ensuring the year-over-year growth rate remains firmly above zero.",
    "rationale": "My forecast is based on the strong positive momentum observed in the most recent data, which I weigh heavily. The year-over-year (YoY) growth in US Industrial Production has not only been positive since February 2025 but has also been accelerating, reaching +1.49% in April. This established trend represents a significant tailwind and forms the basis of my forecast.\n\nSupporting this view, forward-looking indicators for May are largely positive. Both the ISM and S&P Global manufacturing PMIs were in expansionary territory, suggesting continued growth in the manufacturing sector, a key component of industrial production. Furthermore, specific sectors like auto assemblies have seen rebounds, and the energy sector demonstrated significant strength in April, providing a solid foundation for growth.\n\nMy probability is not higher due to several notable headwinds and cautionary signals. The Conference Board's Leading Economic Index (LEI) experienced its largest drop since March 2023, and the core Producer Price Index (PPI) saw its first decline since 2020. These are significant leading indicators of potential economic weakness. Additionally, the persistent decline in civil non-energy processing industries and a slowing global economic environment, particularly in Asia, pose a tangible risk to US production. Finally, hard data proxies for May, such as flat aggregate manufacturing hours, suggest stability rather than strong acceleration.\n\nMy probability is not lower because for the outcome to be 'No', the index would need to experience a significant month-over-month decline in May to offset the base from May 2024. The positive PMIs and existing momentum in key sectors make such a sharp, sudden contraction unlikely, even with the concerning signals from the LEI and PPI.\n\nI would increase my forecast if high-frequency data for late May (e.g., weekly electricity production, rail car loadings) showed unexpected strength. Conversely, I would decrease my forecast if there were news of a major supply chain shock or a significant geopolitical event that would immediately impact industrial activity.",
