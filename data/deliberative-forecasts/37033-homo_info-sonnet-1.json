    "review": "Forecaster 2 raises a particularly compelling argument I had underweighted: the European farmers compensation framework ($145M over 4 years) provides a concrete reference point suggesting payments occur every 3-6 months, not monthly. This is strong evidence that with only 38 days remaining and the first payment occurring just 14 days ago, another payment is unlikely. Forecaster 3's note about $6.9M remaining in the 2025 budget is mildly positive but doesn't address timing. Both forecasters appropriately emphasize payment cadence as the critical factor. The European farmers comparison significantly strengthens the case that typical government payment schedules would put the next disbursement in July-October, after the deadline. However, I maintain some probability for the possibility that treasury bond distribution could occur more rapidly than cash payments, or that international pressure could accelerate the timeline beyond normal government cadence.",
    "rationale": "After reviewing the other analyses, I'm convinced that payment cadence is more important than I initially weighted. The European farmers compensation comparison is particularly relevant - spreading $145M over 4 years implies roughly quarterly or less frequent payments. Applying this pattern to the Global Compensation Deed, a second payment 38 days after the first would be highly unusual for government disbursements of this nature. Zimbabwe just demonstrated capability with the April 9 payment, but moving from first payment to second payment in under 6 weeks would be exceptionally fast for a government with Zimbabwe's bureaucratic constraints and economic challenges. The remaining factors remain: $6.9M budgeted for 2025 provides means but not urgency; the structure calling for 99% in treasury bonds could theoretically allow faster action, but we have no evidence bond issuance is imminent; and Zimbabwe's track record suggests caution. The short timeframe and typical payment schedules argue for lower probability than my initial 40%. I'm updating downward to 30%, acknowledging the payment schedule argument while preserving some probability for bond distribution or a surprisingly rapid second disbursement driven by international conditionality.",
