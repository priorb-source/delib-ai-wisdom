    "review": "Forecaster 2 adds a strong claim that most recent months have at least one cube report. If accurate, that materially raises the base rate. However, they don’t provide concrete month-by-month counts, and 92% seems overconfident given classification ambiguity (witnesses might choose Rectangle/Unknown) and potential posting lag by July 1. Forecaster 3 rightly pushes back on overconfidence and emphasizes uncertainty about the monthly distribution, but their reading of “rare” may conflate “six in a month is rare” with “cube reports are rare.” The December 2024 example suggests high variance, not necessarily a low baseline probability. Both agree the threshold is low (only one report needed) and NUFORC volume is steady; both underweight the risk that June postings might be delayed past July 1.",
    "rationale": "My prior was 55%, driven by a low-but-nontrivial base rate for the Cube category, seasonally higher June reporting, and small risks from shape-label ambiguity and posting lag. Forecaster 2’s assertion that most months have ≥1 cube would imply a monthly λ around or above ~0.7 in a Poisson framing (P≥1 ≈ 1−e^{−λ}), which supports a modest upward adjustment. However, without hard counts, I won’t move near their 90%+ level. Forecaster 3’s caution about the term “rare” is sensible, but I think it refers to six-in-a-month being rare rather than any-cube-being-rare, so I don’t lower on that basis. Net: slight update up for seasonality and the plausibility that ≥1 cube occurs in most months, tempered by taxonomy ambiguity and the July 1 posting-lag risk.",
