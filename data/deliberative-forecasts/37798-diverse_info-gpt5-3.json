    "review": "Forecaster 2 leans heavily on status quo and short time horizon, which is reasonable, but their 48% feels too high given the bar is “the” highest out of 30 teams and the Dodgers likely slipped behind after the Angels sweep. Their rotation notes (Snell on 60-day IL, Glasnow recovering, Kershaw returning) seem speculative and possibly inaccurate for the relevant window, so I discount that driver. Forecaster 3 adds helpful context: preseason elite projections and a strong current record (cited 29–17) and emphasizes razor-thin margins among the top teams. I agree with their framing that the Dodgers are likely the single most probable team but still face heavy field competition; however, 40% still seems rich if they’re currently trailing by ~1–2+ games and with several credible rivals (Yankees, Phillies, Tigers, possibly an AL East team) in the mix. Both analyses strengthen the case that my original estimate may be slightly low, but not by as much as their numbers suggest.",
    "rationale": "Time until resolution is short (~27 days), and the Dodgers were tied for best record immediately before getting swept, implying they’re now slightly behind. Being the outright top W% on a specific date is a high bar with multiple near-peers. Given elite underlying strength (top-tier offense, deep roster), a 1–2 game swing is very plausible over ~25 games, and ties for highest likely resolve as Yes. But with 3–5 serious contenders and the Dodgers not clearly ahead right now, the field remains favored. I’m nudging up my forecast to reflect the strong team quality and short window but keeping it well below 40% to respect the difficulty of beating the entire field and the post-sweep standings context.",
