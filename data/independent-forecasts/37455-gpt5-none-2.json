    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "About 54 days (until 2025-07-01)",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No — as of today, Lesotho is not shown as Available on Starlink’s map, and if nothing changes it will stay that way.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Despite a license being granted, Starlink delays flipping Lesotho to Available due to remaining regulatory/administrative steps (e.g., device type approval, tax/VAT setup, local partner arrangements, payment/billing configuration) or internal release batching. The map keeps Lesotho as Coming Soon or Waitlist past July 1.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Starlink finalizes post-license steps and updates its availability map for Lesotho in late May or June, begins accepting orders (Residential/Roam via direct sales or a local partner), and the country appears as Available before July 1.",
    "rationale": "Lesotho reportedly granted Starlink a license on 2025-04-14. In many markets, once licensing is secured, Starlink often flips the map to Available within weeks to a few months. We have roughly seven to eight weeks left, which is within that historical window. Factors supporting a Yes: regulatory approval is the main gating item; satellites already cover the area; Starlink has recently accelerated African rollouts; end of Q2 (June 30) is a natural internal milestone for updating availability. Factors supporting a No: some countries see multi‑month lags after licensing due to type approval, local tax/registration, partner distribution, or internal scheduling; Lesotho is a small market and could be deprioritized; being landlocked may complicate hardware logistics, though the map status doesn’t strictly depend on shipments. The research assistant provided no extra detail beyond the licensing report, so the forecast leans on base rates from prior rollouts: recent cases have ranged from weeks to a few months post-license, but earlier examples showed longer lags. That mix argues for a moderate‑to‑slightly‑above‑even chance by July 1. Not higher than low‑60s because two and a half months can still be short if administrative steps remain or if Starlink batches map updates. Not lower because the key barrier (licensing) appears cleared and Q2 timing aligns with typical rollout cadences. I would update upward on credible signals such as: Starlink adding Lesotho pricing/order pages, regulator announcements of service commencement, or reports of successful activations. I would update downward on signs of conditional/provisional licensing, delays in type approval, or explicit notes on the map indicating availability pushed to H2 2025.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill Starlink's website show Lesotho as a country with Starlink availability before July 1, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\n[Lesotho grants license to Musk's Starlink](https://www.ewn.co.za/2025/04/14/lesotho-grants-license-to-musks-starlink)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if, before July 1, 2025, the [Starlink Availability Map](https://www.starlink.com/us/map) has anywhere in Lesotho listed as \"Available.\"\n\n\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nNo additional information available.\n\nToday is 2025-05-07.\n\nBefore answering you think:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n(e) You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
