    "review": "The other two forecasters and I reached a strong consensus on the core dynamics of this election. We all identify the central tension as the People's National Movement's (PNM) incumbency advantage and plausible path to victory via vote-splitting in Tobago, versus the United National Congress's (UNC) strengthened position through a coalition and potent anti-incumbent campaign themes like crime. We all correctly dismissed the outlier WIC News poll and identified the large bloc of undecided voters as the primary source of uncertainty. I found Forecaster 3's reasoning particularly insightful. They pointed out that the election being triggered by a Prime Minister's resignation and the presence of high-profile endorsements for the opposition are not just facts, but active indicators of anti-incumbent momentum. This perspective was convincing and suggested that I may have slightly underweight these negative signals for the PNM in my initial analysis.",
    "rationale": "After reviewing my peers' analyses, I am slightly decreasing my forecast. My initial reasoning stands: the PNM remains the slight favorite due to the powerful advantages of incumbency and the specific, credible mechanism for victory outlined in the Guardian TT poll concerning the two Tobago seats. However, the deliberation has convinced me to assign more weight to the factors favoring the opposition. As highlighted by Forecaster 3, the context of an early election caused by a leadership resignation suggests potential weakness or instability within the ruling party. This, combined with the unified UNC-COP opposition, the endorsement from a former Attorney General, and the politically damaging issue of high crime, creates a compelling case for opposition momentum. In an environment with strong anti-incumbent sentiment, the 20% of undecided voters are more likely to break for the challenger. Therefore, while I still believe the PNM has a better-than-even chance, the risk of them losing is higher than I first estimated. I am adjusting my forecast down from 58% to 56% to better reflect this enhanced view of the opposition's strength and the incumbent's vulnerabilities.",
