    "review": "All three forecasters converged on remarkably similar reasoning and forecasts (38-45%). We all identified the same key factors: the 94-day window from recall to deadline closely matching the 90-day median for Class III recalls, the 40 days already elapsed without closure, and the competing forces of complicating factors (multi-state distribution, foodservice channels, large volume, extended shelf life) versus favorable factors (Class III classification, no illnesses, proactive recall). Forecaster 3's approach of starting at 50% because we're 'right at the median' and then adjusting down is methodologically interesting, but I think this somewhat underweights the information value of already being 40 days in without closure. If recalls close across a distribution from 30-120+ days with a 90-day median, being at day 40 with no closure signals we're likely not in the fast-resolving subset (those that close in 30-45 days). This should shift probability below 50% more substantially. Forecaster 2's analysis is nearly identical to mine, emphasizing status quo bias and the lack of closure signals after 40 days. The tight clustering of our forecasts (38-45%) suggests we've identified the key considerations correctly, with differences arising mainly from how much weight to assign to the 'already 40 days' information versus proximity to the median timeframe.",
    "rationale": "After reviewing the other analyses, I find no fundamentally new information or arguments that weren't in my original assessment. The convergence around 38-45% increases my confidence that this is the appropriate range. The key insight from the deliberation is recognizing that being 40 days into the recall without closure is actually informative—it suggests we're not tracking toward the faster end of the distribution. If this recall were on pace for a 60-day closure, we'd likely see signs by now. This reinforces my view that the complicating factors (multi-state, foodservice, extended shelf life) are indeed pushing this toward the slower half of the distribution. With 54 days remaining and typical Class III recalls taking 60-120 days when complicated by these factors, there's a meaningful but not dominant chance of closure before July 1. The status quo (remaining Active) is the default outcome unless verification processes are completed, which favors a probability below 50%. I'm adjusting slightly from 40% to 39% to acknowledge Forecaster 2's nearly identical reasoning arriving at 38%, effectively splitting the difference between our two very similar assessments.",
