    "review": "Both forecasters provide well-reasoned analyses that largely align with my own assessment, though they land 3-6 percentage points higher. Key arguments I should weigh more carefully: (1) Forecaster 3's point about Russia and China favoring expansion and potentially pushing for at least one symbolic addition despite Brazil's reluctance - this is a legitimate counterpressure I may have underweighted; (2) The political dynamics of needing tangible summit deliverables - summits do often produce surprises for this reason; (3) Indonesia's January 2025 accession demonstrating the machinery can move quickly; (4) Forecaster 3's observation that 'large multilateral expansions typically telegraph in advance' and the lack of such signals by now is actually strong evidence for 'No'. However, I think both forecasters may be slightly overweighting the tail risk scenarios. The combination of Brazil's explicit stance as host, the documented April discord on even a joint communiqué, and the complete absence of credible leaks about consensus-building with only 5 weeks remaining creates an extremely high bar. Russia and China's preferences matter, but they cannot force Brazil's hand on something requiring unanimity, especially when Brazil is the host. The Indonesia example actually cuts against expansion - that decision was likely made months earlier at Kazan, not rushed through. The strongest new argument is about Russia/China pressure creating a small tail risk of a compromise single-country invite, which does warrant a modest upward adjustment from my initial 12%.",
    "rationale": "After reviewing the other forecasters' analyses, I'm making a modest upward adjustment from 12% to 14%. The core evidence remains unchanged and heavily favors 'No': Brazil's explicit stabilization preference, non-committal draft agendas, April's failed communiqué showing discord, and complete absence of preparatory signals with only 5 weeks left. These factors create an extremely high bar for expansion. However, I'm incorporating two valid points that warrant a small increase: (1) Russia and China's pro-expansion stance could create last-minute pressure for a symbolic single-country invite as a summit deliverable - this is a genuine tail risk I underweighted; (2) The recent institutional momentum (Indonesia's accession, partner framework) does leave a small probability window. That said, I remain closer to my original forecast than to the other forecasters because the host nation's position is historically determinative, unanimity among 10 members showing coordination problems is nearly impossible to achieve quickly, and major diplomatic initiatives of this nature virtually always telegraph in advance through leaks, preparatory meetings, or diplomatic reporting - none of which we're seeing. The 'lack of signals' argument actually reinforces rather than weakens the case for 'No'.",
