  "information": "The Trump administration has threatened to revoke Harvard University's 501(c)(3) status, citing the university's DEI programs, alleged anti-Semitism, and refusal to comply with demands for reforms to governance and leadership. The administration has frozen $2.2 billion in federal funding and $60 million in contracts intended for the university. In response, Harvard has filed a lawsuit against the administration, arguing that its actions are arbitrary, capricious, and outside the scope of its legal authority. The university has rejected the administration's demands, with its spokesperson stating there is 'no legal basis for revoking the University's exemption.'\n\nThe authority to revoke a 501(c)(3) tax-exempt status rests with the Internal Revenue Service (IRS), not the President. According to legal precedent, revocation typically requires evidence that an organization is violating public policy or engaging in illegal activities. The key Supreme Court case, Bob Jones University v. United States (1983), affirmed that tax-exempt status could be revoked for organizations violating clear public policy, such as racial discrimination. The legal and administrative process in the Bob Jones case took over seven years to resolve. Historically, no major university has had its tax-exempt status revoked in recent decades.\n\nLegal experts and former IRS officials state that the revocation process normally involves a multi-step, years-long procedure including an audit, formal notice, appeals, and litigation. Statutory safeguards, such as IRC § 7217 and a 1998 anti-targeting law, are intended to prevent direct presidential direction or politically motivated targeting. The IRS is also reportedly experiencing significant internal challenges, including leadership turnover with three acting directors in one week and workforce reductions. Despite these procedural hurdles, multiple news outlets have reported the Trump administration has formally asked the IRS to begin revocation proceedings and that the agency is 'making plans' to rescind Harvard’s exemption.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "67 days (from April 25, 2025 to July 1, 2025)",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No - Harvard maintains its 501(c)(3) tax-exempt status",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "The IRS follows its normal multi-year procedural requirements for revocation, including audits, formal notices, and appeals. Harvard's lawsuit results in court injunctions or temporary restraining orders that delay any action. The IRS's internal challenges and leadership instability prevent rapid action. By July 1, 2025, no formal revocation has occurred.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Under intense political pressure, the IRS issues an emergency or expedited revocation order, bypassing normal procedures. Courts decline to issue injunctions stopping the action, or legal challenges fail to materialize quickly enough. The administration successfully overcomes procedural safeguards through unprecedented executive action within the 67-day window.",
    "rationale": "The status quo strongly favors Harvard maintaining its tax-exempt status given multiple factors: (1) Timeline constraints - only 67 days remain, while the Bob Jones University precedent took over 7 years to resolve through normal IRS procedures; (2) Robust procedural safeguards including IRC § 7217 and 1998 anti-targeting laws designed to prevent politically motivated actions; (3) IRS operational challenges with three acting directors in one week and workforce reductions limiting capacity for complex unprecedented actions; (4) Harvard's active lawsuit claiming arbitrary and capricious government action, which could trigger court injunctions; (5) Historical precedent showing no major university has lost tax-exempt status in recent decades. While the administration has formally requested revocation and reports indicate the IRS is 'making plans,' the combination of legal, procedural, and practical obstacles makes completion within 67 days extremely unlikely. The probability is not zero because unprecedented political pressure could theoretically lead to emergency administrative action, but it's not higher because the timeframe is simply too short for the complex legal and administrative process required, even in an expedited scenario. The forecast would increase if the IRS issues formal revocation notices or courts decline to issue injunctions, and would decrease if courts issue restraining orders or if evidence emerges that the IRS is following standard multi-year procedures.",
