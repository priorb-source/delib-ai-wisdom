    "review": "All three forecasters converged on remarkably similar forecasts (22%, 22%, 23%) using comparable reasoning, which provides some validation that this probability range is appropriate. Forecaster 3 provided the most explicit mathematical framework, showing that even with 10-15% per-category win chances, three independent attempts only yield 27-38% for at least one win. This structured approach clarifies why we shouldn't be much higher than the low-to-mid 20s range. All forecasters correctly identified the key factors: the poor 6.5% historical conversion rate, strong competition from Wilson and Langley, the 'surprise' characterization of her Entertainer nomination, and the three nominations providing multiple pathways. No forecaster introduced genuinely new information that would warrant a significant update. The convergence suggests we're reasoning through this correctly rather than missing something obvious. The one consideration is whether we're all over-anchoring on the historical 6.5% rate, but given the 'surprise' nomination language and fierce competition, this anchor seems appropriate.",
    "rationale": "Upon reflection, my original forecast of 22% remains well-supported. The mathematical framework from Forecaster 3 confirms that even with generous per-category probabilities of 10-15%, three attempts only reach 27-38% before adjusting for her weak historical performance and strong competition. The consensus at 22-23% across all forecasters using similar logic suggests this range appropriately balances the competing factors. I considered adjusting upward slightly to 23% to align with the group consensus, but I don't see compelling evidence that would make my forecast materially different. The key anchors remain: (1) historical 6.5% win rate indicating poor conversion, (2) 'surprise' nomination suggesting underdog status, (3) formidable competition from artists with more nominations, but (4) three genuine opportunities providing multiple pathways. The Music Event category remains her most plausible path, but not enough to push the forecast significantly higher. I'm maintaining my original forecast of 22%.",
