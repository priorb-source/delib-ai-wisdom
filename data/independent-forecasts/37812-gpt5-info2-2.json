  "information": "According to airport statistics, Beirut International Airport handled 1,254,550 passengers in the first quarter of 2025, a 1.42% decrease from the same period in 2024. While passenger arrivals increased by 9.33%, departures fell by 11.60%, and the number of transit passengers dropped by over 92%. The Lebanese government has also implemented new security measures at the airport to combat smuggling, including banning certain Iranian flights and increasing security checks.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "About 41 days (until July 1, 2025)",
    "status_quo_outcome": "Yes (just over the 51 threshold, assuming summer schedules hold)",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Cross‑border conflict escalates enough that multiple regional and European carriers suspend service and MEA trims seasonal leisure routes (Turkey/Greece/EU). FlightsFrom reflects these cancellations by July 1, leaving ≤51 listed destinations.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Security situation remains at its current simmer without major new escalations. Summer seasonal routes to Turkey/Greece/Europe operate alongside resilient Gulf and Iraq links, and FlightsFrom lists roughly mid‑50s destinations on/after July 1.",
    "rationale": "Baseline: Beirut typically sees a broader network in summer, with MEA plus Gulf, Iraqi, Turkish, and Greek seasonal services. The threshold (>51) is close, but summer adds (Greek islands, Turkish resorts, extra European points) usually push BEY above 50. Q1 2025 airport data show overall passengers down only 1.4% YoY (arrivals up, departures down), suggesting stability rather than a sharp contraction in network breadth. The reported 92% drop in transit passengers and bans on certain Iranian flights likely affect a small number of destinations (e.g., Tehran/Mashhad) rather than the core regional network. Countervailing risks: Recent Israeli strikes and negative tourism outlook could lead to seasonal cuts, and some European carriers may be risk‑averse. If there’s a notable security deterioration, listings could fall below the threshold quickly. Why not higher: Elevated geopolitical risk and already‑weak tourism sentiment increase the odds of late schedule pullbacks, particularly for discretionary leisure routes that often make the difference between ~48 and ~55 destinations. Why not lower: Diaspora and VFR travel sustain Gulf/Iraq/Jordan/Egypt links; MEA typically maintains a broad European footprint; July schedules are largely filed already, and summer seasonality is a tailwind. What would change my view: Upward—evidence on FlightsFrom or airline announcements confirming a robust slate of seasonal Greek/Turkish/European routes (total listed destinations ≥55), or de‑escalation reducing insurer/travel advisories. Downward—new airspace restrictions/NOTAMs, insurer withdrawals, or multiple carriers (especially Gulf/Turkish/European) suspending BEY by late June, leading to listings ≤51 on FlightsFrom.",

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
