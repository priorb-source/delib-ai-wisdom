    "review": "Both forecasters make compelling points that refine my initial thinking. Forecaster 2's emphasis on the lack of clear, imminent catalysts is particularly persuasive - historically, DJIA changes cluster around specific events (M&A, spin-offs, bankruptcies, major stock splits) rather than general market volatility. The specific historical data (7 removals over ~10 years) provides a useful quantitative anchor. Forecaster 3's identification of specific weak performers (IBM, Boeing) aligns with my analysis, but correctly notes that short-term stock volatility alone rarely triggers removal. All three of us converge on the key tension: the short timeframe and recent February 2024 changes strongly favor status quo, but 30 companies create non-trivial aggregate risk and the committee can act without warning. The range of 10-15% represents genuine uncertainty rather than disagreement on fundamentals.",
    "rationale": "After deliberation, I'm adjusting my forecast slightly downward from 15% to 12%. Forecaster 2's argument about the absence of obvious near-term catalysts is the deciding factor. While I initially weighted market stress and economic uncertainty heavily, the historical pattern shows changes typically follow specific corporate events rather than general volatility. The February 2024 reshuffling remains a strong signal that the committee is satisfied with current composition. However, I'm not going as low as 10% because: (1) with 30 companies, unexpected corporate actions (sudden merger announcements, unforeseen crises) remain possible even in 67 days, (2) Boeing and IBM face ongoing structural challenges that could theoretically accelerate committee action if conditions worsen dramatically, and (3) the resolution criterion only requires an announcement, not implementation, which slightly increases the probability window. The 12% forecast reflects meaningful tail risk while acknowledging the strong status quo bias and lack of visible catalysts.",
