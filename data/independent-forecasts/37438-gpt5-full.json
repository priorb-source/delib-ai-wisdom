  "information": "Based on its Q4 Fiscal Year 2025 results (for the quarter ending January 31, 2025), ChargePoint reported having $225.6 million in cash, cash equivalents, and restricted cash. The company's operating cash usage decreased to $3 million in Q4, down from $31 million in the previous quarter. The non-GAAP gross margin improved to 30%. While overall Q4 revenue declined 12% year-over-year, subscription revenue grew by 14% to $38 million. The company has no debt maturities until 2028. For Q1 of Fiscal Year 2026, ChargePoint guided for revenues between $95 million and $105 million.\n\nOn February 19, 2025, ChargePoint received a notice of non-compliance from the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE). The notice was issued because the company's average closing stock price remained below $1.00 over a consecutive 30-day trading period. This notification does not result in an immediate delisting. The company has publicly stated its intention to cure the stock price deficiency and regain compliance, and is considering measures such as a reverse stock split, which would be subject to stockholder approval.\n\nIn February 2025, it was reported that the U.S. federal government had paused $3 billion in funding designated for EV charging stations. Separately, on May 1, 2025, ChargePoint announced it had secured over $19 million in funding from the National Electric Vehicle Infrastructure (NEVI) program to build charging stations in California. The company is also launching a new AC Level 2 charging technology with bidirectional capabilities, scheduled for release in Europe by summer 2025 and in North America by the end of 2025.",

    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "About 56 days (until July 1, 2025)",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "ChargePoint continues operating with existing cash, works toward NYSE compliance (e.g., reverse split), reports Q1 FY26 results without an acute liquidity crisis, and does not seek court protection before July 1, 2025.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "A sudden liquidity shock (e.g., major recall or legal judgment, vendor credit pull, covenant/default event on any financing, auditor resignation/going‑concern crisis) forces the board to seek Chapter 11 protection unexpectedly before July 1, 2025.",
    "rationale": "- What we know: As of Jan 31, 2025, ChargePoint reported $225.6m in cash/cash equivalents/restricted cash, markedly reduced operating cash usage in Q4 to $3m (from $31m in Q3), improved non‑GAAP gross margin to 30%, and no debt maturities until 2028. Q4 revenue fell 12% YoY, but subscription revenue rose 14% to $38m. Guidance for Q1 FY26 was $95–105m revenue. On Feb 19, 2025, the NYSE notified CHPT of sub‑$1 price non‑compliance; the company plans to cure (potentially via reverse split). Separately, while some federal EV‑charging funds were reportedly paused in February, ChargePoint announced over $19m in NEVI awards in May and is rolling out new products in 2025.\n- Status quo weighting: With roughly two months remaining and no near‑term maturities, the base case is no filing. Bankruptcy in this window would typically require either (1) an imminent debt wall or interest default, (2) a catastrophic operational/liability shock, or (3) a disclosure of severe going‑concern/liquidity issues that cannot be bridged. None are currently indicated. NYSE non‑compliance creates listing risk, not an immediate solvency event; companies often cure via reverse split and/or capital raises.\n- Runway intuition: Even if Q4’s $3m operating cash usage benefited from working‑capital timing and the true forward burn were materially higher, $225m provides meaningful months of runway. The absence of maturities until 2028 materially lowers the probability of a forced filing in the next 56 days. Bankruptcy of a subsidiary alone would not satisfy the resolution (the criterion is specifically ChargePoint Holdings, Inc.).\n- Why not lower: Sector demand is choppy; revenue declined YoY; the stock price is under $1; and public‑market capital access could be constrained pending compliance. A negative Q1 FY26 surprise (e.g., sharp revenue miss, margin compression, or a new liability) could tighten liquidity faster than expected. There is always tail risk of an unforeseen shock (legal, regulatory, recall) that triggers a filing.\n- What would move me up: An 8‑K/press release about acute liquidity pressure; missed or delayed financial filings; auditor resignation or going‑concern language in the upcoming 10‑Q; vendor credit holds; default/covenant notices; inability to make a scheduled interest payment; large adverse judgment/recall.\n- What would move me down: Confirmation of continued low cash burn in Q1 FY26, additional non‑dilutive funding/awards, successful reverse split approval, or clear evidence of improving orders/margins.\nOverall, given cash on hand, improved operating metrics, and lack of near‑term maturities, a filing before July 1, 2025 appears unlikely, though not impossible.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill ChargePoint file for bankruptcy before July 1, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\n[ChargePoint Reports Fourth Quarter and Full Fiscal Year 2025 Financial Results](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1777393/000177739325000009/chpt8-kerfy2025q4exx991.htm)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question will resolve as **Yes** if ChargePoint Holdings, Inc., files any petition for bankruptcy protection in the United States, under any chapter of the United States Bankruptcy Code, before July 1, 2025. The question will resolves on the filing of such a petition, not on whether any bankruptcy protection is granted by a court. If no such petition is filed by that date, this question will resolve as **No**.\n\n\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nBased on its Q4 Fiscal Year 2025 results (for the quarter ending January 31, 2025), ChargePoint reported having $225.6 million in cash, cash equivalents, and restricted cash.

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
