    "review": "- F2 usefully highlights the “every day” fragility and the risk of a sudden legal development, but I’m not convinced by the premise that major sports leagues pose an immediate injunction threat to Kalshi’s sports markets in June. The referenced court action appears centered on election markets vs. the CFTC, which is not obviously dispositive for sports listings.\n- F3 adds concrete operational claims: daily MLB listings since Apr 17 and strong business incentives. The specific volume figures (e.g., $500M March Madness) seem inflated or at least unverified, so I discount those. Still, a 6-week track record of daily MLB markets, if accurate, meaningfully reduces operational-miss risk. Their 87% feels high given the 30-for-30 fragility and unresolved legal overhang, but their operational-continuity argument is persuasive.\n- Net: I give weight to the operational track record and incentives, while treating the legal risk as a meaningful but not dominant tail for sports specifically. I do not find an imminent sports-specific injunction as likely as F2 suggests.",
    "rationale": "My prior 70% chiefly reflected the compounding “all-days” risk and a modest regulatory tail. Incorporating F3’s point about several weeks of continuous daily MLB markets (plausible and consistent with current site behavior), I lower the probability of an operational miss. I continue to assign some probability to an external shock (legal/regulatory or extended outage), but I view election-market litigation as unlikely to force a June pause in sports specifically.\n\nBack-of-envelope: if daily success is ~99.2% (failure ~0.8%), the 30-day success is ~78%. Add a small chance (5–10%) of an exogenous halt in June, and we’d be lower; but I think the exogenous risk specific to sports in June is closer to low-single-digits. That supports an uptick from 70% but not to the high-80s.\n\nI’ll update modestly upward to reflect stronger operational continuity and incentives, while keeping a cushion for the “every day” fragility and residual legal/technical tail risks.",
