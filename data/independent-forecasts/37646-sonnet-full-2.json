  "information": "Somalia's National Communications Authority granted Starlink a full operating license in mid-April 2025, following approximately two and a half years of discussions. On April 13, 2025, Elon Musk announced on social media, \"Starlink is in Somalia.\" At a ceremony in Mogadishu, Starlink representatives stated the service would be available nationwide soon. Somali government officials, including the Minister of Communications and Technology, publicly welcomed the service, highlighting its potential to provide internet access across the country. As of mid-May 2025, the official Starlink availability map listed Somalia as \"Not Available\" or \"Coming Soon.\"\n\nThe time between Starlink receiving a license and its service becoming \"Available\" varies. For several African nations, the lag has been several months: Nigeria's service went live approximately four months after licensing in 2023, while Rwanda's took about four months. The median time for recent African launches has been estimated at 4–8 months. However, some rollouts have been much faster; for example, Bangladesh's service became available in about two weeks in May 2025. Conversely, some countries, such as Zambia, India, and Vietnam, have remained in a \"Coming Soon\" status for many months after receiving licenses.\n\nStarlink can provide service to Somalia without an in-country gateway station due to its use of inter-satellite laser links, which can connect to ground stations in neighboring countries like Kenya or Ethiopia. A report by the Washington Post indicated that the U.S. government has been diplomatically promoting Starlink's expansion in various countries, including Somalia. Local challenges in Somalia include a fragile security environment, complex import logistics for user terminals, and difficulties with payment processing infrastructure. According to 2022 World Bank data, about 30% of Somalia's 18 million people have internet access.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Approximately 6.5 weeks until July 1, 2025",
    "status_quo_outcome": "The Starlink availability map currently shows Somalia as 'Not Available' or 'Coming Soon', which would result in a No outcome",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Starlink follows the typical African deployment timeline of 4-8 months. With the license granted in mid-April 2025, this would place availability in August-December 2025, missing the July 1 deadline. Operational challenges in Somalia including payment processing infrastructure, import logistics for terminals, and security concerns cause delays in the rollout.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Starlink prioritizes Somalia following the Bangladesh model of rapid deployment (~2 weeks). US government diplomatic support accelerates the process, technical infrastructure is already ready via inter-satellite links to neighboring countries, and strong Somali government backing facilitates swift activation. Service becomes available on the map in late May or June 2025.",
    "rationale": "This forecast requires weighing competing signals. The base rate for African Starlink deployments strongly suggests longer timelines: the median is 4-8 months, with Nigeria and Rwanda taking approximately 4 months. Since Somalia received its license only about 1 month ago (mid-April), following typical patterns would mean availability in August-December 2025, well past the July 1 deadline. Additionally, several countries have remained in 'Coming Soon' status for extended periods. Somalia's operational challenges—fragile security, payment infrastructure issues, and import logistics—could further slow deployment. However, there are positive signals: Bangladesh's May 2025 rollout in just ~2 weeks demonstrates that very rapid deployments are possible; US government diplomatic support could prioritize Somalia; technical readiness exists via inter-satellite links; and there's strong government backing. The current status quo of 'Not Available' mid-May with only 6.5 weeks remaining favors the No outcome. For my forecast to increase, I would need evidence of imminent activation, such as Starlink announcing specific dates, user terminals being distributed, or the map moving to a more definitive pre-launch status. For it to decrease, delays would need to be announced or the typical 4-8 month timeline would need to be confirmed as applying to Somalia. Good forecasters weight status quo heavily, and here the status quo plus typical timelines suggest the deadline will be missed, though the Bangladesh precedent and US support provide meaningful upside risk.",
