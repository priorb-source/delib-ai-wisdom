  "information": "Direct air travel between Iraqi Kurdistan and Europe has expanded in 2025. In February, Aegean Airlines launched a direct route between Athens and Erbil, initially operating two flights per week. The new route brought the total number of countries with direct air links to Iraqi Kurdistan to 21. Following this, Athens International Airport's summer 2025 expansion plan includes new flights to Erbil operated by easyJet. Separately, German airline Eurowings has added Erbil to its summer flight plan from Cologne/Bonn airport, along with other new destinations such as Funchal and Bastia.\n\nErbil International Airport has undertaken developments to enhance its operational capabilities. The airport has commenced preliminary tests for night flights after receiving clearance for night landings, as part of a strategic plan to improve air communication systems and safety. In January 2025, a committee from the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) visited the airport to conduct an inspection for its inclusion in the official list of international airports. This inclusion is expected to facilitate an increase in the number of international flights. The airport's operational capacity was also demonstrated during the Hajj season, with the Iraqi Ministry of Transportation successfully operating numerous pilgrim flights from Erbil and other Iraqi airports.\n\nBroader regional aviation activity and international interest in the area have seen recent developments. Dubai-based carrier flydubai announced the resumption of direct daily flights to Damascus, Syria, starting from June 1, 2025, after a 12-year suspension. This move is part of a wider effort to enhance regional connectivity. In a different development indicating tourism interest, British travel company Wild Frontiers is offering a 15-day tour of Iraq, which includes visits to historical sites such as the citadel of Erbil, despite official UK government warnings against travel to the country.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Approximately 5-6 weeks until July 1, 2025",
    "status_quo_outcome": "The number of direct flight destinations from Erbil would remain close to current levels, likely in the range of 28-32 destinations based on the reported 21 countries with direct links",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "The number of destinations stays at or below 31 due to: current baseline being lower than estimated, summer route expansions being delayed or cancelled, or some existing routes being suspended. Weather disruptions, operational challenges with night flight implementation, or broader regional instability could prevent planned summer expansions from materializing on schedule",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "The number exceeds 31 destinations through successful implementation of confirmed summer 2025 routes (Athens via easyJet, Cologne/Bonn via Eurowings) combined with additional unannounced summer seasonal routes. The airport's recent ICAO inspection and night flight capability expansion enable more international connections, and the optimistic tourism outlook for Kurdistan Summer 2025 drives airline demand for new routes",
    "rationale": "The baseline is difficult to establish precisely but appears close to the threshold. With 21 countries having direct links reported after Athens was added in February, and assuming an average of 1.4-1.5 destinations per country (accounting for countries like Turkey, UAE, or Iran potentially having multiple city connections), the current count is likely 28-32 destinations. The research confirms at least 2-3 new European routes for summer 2025: easyJet's Athens service and Eurowings' Cologne/Bonn service (Athens via Aegean is already counted from February). The airport's infrastructure improvements—ICAO inspection for international listing and night flight capabilities—signal capacity for expansion. The optimistic framing of 'Kurdistan Summer 2025: A Promising Season' suggests industry confidence. However, several factors create uncertainty: (1) I lack exact current destination counts; (2) summer schedules can face delays or cancellations; (3) the 5-6 week timeframe is short for major network changes; (4) not all summer routes may be operational by exactly July 1. The forecast isn't higher because the current baseline might already be at or just below 31, meaning only incremental summer additions would push it over. It isn't lower because multiple confirmed new routes plus positive momentum indicators suggest growth is likely. I would update upward with confirmation of current destinations being 29-30 or announcement of additional summer routes; downward if current count is verified below 28 or if planned summer routes are postponed",
