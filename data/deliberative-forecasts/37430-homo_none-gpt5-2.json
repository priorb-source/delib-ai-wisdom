    "review": "Both analyses mirror my process view and add two useful specifics: (1) the likely Sallah recess in June further compresses the window; (2) a potential path via a narrowly scoped VAT amendment that could be fast‑tracked outside an omnibus reform bill. They also stress the common pattern of tax changes bunching into year‑end finance packages. None of this contradicts my priors; the recess is a modest negative, while the carve‑out path is a modest positive. Net, these largely offset and keep the balance similar to my initial read.",
    "rationale": "As of May 5, there are roughly eight weeks left. We have signaling of intent (late‑April reporting on a Tax Reforms Bill including a VAT exemption for real estate) and an aligned executive–legislative environment, which makes fast‑tracking plausible. However, key risks remain: (a) omnibus tax packages tend to slow in committee/harmonization; (b) revenue concerns could pare back the exemption; (c) a June Sallah recess likely shrinks legislative time; and (d) even if both chambers pass the bill in late June, presidential assent might slip past July 1. A credible Yes path exists if leadership designates this as a priority and either advances the current bill rapidly through both chambers or carves the exemption into a small amendment that can clear quickly and be assented to in June. Absent concrete movement in May (e.g., second/third readings and committee reports in at least one chamber), the odds fall quickly. Considering the new arguments, I view the recess risk and the carve‑out possibility as offsetting; thus I’m holding my estimate steady pending signs of accelerated legislative action.",
