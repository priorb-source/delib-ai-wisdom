    "review": "The other forecasters provided crucial new information I lacked. Forecaster 3 revealed that March 2025 inflation was exactly 2.2% (down from February's 2.3%), and that the Bloomberg/Reuters consensus forecast for April is 2.1% - below the threshold. This is highly material evidence. Forecaster 2 added important ECB policy context: seven rate cuts with the deposit rate now at 2.25%, indicating the ECB's confidence that inflation is under control. Both correctly emphasize that the question requires inflation to be ABOVE 2.2%, so even matching March's figure would resolve as No. Forecaster 3's point about forecast uncertainty (standard error of 0.2-0.4pp) is well-taken and explains why none of us should go below ~20% despite the strong evidence - there's genuine tail risk of upside surprises. The services inflation stickiness (+1.56pp) is a legitimate upside concern. However, the combination of: (1) downward trend from 2.3% to 2.2%, (2) professional consensus at 2.1%, (3) aggressive ECB easing, and (4) sustained disinflationary pressures makes the case for sub-2.2% quite compelling.",
    "rationale": "The concrete March data (2.2% exactly) and April consensus forecast (2.1%) significantly strengthen the case for a No outcome beyond what I initially assessed. The downward trajectory from February (2.3%) → March (2.2%) → consensus April (2.1%) is clear and consistent with the disinflationary environment I identified. With professional forecasters expecting 2.1%, inflation would need to come in approximately 0.37 standard deviations above consensus to exceed 2.2%. While forecast errors of this magnitude occur, the balance of evidence - weak growth, ECB's aggressive easing cycle, negative energy contributions, decelerating wages, and sustained disinflation - suggests downside risks are at least as likely as upside risks. The sticky services inflation (1.56pp contribution) provides some upside risk, but not enough to overcome the strong disinflationary momentum. I'm lowering my forecast slightly from 25% to 24% to reflect the additional confidence from the concrete March data and consensus forecast, while maintaining meaningful probability for forecast uncertainty and potential volatility.",
