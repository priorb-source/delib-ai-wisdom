  "information": "Reports from late April and early May 2025 provide context on Starlink's expansion in the region. Bangladesh's telecommunication regulator granted Starlink two 10-year operating licenses, making it the second South Asian country after Sri Lanka to approve the service. Officials indicated that Starlink was preparing to launch service in Bangladesh by May 2025. In contrast, Starlink's full license in Pakistan is delayed pending permanent registration and the clearance of technical and security checks.",

    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "About 46 days (until 2025-07-01)",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Sri Lanka keeps showing as Coming Soon on Starlink’s availability map through June due to lingering administrative steps (e.g., terminal type approvals, import/tax arrangements, local distribution) or SpaceX’s sequencing priorities. No website update occurs before July 1, 2025.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "SpaceX completes remaining regulatory/operational steps (e.g., terminal approvals, logistics) and flips Sri Lanka to Available, enabling orders in at least some part of the country. The availability map updates in late May or June 2025.",
    "rationale": "- Baseline/status quo: As of May 16, 2025, Sri Lanka is not yet shown as Available on the Starlink map. Despite receiving a license in Aug 2024 (Reuters), it has not appeared as Available for roughly nine months. Good forecasting practice gives extra weight to the status quo; the fact that availability has not appeared after a long lead time suggests some remaining hurdles.\n- Regional context (from the research assistant): Bangladesh has now granted two 10-year licenses and officials indicated Starlink was preparing to launch service by May 2025, while Pakistan’s full license remains delayed. Bangladesh’s imminent launch is a positive regional signal that SpaceX is advancing in South Asia, but Sri Lanka’s earlier license without map availability implies country-specific issues may still be unresolved in Sri Lanka.\n- Drivers toward Yes by July 1: (1) License already in hand; (2) Technical coverage is not a constraint; (3) Starlink has been expanding quickly elsewhere once regulatory clearance is in place; (4) The question only requires that anywhere in Sri Lanka is marked Available, not nationwide.\n- Drivers toward No by July 1: (1) The prolonged gap since licensing hints at type-approval/import/retail arrangements, tax/FX, or other compliance steps taking time; (2) SpaceX often sequences rollouts and could prioritize Bangladesh or other markets first; (3) Starlink typically updates the map close to actual orderability, so remaining commercial/logistics steps can hold up the website change.\n- Why not higher: The nine-month lag after licensing and no availability as of mid-May suggests nontrivial friction; only ~6 weeks remain.\n- Why not lower: The license is granted, technical capacity exists, and Starlink is actively pushing in the region (Bangladesh launch expected). A single flip of the site could satisfy the criterion at any time.\n- What would move me up: Any report of Sri Lankan terminal type-approval completion, customs/import policy enabling shipments, local retail arrangements, pilot deployments, or Starlink opening preorders/orders in Sri Lanka; Bangladesh appearing as Available could modestly raise the odds for Sri Lanka if accompanied by signs of Sri Lankan progress.\n- What would move me down: Continued silence through early/mid-June, new reports of regulatory or tax/FX holdups in Sri Lanka, or indications Starlink is deferring Sri Lanka’s commercial launch to H2 2025.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill Starlink's website show Sri Lanka as a country with Starlink availability before July 1, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nReuters: [Musk's Starlink wins Sri Lanka licence](https://www.reuters.com/business/media-telecom/sri-lanka-regulator-grants-licence-musks-starlink-satellite-broadband-2024-08-13/)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if, before July 1, 2025, the [Starlink Availability Map](https://www.starlink.com/us/map) has anywhere in Sri Lanka listed as \"Available.\"\n\n\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nReports from late April and early May 2025 provide context on Starlink's expansion in the region. Bangladesh's telecommunication regulator granted Starlink two 10-year operating licenses, making it the second South Asian country after Sri Lanka to approve the service. Officials indicated that Starlink was preparing to launch service in Bangladesh by May 2025. In contrast, Starlink's full license in Pakistan is delayed pending permanent registration and the clearance of technical and security checks.\n\nToday is 2025-05-16.\n\nBefore answering you think:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n(e) You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
