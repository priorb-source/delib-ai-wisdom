    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "About 5–6 weeks (resolution check on or after July 1, 2025)",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No — recent monthly NUFORC tallies typically come in below 400 absent a widely seen trigger event.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "June 2025 is a routine month: scattered reports across the U.S. and Canada, a few minor Starlink trains and fireballs but nothing widely visible or viral. NUFORC posts ~250–350 June reports by early July, keeping the total at 400 or fewer.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "One or more high-profile sky events produce large, geographically broad misidentifications: e.g., a widely visible Starlink ‘train’ during evening twilight across much of North America on multiple nights, a bright rocket-stage reentry/fireball crossing several states, and/or a strong auroral display at low latitudes during solar maximum. These triggers drive a surge of submissions pushing June’s posted count to >400 by early July.",
    "rationale": "Baseline: In recent years, NUFORC’s monthly report counts have commonly been in the low-to-mid hundreds, with occasional spikes linked to distinctive, widely observed phenomena (Starlink trains soon after launch, spectacular fireballs/reentries, holiday lantern/fireworks periods). A threshold of >400 is above what I’d expect in a typical non-spike month. Seasonality and catalysts: June has long evening twilight and good outdoor activity, which can boost skywatching. Starlink launch cadence remains high, and summer geometry can make trains conspicuous at mid/high latitudes. We are also near solar maximum, so auroral activity capable of reaching lower latitudes is more plausible than usual, occasionally prompting UAP reports. These factors modestly raise the tail risk of a spike relative to, say, winter months without events. Offsetting considerations: Public familiarity with Starlink has increased over time, which likely dampens extreme spikes compared to 2020–2021. There’s no large U.S. fireworks/lantern holiday within June (July 4 spikes fall in July). NUFORC posting cadence can introduce lags; although the question allows checking on or after July 1, it still depends on what’s posted by the time Metaculus checks, not on late-added June reports weeks later. Why not higher? Because the status quo most months appears to be under 400 absent a major, widely visible trigger; big spikes are possible but not the norm. Why not lower? June’s conditions (long twilight, high launch cadence, solar max) add multiple plausible pathways for a surge above 400, so the right tail is meaningful. Updates I’d make: I would move the probability up if, early in June, there are one or more evenings where a Starlink train is broadly visible across North America and social media shows significant confusion, or if there’s a notable reentry or fireball event tracked across several states, or a strong geomagnetic storm pushes aurora to low latitudes with widespread reports. I would move it down if by mid-to-late June NUFORC’s visible rolling count (if trackable) is subdued (<200 by the 20th) and no major sky events are reported, or if launch/reentry schedules/visibility windows suggest limited North American visibility. Research assistant summary: No additional information was provided, so this forecast leans on general recent patterns, known drivers of spikes, and seasonal/astronomical considerations.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill the number of UFO sightings reported by the National UFO Reporting Center exceed 400 for June 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nAccording to the [National UFO Reporting Center](https://nuforc.org/about-us/): \"The National UFO Reporting Center was founded in 1974 by noted UFO investigator Robert J. Gribble. The Center’s primary function over the past five decades has been to receive, record, and to the greatest degree possible, corroborate and document reports from individuals who have been witness to unusual, possibly UFO-related events. Throughout its history, the Center has processed over 180,000 reports, and has distributed its information to thousands of individuals.\"\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if The National UFO Reporting Center posts greater than 400 UFO/UAP sighting reports at [this link](https://nuforc.org/ndx/?id=event) for the month of June 2025, as displayed when accessed by Metaculus on or after July 1, 2025.\n\n\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nNo additional information available.\n\nToday is 2025-05-23.\n\nBefore answering you think:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n(e) You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
