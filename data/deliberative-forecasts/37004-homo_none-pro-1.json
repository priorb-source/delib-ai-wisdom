    "review": "The other two forecasters and I are in strong agreement on the fundamental drivers of this forecast: the Conservative Party's substantial, consistent, and long-standing lead in public opinion polls, which is rooted in widespread economic discontent. Forecaster 2's point about the intensified scrutiny the Conservative leader will face during an official campaign is a valid consideration that reinforces the uncertainty. Forecaster 3's explicit mention of a potential Liberal leadership change as a key variable was particularly insightful, as it represents one of the few plausible, albeit low-probability, scenarios that could significantly alter the race. I found their reasoning convincing as it helped to articulate the specific, known uncertainties more clearly.",
    "rationale": "After reviewing my colleagues' analyses, I am slightly increasing my forecast. The deliberation reinforced the core strength and stability of the Conservative Party's position. The consensus that their lead is driven by deep-seated and slow-moving factors like economic anxiety and voter fatigue strengthens the case for the status quo holding. While the other forecasters rightly identified potential sources of volatility—such as campaign performance under scrutiny and a hypothetical Liberal leadership change—I now believe I initially gave these possibilities slightly too much weight. Overcoming a double-digit polling deficit in the final six months is a historically rare feat. The fundamental conditions favouring the Conservatives are so entrenched that the probability of an upset is likely lower than the 15% I had previously estimated. Therefore, I am adjusting my forecast upward by two percentage points to better reflect the high probability of the current trend continuing through to the election.",
