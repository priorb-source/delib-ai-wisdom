    "review": "The other forecasters raise several compelling points I hadn't fully weighted. Forecaster 3's argument about order-to-shipment lag is particularly important - the 45% China booking decline represents future orders, not April shipments, which likely reflect contracts made before April 2nd. The calculation showing February 2025 at $278.5B (6% above threshold) is also helpful framing. For April to miss would require a ~$16B decline from February, which Forecaster 3 correctly notes is rare outside recessions. I initially overweighted the immediate shock signals (bookings, PMI) without adequately considering that export shipments lag orders by weeks or months. Forecaster 2's analysis at 30% seems too pessimistic given these lag effects, while Forecaster 3's 40% better captures the structural protection April enjoys from pre-tariff contracts. However, I'm not fully convinced we should go as high as 40% because some tariff impact will hit April through expedited cancellations or holds, and the disruption severity is genuine.",
    "rationale": "Upon reflection, I underweighted the critical distinction between bookings (forward-looking) and shipments (backward-looking). April exports primarily reflect orders placed in February-March, before tariffs. The 45% China booking collapse mainly predicts May+ problems, not April. With February at $278.5B (already $16B above threshold) and March showing continued positive trends, April would need an unprecedented month-over-month collapse to miss. The tariff shock is real but its full impact on actual shipments takes time to manifest. Services exports, less affected by goods tariffs, provide additional buffering. While some April impact is inevitable through rushed cancellations or holds, and the disruption is severe enough to matter, the structural lags in trade data provide more protection than I initially assessed. I'm updating upward but remaining below 40% due to: some immediate impact will occur, manufacturing PMI contraction suggests real weakness, and retaliatory measures add uncertainty. The forecast balances recognition that April *shipments* are partially insulated by timing against the genuine severity of the trade disruption.",
