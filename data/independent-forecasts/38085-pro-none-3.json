    "status_quo_outcome": "Yes. The provided background information from late April 2025 states that 14 million Florida residents were already in drought, which meets the threshold for a 'Yes' resolution.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "The onset of Florida's typical summer wet season in June brings widespread, consistent rainfall from afternoon thunderstorms. This alleviates drought conditions in major population centers, causing the number of affected residents to drop below 14.0 million by the resolution date.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "A persistent high-pressure system delays or weakens the start of the summer wet season. June rainfall remains below average, and no significant tropical moisture impacts the peninsula, causing the number of residents in drought to remain at or above 14.0 million.",
    "rationale": "My forecast is based on the strong climatological pressure for drought conditions to ease in Florida during the month of June. The question's resolution date, June 28, is one month from now and falls squarely within the typical onset of Florida's wet season (late May to October), a period characterized by a dramatic increase in rainfall from daily thunderstorms.\n\nThe primary evidence for a 'Yes' vote is the status quo. The background article from April 28, 2025, notes that 14 million residents were already in drought, meeting the resolution threshold. Since droughts have inertia, it's possible these conditions will persist.\n\nHowever, the seasonal shift is a powerful counter-force. The transition from the dry spring to the wet summer is one of the most reliable features of Florida's climate. It is statistically more likely than not that significant, drought-alleviating rains will occur across the state between late May and late June. Because the starting point is exactly 14.0 million, any net improvement in conditions affecting populated areas will result in a 'No' outcome.\n\nMy probability of 35% reflects this balance. It is not lower because overcoming established and 'extreme' drought requires substantial and widespread rainfall, and a delayed or weak start to the rainy season is certainly possible. It is not higher because betting against the arrival of Florida's rainy season in June is to bet against a strong, well-established climatological pattern. For my forecast to move higher, I would need to see medium-range weather models predicting a persistent high-pressure ridge over the southeast. For it to move lower, I would look for forecasts of an early tropical system or an unusually strong and moist southwest flow establishing over the state.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill Florida have 14.0 million or more residents living in drought on June 28, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nUSA Today: [14 million Florida residents are under drought conditions, some extreme: What to know](https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2025/04/28/florida-drought-conditions-what-to-know/83328368007/)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if Drought Monitor at [this link](https://www.drought.gov/states/florida) lists greater than or equal to 14.0 million Florida residents in areas of drought, when the link is accessed by Metaculus on or after June 28, 2025. If the number is below that, this question resolves as **No**.\n\nThe question will resolve as soon as the page is accessed by Metaculus Admins on the resolution date. However, if there are issues accessing the page, then resolution will wait up until the end of the tournament's scoring at which point if Metaculus has still not been able to access the resolution source, this question will be **annulled**.\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nNo additional information available.\n\nToday is 2025-05-29.\n\nBefore answering you think:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n(e) You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
