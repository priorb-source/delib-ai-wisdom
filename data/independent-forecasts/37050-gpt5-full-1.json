  "information": "Historical changes to the Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA) are infrequent. In February 2024, Intel and Walgreens were replaced. In August 2020, Exxon Mobil, Pfizer, and Raytheon Technologies were replaced by Salesforce, Amgen, and Honeywell. In June 2018, General Electric was replaced by Walgreens Boots Alliance, and in March 2015, AT&T was replaced by Apple.\n\nSeveral DJIA components have experienced recent negative performance and events. UnitedHealth Group's stock dropped 22%, causing a record 805-point single-stock decline in the DJIA. In March 2025, Nike's stock dropped 20.1%, Walt Disney's fell 13.3%, and Nvidia's declined 13.2%. IBM shares fell 7.6% after the company announced the cancellation of 15 government contracts. IBM (-6.6%) and Procter & Gamble (-3.7%) have also experienced recent losses.\n\nThe broader US stock market is experiencing significant volatility driven by corporate earnings, trade policy uncertainty, and economic indicators. President Trump's tariffs sparked a 2,200-point drop in the DJIA on April 4, 2025. In response to the impact of tariffs, Deutsche Bank strategists cut their year-end S&P 500 target by 12%. The Federal Reserve is described as cautious due to persistent inflation.",

    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "About 66 days (until end of day June 30, 2025)",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No change: none of the listed companies are dropped from the DJIA before July 1, 2025.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "S&P Dow Jones Indices makes no announcement of DJIA changes over the next ~2 months. Recent price volatility in several components subsides or is judged transitory, and there are no corporate actions (mergers/spin‑offs/listing changes) that force a swap. The committee opts for continuity so soon after the February 2024 reshuffle.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "S&P Dow Jones Indices announces a reshuffle before July 1, 2025, replacing at least one of the listed companies. Triggers could include: a major corporate action (e.g., a spin-off or merger altering a company’s profile), a sustained collapse that leaves a component with an unusually low price/weight, or a desire to rebalance sector representation (e.g., swapping out a laggard like 3M, IBM, Disney, Nike, or Boeing to add a company seen as more representative).",
    "rationale": "Base rates dominate over short horizons. DJIA membership changes are infrequent and discretionary. In the past decade, change events occurred in 2015, 2018, 2020, and 2024—roughly one event every ~2–3 years, often with 1–3 constituents swapped. On that cadence, the unconditional chance of any change in a random two‑month window is low (on the order of mid‑single digits). Moreover, the last change was in Feb 2024 (Intel and Walgreens out; Nvidia and Amazon in), only ~14 months ago, which makes another near‑term change less likely absent a forcing event.\n\nThe research assistant notes notable recent declines (UNH −22% in a day; Nike −20.1%; Disney −13.3%; Nvidia −13.2%; IBM −7.6%; P&G −3.7%) and broad market volatility tied to tariffs and inflation. Historically, the DJIA committee does not react to short‑term volatility alone. Walgreens’ 2024 removal followed a long period of underperformance and very low price/weight, and Intel’s removal reflected a broader representativeness shift in tech—those are structural rationales, not transient market moves. None of the listed companies is currently known (to me) to be undergoing a definitive corporate action that would force a removal by July 1, 2025.\n\nWhy not higher? The short time left (~2 months), low base rate of changes, and lack of a clear catalyst argue for a low probability. The committee typically avoids clustering changes and just executed a significant update in 2024.\n\nWhy not lower? The threshold for a Yes is only one company being dropped, and unforeseen corporate actions can arise (e.g., spin-offs, governance changes, or sector-balancing moves). A particularly sharp, sustained deterioration leaving a member with an unusually low price/weight (as happened to Walgreens) could prompt action, as could a high‑profile addition the committee wishes to make for representativeness.\n\nWhat would move me up: credible reports of an imminent DJIA reshuffle; an announced, near‑term spin‑off or merger of a component that would alter eligibility; a major stock split by a high‑priced member that the committee signals it wants to counterbalance; persistent price collapse driving a component toward negligible weight; media leaks about specific replacements.\n\nWhat would move me down: passing into mid‑June with no relevant news; stabilization in the most volatile constituents; explicit statements from S&P Dow Jones Indices downplaying near‑term changes.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill any of these companies get dropped from the Dow Jones Industrial Average before July 1, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nOregon Business: [Intel Ousted From Dow Jones By Rival Nvidia](https://oregonbusiness.com/intel-ousted-from-dow-jones-by-rival-nvidia/)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if before July 1, 2025, there is any official announcement or confirmation (or credible source reporting) that any of the following companies will no longer be a component of the Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA) either on the official announcement or that the company has been or will be removed from the index: Amazon.com Inc, American Express Co, Amgen Inc, Apple Inc, Boeing Co, Caterpillar Inc, Cisco Systems Inc, Chevron Corp, Goldman Sachs Group Inc, Home Depot Inc, Honeywell International Inc, International Business Machines Corp, Johnson & Johnson, Coca-Cola Co, JPMorgan Chase & Co, McDonald’s Corp, 3M Co, Merck & Co Inc, Microsoft Corp, Nike Inc, Procter & Gamble Co, Sherwin-Williams Co, Travelers Companies Inc, Unitedhealth Group Inc, Salesforce Inc, NVIDIA Corp, Verizon Communications Inc, Visa Inc, Walmart Inc, Walt Disney Co.\n\nAlthough removals from the index are generally effective immediately in order to forestall frontrunning, this is not a requirement for this question. All that is required is for there to be an announcement or confirmation before the resolution date about the removal from the DJIA at any point in time. Therefore this question will resolve based on the announcement or confirmation, not on the actual removal date.\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nHistorical changes to the Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA) are infrequent.

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
