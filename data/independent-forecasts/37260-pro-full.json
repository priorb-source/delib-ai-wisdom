  "information": "The legal process to ban a political party in Germany requires an application to be submitted to the Federal Constitutional Court by the federal government, the Bundestag, or the Bundesrat. The court must then rule that the party aims to undermine the democratic order. Historically, only two parties have been banned in post-WWII Germany: the Socialist Reich Party (SRP) in 1952 and the Communist Party of Germany (KPD) in 1956. A 2017 attempt to ban the far-right NPD party failed. As of early May 2025, no formal application to ban the AfD had been filed with the Constitutional Court. Separately, Germany's domestic intelligence agency (BfV) has classified the AfD as a 'proven right-wing extremist organization,' which permits state surveillance.\n\nAccording to polling in late April 2025, the Alternative for Germany (AfD) party had support from 25-26% of voters, making it one of the strongest parties in Germany. Internally, the AfD leadership delayed the release of its new foundational program from 2025 to 2027, with party insiders stating the reason was to avoid public debate on contentious issues and internal party conflict ahead of state elections in 2026. In the public sphere, demonstrations protesting the AfD and right-wing extremism were held across multiple German cities on May 1, 2025. Earlier, in February 2025, a rally in Hachenburg demanding a ban on the AfD drew approximately 1,200 participants.\n\nIn January 2025, a cross-party group of 124 lawmakers in the German Bundestag, led by CDU politician Marco Wanderwitz, submitted a motion to initiate a party ban procedure against the AfD at the Federal Constitutional Court. The Bundestag debated this motion, along with a related motion from the Green party to assess the chances of such a procedure's success, on January 30, 2025. While a group of 17 constitutional law experts issued a statement supporting the proposal and asserting the AfD is unconstitutional, reports from the time indicated that no immediate decisions were expected from the debate and that the motion lacked majority support.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Less than two months (The question closes on July 1, 2025).",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No. The AfD remains a legal political party, and the debate over a potential ban continues without a formal legal process being initiated or concluded.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "The Bundestag, Bundesrat, or the federal government do not file an application with the Federal Constitutional Court to ban the AfD. Alternatively, even if such an application were filed, the legal proceedings would take far longer than the two months remaining, and the court would not issue a final ruling before July 1, 2025.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "A catastrophic and politically explosive event provides irrefutable proof that the AfD is actively working to violently overthrow the German government. This forces an immediate consensus among political leaders to file for a ban. In an unprecedented move, the Federal Constitutional Court expedites the case under an emergency procedure and issues a ruling to ban the party just before the July 1, 2025 deadline.",
    "rationale": "My forecast is based primarily on the extremely high procedural and temporal barriers to banning a political party in Germany, which make a ban by July 1, 2025, a near impossibility. \n\nFirst, the legal process is lengthy and has not even begun. Information provided indicates that as of early May 2025, no formal application to ban the AfD had been filed with the Federal Constitutional Court. The process requires such an application to be filed by the Bundestag, Bundesrat, or the federal government. Following that, the court itself undertakes a thorough judicial review that, based on historical precedent like the failed NPD ban case, takes years, not weeks. With less than two months until the deadline, the timeline for a definitive court ruling is not credible. \n\nSecond, the political will to initiate a ban is not consolidated. While a motion to start proceedings was debated in the Bundestag in January 2025, it reportedly lacked majority support at the time. Banning a party with 25-26% support in the polls, as the AfD currently has, would be a politically monumental and divisive step that key decision-makers are hesitant to take.\n\nThird, historical precedent shows that banning a party is an extremely rare event, with only two cases in post-WWII Germany and a high-profile failure in 2017 against the NPD. The legal bar is exceptionally high. \n\nMy probability is not lower than 1% because an unforeseeable 'black swan' event could theoretically accelerate the political will and trigger an emergency legal process, though this is extremely unlikely. My probability is not higher because it would require ignoring the near-insurmountable procedural timeline, the lack of political consensus, and the high legal bar established by precedent. For me to increase my forecast, an application would need to be formally filed with the court, and the court would have to announce an unprecedented, expedited schedule for its ruling.",
