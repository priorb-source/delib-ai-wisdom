  "information": "In February 2025, South Africa's National Treasury reported that the country had addressed or largely addressed 20 of its 22 FATF action items, with the remaining two expected to be resolved by June 2025. The goal is to facilitate an exit from the grey list by October 2025. In West Africa, a May 2025 meeting of the GIABA Ministerial Committee noted that Senegal had exited the FATF grey list in October 2024. However, four other regional members—Nigeria, Mali, Burkina Faso, and Côte d'Ivoire—remain on the grey list, with Nigeria's government stating an aim to be removed by the end of May 2025.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Approximately one month. The FATF Plenary meeting is in June 2025, and the results are typically published at its conclusion.",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No. The list of 'High-Risk Jurisdictions subject to a Call for Action' remains unchanged, consisting of North Korea, Iran, and Myanmar.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "The FATF reviews the current black-listed jurisdictions (North Korea, Iran, Myanmar) and concludes that they have not made sufficient progress on their strategic deficiencies to warrant removal. Simultaneously, no other jurisdiction's situation is deemed to have deteriorated to the point of requiring a 'call for action', so the list remains static.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "A jurisdiction currently on the FATF 'grey list' demonstrates a significant lack of political will to implement its action plan, leading the FATF to escalate its status. This results in the country being added to the 'black list' as a non-cooperative jurisdiction, resolving the question as 'Yes'.",
    "rationale": "My forecast is based on the significant inertia of the FATF 'black list'. Changes to this list are infrequent and typically driven by major, long-term shifts in a country's political and institutional framework, which are not evident for the current members.\n\n1.  **Status Quo Predominance**: The jurisdictions currently on the black list—North Korea, Iran, and Myanmar—are there for deep-seated, systemic reasons. North Korea and Iran have been on the list for extended periods due to persistent lack of compliance and geopolitical factors. Myanmar was added in October 2022 following the 2021 military coup, and its political situation makes rapid progress toward compliance highly improbable. Therefore, a removal is extremely unlikely.\n\n2.  **High Bar for Additions**: Adding a country to the black list is the FATF's most serious step, reserved for jurisdictions that are actively non-cooperative. Countries on the 'grey list', such as those mentioned in the research assistant's report (South Africa, Nigeria), are by definition already cooperating with the FATF to address their deficiencies. Escalation from grey to black is rare and would require a complete breakdown in this cooperation, for which there are currently no public indicators.\n\n3.  **Irrelevance of Provided Data**: The research assistant's report focuses on countries on the 'grey list' aiming for removal from that list. This indicates progress and cooperation, making them less, not more, likely to be escalated to the 'black list'. The data does not provide any evidence supporting a potential change to the black list.\n\n**Why the probability is not lower**: While unlikely, an addition remains a possibility in the current volatile geopolitical climate. A sudden political event in a grey-listed country or a strategic decision by the FATF to increase pressure on a nation like Russia (whose membership is suspended but is not black-listed) could lead to an unexpected addition. This non-zero chance prevents a forecast closer to 0%.\n\n**Why the probability is not higher**: The high bar for adding or removing countries, combined with the lack of any credible candidates for such a change ahead of the June 2025 plenary, means the status quo is overwhelmingly the most probable outcome. For the probability to be higher, there would need to be public reports or strong indications from FATF members that a specific country's status is under serious review for escalation.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill any jurisdictions be added to or removed from the FATF \"black list\" following the FATF Plenary meeting in June 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nWikipedia: [Financial Action Task Force blacklist](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Financial_Action_Task_Force_blacklist)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if following its June 2025 plenary, the Financial Action Task Force (FATF) has made any changes to its \"High-Risk Jurisdictions subject to a Call for Action\" list, which at the time of this question consists of North Korea, Myanmar and Iran. Resolves according to the [official list](https://www.fatf-gafi.org/en/countries/black-and-grey-lists.html).\n\nThe question may resolve according to [credible sources](https://www.metaculus.com/help/faq/#definitions) in case the website is unavailable or not timely updated.\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nIn February 2025, South Africa's National Treasury reported that the country had addressed or largely addressed 20 of its 22 FATF action items, with the remaining two expected to be resolved by June 2025.

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
