  "information": "Anthropic's historical release cadence for major versions shows a lengthening gap: approximately 5 months between Claude 1 (March 2023) and Claude 2 (July 2023), and approximately 8 months between Claude 2 and Claude 3 (March 2024). Previous numbered Claude models have been made available to paid web users and via API within 48 hours of their announcement, without a public waitlist.\n\nAccording to reports from Cursor-IDE (May 15) and ZDNet (May 16), a next-generation Anthropic model codenamed 'Claude Neptune' completed its red-team testing phase on May 18.

In the past, Anthropic has used internal codenames that later became part of public branding, such as the codename 'Asimov' for the models released as the Claude 3 family.\n\nA February 2025 report from Sina Finance described plans for Claude 4 to be a hybrid model combining a general-purpose model with a reasoning model, which would allow users to adjust the computational resources used for a given task.

  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Approximately 45 days remain until the July 1, 2025 deadline",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No - Claude 4 is not currently available to the general public, and if nothing changes before July 1, 2025, this would remain the case",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Anthropic delays the release of Claude 4 beyond July 1, 2025 due to extended testing, safety concerns, or strategic timing decisions. Alternatively, they release the next-generation model under a different naming convention (e.g., 'Claude Neptune' or 'Claude 3.5 Opus') that doesn't include both 'Claude' and '4' in the name. Or they initially release with a waitlist or early access program that extends past the deadline.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "The 'Claude Neptune' model that reportedly completed red-team testing on May 18, 2025 is publicly announced and released as 'Claude 4' in late May or early June, following Anthropic's historical pattern of making numbered releases available to the general public within 48 hours of announcement without waitlists, thereby meeting the July 1 deadline with time to spare.",
    "rationale": "The most compelling evidence is the specific reporting from Cursor-IDE and ZDNet about 'Claude Neptune' completing red-team testing on May 18, 2025 (just 2 days from now) with a targeted general availability in late May or early June. This timeline would comfortably meet the July 1 deadline if accurate. Anthropic's historical pattern strongly supports rapid general availability - both Claude 2 and Claude 3 were made available within 48 hours of announcement without waitlists. The 14-month gap since Claude 3's March 2024 release is significantly longer than previous version gaps (5 months, then 8 months), suggesting a major release is overdue. However, several critical uncertainties temper my confidence: First, the naming requirement is strict - the model must include both 'Claude' and '4'. While 'Asimov' became Claude 3, there's no guarantee 'Claude Neptune' will be branded as Claude 4 rather than Claude 3.5, Claude Opus 2, or some other designation. Second, while 'later in 2025' from multiple sources is consistent with a May-June release, it could just as easily mean Q3 or Q4. Third, even minor delays common in tech releases could push past our tight 45-day window. Fourth, any initial waitlist or early access period, even brief, would disqualify it under the resolution criteria. My forecast is not higher because: (1) the naming uncertainty is substantial - we have no confirmation that Neptune equals Claude 4; (2) 45 days is a narrow window with little margin for typical tech delays; (3) the resolution requires fully general availability, not just announcement. My forecast is not lower because: (1) the Neptune reports are specific, credible, and near-term; (2) Anthropic's track record shows rapid general releases; (3) the extended gap since Claude 3 suggests readiness for a major release. I would update higher with: confirmation that Claude Neptune will be branded as Claude 4, an official announcement with a specific pre-July date, or Anthropic statements indicating imminent release. I would update lower with: delays to Neptune's testing completion, announcements of extended safety reviews, or any indication the next release will use different branding.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill Claude 4 be available to the general public before July 1, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nPromptLayer: [Everything we know: Claude 4](https://blog.promptlayer.com/claude-4/)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if a member of the general public can access Anthropic's Claude 4 model without first joining a waitlist or participating in an early access or testing phase. If Anthropic does not release Claude 4 before July 1, 2025, this question resolves as **No**.\n\nThe resolution will rely on [credible sources](https://www.metaculus.com/help/faq/#definitions), including that it may rely on the ability of Metaculus employees to access Claude 4. \"Access\" may be via API, the Anthropic website, or any other method that allows interaction with Claude 4. Models that do not include both \"Claude\" and \"4\" in the name will not be considered for resolution of this question.\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nAnthropic's historical release cadence for major versions shows a lengthening gap: approximately 5 months between Claude 1 (March 2023) and Claude 2 (July 2023), and approximately 8 months between Claude 2 and Claude 3 (March 2024).
