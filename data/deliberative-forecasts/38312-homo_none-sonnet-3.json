    "review": "All three forecasters arrived at remarkably similar probabilities (15-18%), indicating strong consensus on the key factors. The convergence is reassuring - we all independently identified the same critical elements: the June 3rd date, the absence of an invitation despite other countries being invited, Canada-India diplomatic tensions over the Nijjar case, and the extremely tight timeline for summit logistics. Forecaster 3's explicit mention of India's participation pattern (UK 2021, Germany 2022, Japan 2023) is valuable context that strengthens the argument that this exclusion appears deliberate rather than accidental. Forecaster 2's emphasis on security and logistical planning requirements further reinforces the implausibility of a last-minute attendance. All three analyses acknowledge the theoretical possibility of rapid diplomatic shifts while recognizing the overwhelming evidence against attendance. The update conditions mentioned by Forecaster 2 (60-80% if invitation emerges soon, near 0% if summit proceeds without India) align with my thinking. No forecaster has raised compelling arguments that challenge the 15-18% range.",
    "rationale": "The consensus analysis across all three forecasters reinforces my initial assessment. The key factors remain: (1) We are already in June with no invitation extended, (2) Canada has deliberately invited other nations while excluding India, (3) Canada-India diplomatic relations are severely strained since 2023, (4) G7 summits require extensive advance planning that makes last-minute attendance extremely difficult, and (5) the historical pattern of India's regular participation in recent summits (2021-2023) makes this exclusion appear intentional. The 15% probability appropriately captures the small but non-zero possibility that diplomatic circumstances could shift rapidly or that information about an invitation hasn't yet become public. However, the weight of evidence - particularly the timing and Canada's explicit invitations to other countries - makes Modi's attendance highly unlikely. The convergence of all three independent forecasts in the 15-18% range increases my confidence that this probability range correctly weights all available information. I see no reason to adjust my forecast.",
