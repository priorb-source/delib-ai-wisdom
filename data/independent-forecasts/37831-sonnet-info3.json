  "information": "The international community has widely condemned the dissolution of political parties in Mali. The UN High Commissioner for Human Rights, Volker Türk, publicly called on the Malian authorities to reverse the decision. Both Amnesty International and the United Nations have characterized the junta's actions as an attack on freedom of expression and association. The African Union (AU) has been called upon to mediate and support dialogue to restore democratic processes, in line with the African Charter on Democracy, Elections and Governance. This international pressure comes after Mali previously announced its withdrawal from the regional bloc ECOWAS.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Approximately 40 days, from May 22, 2025 to July 1, 2025",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No - The military government maintains its decision to dissolve all political parties",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "The Malian military junta, having issued the dissolution decree on May 13, maintains its position despite international condemnation. The government views the measure as necessary for national stability and continues to consolidate power. Having already withdrawn from ECOWAS, the junta proves willing to weather external criticism and maintains the ban through July 1, 2025.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Intense international pressure from the UN, African Union, and regional actors, possibly combined with threatened or actual economic sanctions and/or unexpected internal unrest, forces the junta to reconsider. The AU successfully mediates, and by late June 2025, the government announces it will allow political parties to reform, framing this as a measured return to democratic processes while maintaining some control over the transition.",
    "rationale": "The base rate for military governments reversing major political decisions within 40 days is extremely low. Several factors strongly favor a No outcome: (1) The decree was issued only 9 days ago, making a rapid reversal highly unlikely as it would severely undermine the junta's credibility and authority; (2) Mali has already demonstrated willingness to resist international pressure by withdrawing from ECOWAS; (3) Military governments that dissolve political institutions typically maintain such restrictions for extended periods, often years, not weeks; (4) There are no current reports of wavering or reconsideration by Malian authorities. The research assistant's report confirms significant international condemnation from the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights, Amnesty International, and calls for AU mediation, but such pressure typically takes months or years to produce results, not 40 days. Historical precedent shows that authoritarian governments rarely reverse course this quickly after taking dramatic steps. Why not lower than 4%: The international pressure is real and could theoretically intensify rapidly through sanctions or other measures. The AU mediation efforts could potentially succeed faster than expected. There's a small possibility the junta miscalculated consequences and might make a tactical retreat. Why not higher: The extremely compressed 40-day timeline makes meaningful reversal highly improbable. No evidence yet exists of internal debate or reconsideration. Mali's prior defiance of ECOWAS suggests resilience to external pressure. To update higher, I would need: clear signals from Malian officials suggesting reconsideration, major sanctions with specific reversal demands, significant internal protests, or concrete AU mediation progress. To update lower, I would need: strong reaffirmation of the dissolution, additional repressive measures, or explicit rejection of mediation.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nBefore July 1, 2025, will the government of Mali reverse its decision to dissolve all political parties?\n\nQuestion background:\n[Mali's Military Government Shuts Down All Political Parties](https://www.legit.ng/world/africa/1654992-malis-military-government-shuts-political-parties/)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if the government of Mali announces a reversal of its May 13, 2025 presidential decree dissolving all political parties in the country.\n\nA partial reversal, such as allowing the reinstatement of a limited number of parties, will only count as long as new parties are generally allowed to be formed again.\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nThe international community has widely condemned the dissolution of political parties in Mali.

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
