  "information": "Following its plenary meeting in Paris from February 17-21, 2025, the Financial Action Task Force (FATF) announced no changes to its 'black list' of High-Risk Jurisdictions subject to a Call for Action, which continues to include North Korea, Iran, and Myanmar. During the same plenary, Laos and Nepal were added to the 'grey list' of jurisdictions under increased monitoring, while the Philippines was removed. The FATF also maintained the suspension of Russia's membership, which has been in place since February 2023, without adding the country to either the grey or black lists.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Approximately one month, with the outcome expected following the FATF Plenary in late June 2025.",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No. The FATF 'black list' would remain unchanged, consisting of North Korea, Iran, and Myanmar.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "The FATF concludes its June 2025 Plenary and announces that the list of 'High-Risk Jurisdictions subject to a Call for Action' remains unchanged. This reflects a consensus that the strategic deficiencies in North Korea, Iran, and Myanmar persist, and no other jurisdiction warrants inclusion on the list.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Following its June 2025 Plenary, the FATF adds a new jurisdiction to the 'black list'. This might occur due to a significant geopolitical escalation compelling members to act, for instance regarding Russia, or if a grey-listed country demonstrates a complete and persistent failure to address its deficiencies. A removal, while theoretically possible, is extremely unlikely.",
    "rationale": "My forecast is based on the significant inertia of the Financial Action Task Force's (FATF) 'black list'. Changes to this list are rare events, as the criteria for addition or removal are extremely stringent. The list has remained static since Myanmar was added in October 2022, and the February 2025 plenary, as noted in the provided information, saw no changes to this specific list.\n\n1. Likelihood of Removals: The probability of any of the three currently listed jurisdictions (North Korea, Iran, Myanmar) being removed is near zero. North Korea is a perpetually non-compliant state. Iran's political impasse regarding key international conventions remains. Myanmar's internal conflict and political instability are major obstacles to making the required progress on its AML/CFT action plan.\n\n2. Likelihood of Additions: Adding a new country is the only plausible, yet still very unlikely, route to a 'Yes' outcome. The bar for blacklisting is exceptionally high. While Russia's membership remains suspended, the FATF has consistently refrained from the more drastic step of blacklisting, a stance reaffirmed just a few months ago in February 2025. Moving a country from the 'grey list' to the 'black list' is also a very rare and slow process, and there are no strong indications that any grey-listed country is currently on that trajectory for the June meeting.\n\nMy probability forecast is not higher because of this strong institutional inertia and the high political bar for making changes. The short timeframe until the June plenary further reduces the likelihood of a shift. My forecast is not zero to account for the small but persistent chance of a surprise geopolitical event that could force the FATF's hand. I would raise my forecast if high-level diplomatic sources indicated a strong push from key member states to blacklist a country before the plenary.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill any jurisdictions be added to or removed from the FATF \"black list\" following the FATF Plenary meeting in June 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nWikipedia: [Financial Action Task Force blacklist](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Financial_Action_Task_Force_blacklist)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if following its June 2025 plenary, the Financial Action Task Force (FATF) has made any changes to its \"High-Risk Jurisdictions subject to a Call for Action\" list, which at the time of this question consists of North Korea, Myanmar and Iran. Resolves according to the [official list](https://www.fatf-gafi.org/en/countries/black-and-grey-lists.html).\n\nThe question may resolve according to [credible sources](https://www.metaculus.com/help/faq/#definitions) in case the website is unavailable or not timely updated.\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nFollowing its plenary meeting in Paris from February 17-21, 2025, the Financial Action Task Force (FATF) announced no changes to its 'black list' of High-Risk Jurisdictions subject to a Call for Action, which continues to include North Korea, Iran, and Myanmar.

The FATF also maintained the suspension of Russia's membership, which has been in place since February 2023, without adding the country to either the grey or black lists.\n\nToday is 2025-05-19.\n\nBefore answering you think:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n(e) You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
