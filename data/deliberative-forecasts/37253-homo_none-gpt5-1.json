    "review": "Both forecasters reinforce the short-window logic and the lack of fresh, credible pre-test indicators. New/useful points I hadn’t explicitly weighed: (1) translating a plausible annual hazard into a two‑month hazard (implying only a few percent absent acute triggers), (2) the Korean War anniversary on June 25 as a plausible provocation date, and (3) the idea that DPRK may opt for alternative provocations (e.g., a space launch) in June, which would substitute away from a nuclear test. They also note that spring allied exercises have already passed without a test, trimming near-term risk. I find this reasoning generally convincing and it suggests my prior 12% was a bit high for a 61‑day window with no imminent indicators.",
    "rationale": "I keep the structure of my prior view (site readiness, geopolitical cover, and incentives keep the probability non‑trivial; seven-plus years of restraint and lack of current signals keep it low) but weight the short-window math and the passed exercise window more. The June 25 date is a specific, plausible trigger, but a single date within 61 days does not lift the overall odds much without corroborating signals. Given no satellite imagery reports of final preparations, no allied public warnings, and no DPRK state-media foreshadowing, I lower slightly. I stay above 6% because readiness has been maintained since 2022, Russia ties likely reduce punishment risk, and a late-June political decision remains possible. Net: down from 12% to 9%.",
