  "information": "An executive order signed on March 7, 2025, aims to limit eligibility for the Public Service Loan Forgiveness (PSLF) program by altering the definition of 'public service'. The order directs the Department of Education and the Treasury Department to propose regulatory changes to make certain public-sector employees ineligible. Additionally, a provision within the House GOP's 2025 tax bill would grant the U.S. Treasury Secretary the authority to revoke the tax-exempt status of non-profits designated as 'terrorist supporting organizations,' which would disqualify their employees from the PSLF program.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Approximately 48 days (from May 14, 2025 to July 1, 2025)",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No - the objective remains marked as 'in progress' and does not reach 'complete' status by July 1, 2025",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "The regulatory changes directed by the March 7 executive order remain under review or face legal challenges. The House GOP tax bill either fails to pass or its implementation is delayed. The tracker maintainers continue to classify the objective as 'in progress' because the program, while restricted, has not been fully terminated. Administrative processes and potential court injunctions slow implementation beyond the July 1 deadline.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "The Department of Education and Treasury Department rapidly finalize and implement the regulatory changes from the March 7 executive order. The House GOP tax bill passes and the Treasury Secretary begins revoking tax-exempt status for targeted non-profits, effectively eliminating PSLF eligibility for their employees. The tracker maintainers determine these actions constitute sufficient termination of the program and update the status to 'complete' before July 1.",
    "rationale": "This forecast requires careful consideration of timing and what constitutes 'termination' for the tracker maintainers. Key factors: (1) The executive order was signed over 2 months ago (March 7) yet the objective remains 'in progress', suggesting slow implementation or a high bar for 'complete' status. (2) With only 48 days remaining, completing a major federal program termination is challenging even with executive action. Regulatory changes typically require formal notice-and-comment periods, which often take 60-90+ days minimum. (3) The executive order directs regulatory proposals to 'alter the definition' and 'make ineligible' certain employees - this is restriction, not immediate termination. Full termination would likely require either complete regulatory implementation or congressional legislation. (4) The House GOP tax bill provision adds another potential path but faces uncertain passage and implementation timelines. (5) Legal challenges to such changes are highly probable and could delay implementation. The status quo strongly favors 'No' - the program has been 'in progress' for over 2 months without reaching completion, and major policy changes rarely move from partial implementation to full termination in under 2 months. However, I don't assign a probability below 20% because aggressive regulatory timelines and a subjective determination by tracker maintainers could potentially classify significant restrictions as 'complete' termination. I don't go higher than 30% because federal administrative processes, even expedited ones, typically take longer than 48 days, and the fact that 2+ months post-executive order it remains 'in progress' suggests substantial work remains. For me to update higher: final regulations published, clear legislative passage, or announcements of imminent program closure. To update lower: legal injunctions, explicit timeline extensions, or news of regulatory delays.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill the Project 2025 Tracker spreadsheet have the objective of terminating the Public Service Loan Forgiveness program marked as complete before July 1, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nAt the time of this question, the objective was marked as \"in progress.\" The 2025 Tracker is a project of the Keep_Track subreddit and is explained [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/Keep_Track/comments/1ii7tbr/project_2025_tracker_is_now_live/).\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if the Project 2025 objective to \"terminate the Public Service Loan Forgiveness program\" is marked as complete according to [this spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1QGG6wNHna-1tt91yXNkOauAJJ7snobFjfEnmxlmzhl4/edit?gid=0#gid=0) before July 1, 2025. If it is anything other than complete (such as \"in progress\") when accessed by Metaculus on or after July 1, 2025, then the question resolves as **No**.\n\n\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nAn executive order signed on March 7, 2025, aims to limit eligibility for the Public Service Loan Forgiveness (PSLF) program by altering the definition of 'public service'.

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
