    "review": "The other two forecasters and I are in strong agreement on the core drivers of this question. We all identified the conclusion of the regular legislative session and the recent withdrawal of the comprehensive bill (CS/HB 1381) as the most significant evidence in favor of a 'No' resolution. We also all agree that the Republican supermajority and a supportive governor create a constant, non-zero possibility of a 'Yes' outcome. Forecaster 3's analysis was particularly insightful, adding two key points I hadn't fully weighed: 1) A detailed breakdown of the specific procedural avenues for a 'Yes' outcome, including the legislature's ability to expand the special session's agenda with a two-thirds vote, which the GOP possesses. 2) The potential for litigation risk (e.g., NVRA preemption) to be a strategic reason for leadership's caution, explaining why the bill was withdrawn rather than just failing. This reasoning is highly convincing as it adds valuable procedural and strategic context.",
    "rationale": "My initial forecast was primarily based on the legislative calendar; with the regular session over and the key bill withdrawn, the path to 'Yes' is difficult. The analysis from the other forecasters, especially Forecaster 3, has prompted a slight update. While I still believe the withdrawal of CS/HB 1381 is the strongest signal, I was likely underweighting the procedural power of the Republican supermajority. The fact that they can expand the scope of the upcoming special budget session themselves with a two-thirds vote—a threshold they can meet—means the barrier is one of political will, not an insurmountable procedural hurdle. This slightly increases the chances that leadership could decide to act before the deadline if they perceive a political need. This new information about the specific mechanisms available to the legislature warrants a small increase in my forecast to better reflect this possibility. I am moving my forecast from 15% to 18%, bringing it into alignment with the other experts, as their reasoning on this point has persuaded me.",
