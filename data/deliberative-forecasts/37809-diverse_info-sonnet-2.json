    "review": "Both forecasters provide critical information I lacked. Forecaster 2's analysis is particularly detailed, revealing that Aaron Judge is currently at ~.401 with a BABIP of .481 (vs career .344) and xBA of .362. This is crucial: someone IS already at .400, which I didn't know when making my initial forecast. Forecaster 2's mathematical approach—calculating that Judge needs roughly 45/112 hits over the next ~112 AB, with probability ranging from 5-20% depending on his true talent level—is more rigorous than my base-rate approach.\n\nForecaster 3 claims Freeman leads at .375, contradicting Forecaster 2's Judge data. Forecaster 2's analysis appears more current and detailed.\n\nThe Arraez precedent both cite (at .401 on June 23, 2023, falling to .392 by July 1) is particularly instructive—it shows that being above .400 in late June doesn't guarantee reaching July 1 at .400, reinforcing regression concerns.\n\nHowever, I find both forecasters' 14-15% estimates slightly optimistic given: (1) the 25+ year drought is an extremely strong prior, (2) the Arraez example demonstrates how quickly regression occurs even in late June, and (3) Judge's BABIP/xBA gap strongly signals imminent regression. While someone being at .401 currently is significant new information requiring an upward revision from my 6%, the historical base rate and regression mechanics suggest somewhat more caution than 14-15%.",
    "rationale": "I am updating my forecast upward from 6% to 11% based on the critical new information that Aaron Judge is currently batting approximately .401. This fundamentally changes the question from 'will someone reach .400 by July 1' to 'will someone already at .400 maintain it for 6 more weeks.'\n\nThe case for updating upward: Judge's current .401 average means we're not speculating about someone achieving an unlikely breakthrough—someone is already there. With 110-120 AB remaining until July 1, there's room for positive variance. Forecaster 2's calculation showing 5-20% probability depending on assumptions about Judge's true talent provides a reasonable quantitative framework.\n\nThe case for restraint in my update: The 25+ year historical drought remains powerful evidence. The BABIP/xBA gap (.481 vs .362) strongly indicates regression is coming. Most importantly, the Arraez example shows that being at .401 on June 23 led to falling below .400 by July 1—and we still have an extra week beyond that timeframe. This suggests that even players at .400 in late June typically regress below it by July 1.\n\nMy 11% forecast reflects: (1) meaningful upward revision acknowledging Judge's current performance, (2) appropriate weight on the statistical regression signals, (3) respect for the extremely strong 25+ year base rate, and (4) slightly more conservative positioning than the other forecasters given the historical evidence and the specific Arraez precedent showing late-June regression.",
