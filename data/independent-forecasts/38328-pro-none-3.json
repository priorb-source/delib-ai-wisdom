    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "26 days",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "No member of the European Parliament announces their resignation in the specified 21-day window. Any members implicated in the Huawei scandal either weather the political storm with the support of their party, or any potential resignation is delayed until after July 1, 2025, pending further investigation.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Following the European elections, an MEP implicated in the Huawei lobbying scandal faces intense pressure from their national party, their European political group, or the media. To mitigate damage at the start of the new parliamentary term, the MEP announces their resignation between June 10 and June 30, 2025.",
    "rationale": "The baseline probability of any of the 700+ MEPs resigning in a specific three-week period is low. Therefore, the status quo outcome is 'No'. However, the provided context of a Huawei-related lobbying scandal significantly increases this probability. The question's timeframe, immediately following the end of the European elections on June 9, 2025, is a critical factor. Post-election periods are often when political parties address lingering issues to present a 'clean slate' for the new term. An MEP implicated in a scandal would be under maximum pressure to resign at this exact moment to avoid tarnishing their party's image at the outset. The strength of this forecast depends entirely on the severity and public traction of the scandal mentioned in the Euronews article. My forecast is not higher because political scandals often take a long time to unfold, and accused politicians frequently attempt to resist calls for resignation. The window for the announcement (June 10-30) is very narrow, and a resignation could easily fall outside of it. My forecast is not lower because a scandal involving a major global entity like Huawei has the potential to create immense and rapid political pressure, and the post-election timing is a powerful catalyst for forcing a resolution. I would increase my forecast if a major political leader or party officially calls for an implicated MEP's resignation before June 10. I would decrease it if the implicated MEPs receive strong, public backing from their party leadership.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill any members of the European Parliament resign before July 1, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nEuro News: [Lobbying scandal related to Huawei: What we know so far](https://www.euronews.com/my-europe/2025/05/21/lobbying-scandal-related-to-huawei-what-we-know-so-far)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if a member of the European Parliament announces their resignation after June 9, 2025 and before July 1, 2025.\n\n\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nNo additional information available.\n\nToday is 2025-06-05.\n\nBefore answering you think:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n(e) You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
