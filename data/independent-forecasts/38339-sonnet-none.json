    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Approximately 25 days until July 1, 2025",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No - the agreement continues to exist without formal cancellation announcement",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Neither Bulgargaz nor BOTAŞ makes a formal announcement cancelling the agreement before July 1, 2025. Despite ongoing tensions, financial difficulties, and high-level political discussions, the parties continue negotiations or maintain the existing arrangement through the resolution deadline.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Either Bulgaria (through Bulgargaz) or Turkey (through BOTAŞ) formally announces cancellation of the natural gas transmission agreement before July 1, 2025, possibly driven by Bulgargaz's bankruptcy situation or political pressure from Bulgarian leadership seeking to exit the deal.",
    "rationale": "The background information reveals clear tensions: Bulgarian PM Borissov has directly approached Turkish President Erdogan about exiting the Botas deal, and Bulgargaz is reportedly facing bankruptcy due to debts to BOTAŞ. These are significant pressures that could lead to cancellation. However, several factors strongly favor the status quo outcome. First, there are only 25 days remaining until the resolution deadline - a very short window. Second, cancelling international energy agreements typically involves complex legal and diplomatic processes that rarely happen quickly, even under financial distress. Third, my research assistant provided no additional information suggesting an imminent announcement is planned. Fourth, while high-level political engagement indicates seriousness, discussions between leaders don't necessarily translate to immediate formal action. The lack of dated information in the articles means I cannot assess how recent or urgent these tensions are. International gas transmission agreements are critical infrastructure arrangements that parties are typically reluctant to terminate abruptly due to energy security concerns. My forecast is not higher because there's no concrete evidence of imminent action or timeline, and 25 days is an extremely short window for such a consequential decision. My forecast is not lower because the documented financial crisis and high-level political pressure represent real catalysts that could theoretically lead to rapid action. I would revise upward if reports emerged of scheduled meetings specifically to finalize cancellation, official statements indicating imminent action, or legal proceedings to terminate the agreement. I would revise downward if reports indicated ongoing negotiations to restructure the deal or payment plans being discussed.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill the Botas Gas Agreement between Bulgaria and Turkey be cancelled before July 1, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\n[Borissov to Erdogan: Bulgaria Needs Out of the Botas Gas Deal](https://www.novinite.com/articles/232423/Borissov+to+Erdogan%3A+Bulgaria+Needs+Out+of+the+Botas+Gas+Deal) | [Bulgargaz on verge of bankrupty due to debts to Turkish gas company BOTAS: Turkish media](https://www.turkiyetoday.com/business/bulgargaz-on-verge-of-bankrupty-due-to-debts-to-turkish-gas-company-botas-turkish-med-3201881)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if before July 1, 2025, the natural gas transmission agreement between Bulgargaz EAD and BOTAŞ Petroleum Pipeline Corp is announced by either party as being cancelled.\n\nTermination of the agreement by either side, even if denied by the other side, would still count.\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nNo additional information available.\n\nToday is 2025-06-06.\n\nBefore answering you think:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n(e) You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
