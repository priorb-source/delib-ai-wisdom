    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Approximately 6 months, as the election is scheduled to occur on or before October 20, 2025.",
    "status_quo_outcome": "The Conservative Party wins the popular vote. This reflects a continuation of the significant and durable lead they have held in nationwide polling for over a year.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "The incumbent Liberal Party erases the large polling deficit and wins the popular vote. This scenario would likely require a combination of factors: a major, damaging scandal for the Conservative Party, a significant and widely-felt improvement in the economy, and a flawlessly executed Liberal campaign that successfully portrays the Conservative platform as extreme or risky.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "The Conservative Party maintains its current polling advantage through the election campaign. Voter discontent over the cost of living, housing affordability, and inflation, combined with general fatigue after nearly a decade of a Liberal government, results in a decisive popular vote victory for the Conservatives.",
    "rationale": "My forecast is based on the overwhelming and consistent public polling data from the past 12-18 months. As suggested by recent analyses, such as the provided Politico article, the Conservative Party holds a commanding lead of 15 points or more over the incumbent Liberals. This is not a recent or volatile shift, but a stable trend reflecting deep voter dissatisfaction with the status quo on core economic issues like inflation and housing affordability. The Conservative message, centered on these pocketbook issues, has clearly resonated with a large segment of the electorate.\n\nMy probability is not higher than 85 because an election is still approximately six months away, which is a significant amount of time in politics. Unforeseen events, such as a major international crisis or a significant domestic scandal, could alter the political landscape. Furthermore, the Liberal party has historically proven to be resilient and effective during campaign periods, and we cannot entirely discount the possibility of them narrowing the gap as voters' choices become more concrete.\n\nMy probability is not lower because the scale of the Conservative lead is historically large. Overcoming such a deficit in this timeframe would be unprecedented in modern Canadian politics. The core issues driving voter intention are slow-moving economic factors, not easily reversed by government policy in the short term. For the outcome to flip, it would require a political event of a much greater magnitude than a typical campaign gaffe or policy announcement. I would lower my forecast if polling consistently shows the Conservative lead narrowing to single digits. Conversely, I would raise my forecast if the lead holds or widens as the election date nears and the Liberal campaign fails to gain traction.",
