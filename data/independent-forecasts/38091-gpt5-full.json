  "information": "In the first five months of 2025, three countries signed the Artemis Accords: Finland (January 23), Bangladesh (April 8), and Norway (May 15), bringing the total number of signatories to 55. This follows the signings of Panama and Austria in December 2024. In a statement on May 22, 2025, acting NASA Administrator Janet Petro said that NASA anticipates additional countries will sign the accords in the coming weeks and months.\n\nThe United Arab Emirates hosted an international Artemis Accords workshop in Abu Dhabi on May 21-22, 2025. Representatives from over 30 of the 55 signatory countries attended to discuss the implementation of the Accords' principles, including transparency, data sharing, and sustainability in space. In addition, the 2025 Humans to the Moon & Mars Summit (H2M2) was held in Washington, D.C., on May 28-29, bringing together leaders from government, industry, and international space agencies to discuss the future of human space exploration.\n\nAs of late May 2025, there have been no public announcements of a specific country planning to sign the Artemis Accords during the month of June. In a parallel development in international space exploration, China and Russia have announced a joint plan to build a nuclear reactor on the Moon by 2035 to power their International Lunar Research Station (ILRS). The ILRS project is positioned as a rival to the US-led Artemis program and has secured partnerships with 17 countries.",

    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "About 32 days (window: Jun 1–Jun 30, 2025)",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No new signatory in June 2025",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Prospective signings slip to July or later as countries await domestic approvals or choose higher‑profile venues (e.g., fall conferences) or align with other diplomatic calendars; no public ceremonies are scheduled during June despite ongoing discussions.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "A country signs during a June venue such as the UN COPUOS session in Vienna or the Paris Air Show, or via a bilateral event announced on short notice by NASA/US State; plausible candidates include non‑signatory EU states (e.g., Portugal, Hungary, Croatia, Ireland, Malta), additional Middle East/North Africa states, or Southeast Asian partners.",
    "rationale": "- Recent cadence and base rate: Since Dec 2024 there have been five signings (Austria and Panama in Dec 2024; Finland Jan 23; Bangladesh Apr 8; Norway May 15), which is roughly 0.8/month. A simple Poisson model with λ≈0.8/month gives about a 56% chance of at least one signing in any given month. Earlier in 2025 there were two quiet months (Feb, Mar), showing that zero‑signing months are common.\n- Forward‑looking signals: Acting NASA Administrator Janet Petro (May 22) said NASA anticipates additional signings in the coming weeks and months. That language suggests a near‑term pipeline and slightly boosts June odds versus the base rate.\n- June venues: The full UN COPUOS session in Vienna typically occurs in June and has historically been a favorable setting for international space announcements. The Paris Air Show (odd‑year June) is another venue where space/diplomatic MoUs are signed. Either provides a natural stage for an Artemis Accords signing with minimal advance notice.\n- Momentum vs saturation: With 55 signatories, much of the low‑hanging fruit has joined, which dampens the probability that any particular month sees an addition. However, multiple plausible candidates remain across Europe, MENA, and Southeast Asia, and signings are often announced only at the moment of ceremony, so the absence of advance press isn’t very informative.\n- Competitive dynamics: China/Russia’s ILRS effort and its partners may slow some prospects, but it does not preclude signings from US‑aligned or non‑aligned states seeking cooperation optionality.\nWhy not higher: There were recent months with no signings; specific June commitments haven’t been telegraphed; governments may wait for later events or domestic processes.\nWhy not lower: Clear upward momentum in late 2024–2025, explicit NASA guidance about more signings in the “coming weeks,” and June’s strong event calendar (COPUOS, Paris Air Show) that often catalyzes announcements.\nWhat would move me up: Credible reports of a planned June signing, a country’s cabinet authorization hitting the news, a high‑level US visit with a signing ceremony on the schedule, or COPUOS/Paris Air Show agendas hinting at an Accords event.\nWhat would move me down: Signals that targeted candidates are delaying (e.g., parliamentary deferrals), adverse diplomatic developments, or official guidance that the next wave is timed for later (e.g., fall conferences).",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill a country sign the Artemis Accords in June 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nThe most recent signatory was Bangladesh, on April 8, 2025 and [Norway](https://www.state.gov/united-states-welcomes-norways-signing-of-the-artemis-accords/) on May 15, 2025.

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
