  "information": "Multiple Federal Reserve officials have emphasized a patient approach to monetary policy. Fed Chair Jerome Powell stated that the central bank is 'not in a hurry to cut interest rates' and will maintain a 'wait-and-see' approach. Similarly, Fed Governor Adriana Kugler commented that following an agreement to reduce US-China tariffs, the urgency for monetary easing has decreased. The minutes from the January FOMC meeting also indicated that officials decided to hold off on rate cuts until inflation shows more consistent improvement. In March 2025, the Federal Reserve increased its inflation estimate for the year to 2.7% and projected two potential interest rate cuts during 2025.\n\nMajor financial institutions have recently pushed back their timelines for the first interest rate cut. Goldman Sachs adjusted its forecast to expect the first cut in December 2025, a delay from its previous July expectation, citing a stable US economy. Following a stronger-than-expected jobs report, Bank of America also shifted its rate cut expectation from June to July. Morgan Stanley economists now anticipate just one rate cut in 2025, projected for July. A Bloomberg survey of economists also reflects this shift, with the consensus projection for the first Fed rate cut moving from May to July.\n\nRecent economic data and market indicators reflect a mixed economic picture. The US Consumer Price Index (CPI) showed a deceleration in its annual rate. However, the April jobs report indicated a higher-than-expected increase in non-agricultural employment, with the unemployment rate holding at 4.2%. In response to economic developments and Fed communications, market expectations have shifted. Indicators like the CME FedWatch tool show that the perceived likelihood of a rate cut in June has decreased, with many market participants now viewing September or later as the most probable period for the start of an easing cycle.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Approximately 7 weeks until July 1, 2025. The outcome depends on whether the Federal Reserve announces a rate cut at any FOMC meeting between now and June 30, 2025, with the most likely opportunity being the June 2025 FOMC meeting.",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No rate cut before July 1, 2025. The Federal Reserve maintains its current target federal funds rate through the June meeting, continuing its patient 'wait-and-see' approach as explicitly stated by Fed Chair Powell and other officials.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "The Fed continues its stated patient approach through June. Economic data remains mixed with solid employment (unemployment at 4.2%) and inflation still elevated at 2.7%. The Fed waits for more consistent evidence of inflation improvement before cutting, holding rates through any June meeting and making their first cut in July or later, consistent with current forecasts from Goldman Sachs, Bank of America, and Morgan Stanley.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Economic conditions deteriorate sharply in the next 6-7 weeks - unemployment spikes unexpectedly, recession signals emerge, financial markets experience significant stress, or inflation drops dramatically below target. This forces the Fed to abandon its patient stance and implement an emergency or scheduled rate cut at the June FOMC meeting before July 1.",
    "rationale": "The research assistant's report strongly suggests the status quo favors no cut before July 1. Key factors: (1) Fed officials have explicitly stated they are 'not in a hurry' and taking a 'wait-and-see' approach, (2) All major financial institutions have recently pushed their rate cut forecasts to July-December 2025, away from earlier expectations, (3) Recent strong jobs data (unemployment at 4.2%) doesn't signal urgency, (4) The Fed's own March projections estimated inflation at 2.7% with only two cuts expected for all of 2025, (5) Market indicators like CME FedWatch show low probability for June cuts. While there is likely a June FOMC meeting providing an opportunity for a cut, the Fed rarely surprises markets without significant telegraphing, and all signals point toward July or later. The probability isn't lower because: unexpected economic shocks can occur; there is still time and a meeting opportunity; and the Fed has surprised before. The probability isn't higher because: the Fed's recent communications have been consistently patient; economic data doesn't support urgency; and the institutional consensus has converged on July or later. For me to update higher, I'd need: significant labor market deterioration, financial crisis signals, or explicit Fed communication of imminent action. For a lower forecast, I'd need: even more hawkish Fed rhetoric or persistently strong economic data through June.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill the Federal Reserve cut interest rates before July 1, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nJP Morgan: [Following the Fed’s decision to pause rate cuts, what could its next move be?](https://www.jpmorgan.com/insights/global-research/economy/fed-rate-cuts)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if, after the launch of this question and before July 1, 2025 the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) announces a reduction of any amount in the target federal funds rate range.\r\nThe primary resolution source is the FOMC's *target federal funds rate or range* webpage [here](https://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/openmarket.htm), the Federal Reserve's official minutes and statements [here](https://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/fomccalendars.htm), or other [credible sources](https://www.metaculus.com/help/faq/#definitions) in case the Federal Reserve's website is unavailable or not timely updated.\n\nThis question resolves based on the announcement.

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any).
