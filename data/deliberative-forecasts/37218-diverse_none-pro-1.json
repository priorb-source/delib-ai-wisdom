    "review": "Both other forecasters provide a sound general framework for assessing Donald Trump's attendance at UFC events, correctly identifying his relationship with Dana White and the low base rate of attendance as key variables. However, both of their analyses are critically flawed by the same oversight: they failed to identify that UFC 315 is being held in Perth, Australia. Their forecasts of 20% and 30% are based on the premise of an unknown location. Their reasoning is unconvincing in light of this key fact. In fact, Forecaster 3's own logic supports my initial low forecast, as they explicitly state the probability would fall to between 5% and 15% if the event were international. Their analyses, when corrected for this factual error, strongly reinforce my original position rather than challenging it.",
    "rationale": "I am not changing my forecast. My initial analysis was predicated on the single most important variable for this question: the event's location in Perth, Australia. The other two forecasters missed this publicly available information, rendering their higher probability estimates invalid. Their arguments about the low base rate of attendance for any given UFC event actually strengthen my reasoning for a low forecast. The immense logistical, security, and time-commitment challenges of a former US President traveling to Australia for a single sporting event remain the overwhelming factor against attendance. This breaks his established pattern of attending only domestic US events. While his relationship with Dana White is strong, it is not strong enough to overcome the practical barriers of intercontinental travel for this type of appearance. The deliberative process has only increased my confidence in my initial assessment, as the other forecasters' own stated logic, once applied to the correct facts, aligns with my conclusion.",
