    "review": "Forecaster 2 highlights an important downside I underweighted: the NYSE-specific requirement. If Circle lists on Nasdaq, this resolves No even if they go public in June. They also stress the tight calendar and lack of visible milestones (roadshow, pricing window), both of which reasonably pull the odds down. Forecaster 3 argues that the prompt’s explicit NYSE reference likely mirrors Circle’s stated intention and that Q2 timelines are still feasible; that tempers the exchange risk somewhat. I find both arguments credible, but I put only partial weight on the idea that the prompt itself confirms NYSE—without explicit filings or reports, that remains uncertain. Overall, I’m persuaded to incorporate meaningful exchange risk and execution/timing risk, but not to the extent of dropping below 50% given the April coverage implying near-term progress.",
    "rationale": "I’m revising my view primarily for two reasons: (1) Exchange specificity adds a real failure mode. Without firm confirmation of NYSE, a Nasdaq choice would resolve No; and (2) with ~6–7 weeks left and no clear public signs of a launched roadshow or SEC effectiveness, slippage beyond June is plausible. Countervailing this, the April Forbes piece suggests the process is live and Q2 remains possible. Balancing these, I reduce from 70% to 55%: still slightly above even odds due to indications of momentum and a viable June window, but discounted for exchange uncertainty and execution risk under a hard cutoff.",
