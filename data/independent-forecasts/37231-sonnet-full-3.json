  "information": "According to the National Institute of Statistics and Geography (Inegi), Mexico's unemployment rate reached a historic low of 2.2% in March 2025. This was a decrease from 2.3% in March 2024 and 2.5% in February 2025. The total number of unemployed individuals was 1.4 million. The economically active population (PEA) was reported at 61.1 million, with a participation rate of 59.3%. In contrast, the informal labor sector accounted for 54.4% of the workforce, and the number of underemployed individuals—those needing to work more hours—rose to 3.9 million, representing 6.6% of the employed population.\n\nThe International Monetary Fund (IMF) projects a 0.3% economic contraction for Mexico in 2025, citing the effects of tariffs imposed by the United States on key Mexican products. The IMF also predicts Mexico's unemployment rate will increase from 2.8% to 3.8% during 2025. Separately, the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) forecasts Mexico's economy will grow by 1.3% in 2025 and 0.6% in 2026, though these projections are conditional on the tariff situation. The U.S. has imposed tariffs of 25% on key Mexican products like autos, steel, and plastics.\n\nMexican President Claudia Sheinbaum has publicly rejected the International Monetary Fund's (IMF) prediction of a 0.3% economic contraction in Mexico for 2025. She stated that the economic models of the Ministry of Finance contradict the IMF's projection and that the government has a strategic plan, known as 'Plan México', to reactivate and strengthen the national economy. As part of this strategy, the president has called on commercial banks to reduce interest rates to promote economic growth.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Approximately 2-3 weeks. Since today is April 29, 2025, the April unemployment data will likely be published by Mexico's National Institute of Statistics and Geography (Inegi) in mid to late May 2025, following their typical release schedule.",
    "status_quo_outcome": "Yes - unemployment remains under 3%. The most recent data shows Mexico's unemployment rate at a historic low of 2.2% in March 2025, which is 0.8 percentage points below the 3% threshold.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "US tariffs cause rapid manufacturing layoffs, particularly in the automotive sector, resulting in unemployment jumping by at least 0.8 percentage points within a single month to reach or exceed 3% in April 2025. This would represent an unusually sharp one-month deterioration.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Mexico's labor market maintains its resilience through April, with unemployment remaining steady or increasing only marginally from the March level of 2.2%. The 54.4% informal sector provides some absorption capacity, and the full impact of US tariffs takes longer than one month to materialize in official unemployment statistics.",
    "rationale": "The status quo strongly favors a Yes outcome. Mexico's unemployment was at 2.2% in March 2025, providing a substantial 0.8 percentage point buffer below the 3% threshold. The recent trend has been downward (from 2.5% in February to 2.2% in March). For a No outcome, unemployment would need to spike dramatically in just one month - this type of rapid deterioration is historically rare outside of major economic crises. While US tariffs of 25% on autos, steel, and plastics pose genuine economic risks, and the IMF predicts unemployment rising from 2.8% to 3.8% during 2025, such policy impacts typically take several months to fully materialize in labor market data. The one-month timeframe works in favor of status quo persistence. The Mexican government is also actively implementing countermeasures through 'Plan México.' The main downside risk is if the tariff impact was more immediate than typical, causing accelerated job losses in manufacturing. However, the informal sector (54.4% of workforce) may provide some shock absorption. My forecast is not higher (closer to 95%+) because there is genuine economic uncertainty and tariff-related headwinds. It's not lower because monthly unemployment volatility is typically modest, the buffer is substantial, and one month is insufficient time for major structural changes absent a crisis event.",

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower.
