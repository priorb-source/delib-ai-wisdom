    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Approximately 2 months (from May 2, 2025 to July 1, 2025)",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No - the question resolves as No if no qualifying protest is reported",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "No major catalyzing event occurs in the next two months. The political and social landscape remains relatively stable. Any protests that do occur remain below the 10,000 participant threshold or are not captured by the Global Protest Tracker. Scheduled events like local demonstrations or rallies fail to reach the required scale.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "A significant triggering event mobilizes mass protest activity - this could include a controversial Supreme Court decision, major policy announcement (immigration, healthcare, abortion), high-profile incident of police violence, international crisis involving US military, or major environmental disaster. Alternatively, a well-organized planned demonstration around existing issues (climate change, abortion rights, immigration, civil rights) successfully mobilizes 10,000+ participants and is documented by the Global Protest Tracker.",
    "rationale": "The United States has demonstrated capacity for large-scale protests in recent years (Women's March 2017, George Floyd protests 2020, various reproductive rights demonstrations), but these typically require either extensive advance planning or significant triggering events. The 2-month timeframe is relatively short, which limits opportunities. Key considerations: The current political environment under Trump's second term includes contentious policy debates on immigration, government reforms, and social issues that could serve as catalysts. May and early June could see demonstrations related to various causes, and Pride events in June sometimes involve protest elements, though these are often celebratory rather than protest-focused. The Global Protest Tracker threshold matters - it must be significant enough for international documentation. Historical base rates suggest large protests (10,000+) occur episodically rather than regularly. Most 2-month periods do not see such protests. However, the US political climate remains polarized, and unexpected events can rapidly mobilize large groups. The status quo deserves substantial weight - absent a major trigger, large protests are unlikely. My forecast is not higher because: (1) Large protests are still relatively rare discrete events, (2) No major catalyzing events are currently scheduled or visible on the horizon, (3) The short timeframe limits opportunities. My forecast is not lower because: (1) The US has proven mobilization capacity, (2) The current political climate is contentious with multiple potential flashpoints, (3) Two months provides adequate time for organization if an event triggers mobilization. I would revise upward if: a major triggering event occurs, organized protests are announced, or political tensions escalate significantly. I would revise downward if: the next several weeks pass without major catalyzing developments or if early protests fail to reach the threshold.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill the Global Protest Tracker report any protests in the United States with 10,000+ participants, before July 1, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nBrookings Institution: [The power of protest in the US](https://www.brookings.edu/articles/the-power-of-protest-in-the-us/)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if the [Global Protest Tracker](https://carnegieendowment.org/features/global-protest-tracker?lang=en) reports a protest in the United States with 10,000 or more participants with a start date after the launch of this question and before July 1, 2025.\n\n\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nNo additional information available.\n\nToday is 2025-05-02.\n\nBefore answering you think:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n(e) You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
