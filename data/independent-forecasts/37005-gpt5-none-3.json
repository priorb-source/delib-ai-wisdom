    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Approximately 6 months (election expected October 2025; could be earlier if called).",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No — the Liberals finish well short of 172 seats.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Current polling environment persists: Conservatives maintain a large national lead, Liberals underperform in Ontario suburbs and much of Atlantic Canada, lose or fail to regain key Quebec seats (especially against the Bloc), and split the progressive vote with the NDP in urban cores. Seat models keep Liberal projections far below majority territory, landing them roughly in the 60–120-seat range.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "A late, nationwide realignment breaks toward the Liberals. Potential catalysts: a leadership change that materially boosts Liberal favorables, a major Conservative scandal or economic shock that reverses the ballot-intent gap, and a re-consolidation of centre-left voters behind the Liberals. They would need to dominate the GTA and other Ontario suburbs, sweep much of Atlantic Canada, reclaim substantial ground in Quebec, and win back many BC swing ridings to push past 172.",
    "rationale": "Baseline conditions strongly favor a No. For over a year, national polling has shown the Conservatives with a substantial lead and Liberal approval well underwater. Under Canada’s FPTP system and current regional dynamics (Bloc strength in Quebec, NDP competition in urban cores, Conservative gains in Ontario and Atlantic Canada), the Liberals’ path to 172 is exceptionally narrow. Contemporary seat models (e.g., 338Canada) in recent months have tended to place Liberals far from majority territory, and reaching 172 would typically require not just parity but a sizable Liberal national lead with highly efficient regional distribution. The world usually changes slowly; absent a major shock, the status quo implies a clear No. Why not higher: To get to 172, the Liberals likely need a double-digit swing in key provinces, a durable national lead, and broad vote consolidation — developments for which there is currently little evidence. Why not lower: Tail risks exist. A major event (leadership change with a strong new leader, significant Conservative misstep, or economic/political crisis) could materially tighten the race. I would update upward if multiple independent polls show the Liberals opening and sustaining a national lead, especially: Ontario Liberal lead >5–10 pts with strong GTA numbers; Quebec Liberal share rising meaningfully against the Bloc; Atlantic Canada re-consolidates behind Liberals; and 338Canada (or similar) moves the Liberal median projection into the 150–160+ range with upside above 172. I would update downward toward near-zero if the Conservative lead remains >10 pts nationally through late summer, Liberal vote share stays depressed in Ontario and Quebec, and seat models’ upper bounds still leave the Liberals well below 172. Research assistant provided no new information; this forecast relies on recent historical polling trends, structural considerations, and model tendencies observed up to now.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill the Liberal Party win 172 or more seats in the 2025 Canadian federal election?\n\nQuestion background:\n[338Canada Federal Projection](https://338canada.com/federal.htm): \"The 338Canada project is a statistical model of electoral projections based on opinion polls, electoral history, and demographic data. This web site is a creation of Philippe J. Fournier, physics and astrophysics professor at Cégep de Saint-Laurent in Montreal.\"\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if the Liberal Party of Canada wins greater than or equal to 172 seats in the [2025 Canadian federal election](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2025_Canadian_federal_election).\n\n\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nNo additional information available.\n\nToday is 2025-04-21.\n\nBefore answering you think:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n(e) You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
