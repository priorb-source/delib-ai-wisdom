    "review": "My initial forecast of 65% was based on the premise that WorldAtlas's decision to update its article title to 'Gulf Of Mexico (Gulf of America)' was a strong leading indicator of a future map update. I interpreted this as a willingness to adapt and a signal of intent. However, both Forecaster 2 and Forecaster 3 presented a compelling counterargument that I had significantly undervalued: the nearly four months of inaction on the map itself. They persuasively re-framed the article title change not as a first step, but as a potential final compromise – a way to acknowledge the new U.S. usage without altering its primary cartographic assets. Their emphasis on the powerful inertia of the centuries-old name, the lack of adoption by other major international publishers like National Geographic, and WorldAtlas's Canadian base (making it less susceptible to U.S. political pressure) was highly convincing. Forecaster 3's point about the higher friction involved in changing a 'legacy/static map asset' versus a simple text title added a practical dimension I had overlooked. These arguments have made it clear that I over-weighted a single piece of positive evidence and under-weighted the substantial evidence favoring the status quo.",
    "rationale": "After reviewing my peers' analyses, I am substantially revising my forecast downward. My initial 65% was too optimistic and failed to properly weigh the evidence of inaction. The key insight from the other forecasters is that the nearly four-month period between the U.S. executive order and now, during which the main North America map has remained unchanged, is a stronger signal than the single update to an article's title. This inaction suggests significant reluctance or a high barrier to changing the map. I now believe the article title change is more likely a minor, sufficient concession rather than a precursor to a larger site-wide update. The combined weight of international controversy, the lack of endorsement from the International Hydrographic Organization, and the precedent of other major publishers not making the change creates a strong environment for maintaining the status quo. As a Canadian entity, WorldAtlas has more incentive to align with international cartographic standards than a unilateral, politically motivated change from a single country, especially with less than two months remaining before the resolution date. The probability is not lower than 25% because the article title change does show an awareness and a potential mechanism (dual-naming) for a change, keeping the possibility open. However, the evidence now strongly suggests this is an unlikely outcome.",
