    "review": "The deliberation reveals a strong consensus among all three forecasters. Both Forecaster 2 and Forecaster 3 presented analyses that align closely with my own, emphasizing the Federal Reserve's overtly patient communication, the shift in institutional and market expectations to July or later, and the lack of urgency from the current economic data. I found their specific emphasis on the structural constraint of having only one FOMC meeting left before the deadline particularly compelling. Forecaster 3's point that the Fed would require a clear 'trend confirmation' of economic weakness, rather than just one or two soft data points, was also a very sharp and convincing argument that reinforces the high bar for a June cut. This argument wasn't absent from my initial thoughts, but hearing it articulated so clearly strengthens its weight in my forecast.",
    "rationale": "After reviewing the other experts' analyses, I am updating my forecast. While their reasoning did not introduce new evidence, it sharpened the existing arguments and convinced me that my initial probability was slightly too high. The consensus forecast of 12% from the other two experts, supported by strong reasoning, prompted me to re-evaluate the weight I placed on a potential rapid economic deterioration. The key factors persuading me to lower my forecast are the stark reality of having only one decision-making meeting left (the June FOMC) and the high evidentiary bar the Fed has set for itself. It would require a significant, unambiguous, and rapid downturn in the upcoming May economic data to compel the committee to abandon its well-telegraphed 'wait-and-see' approach so quickly. The combined force of explicit Fed guidance, market pricing, and the consensus of economists makes a rate cut before July 1 a very low-probability event. Therefore, I am decreasing my forecast from 15% to 12% to reflect a higher degree of confidence in the 'No' outcome.",
