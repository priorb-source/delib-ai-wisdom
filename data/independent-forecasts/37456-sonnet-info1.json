  "information": "On March 28, 2025, Cargill Kitchen Solutions recalled approximately 212,268 pounds of liquid egg products, including items under the Egg Beaters and Bob Evans brands. The recall was due to potential contamination with sodium hypochlorite, a cleaning solution. The affected products were produced on March 12 and 13, 2025, have 'use by' dates in August 2025 and March 2026, and bear the establishment number 'G1804' on the carton. The products were shipped to distributors in Ohio and Texas and for foodservice use in at least six other states, with potential for nationwide distribution.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "55 days (from May 7, 2025 to July 1, 2025)",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No - the recall remains Active",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "The FSIS continues its investigation and verification process beyond July 1, 2025. Product recovery may be incomplete, corrective actions may still be under review, or the agency may be waiting to ensure adequate recall effectiveness before closing the case. The recall status remains listed as Active on the FSIS website when checked on or after July 1, 2025.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "The FSIS completes its verification process, determines the recall has been sufficiently effective, confirms that adequate product has been recovered or accounted for, validates corrective actions by Cargill Kitchen Solutions, and changes the recall status from Active to Closed before July 1, 2025. This would require completing all verification steps within the next 55 days.",
    "rationale": "The recall was issued on March 28, 2025, meaning approximately 40 days have elapsed with the recall still active. This suggests the investigation and verification process is ongoing and complex enough to require more than a month. For the question to resolve as Yes, the entire recall process must be completed within 95 days total (40 days elapsed + 55 days remaining). Key factors working against a quick closure: (1) The affected products have use-by dates extending to March 2026, giving them a long shelf life that complicates recall effectiveness verification; (2) Distribution was to multiple states and included both brand-name retail products (Egg Beaters, Bob Evans) and foodservice channels, creating tracking complexity; (3) The substantial volume (212,268 pounds) across multiple product codes requires thorough verification. Factors that could enable closure: (1) The contamination source is clearly identified (sodium hypochlorite cleaning solution); (2) Products were from a limited production window (March 12-13, 2025); (3) The establishment number provides clear identification. However, USDA/FSIS recalls typically take several months to close, as the agency must verify recall effectiveness, product recovery rates, and implementation of corrective actions. The status quo strongly favors the recall remaining active, as changing to closed status requires deliberate agency action after completing verification protocols. Given that 40 days have passed without closure, and considering typical USDA recall timelines often extend 6-12 months for products with long shelf lives, the probability of closure within the next 55 days is relatively low. I would update higher if news emerged of accelerated product recovery or FSIS statements indicating imminent closure. I would update lower if additional complications arose or if FSIS indicated extended investigation needs.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill the USDA-posted recall by Cargill Kitchen Solutions of its liquid egg product for an unapproved substance issued March 28, 2025 be closed before July 1, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nABC News: [Liquid eggs recalled due to potential cleaning solution contamination](https://abcnews.go.com/GMA/Food/liquid-eggs-recalled-due-potential-cleaning-solution-contamination/story?id=120329600)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if the status of the recall posted by the U.S. Department of Agriculture’s Food Safety and Inspection Service (FSIS) is changed from Active to Closed on [this page](https://www.fsis.usda.gov/recalls-alerts/cargill-kitchen-solutions-recalls-liquid-egg-products-due-unapproved-substance) before July 1, 2025. If the recall is still shown as Active when the link is accessed by Metaculus on or after July 1, 2025, this question resolves as **No**.\n\n\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nOn March 28, 2025, Cargill Kitchen Solutions recalled approximately 212,268 pounds of liquid egg products, including items under the Egg Beaters and Bob Evans brands. The recall was due to potential contamination with sodium hypochlorite, a cleaning solution.

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
