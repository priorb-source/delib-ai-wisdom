    "review": "Both forecasters emphasize Jones’s structural edges: fundraising, cash-on-hand, marquee endorsements, and prior statewide run/infrastructure. I agree those are the most salient signals this close to primary day, and they likely translate into better paid media and GOTV. They also correctly flag the main uncertainty: no polling. I find their probabilities a bit high given the modest COH gap (meaningful but not overwhelming), the outsized importance of NoVA in Democratic primaries, and the potential influence of a major editorial endorsement (e.g., Washington Post) that remains unknown. They don’t materially add new factual inputs beyond reinforcing the strength of Jones’s position, but their weighting of money/endorsements in a two-way, low-information primary is persuasive enough to nudge my estimate up from my initial conservatism.",
    "rationale": "Baseline: I previously had 60%, citing Jones’s advantages (money, endorsements, prior statewide profile) versus uncertainties (no polling, NoVA dynamics, potential late media endorsements, and Taylor’s credible resume as a longtime CA). The deliberation confirms that Jones’s advantages are real and likely to matter most in the final two weeks, especially with early voting underway and limited time for late shifts. While the COH edge isn’t crushing, in a two-candidate statewide primary it likely buys superior coverage in DC and Hampton Roads media plus a stronger field program. That, combined with top-tier endorsements and residual name ID from 2021, makes Jones more than a coin-flip favorite. I’m not as high as 75–77% because: (1) absence of public polling; (2) NoVA turnout can be decisive and Taylor has some meaningful local/legal-establishment credentials; (3) any major editorial endorsement or late negative story could still move a low-info electorate. Update: Up from 60% to 68% to reflect stronger weighting on fundraising/endorsement advantages close to E-day, while retaining a healthy discount for uncertainty without polling and possible NoVA/endorsement swings.",
