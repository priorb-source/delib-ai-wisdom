  "information": "The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) issued a Level 2 \"Practice Enhanced Precautions\" travel notice for yellow fever in South America in April 2025, which includes Colombia. This notice advises travelers to get vaccinated. Historically, the CDC has not elevated yellow fever outbreaks beyond Level 2, even during larger epidemics such as those in Brazil (2017–18, with over 2,000 cases) and Nigeria (2019). Level 3 notices are typically reserved for situations with sustained urban transmission, overwhelmed healthcare capacity, or for diseases where risk cannot be mitigated by standard measures like vaccination.",

    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "About 39 days (until 2025-06-01)",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No — CDC keeps Colombia at Level 2 (Practice Enhanced Precautions).",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "The yellow fever situation in Colombia remains largely sylvatic and geographically limited; vaccination mitigates traveler risk; healthcare capacity is not overwhelmed; CDC maintains a Level 2 notice through June 1, 2025.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "A marked deterioration occurs: credible evidence of sustained urban yellow fever transmission in major Colombian cities, vaccine access shortages that materially limit mitigation for travelers, overwhelmed local health systems, or multiple exported cases to the U.S./abroad; CDC escalates to Level 3 (Avoid Nonessential Travel) or higher before June 1 and it remains >2 when checked on/after June 1.",
    "rationale": "Interpretation: I am following the resolution criterion that resolves Yes if Colombia’s CDC Travel Health Notice is greater than Level 2 on or after June 1, 2025. Historically, CDC uses Level 3 sparingly and reserves it for high, less-mitigable risk (e.g., Ebola, early COVID). For yellow fever, even large recent outbreaks (Brazil 2017–18, Nigeria 2019) were handled at Level 2, because traveler risk is substantially mitigable via vaccination and standard precautions. The research assistant notes CDC issued a Level 2 notice in April 2025 covering South America, including Colombia, and that CDC has not elevated yellow fever outbreaks beyond Level 2 historically. With only ~5.5 weeks until the resolution date, policy inertia plus CDC precedent make an escalation to >2 unlikely absent an unusually severe shift. Status quo carries extra weight: travel notices tend to be sticky over short horizons unless a clear, acute change occurs. What could change this? Documented sustained urban transmission (Aedes-mediated) in a major city, marked healthcare strain, vaccine supply disruptions preventing traveler protection, or notable international spread could prompt a Level 3. None of these are evident in typical yellow fever patterns in the Americas in recent decades; urban cycles have been rare. Why not higher? While there are concerning media reports about economic impacts in Colombia, CDC practice suggests a high bar for Level 3 for yellow fever. The timeline is short, and upgrades are uncommon. Why not lower? A non-zero chance remains: outbreaks can surprise, and CDC can act quickly if risk becomes less mitigable, especially with urban spread or exported cases. What I’d watch to update upward: WHO/PAHO alerts of urban transmission in Bogotá/Medellín/Cali; CDC HAN advisories; vaccine shortage reports; sharp case/death spikes; U.S. traveler cases. To update downward: evidence that cases are plateauing/declining; continued sylvatic pattern; robust vaccination campaigns; lack of international spread. Net: a small tail risk, but the base case is that the notice remains Level 2 by June 1.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill the CDC raise the Travel Health Notice status of Colombia to above level 3 before June 1, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\n[Colombia’s Economic Emergency As Yellow Fever Outbreak Threatens Tourism And Agricultural Exports](https://www.travelandtourworld.com/news/article/colombias-economic-emergency-as-yellow-fever-outbreak-threatens-tourism-and-agricultural-exports/) | CDC: [Travel Health Notices](https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/travel/notices)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if the [Travel Health Notice status of Colombia](https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/travel/destinations/traveler/none/colombia), which is \"Level 2 Practice Enhanced Precautions\" at the time of this question, is a level of greater than 2 when checked by Metaculus on or after June 1, 2025.\n\n\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nThe U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) issued a Level 2 \"Practice Enhanced Precautions\" travel notice for yellow fever in South America in April 2025, which includes Colombia.

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
