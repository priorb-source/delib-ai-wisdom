    "review": "Forecaster 2 raises valid concerns about BBC partnership pressure and the unprecedented scale of political pressure, but fundamentally misreads Glastonbury's institutional character. Claiming Glastonbury is 'highly sensitive' to controversy contradicts the festival's decades-long reputation for embracing politically charged, counter-cultural acts. The comparison to Eden Project and Plymouth Pavilions as precedent is weak - these are fundamentally different entities with different risk tolerances and political identities. The 25% forecast implies only a 1-in-4 chance despite being 33 days out with no announced changes and the band performing elsewhere in the UK.\n\nForecaster 3's analysis is more balanced and methodologically sound. The emphasis on base rates for announced acts, Glastonbury's historical tolerance, and ongoing UK performances as evidence is compelling. Crucially, Forecaster 3 properly weights the resolution criterion allowing a Yes even if one member is barred - this materially lowers the threshold. The 62% forecast is defensible but seems slightly conservative given the status quo strength.\n\nBoth forecasters prompted me to reconsider BBC editorial pressure and the cumulative effect of venue cancellations, which I had underweighted. However, neither convinced me that Glastonbury will act like typical commercial venues.",
    "rationale": "After deliberation, I maintain that status quo bias strongly favors performance, but acknowledge increased downside risk. The BBC partnership does create reputational considerations I initially underweighted - while the BBC has tolerated Glastonbury controversy historically, a terrorism charge is a different category. The volume of political pressure from government ministers is genuinely unprecedented.\n\nHowever, my core analysis remains sound: (1) Glastonbury has a 50+ year reputation for progressive politics and resisting conservative pressure - their brand identity depends on this; (2) changing a major lineup 33 days before the event with no logistical or legal impediment creates its own reputational damage; (3) the band is demonstrably still performing in the UK, showing no immediate legal barrier exists; (4) the resolution criterion is forgiving - even if one member faces restrictions, others can perform as Kneecap.\n\nThe terrorism charge is serious but unlikely to result in detention at a first appearance on June 18. Standard procedure is bail with conditions. Unless those conditions explicitly prohibit public performance (rare), the performance can proceed. The timing creates media pressure but not necessarily a legal barrier.\n\nI'm updating down from 77% to acknowledge BBC considerations and political pressure volume, but not to Forecaster 2's 25% which seems to misread the fundamental question of what kind of institution Glastonbury is. My revised forecast of 71% reflects modest increased downside risk while maintaining that fundamentals favor performance.",
