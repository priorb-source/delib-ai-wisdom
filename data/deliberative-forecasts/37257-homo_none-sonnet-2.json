    "review": "Both forecasters independently arrived at 12% using nearly identical reasoning, which is noteworthy and suggests convergence on calibrated judgment. Their analyses strengthen several points I underweighted: (1) the historical pattern of rhetoric-without-action is even more significant than I initially credited - years of threats with zero actual referendum schedules is a very strong base rate, (2) in a 2-month window, the absence of any signals of imminent action is more telling than I initially considered, and (3) they correctly emphasize that the question requires an official announcement with a specific date, not just rhetoric, which is a meaningful threshold. Their emphasis on severe international consequences as a constraint is also well-taken. However, I still believe they may be slightly underweighting the tail risk given: (1) the genuinely low bar for resolution - this only requires a statement from authorized officials, not actual implementation or legality, (2) the region's demonstrated capacity for sudden escalation, and (3) the reality that 2 months provides sufficient time for a political announcement if leadership chooses to make one. Their identical 12% forecasts using similar logic is persuasive evidence I should move toward their position.",
    "rationale": "After reviewing both analyses, I am updating downward but not fully to their consensus position. The strongest argument for lowering my forecast is the historical pattern: Dodik has made separatist threats for many years without ever officially scheduling an independence referendum. This base rate is more powerful than I initially weighted. Additionally, in a 2-month timeframe, the complete absence of signals suggesting imminent action is more significant than I credited - if plans were advanced, we would likely see some indicators. However, I'm settling at 15% rather than 12% because: (1) the resolution criteria set a very low bar requiring only an announcement of a date, not implementation, (2) genuine geopolitical volatility exists in the region with real separatist sentiment, (3) authorized officials could make such an announcement relatively quickly if motivated by political circumstances, and (4) while unlikely, completely dismissing the possibility in a volatile region over 2 months seems insufficiently cautious. The convergence of two independent forecasters at 12% is strong evidence for moving substantially toward their position, but I maintain a slightly higher estimate to account for tail risk in genuinely unstable situations.",
