  "information": "As of late May 2025, no charges have been filed against James Comey, nor have any warrants or subpoenas been issued in relation to the social media post. Legal experts suggest a prosecution faces significant hurdles due to First Amendment protections and a 2023 Supreme Court ruling that requires prosecutors to prove a subjective intent to threaten. Historically, arresting former FBI directors or other ex-cabinet-level officials is extremely rare in the United States.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "32 days (from May 30, 2025 to July 1, 2025)",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No arrest - James Comey remains free without charges filed",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "The Secret Service investigation continues without resulting in charges. Legal experts' assessment proves correct that First Amendment protections and the 2023 Supreme Court ruling requiring proof of subjective intent to threaten create insurmountable legal barriers. The cryptic nature of the seashell photo is deemed protected political speech. The investigation either concludes without action or remains open but inactive past July 1.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Federal prosecutors determine they have sufficient evidence to prove subjective intent to threaten. They rapidly file charges, obtain a warrant, and execute an arrest within the 32-day window. This would represent an unprecedented acceleration of legal proceedings against a former FBI director, potentially driven by extreme political pressure or discovery of additional incriminating evidence.",
    "rationale": "The status quo strongly favors no arrest. Key factors weighing against arrest: (1) Historical base rate - arresting former FBI directors or cabinet-level officials is extraordinarily rare in US history; (2) Strong legal barriers - First Amendment protections and 2023 Supreme Court ruling requiring subjective intent makes prosecution difficult for cryptic social media posts; (3) Compressed timeline - only 32 days for investigation completion, charges, warrant issuance, and arrest execution when such proceedings typically take months or years; (4) Current status - no charges, warrants, or subpoenas issued as of May 30. The research assistant's report emphasizes legal experts are skeptical of prosecution viability. My forecast is not higher because there IS an active Secret Service investigation, unpredictable political dynamics could theoretically accelerate action, and low-probability events do occasionally occur. My forecast is not lower (not 0-1%) because the investigation is real and ongoing, creating non-zero probability. To update higher, I would need: charges actually filed, statements indicating imminent legal action, or new evidence emerging. To update lower: investigation officially closed, DOJ statement declining prosecution, or legal expert consensus solidifying against viability.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill James Comey be arrested before July 1, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\n[Secret Service Is Asking Comey About a Photo of Seashells Spelling ‘86 47’](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/16/us/politics/secret-service-comey-social-media-trump.html)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if former FBI director James Comey is arrested before July 1, 2025, according to [credible sources](https://www.metaculus.com/faq/#definitions).\n\nIn order to streamline this question's resolution, please note that an arrest anywhere in the world, for any reason, will resolve this question as Yes. For purposes of this question, we define \"arrest\" using the definition [posted at Nolo](https://www.nolo.com/legal-encyclopedia/justifies-arrest-probable-cause.html): \"An arrest requires taking someone into custody, against that person's will, in order to prosecute or interrogate. It involves a physical application of force, or submission to an officer's show of force. In sum, the arrestee must not be free to leave. Whether the act by the police is termed an arrest under state law is not relevant. When deciding whether someone has been arrested, courts apply the 'reasonable man' standard. This means asking whether a reasonable person, in the shoes of the defendant, would have concluded that he or she was not free to leave.\"\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nAs of late May 2025, no charges have been filed against James Comey, nor have any warrants or subpoenas been issued in relation to the social media post.

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
