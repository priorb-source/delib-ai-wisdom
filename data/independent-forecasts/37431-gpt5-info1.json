  "information": "The recall, issued on April 24, 2025, by ACC Central Kitchen LLC, is for approximately 64,000 to 65,000 pounds of frozen pork bun products. The recall is classified as Class I and was initiated due to misbranding and an undeclared sesame allergen. The affected products were produced over an extended period, with some items dating back to November 2023. Distribution was limited to retail locations in New York. There have been no reported illnesses associated with the consumption of these products.",

    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "About 57 days (until 2025-07-01)",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No — the FSIS page still shows the recall as Active on or after July 1, 2025.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Recall effectiveness checks take longer than expected (e.g., due to the long production span back to Nov 2023, volume ~65k lbs, and frozen product lingering in consumer freezers); FSIS requests additional actions or documentation; the recall is expanded or updated; or there is posting lag so the page is not marked Closed by July 1.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "ACC Central Kitchen completes recall notifications and product accounting quickly; FSIS verifies effectiveness without complications and updates the page from Active to Closed in late May or June, before July 1.",
    "rationale": "- What we know: The recall (Class I) was issued April 24, 2025 for ~64–65k lbs of frozen pork buns, misbranding with undeclared sesame. Distribution is limited to retail in New York. No illnesses reported. Today is May 5.\n- Base-rate reasoning: FSIS allergen misbranding recalls commonly close within a few to several weeks once effectiveness checks are completed, though some take a few months. The July 1 deadline is roughly 9–10 weeks after announcement, a window that is often sufficient for closure but not guaranteed.\n- Factors pushing toward Yes (earlier closure): limited geographic distribution (NY only) and no reported illnesses, which typically reduces investigative complexity. Allergen misbranding recalls are straightforward compared with pathogen contamination investigations.\n- Factors pushing toward No (later closure): Class I designation, relatively large volume for a niche product, the long production span back to November 2023, and the frozen nature of the product (more likely to remain in consumers’ freezers). Any scope expansion or documentation gaps can extend timelines. There is also a small risk that the recall is effectively complete but the public page update lags past July 1, which would still resolve as No under the question’s criterion.\n- Status quo anchoring: The current status is Active; without timely closure (or an on-time website update), the outcome is No. Given typical FSIS timelines, I expect a modestly better-than-even chance of closure within the 9–10 week window, but I discount for potential expansion/lag and the complexity from the long production period.\n- What would update me higher: Evidence that FSIS has verified effectiveness (e.g., a Recall Termination/Closure notice or agency communications suggesting completion), retailer lists showing rapid product recovery, or indications that no expansion is needed. If the page shows progress updates without complications by early June, I would move into the 70–80% range.\n- What would update me lower: Any recall expansion, reports of illnesses, discovery of additional misbranding issues, broader distribution than NY, or signs that effectiveness checks are encountering delays. If there’s an expansion or new findings in late May/June, I’d drop toward 30–40%.\n\nGiven these considerations, I put moderate weight on the status quo but still see slightly better-than-even odds for closure before July 1.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill the USDA-posted recall by ACC Central Kitchen LLC of pork bun products issued April 24, 2025 be closed before July 1, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nConsumerAffairs: [Nearly 65,000 pounds of pork buns recalled for undeclared allergen](https://www.consumeraffairs.com/news/nearly-65000-pounds-of-pork-buns-recalled-for-undeclared-allergen-042525.html)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if the status of the recall posted by the U.S. Department of Agriculture’s Food Safety and Inspection Service (FSIS) is changed from Active to Closed on [this page](https://www.fsis.usda.gov/recalls-alerts/acc-central-kitchen-llc-recalls-pork-bun-products-due-misbranding-and-undeclared) before July 1, 2025. If the recall is still shown as Active when the link is accessed by Metaculus on or after July 1, 2025, this question resolves as **No**.\n\n\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nThe recall, issued on April 24, 2025, by ACC Central Kitchen LLC, is for approximately 64,000 to 65,000 pounds of frozen pork bun products. The recall is classified as Class I and was initiated due to misbranding and an undeclared sesame allergen.

There have been no reported illnesses associated with the consumption of these products.\n\nToday is 2025-05-05.\n\nBefore answering you think:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n(e) You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
