    "review": "Helpful additions: (1) Panama’s last human YF case reportedly being in 1974 and (2) >95% vaccination coverage in high‑risk Panamanian areas, if accurate, both push the odds down; I hadn’t explicitly used those base-rate anchors. The 38‑day window point reinforces my timing concern. I don’t find “Aedes aegypti is present in Costa Rica” persuasive for short‑term risk; recent large South American events have been sylvatic (Haemagogus/Sabethes), not urban Ae. aegypti cycles. Likewise, Costa Rica’s yellow fever entry-vaccination requirement is longstanding and not evidence of current spread. Forecaster 3’s 5% feels too low given the elevated South American activity and proximity to the Darién; Forecaster 2’s 18% seems a bit high in light of Panama’s long quiet history and high vaccination in risk zones.",
    "rationale": "Baseline: CDC YF Travel Health Notices for North American countries are rare; no current NA notices; Panama—most plausible conduit from Colombia—has had no human cases for decades and reportedly high vaccination in risk areas. To resolve Yes by early June, we likely need (a) confirmed local transmission or notable epizootic in a NA country (most plausibly Panama), and (b) CDC to issue a Travel Health Notice within ~5 weeks. That two-step sequence is possible but unlikely on this timeline. The current PAHO alert and surge in South America meaningfully raise tail risk of northward spillover via the Darién and sylvatic cycles, but the short window and historical base rates dominate. I slightly lower my forecast to reflect the stronger base-rate arguments (Panama’s long absence of cases and high coverage) while retaining a nontrivial tail for rapid detection-and-notice scenarios. Upward triggers before June 1: reports of human YF or primate die-offs in Panama/Costa Rica, or MOH advisories that prompt CDC action. Downward triggers: no northward signals by mid-May, or PAHO updates showing containment in Colombia/Peru/Brazil.",
