    "review": "Forecaster 2 rightly leans on strong base rates and the fact that last year’s failure should spur mitigation. However, 95% seems too high given (a) the strict completion criterion (start-but-adjourn = No), and (b) GameStop’s idiosyncratic, heavy-tailed attention risk that has already produced one high-profile failure. Forecaster 2 also doesn’t explicitly consider the possibility that June 12 might not be the actual meeting date, which is a non-zero source of error.\n\nForecaster 3 adds a valuable point I underweighted: by ~16 days out, a DEF 14A or equivalent notice should exist, so lack of confirmation is a meaningful risk to the “exact date” component. That said, treating the prior of any specific date as low ignores that companies tend to keep consistent mid-June timing and that the question context likely reflects an announced or expected date. The research assistant’s lack of info is not strong evidence that no announcement exists. Thus 30% feels too low.\n\nNet: I accept a modest downward pull from the date-confirmation concern, but still give substantial weight to (i) typical mid-June cadence and (ii) improved execution after 2024. I don’t buy >90%, but I’m above 50% by a comfortable margin.",
    "rationale": "I decompose the probability into two parts: (1) the meeting is scheduled for June 12, and (2) conditional on that, it fully completes that day.\n- P(scheduled for June 12): moderate-high. GameStop has historically held mid-June meetings, and questions like this typically target a known/expected date. However, absent explicit proxy confirmation in hand at T–16 days, I haircut this somewhat. I estimate ~0.90.\n- P(complete | scheduled): higher than average risk due to 2024’s crash and the strict resolution rule, but mitigated by strong incentives to avoid a repeat (capacity upgrades, vendor changes, in-person/hybrid options, tighter access controls). I estimate ~0.89.\nMultiplying yields ~0.80.\n\nWhat would move me up: evidence of a filed DEF 14A or company notice explicitly confirming June 12 with robust logistics (e.g., in-person/hybrid or controlled virtual access), and a routine agenda. What would move me down: confirmation of a different date, explicit virtual-only with open access amidst renewed meme-style attention, or any sign of adjournment or litigation risk.",
