  "information": "The recall was initiated by Johnsonville LLC on April 5, 2025, for approximately 22,672 pounds of its cheddar bratwurst product due to potential contamination with hard plastic. The affected products were produced on a single date, February 5, 2025, and bear the establishment number 'Est. 1647'. The U.S. Department of Agriculture’s Food Safety and Inspection Service (FSIS) classified this as a Class I recall, indicating a high health risk. The recall was prompted by two consumer complaints, but no confirmed injuries have been reported. The product was distributed to retail locations in ten states: Georgia, Indiana, Kansas, Kentucky, Michigan, Minnesota, Ohio, Tennessee, Virginia, and Wisconsin. The FSIS has noted concerns that the product may still be in consumers' freezers.\n\nThe FSIS follows a structured process for closing recalls. This process involves verifying that the recalling firm has notified all its customers, confirming that the product has been removed from circulation, conducting effectiveness checks to ensure the product is no longer available to consumers, and verifying that the company has implemented corrective actions. For Class I recalls, which are deemed high-risk, the FSIS enforces more rigorous verification requirements before it can be closed. Recalls involving foreign material contamination necessitate a comprehensive investigation into the source of the contaminant and the implementation of effective preventive measures.\n\nHistorical data on similar FSIS recalls provides context for typical closure timelines. Many previous recalls handled by Johnsonville were closed within 4 to 8 weeks. Broader data for Class I meat recalls of a similar size often shows closure within 2 to 4 months after the announcement. However, some cases can take longer; a recall for Tyson Fun Nuggets in 2023 took approximately four months to close. A January 2025 report from the Plastic Pollution Coalition also mentioned that several recalls from 2024 involving plastic contamination remained ongoing for several months after their initiation.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "~53 days (about 7 weeks) from May 9, 2025 until July 1, 2025",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No — the recall page is currently Active; without change, it remains Active on July 1",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Effectiveness checks or corrective-action verification take longer than expected, or the recall is expanded due to additional complaints/findings, keeping the FSIS status Active into July",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Johnsonville completes all notifications, retrieval, and corrective actions for the single-day lot; FSIS finishes effectiveness checks without issues and updates the page to Closed in late May or June",
    "rationale": "Timing and base rates favor closure before July 1, but not overwhelmingly. The recall (initiated Apr 5, 2025) covers a single production date and a moderate volume (22,672 lbs) across 10 states, triggered by two complaints and no injuries. FSIS classed it as Class I, which entails stricter verification, but the scope is narrow and Johnsonville’s prior recalls often closed in 4–8 weeks. We are ~5 weeks post-announcement with ~7 weeks left; that gives ample runway for a typical close in late May–June.\nCountervailing evidence: Class I foreign-material recalls can linger while FSIS verifies root cause and corrective actions; FSIS explicitly notes concern about product remaining in consumer freezers; and some plastic-contamination recalls (e.g., Tyson Fun Nuggets 2023) took ~4 months, and a few 2024 plastic cases persisted for several months. Any expansion or additional complaints would likely delay closure.\nWhy not higher: The Class I designation, foreign-material investigation requirements, and the history of some plastic recalls running 3–4+ months create real risk the status stays Active past July 1. Why not lower: The recall is limited to one day’s production and modest size, with Johnsonville’s track record of 4–8 week closures and many similar Class I meat recalls closing within 2–4 months; July 1 is ~12.5 weeks post-announcement, squarely within that window.\nUpdates that would raise the forecast: FSIS posts successful effectiveness-check progress, retailer recovery appears comprehensive, or Johnsonville issues a clear completion/corrective-action update without expansion. Updates that would lower it: any scope expansion, new injuries/complaints linked to additional lots, signs of ineffective retrieval, or FSIS audit issues.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill the USDA-posted recall by Johnsonville LLC of cheddar bratwurst for foreign matter contamination issued April 5, 2025 be closed before July 1, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nReal Simple: [Over 22,000 Pounds of a Popular Sausage Brand Recalled Due to Contamination](https://www.realsimple.com/sausage-recall-2025-11711268)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below.
