  "information": "As of early May 2025, Muqtada al-Sadr has publicly and repeatedly reaffirmed his boycott of the 2025 Iraqi parliamentary election. In April 2025, he rejected a plea from the Iraqi President to reconsider his decision, stating he would not participate with 'the corrupt'. In March 2025, he forbade his followers from voting or participating in the election. A Qatari report from late April indicated al-Sadr is unwilling to take responsibility for the political mistakes of the rival Shia Coordination Framework. During a speech on May 2, 2025, he told supporters to 'speak out if their speech benefits reform, and remain silent if silence benefits reform.'\n\nThe Iraqi government has set November 11, 2025, as the date for the parliamentary elections. The Independent High Electoral Commission (IHEC) announced that the registration period for political alliances would run from April 15 to May 4, 2025. The political landscape is marked by significant divisions within the Shia bloc. The Shiite Coordination Framework, a major coalition, plans to participate in the election with at least six separate lists, though they are in discussions to form a post-election coalition. The electoral law remains a point of contention among political blocs.\n\nMuqtada al-Sadr has a history of reversing decisions to boycott elections. He previously reversed boycotts in 2014 and 2021. The 2021 reversal occurred in mid-August, approximately two months before the election. Despite his current boycott, al-Sadr has urged his followers to update their voter registration records. Some political sources have discussed the possibility of al-Sadr participating indirectly through an independent list to maintain influence, a strategy he has used in the past. In June 2022, after his party won 73 seats in the 2021 election, he ordered his entire parliamentary bloc to resign.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Less than two months. The question resolves on July 1, 2025.",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No. Muqtada al-Sadr's Alliance Towards Reforms will maintain its current boycott and will not announce participation in the 2025 Iraqi parliamentary election before the specified date.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Muqtada al-Sadr continues his public boycott, considering the political establishment too corrupt for engagement. The registration deadline for political alliances on May 4, 2025, passes without his coalition registering, cementing his non-participation. He opts to exert influence from outside the formal political system, believing this strategy better serves his reform agenda.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "In a characteristic reversal, al-Sadr announces his coalition will participate in the election to prevent his rivals in the Shia Coordination Framework from consolidating power and to avoid the political marginalization of his movement. This decision would likely follow behind-the-scenes negotiations leading to a major concession, such as a favorable change to the electoral law or an extension of registration deadlines, which he would present as a victory for his reformist platform.",
    "rationale": "My forecast is based on the significant weight of current evidence pointing towards a continued boycott, balanced against Muqtada al-Sadr's well-documented history of political reversals. The status quo is a firm 'No.' Al-Sadr has repeatedly and recently reaffirmed his boycott, rejecting even a plea from the Iraqi President in April 2025. His rhetoric about refusing to participate with 'the corrupt' is a hardline stance. Critically, the registration period for political alliances is set to end on May 4, 2025, the day after this forecast is made. The passing of this deadline without the Alliance Towards Reforms registering would create a significant structural barrier to participation, making a subsequent announcement of fielding candidates unlikely and less credible. However, the probability is not close to zero due to al-Sadr's history. He has reversed election boycotts before, notably in 2014 and 2021, often at the last minute to maximize political leverage. His call for followers to update voter registration is an ambiguous but important signal that he may be keeping his options open. A 15% probability reflects the small but non-trivial chance that a significant political development—such as a major concession from his rivals or a perceived existential threat to his movement's influence—could prompt another dramatic reversal, potentially involving an extension of the registration deadline to accommodate him. My forecast would increase with any news of a registration deadline extension or reports of high-level negotiations between al-Sadr and other political blocs. Conversely, my confidence in a 'No' outcome will increase significantly if the May 4 deadline passes without his registration and is followed by another statement from him reaffirming the boycott.",
