    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Roughly 1–3 weeks (summit expected mid-to-late June 2025; today is 2025-06-03).",
    "status_quo_outcome": "Yes — Trump attends in person as planned.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "A late-breaking health issue or domestic/international crisis keeps him in Washington; the summit is postponed or shifted outside June; he opts to participate only virtually; or an acute security issue forces a cancellation or no-show.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Trump flies to Canada and is physically present with other leaders for at least part of the summit (e.g., leaders’ photo, plenary, or bilaterals), satisfying the “in-person” criterion.",
    "rationale": "- Baseline: G7 heads of government almost always attend in person; U.S. presidents in particular treat it as a standard engagement. The White House has reportedly confirmed Trump will visit Canada for the G7, which is a strong signal of intent close to the event date. With only weeks to go, the default is attendance.  \n- Incentives: Trump benefits from direct leader-to-leader engagement and media attention; even in 2018 he attended (despite tensions) albeit briefly. A brief appearance is sufficient for a Yes.  \n- Risks keeping this below 100:  \n  • Health/medical event for a 79-year-old within a short window (low but nonzero).  \n  • Sudden domestic crisis (e.g., major emergency requiring his presence) or an acute foreign crisis.  \n  • Scheduling/postponement risk (summit moved out of June) is unlikely but would resolve No under the question’s wording.  \n  • Idiosyncratic last-minute change of plans, while rare, is more plausible with this principal than with most leaders.  \n- Why not higher: These tail risks collectively are meaningful enough to keep the forecast shy of the mid-90s.  \n- Why not lower: Official confirmation, strong precedent of attendance, short time horizon, and the ease of satisfying the in-person criterion make non-attendance scenarios relatively improbable.  \n- What would move it up: Public release of the exact dates and Trump’s official schedule; pre-positioning or departure of Air Force One; confirmed arrival in Canada; pool reports of him joining the first leader session/photo.  \n- What would move it down: Credible reports of health issues, an urgent stateside crisis, legal/court obligations coinciding with summit dates, or news that the G7 has been postponed or shifted outside June.  \n- Research assistant note: No additional information beyond the cited confirmation; thus this forecast leans on standard attendance patterns, timing, and the reported White House confirmation.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill Donald Trump attend the G7 Summit in June 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nCTV: [Donald Trump will visit Canada for G7, White House confirms](https://www.ctvnews.ca/politics/article/white-house-confirms-trump-will-visit-canada-for-g7-leaders-summit/)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if US President Donald J. Trump attends in person a G7 summit held in June 2025.\n\n\"In person\" is defined as occupying the same physical space closely enough at the G7 Summit that he can see and hear other heads of state through direct un-intermediated exchange of photons and sound waves.\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nNo additional information available.\n\nToday is 2025-06-03.\n\nBefore answering you think:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n(e) You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
