    "review": "Both forecasters emphasize the same binding constraints I used: only the Federal Constitutional Court can ban a party; no application has been filed; and timelines for such cases are inherently long. Forecaster 2’s emphasis that even a prompt filing would still keep the probability well under 1% because a completed ruling by July 1 would be unprecedented is persuasive. Forecaster 3’s clarification that there is no executive shortcut and that the Court’s deliberate cadence makes a sub-two‑month end-to-end process essentially out of the question further tightens the tail. Neither adds new factual developments, but both strengthen the timing argument and the near-zero feasibility of any emergency pathway that would qualify as an official “ban.”",
    "rationale": "My prior 1% reflected a small tail for an extraordinary event plus an unprecedented fast-track ruling. On reflection, that tail was still too generous because: (1) no authorized application exists; (2) the Constitutional Court’s practice in party bans is measured and evidence-heavy; (3) even with a shock triggering immediate filing, achieving a final, official ban by July 1 would require an extraordinary and effectively unprecedented judicial acceleration. Interim measures, if any, would likely not constitute an official party ban as defined, and are themselves improbable. Political signals (lack of Bundestag majority, no government/Bundesrat move) also point against a filing in the immediate term. Given these constraints, I’m nudging down to a very small residual to account for extreme, unforeseen crises plus a legally novel Court response.",
