  "information": "On January 20, 2025, U.S. President Donald Trump signed Executive Order 14172, ordering the renaming of the U.S. continental shelf off the coasts of Texas, Louisiana, Mississippi, Alabama, and Florida to the 'Gulf of America'. Subsequently, he declared February 9 as the 'Day of the Gulf of America'. In response, several U.S. federal agencies have begun using the new name. The National Hurricane Center (NHC) updated its website graphics and tropical weather bulletins to use 'Gulf of America', and the U.S. Coast Guard has used the term in an official press release.\n\nThe adoption of the name 'Gulf of America' has varied among non-governmental entities. Google updated its Maps service to display 'Gulf of America' for users in the United States, while in other regions, both names are sometimes used. As of late January 2025, other major map publishers like National Geographic and Apple had not made the change. The renaming has generated international controversy, with Mexican officials, including President Claudia Sheinbaum, protesting the unilateral change. The International Hydrographic Organization, which works to standardize the names of bodies of water, has not officially recognized the new name.\n\nThe name 'Gulf of Mexico' has been established for centuries, dating back to the 16th century. The body of water is bordered by the United States, Mexico, and Cuba and is considered international waters under the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea. A previous proposal to rename it the 'Gulf of America' in 2012 was not approved. The website in question, WorldAtlas.com, is a Canadian-based company. While its main North America map currently displays 'Gulf of Mexico', the title of its specific article on the gulf reads: 'Gulf Of Mexico (Gulf of America)'.",

    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "54 days until July 1, 2025",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No - WorldAtlas.com continues displaying 'Gulf of Mexico' on its North America map page, as it has for the centuries-old established name",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "WorldAtlas.com, as a Canadian-based company, maintains the internationally recognized 'Gulf of Mexico' name on its maps, considering that the International Hydrographic Organization hasn't recognized the change, Mexico opposes it, and major map publishers like National Geographic and Apple haven't changed their maps either. They view this as a political naming dispute affecting only US territorial waters rather than an official international geographic change.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "WorldAtlas.com updates its North America map to include 'Gulf of America' (alone or alongside Gulf of Mexico), following the precedent set by Google Maps. Having already acknowledged the new name in their article title, they decide to align with US federal usage and what many US users are seeing elsewhere, recognizing that a significant portion of their audience may be American.",
    "rationale": "The critical evidence is that WorldAtlas.com has already made a partial accommodation by updating their article title to 'Gulf Of Mexico (Gulf of America)' but has NOT changed their actual North America map after nearly 4 months since Trump's executive order on January 20, 2025. This suggests awareness but caution. Factors favoring change include: Google Maps already adopted it for US users, multiple US federal agencies use it, and there are still 54 days for an update. Factors against change: WorldAtlas.com is Canadian-based (reducing obligation to follow US political directives), the International Hydrographic Organization hasn't recognized it, Mexico opposes it, major publishers like National Geographic and Apple haven't changed as of late January, and the 4-month delay without map changes suggests reluctance. The status quo has powerful inertia - the 'Gulf of Mexico' name has been established for centuries. The partial accommodation (article title) indicates they're not completely opposed, but the lack of map change after significant time suggests they may be waiting for broader international acceptance or may not change at all. I would update higher if WorldAtlas.com announces plans to change or if National Geographic/Apple make the change. I would update lower if they explicitly state they won't change or if more time passes without action.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill WorldAtlas.com display the body of water northwest of the Caribbean Sea as the Gulf of America before July 1, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nWorld Atlas article: [Gulf Of Mexico (Gulf of America)](https://www.worldatlas.com/gulfs/gulf-of-mexico.html)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if, before July 1, 2025, the World Atlas website at its [North America](https://www.worldatlas.com/webimage/countrys/na.htm) page displays the body of water west of Florida, south of Louisiana and north of the Yucatán Peninsula as the Gulf of America. (At the time of this question, the name displayed is the Gulf of Mexico.)\n\nIn case both names are used, for example \"Gulf of America formerly known as Gulf of Mexico,\" this question resolves as Yes. Note that verification will be from Metaculus admins accessing the webpage from the United States and that therefore resolution will be based on how the page appears when accessed from that location.\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nOn January 20, 2025, U.S. President Donald Trump signed Executive Order 14172, ordering the renaming of the U.S. continental shelf off the coasts of Texas, Louisiana, Mississippi, Alabama, and Florida to the 'Gulf of America'.

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
