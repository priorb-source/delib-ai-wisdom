  "information": "The current U.S. Secretary of Agriculture is Brooke Rollins, who was sworn in around February 2025. Secretary Rollins has expressed support for SNAP reforms as part of a 'Make America Healthy Again' initiative, which is also championed by Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. In legislative developments, the House Budget Committee has cleared a Republican spending package that includes proposed cuts to SNAP and stricter work requirements. Separately, Secretary Rollins plans to announce a USDA reorganization plan and further staff reductions in late May 2025.\n\nSeveral states are pursuing federal waivers to restrict the use of SNAP benefits for certain items. Nebraska became the first state to receive a waiver to ban the purchase of soda and energy drinks, with the ban taking effect on January 1, 2026. Following this, Idaho submitted a similar waiver on May 16, 2025, to ban soft drinks and candy, with a decision expected in the coming weeks. Arkansas is seeking USDA clearance to make candy and soda ineligible starting in July 2026, while also proposing to add rotisserie chicken to the list of eligible foods. Indiana is also pursuing similar restrictions.\n\nChanges to national SNAP eligibility rules require either a congressional amendment to the Food and Nutrition Act of 2008 or a formal USDA rulemaking process. The Act broadly authorizes SNAP benefits for 'any food or food product intended for human consumption.' In the past, the USDA has rejected state waiver requests to restrict specific food items due to concerns about implementation challenges, costs, and the potential impact on recipients. According to the USDA, approximately 20% of all SNAP spending goes towards sugary drinks and snacks.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Approximately 6 weeks (from May 20, 2025 to July 1, 2025).",
    "status_quo_outcome": "Yes. As of May 5, 2025, the USDA's \"What Can SNAP Buy?\" webpage explicitly lists \"snack foods\" as an eligible item.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "The new USDA administration under Secretary Brooke Rollins, as part of its 'Make America Healthy Again' initiative, directs a rapid update to the agency's public-facing guidance. The term \"snack foods\" is preemptively removed from the webpage to signal a new policy direction, even before formal regulations are changed.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Bureaucratic inertia and the legally required time for formal rulemaking or legislative changes prevent any substantive policy shift from being implemented and reflected on the USDA website by the July 1, 2025 deadline. The webpage text remains unchanged.",
    "rationale": "My forecast is based on the powerful influence of bureaucratic inertia over very short timeframes. The resolution date is only six weeks away. Changing national SNAP eligibility rules requires either a congressional amendment to the Food and Nutrition Act or a formal USDA rulemaking process, both of which are lengthy procedures unlikely to be completed by July 1, 2025. While the research indicates strong political will from the new administration to enact these changes, as evidenced by Secretary Rollins's statements and the approval of state-level waivers, the implementation of those waivers themselves (e.g., Nebraska's ban effective Jan 2026) suggests that such changes are not immediate. The status quo is a very strong prior in this case. The primary risk, and the reason my probability is not higher, is that the new administration could make a purely cosmetic change to the webpage text. This is a low-friction action that could be used to signal policy intent ahead of formal changes. However, government agencies are typically cautious about changing official guidance without a corresponding regulatory update. The most probable outcome is that the website text will not be updated within this brief window. I would increase my probability if June passes without any relevant announcements. I would decrease it if Secretary Rollins explicitly announces a 'war on snacks' and directs immediate updates to USDA public communications.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill the USDA still list \"snack foods\" on its \"What Can SNAP Buy?\" page on July 1, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nNY Post: [Americans on food stamps could be banned from buying ‘bad food and sugary drinks,’ Trump USDA chief says](https://nypost.com/2025/02/14/us-news/americans-on-food-stamps-could-be-banned-from-buying-bad-food-and-sugary-drinks-trump-usda-chief-says/)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if \"snack foods\" is specifically listed on the United States Department of Agriculture's [What Can SNAP Buy?](https://www.fns.usda.gov/snap/eligible-food-items) webpage as something that is explicitly mentioned as something that can can be purchased by recipients of the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program. (Forecasters please note that it *is* explicitly mentioned as of May 5, 2025.) If it is *not* explicitly mentioned when checked by Metataculus on or after July 1, 2025, this resolves as **No**.\n\nIn order to streamline resolution, synonyms will not count; the phrase must specifically be \"snack foods.\" The question will resolve as soon as the page is accessed by Metaculus Admins on the resolution date. However, if there are issues accessing the page, then resolution will wait up to the end of the question resolutions period, at which point if Metaculus has still not been able to access the resolution source, this question will be **annulled**.\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nThe current U.S. Secretary of Agriculture is Brooke Rollins, who was sworn in around February 2025.

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
