  "information": "The U.S. Supreme Court unanimously ruled that Kilmar Abrego Garcia's deportation was unlawful and ordered the Trump administration to 'facilitate' his return. Subsequently, U.S. District Judge Paula Xinis ordered the administration to explain its diplomatic efforts with El Salvador regarding his return and set deadlines for the government to provide information and documents. An earlier court-ordered deadline for Garcia's return of April 7, 2025, passed without compliance.\n\nThe Trump administration has publicly resisted the court orders. President Trump stated the case is 'in the hands of lawyers' but also claimed he 'could' have Garcia returned with a single phone call but would not, citing alleged MS-13 gang affiliations. The Department of Homeland Security acknowledged the initial deportation was an 'administrative mistake'. Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem stated that if Garcia were to return to the U.S., he would be immediately deported again.\n\nKilmar Abrego Garcia was deported to El Salvador around March 15, 2025, and is being held in a maximum-security prison. The President of El Salvador, Nayib Bukele, has publicly labeled Garcia a 'terrorist' and has stated that he will not be released or returned to the United States. U.S. Senator Chris Van Hollen traveled to El Salvador to demand Garcia's release from prison, but reported that the U.S. embassy in El Salvador had not received instructions to assist in the matter.",

    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "About 61 days (until July 1, 2025)",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "El Salvador continues to detain Garcia in a maximum‑security facility; President Bukele maintains refusal to release or transfer him; the U.S. administration resists or slow‑rolls compliance with court orders; no deal is struck and Garcia does not physically enter U.S. territory before July 1.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Escalating legal/diplomatic pressure (e.g., contempt findings, congressional pressure, threatened sanctions/visa restrictions or aid leverage) prompts the U.S. to reach an arrangement with El Salvador for a tightly controlled transfer. Garcia is flown into any U.S. jurisdiction (e.g., Miami, Dulles, Puerto Rico) and technically enters U.S. territory—potentially followed by immediate re‑detention or removal, which would still satisfy the question’s criteria.",
    "rationale": "Key facts from the research assistant: (1) The U.S. Supreme Court unanimously ruled the deportation unlawful and directed the government to facilitate Garcia’s return. (2) A district judge set deadlines and demanded documentation; an April 7, 2025 return deadline passed without compliance. (3) The administration has publicly resisted; DHS acknowledges the initial removal was a mistake but indicates Garcia would be re‑removed immediately if he returns. (4) Garcia is in a Salvadoran maximum‑security prison; President Bukele has labeled him a terrorist and refuses to release or return him. (5) U.S. diplomatic posture appears passive (no embassy instruction reported), despite congressional interest (e.g., Sen. Van Hollen’s trip). \n\nAssessment: Two hard constraints must be overcome on a short timeline: cooperation by the U.S. executive branch and cooperation by El Salvador, which is currently detaining Garcia and explicitly refusing transfer. Courts can pressure the U.S. side (contempt, fines, adverse rulings), but they cannot compel a foreign sovereign to release a detainee. Diplomatic tools (aid/visa levers, public pressure) could move El Salvador, but the current U.S. administration appears disinclined to expend capital to secure Garcia’s return before July 1. With only ~2 months remaining, the baseline is continued non‑compliance and Salvadoran detention.\n\nWhy not higher: Because both veto players must align. Given explicit resistance from the U.S. administration, Bukele’s public refusal, and missed court deadlines, the probability that the necessary legal/diplomatic sequence completes by July 1 is low. Logistics (travel docs, flights, custody arrangements) also take time once a deal is struck. \n\nWhy not lower: A unanimous Supreme Court ruling imposes unusually strong legal and political pressure. Congress and courts could escalate costs of defiance; the U.S. has leverage over El Salvador (aid, visas, law‑enforcement cooperation). The resolution criterion is minimal—any brief physical entry into U.S. territory counts—even if followed by immediate removal. A late, face‑saving compliance remains plausible.\n\nKey updates that would raise the forecast: credible reports of (a) the U.S. government instructing State/DHS to facilitate return; (b) Salvadoran authorities signaling willingness to release/transfer; (c) issuance of travel documents or flight arrangements; (d) concrete enforcement actions by courts (e.g., contempt findings with meaningful penalties) that the administration begins to honor. \n\nUpdates that would lower the forecast: (a) new Salvadoran charges or legal actions extending detention; (b) explicit U.S. statements that it will not facilitate return despite court orders, with no meaningful judicial enforcement; (c) reporting that the embassy has been directed not to assist; (d) evidence of deteriorating U.S.–El Salvador relations making a transfer even less likely. \n\nNote: For this question, “entering the United States” means physical entry into U.S. territory (states, D.C., or U.S. territories), not a U.S. embassy/consulate abroad.",

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower.
