  "information": "As of mid-May 2025, the Los Angeles Dodgers hold a record of 29-17, leading the National League West division. The team's offense is ranked as one of the best in baseball, averaging 5.8 runs per game, with Shohei Ohtani leading the team with 16 home runs. Pre-season projections from multiple sources were high; Baseball Prospectus's PECOTA system projected 104 wins for the 2025 season, the most in MLB, while betting markets set their over/under win total at 103.5.",

    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "~27 days (until June 15, 2025)",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "One or more current league leaders (e.g., a top AL/NL club) maintain a >.640 winning percentage through mid-June while the Dodgers play roughly .500–.600 ball over their next ~19 games, leaving LA short of the best MLB win% when the standings are checked on or after June 15.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "The Dodgers post a hot ~3-week stretch (e.g., 13–6 or better), while today’s top teams cool off to ~.500, resulting in LA holding (or sharing) the best MLB winning percentage on the official MLB standings page when checked on/after June 15. Ties for highest win% likely count as Yes.",
    "rationale": "- Where things stand: As of mid-May, the Dodgers are 29–17 (~.630), leading the NL West and boasting elite run production (5.8 R/G; Ohtani 16 HR). Preseason systems (PECOTA ~104 wins; betting O/U 103.5) rated them as MLB’s best or near-best. However, they are not clearly the top record in MLB right now, implying at least one team is ahead in win%. With only ~19 games until June 15, the default (status quo) is that the current top team(s) remain ahead.\n- Short-horizon variance: Over the next ~19 games, a team’s overall winning percentage can move by roughly 0.03–0.04, which is enough to shuffle positions but not guaranteed to erase a multi-point gap (e.g., from ~.630 to above a leader near ~.660–.680) unless LA both surges and rivals stumble. LA likely needs to outperform the current leader(s) by roughly 3–5 wins over this span to finish with the top win% by June 15.\n- Competitive field: Multiple strong clubs (AL powers like NYY/BAL; NL like ATL/PHI) plausibly sit at or above LA’s current pace. Beating all of them to the top on a specific date is harder than merely playing well.\n- Why not higher: They are currently not the best record; multiple teams can block them; limited time to flip the leaderboard.\n- Why not lower: The Dodgers are an elite roster and among the most likely single teams to go on a heater; ties at the top probably count; short-run randomness can swing standings over a few weeks.\n- What would move me up: By late May/early June, LA within ~1 game of the best MLB win% or in a tie; news of soft upcoming schedule; injuries or slumps for current leaders.\n- What would move me down: LA skid, key injuries (e.g., to Betts/Ohtani/Freeman or top starters), or if a rival sustains >.650+.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill the LA Dodgers have the highest winning percentage in the MLB on June 15, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nYahoo Sports: [Even as Dodgers navigate injuries and manage pitcher usage, the wins keep coming](https://sports.yahoo.com/mlb/article/even-as-dodgers-navigate-injuries-and-manage-pitcher-usage-the-wins-keep-coming-053322413.html)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if the Los Angeles Dodgers have the highest winning percentage in Major League Baseball according to the [MLB official standings](https://www.mlb.com/standings/) when checked by Metaculus on or after June 15, 2025.\n\nNo other resolution source will be used to resolve the question. Question resolves based on how the page appears when checked by a Metaculus Admin.\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nAs of mid-May 2025, the Los Angeles Dodgers hold a record of 29-17, leading the National League West division.

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
