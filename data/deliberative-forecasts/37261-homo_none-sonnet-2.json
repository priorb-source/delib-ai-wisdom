    "review": "Both forecasters provide well-reasoned analyses that converge on 35%, compared to my 40%. Their key insights include: (1) Emphasizing that large protests are 'episodic rather than constant' and cluster around specific triggering events, (2) Forecaster 3's explicit mention of Trump's second term context, which adds political polarization considerations, (3) Forecaster 2's base rate reasoning - if several large protests occur annually, 2 months represents ~1/6 of a year, but this must be weighted against uneven distribution, (4) Stronger emphasis on the 'status quo' outcome being no protest absent a major trigger. I find their arguments mostly convincing. The episodic nature point is particularly strong - large protests don't occur regularly but require catalyzing moments, and we have no known major triggers scheduled. However, I still see value in my points about: seasonal favorability (May-June weather and schedules), demonstrated US capacity for rapid mobilization, and multiple contentious political issues that could serve as flashpoints. The convergence of two independent forecasters at 35% is notable evidence against my 40% estimate.",
    "rationale": "After reviewing both analyses, I'm updating downward but not fully to 35%. The other forecasters correctly emphasize that large protests are episodic and require triggering events, which I acknowledged but perhaps underweighted. My 40% may have been too optimistic given: (1) the short 2-month window, (2) absence of known planned major protests or recent triggering events, (3) the episodic rather than regular nature of such protests. However, I maintain that my reasoning has merit: the US has proven mobilization capacity, we're entering a seasonally favorable period, multiple contentious political issues exist as potential flashpoints, and the polarized political environment increases probability of rapid mobilization if events occur. The convergence at 35% by two thoughtful forecasters is strong evidence, but my factors supporting slightly higher probability remain valid. I'm settling on 36% - acknowledging their stronger emphasis on base rates and episodic nature while maintaining modest confidence in favorable conditions I identified.",
