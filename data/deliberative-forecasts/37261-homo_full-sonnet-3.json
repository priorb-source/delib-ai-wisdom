    "review": "The other forecasters make compelling statistical arguments about concentration effects in coordinated national protests. Forecaster 3's point is particularly strong: with 600,000 participants on April 5 alone, if participation followed typical patterns where major cities capture disproportionate shares during national mobilizations, at least one city plausibly exceeded 10,000. This is a valid consideration I underweighted.\n\nHowever, I find a critical piece of evidence concerning: the question HASN'T resolved yet despite these major protest movements occurring nearly a month ago (April 5) and just yesterday (May 1). This suggests either (1) no individual protest reached 10,000 participants, (2) the Global Protest Tracker has significant reporting lag, or (3) the GPT doesn't report with sufficient geographic granularity. The research describes these as \"decentralized\" movements across \"all 50 states,\" which suggests dispersion rather than concentration.\n\nBoth forecasters acknowledge this uncertainty but seem to weigh the statistical probability of concentration more heavily than the empirical evidence that the question remains unresolved. While their logic about metropolitan concentration during coordinated actions is sound (e.g., Women's March 2017 had 500,000 in DC alone), the specific descriptions of these 2025 protests emphasize breadth over depth.",
    "rationale": "Upon reflection, I believe the other forecasters correctly identify that my initial forecast underweighted the probability of concentration effects in major cities during coordinated national actions. With 600,000 participants on April 5, even moderate concentration in top cities (DC, NYC, Chicago, LA) could easily produce multiple events above 10,000.\n\nHowever, I maintain concern about why the question hasn't resolved. The April 5 protests occurred nearly a month ago - sufficient time for the Global Protest Tracker to report if any protest clearly exceeded 10,000. The May 1 protests just occurred, so reporting lag is more plausible there.\n\nBalancing these considerations: (1) the statistical likelihood that major coordinated protests produced at least one 10,000+ event is higher than I initially assessed, (2) there remain nearly 2 months for additional protests or delayed reporting, but (3) the non-resolution of the question despite recent major mobilizations is meaningful evidence against my confidence being too high.\n\nI'm updating upward to account for better reasoning about concentration effects and the significant scale of recent mobilizations, but not as high as Forecaster 3 because the empirical evidence (non-resolution) suggests caution about whether these protests met the specific reporting criteria.",
