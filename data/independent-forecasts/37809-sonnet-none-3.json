    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Approximately 42 days until July 1, 2025",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No - batting averages typically regress toward league norms as the season progresses",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Any players currently batting at or near .400 experience normal regression to the mean over the next six weeks, with their averages declining to more typical elite levels (around .320-.370). This is the historical pattern where early-season hot streaks cool off as pitchers adjust and sample sizes increase.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "An elite hitter like Aaron Judge (mentioned in the article) maintains an exceptional hot streak through the next six weeks, sustaining a .400+ average through approximately 80-85 games (half the season). This would require continuing to get hits in roughly 40% of at-bats against major league pitching.",
    "rationale": "The last player to finish a full season batting .400 was Ted Williams in 1941 (.406), making it one of baseball's most difficult achievements. However, the question asks about July 1, not end-of-season, which significantly increases plausibility since players occasionally maintain extremely high averages into June or early July during hot streaks. We are currently 6 weeks into the 2025 season (late May), and the article reference suggests at least one player (likely Aaron Judge) may be at or near .400 currently. The key question is whether anyone can maintain this for another 6 weeks. Historical patterns strongly favor regression to the mean - even elite hitters typically settle into .300-.350 ranges over full seasons. However, maintaining .400 through roughly half a season, while rare, has occurred more recently than end-of-season .400 averages. Factors supporting a higher probability: We're already several weeks in, suggesting genuine hot performance rather than small-sample-size luck; elite hitters can sustain exceptional stretches. Factors supporting a lower probability: Regression to the mean is powerful in baseball; pitchers and teams adjust to hot hitters; the rarity even of mid-season .400 averages. My forecast would increase if I had confirmation that multiple players are currently above .400 or one player is well above .420. It would decrease if current leaders are only marginally above .400 or trending downward.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill any major league baseball player have a .400 batting average on July 1, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\ntheScore: [How long can Judge's .400 batting average last?](https://www.thescore.com/mlb/news/3284701/how-long-can-judges-400-batting-average-last)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if on July 1, 2025, any Major League Baseball player in the 2025 regular season has a batting average of greater than or equal to .400 according to the [ESPN baseball stats page](https://www.espn.com/mlb/stats)\n\n\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nNo additional information available.\n\nToday is 2025-05-20.\n\nBefore answering you think:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n(e) You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
