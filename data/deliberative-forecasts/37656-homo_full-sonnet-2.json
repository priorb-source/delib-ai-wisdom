    "review": "The other forecasters' analyses are quite strong and we've converged on a narrow range (25-32%). Key points of agreement: (1) the 14-day delay between the executive order and current 'in progress' status is highly informative about maintainer criteria, (2) legal challenges, congressional appropriations through 2027, and Republican opposition create substantial barriers, and (3) the tight 45-day timeline makes resolution unlikely. Forecaster 2's emphasis that 'legal challenges typically take months or years to resolve' is particularly compelling - this temporal constraint may be more binding than I initially weighted. All three of us correctly framed this as predicting tracker maintainer behavior rather than actual policy outcomes. However, I don't see fundamentally new arguments that would justify a large update from my initial position.",
    "rationale": "After reviewing the other analyses, I'm making a modest downward adjustment from 32% to 28% for these reasons: (1) The legal timeline argument is more constraining than I initially weighted - with only ~6 weeks remaining and legal challenges typically taking months, there's almost no chance of legal resolution before July 1. (2) The fact that three independent forecasters converged on 25-32% suggests this range appropriately captures the uncertainty. (3) The 14-day delay remains the strongest evidence - if maintainers were going to mark the EO itself as 'complete,' they likely would have done so already. The primary scenario for a Yes outcome remains the maintainers deciding to reinterpret their criteria to emphasize executive action taken rather than successful implementation. This has meaningful but minority probability (~28%) given: the executive order represents concrete presidential action toward the stated objective, maintainer criteria are somewhat subjective, and there could be incremental developments (preliminary rulings, compliance signals) that tip their assessment. The baseline expectation remains 'in progress' given ongoing legal uncertainty, continuing appropriations, and the maintainers' apparent waiting for clearer results.",
