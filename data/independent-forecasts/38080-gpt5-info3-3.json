  "information": "In response to the DHS action, Harvard University filed a lawsuit against the administration. On May 23, 2025, a federal judge granted Harvard a temporary restraining order (TRO), which has halted the enforcement of the SEVP certification revocation. As a result of the TRO, Harvard's certification is currently considered active. The university's lawsuit alleges that the administration's actions are unconstitutional retaliation that violates the First Amendment, the Due Process Clause, and the Administrative Procedure Act. A court hearing to determine whether a preliminary injunction will be issued is scheduled for May 29.",

    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "About 34 days (until 2025-07-01)",
    "status_quo_outcome": "Yes — Harvard’s SEVP certification is currently in effect due to a TRO halting DHS’s revocation",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "The judge denies a preliminary injunction on/after the May 29 hearing, the TRO expires in mid-June without extension, Harvard fails to secure an injunction pending appeal from the First Circuit, and DHS’s revocation takes effect by July 1, leaving Harvard without active SEVP certification",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "The court grants a preliminary injunction that keeps the certification active through July 1; or the TRO is extended repeatedly; or an appellate court issues an injunction pending appeal; or DHS/ICE voluntarily restores certification pending review or settlement",
    "rationale": "- What we know: DHS revoked Harvard’s SEVP certification on May 22. On May 23, a federal judge issued a TRO halting enforcement, so Harvard’s certification is currently treated as active. A preliminary injunction (PI) hearing is set for May 29. The outcome hinges on whether injunctive relief remains in place through July 1.\n- Legal dynamics: TROs are typically short (about 14 days under FRCP 65) but often convert to or are replaced by PIs if the plaintiff shows likelihood of success, irreparable harm, and favorable equities. The grant of a TRO already signals the judge sees plausible merits and irreparable harm. Harvard’s claims (First Amendment retaliation, due process, APA) and the massive, immediate harm to thousands of students are classic grounds for injunctive relief. Courts have historically been receptive to injunctions protecting international students in abrupt federal policy shifts (e.g., 2020 ICE online-class policy withdrawal after litigation), though immigration/visa matters do get some executive deference.\n- Timing considerations: To get a No by July 1, several steps must stack: PI denied; TRO expires; Harvard fails to obtain an injunction pending appeal from the First Circuit; DHS’s revocation then bites before July 1. That’s a tight sequence in ~4 weeks. Conversely, any form of ongoing injunction (district or appellate) or an interim government restoration keeps certification active, which suffices for a Yes.\n- Status quo weighting: The present state is “certification active” due to the TRO. Good forecasting practice puts extra weight on the status quo. Preserving the status quo is exactly what preliminary relief is designed to do, especially under time pressure with large third-party harms.\n- Why not higher: The judge could deny a PI on deference to executive authority in SEVP/immigration, or accept revised DHS justifications and process. Appellate relief is not guaranteed. The administration could also move rapidly to reissue a procedurally fortified revocation and seek to narrow the TRO’s effect.\n- Why not lower: The TRO itself, the scale of irreparable harm to thousands of students, and the relatively short window until July 1 make it more likely courts maintain the status quo. Multiple procedural avenues (PI, TRO extension, injunction pending appeal) raise the chances that certification remains active on the date.\n- Key updates to watch: (1) Outcome and language of the May 29 PI ruling; (2) Any TRO extensions; (3) First Circuit actions on emergency motions; (4) Any DHS moves to voluntarily reinstate pending review or to reissue with additional process.\n- Research assistant summary used: TRO granted May 23; certification presently active; PI hearing May 29; Harvard alleges 1A, Due Process, APA violations. This supports a higher-than-even chance the status quo persists through July 1.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill Harvard University have a Student and Exchange Visitor Program certification on July 1, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nThe Trump administration and Harvard University have been through a significant confrontation, since Trump took office for the second time. This [started](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/22/us/politics/harvard-university-trump.html) with a task force commissioned by Trump to address antisemitism on campus, but quickly spiralled out of control. The administration asked Harvard to provide detailed records on foreign students, including disciplinary actions and involvement in protests, and demanded that Harvard implement changes to its admissions, hiring, and diversity policies. Harvard refused, citing concerns over academic freedom and student privacy. In response, the administration froze or pulled almost \\$4 billion in federal grants and contracts to Harvard and its research partners. Harvard filed a lawsuit against the administration, accusing it of attempting to interfere in academic decision-making and penalising the institution for resisting politically motivated demands.\r\n\r\nThe situation escalated on May 22, 2025, when the Department of Homeland Security [revoked](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/22/us/politics/trump-harvard-international-students.html) Harvard's certification under the Student and Exchange Visitor Program, effectively barring the university from enrolling international students for the 2025–2026 academic year. This action affects approximately 6,800 international students or 27% of Harvard's student body, who must now transfer to other institutions or risk losing their legal status. The administration justified the move by accusing Harvard of fostering a \"toxic campus climate,\" failing to protect Jewish students, and allegedly collaborating with the Chinese Communist Party.\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question will resolve as **Yes** if, on July 1, 2025, Harvard University has a certification under the Student and Exchange Visitor Program (SEVP) programme allowing international students to enroll, according to [credible sources](https://www.metaculus.com/faq/#definitions).\n\n* An announcement that Harvard's certification will be restored on a date after July 1, 2025 will not suffice to resolve this question. The certification needs to be in effect for this to resolve.\r\n* Getting the certification at any point on July 1, 2025 would resolve this question as **Yes**.\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nIn response to the DHS action, Harvard University filed a lawsuit against the administration. On May 23, 2025, a federal judge granted Harvard a temporary restraining order (TRO), which has halted the enforcement of the SEVP certification revocation. As a result of the TRO, Harvard's certification is currently considered active. The university's lawsuit alleges that the administration's actions are unconstitutional retaliation that violates the First Amendment, the Due Process Clause, and the Administrative Procedure Act. A court hearing to determine whether a preliminary injunction will be issued is scheduled for May 29.\n\nToday is 2025-05-28.\n\nBefore answering you think:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n(e) You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
