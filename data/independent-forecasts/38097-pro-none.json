    "status_quo_outcome": "The question resolves as 'Yes' because Laurent Gbagbo remains removed from the Ivorian electoral list, a legal status established in late 2024 which makes him ineligible to run for president.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "In an unexpected move toward national reconciliation, President Alassane Ouattara issues a pardon or amnesty that explicitly restores Laurent Gbagbo's full political and civil rights, leading to his reinstatement on the electoral list. The other four named candidates also remain eligible, resulting in a 'No' outcome.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Laurent Gbagbo's removal from the electoral roll, due to a 2018 domestic conviction, remains in effect through the July 1, 2025 deadline. No political or judicial action is taken to reverse his status of ineligibility. This alone is sufficient to resolve the question as 'Yes'.",
    "rationale": "The forecast is primarily driven by the established legal status of Laurent Gbagbo. According to credible sources like the BBC, he was removed from the electoral list in October 2024 due to a 2018 conviction for 'looting' a regional bank. This removal renders him legally ineligible to be a candidate, and this state of ineligibility persists. The question resolves 'Yes' if any of the listed candidates 'has been removed from the electoral list' by the deadline. Since this has already occurred and is an ongoing state, the probability of a 'Yes' resolution is very high.\n\nThe core of the forecast is assessing the likelihood of this decision being reversed before July 1, 2025. Such a reversal is highly improbable given the deep-seated political rivalry between the incumbent President Ouattara and Mr. Gbagbo. The use of the judicial system to sideline political opponents is a recurring theme in Ivorian politics, and there is no current indication of a political rapprochement that would lead to Gbagbo's reinstatement.\n\nMy probability is not higher than 95% to account for the small but non-zero chance of a sudden political development. This could include a surprise amnesty or a significant deal brokered by regional or international actors to ensure a more inclusive and stable election. However, with only a month until the deadline, the window for such a major reversal is closing rapidly.\n\nThe probability is not lower because the status quo strongly favors Gbagbo's continued exclusion. Reversing this would require a major political concession from the ruling party, for which there is currently no evidence. My forecast would move toward 'No' only with credible reports of a political deal or a successful, binding legal appeal restoring Gbagbo's rights. It would move closer to 100% 'Yes' if Ivorian officials explicitly reaffirm Gbagbo's disqualification before the deadline.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill any of these candidates be disqualified from running in the 2025 Ivorian presidential election before July 1, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nBBC: [Main opposition leader removed from Ivory Coast electoral list](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c0l0j849143o)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if before July 1, 2025, according to [credible sources](https://www.metaculus.com/faq/#definitions) any of these candidates has been removed from the electoral list or otherwise become legally ineligible to run in the [2025 presidential election](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2025_Ivorian_presidential_election) of the Ivory Coast (Côte d'Ivoire) under the laws of the country: Gnangbo Kacou, Laurent Gbagbo, Pascal Affi N'Guessan, Jean-Louis Billon, or Simone Gbagbo.\n\n\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nNo additional information available.\n\nToday is 2025-05-30.\n\nBefore answering you think:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n(e) You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
