    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Approximately 2 months (from 2025-05-02 to 2025-07-01)",
    "status_quo_outcome": "Yes. India has a recent history of frequent, large-scale protests, and the provided background information indicates current high tensions over a specific law, making another large protest likely to occur and be reported.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "The period between May 2 and July 1, 2025, sees a temporary lull in major protest activity. Alternatively, a protest of the required size occurs late in the period, but the Global Protest Tracker is not updated to include it before the resolution date.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Sparked by the controversial 'Muslim land law' mentioned in the background or another significant political issue, one or more protests involving at least 10,000 people occur in India and are subsequently recorded by the Global Protest Tracker before July 1, 2025.",
    "rationale": "My forecast is based on several key factors. Firstly, India has a high base rate for large-scale protests, as shown by events like the 2019-2021 farmers' protests and the 2019-2020 Citizenship Amendment Act protests, both of which mobilized hundreds of thousands. The 10,000-participant threshold is relatively low in this context. Secondly, the provided background information points to a specific and potent catalyst: a 'Muslim land law' that has already resulted in fatal protests in April 2025. Such volatile issues often lead to sustained protest movements, making another significant demonstration probable within the forecast period. The primary reasons for uncertainty are the short timeframe of less than two months and the dependency on the Global Protest Tracker's reporting schedule, which may have a lag. My probability is not higher (e.g., >80%) because of these timing and reporting constraints; the situation could de-escalate, or a lag in reporting could prevent resolution. My probability is not lower (e.g., <50%) because the active, high-stakes nature of the reported conflict makes a continuation of protests more likely than a sudden calm. I would raise my forecast on news of nationwide protest calls and lower it if the government repealed the law or suppressed the movement's leadership.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill the Global Protest Tracker report any protests in India with 10,000+ participants, before July 1, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nReuters: [Three dead as protests against Muslim land law turn violent in eastern India](https://www.reuters.com/world/india/three-dead-protests-against-muslim-land-law-turn-violent-eastern-india-2025-04-14/)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if the [Global Protest Tracker](https://carnegieendowment.org/features/global-protest-tracker?lang=en) reports a protest in India with 10,000 or more participants with a start date after the launch of this question and before July 1, 2025.\n\nA protest with at least 10,000 participants that is active at the launch of this question does not count for resolution.\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nNo additional information available.\n\nToday is 2025-05-02.\n\nBefore answering you think:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n(e) You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
