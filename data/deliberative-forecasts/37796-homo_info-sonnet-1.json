    "review": "Forecaster 3 provides the most compelling new evidence: a historical base rate showing 16 out of 17 FATF plenaries since 2018 (94%) resulted in grey list changes, with the only exception being October 2020's COVID-affected virtual meeting. This is precisely the type of objective, quantitative data that should anchor forecasting but which I completely missed in my initial analysis. Forecaster 2 adds useful information about the British Virgin Islands as a specific candidate for addition, with concrete details about expired grace periods and political support. Both forecasters identified evidence I overlooked that substantially strengthens the case for a YES outcome.",
    "rationale": "My original 70% forecast was too anchored on qualitative assessment of specific countries' progress toward removal and insufficiently weighted the strong historical base rate. The 94% historical pattern is extremely compelling - changes to the grey list are the clear default outcome at FATF plenaries, not an uncertain possibility requiring specific evidence. The February 2025 plenary's changes (Philippines removed, Laos and Nepal added) confirm normal operations continue. With 25 jurisdictions currently monitored, the FATF's active review process, and multiple countries showing concrete progress (Nigeria targeting May exit, Mozambique completing April site visits, South Africa addressing 20/22 items), the probability of at least one change is very high. While I should not mechanically adopt the 94% base rate without any discount - forecasting requires accounting for residual uncertainty and the fact that we're now close to the meeting without announcements - the historical evidence demands a substantial upward revision. The burden of proof should be on why June 2025 would be exceptional, and I see no evidence of extraordinary circumstances like those in October 2020.",
