    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "10 days - the question resolves on May 1, 2025, and today is April 21, 2025",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No - Haley Stevens has not announced her candidacy for US Senator from Michigan as of April 21, 2025",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Haley Stevens continues to serve in the House of Representatives without making any Senate announcement in the remaining 10 days. She either decides not to run for Senate, or decides to run but doesn't announce until after May 1, or remains undecided through the deadline.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Haley Stevens decides to enter the Michigan Senate race and makes a formal announcement of her candidacy in the next 10 days, filling the void left by other prominent Democrats who have declined to run.",
    "rationale": "With only 10 days remaining until the May 1 deadline, the status quo strongly favors a No outcome. The research assistant provided no information suggesting an imminent announcement, which is telling - if Stevens were about to announce, there would likely be signals such as staff hiring, fundraising activity, or media speculation. The CNN article indicates that several top Democratic contenders (Whitmer, Buttigieg, McDonald, Rivet) have already bowed out of the race, suggesting the field may be stabilizing rather than expanding. While Stevens is a plausible candidate as a Michigan Democrat in the House, the lack of any public movement toward an announcement this close to the deadline is significant. For my forecast to be higher, I would need evidence of: active campaign preparation, statements from Stevens or her team suggesting interest, or reporting that she's seriously considering the race. For it to be lower, I would need definitive statements ruling out a run or evidence she's committed to other plans. The short timeframe and absence of signals point to a low probability, though I leave some room for a surprise announcement given that 10 days is technically enough time and political decisions can happen quickly when vacuums exist.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill Haley Stevens announce her candidacy for US Senator from Michigan before May 1, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nCNN: [Democrats lose another top contender for US Senate seat in Michigan after Whitmer and Buttigieg bow out](https://www.cnn.com/2025/04/10/politics/michigan-senate-race-democrats-mcdonald-rivet/index.html)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if Haley Stevens announces her candidacy for US Senator from Michigan before May 1, 2025. If no such announcement has been made before that date, the question resolves as **No**.\n\n\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nNo additional information available.\n\nToday is 2025-04-21.\n\nBefore answering you think:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n(e) You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
