    "review": "Forecaster 2 surfaces valid Tesla downside catalysts (valuation, deteriorating margins, bearish analyst signals, Robotaxi execution risk) and Walmart’s steadiness/tariff tailwind. However, their 40% seems to underweight base rates for mega-cap relative moves in 45 days and doesn’t quantify the required threshold well. Forecaster 3’s analysis is closer to my view: they emphasize the size/time constraint and frame the probability as a tail outcome despite credible Tesla risks. I find Forecaster 3 more convincing in calibration; Forecaster 2 is directionally right about Tesla fragility but materially overestimates the likelihood.\n",
    "rationale": "Update to my own reasoning: I initially framed the gap as roughly a 40 percentage-point relative move, which overstates the threshold if the move is concentrated in Tesla. More precisely, with TSLA ≈ $1.078T and WMT ≈ $0.769T, the cross occurs if (1+X_TSLA) < 0.713·(1+Y_WMT). If Walmart is flat, Tesla needs about a −28.7% move. If Walmart is +5–10%, Tesla needs roughly −25% to −21.6%. Over a 45-day horizon, Tesla’s effective sigma is plausibly ~25–30% (annualized 60–70% implies ~27–30% over 45 days), and Walmart’s ~7–9%. Treating moves as approximately normal with modest positive correlation, the event {WMT > TSLA by June 27} corresponds to P(X_TSLA − 0.713·Y_WMT < −0.287). With s_TSLA ≈ 0.27, s_WMT ≈ 0.08, and rho ≈ 0.2, this yields an order-of-magnitude probability around 14% (± a few points). That’s higher than my initial 8%.\nCatalysts around the window cut both ways. Bearish for Tesla: valuation sensitivity, margin pressure, and the risk that a June Robotaxi “launch” underwhelms. Bullish for Walmart: potential earnings strength (mid-May), e-commerce inflection, and tariff relief lowering COGS. Bullish for Tesla/bearish for the thesis: a positive Robotaxi preview or broader risk-on/rate cut dynamics could widen the gap. Net, the base-rate calculation plus Tesla’s fat left tail argue for a mid-teens probability, while the dual-catalyst asymmetry (Tesla has a higher-variance event) prevents pushing much lower. I adjust upward from 8% to 16% to reflect the corrected threshold math and TSLA’s heavy-tail downside risk, while still giving significant weight to the large-cap/timeframe constraint.\n",
