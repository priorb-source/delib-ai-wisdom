  "information": "As of March 12, 2025, BC Hydro officially excluded Tesla products, including electric vehicle chargers, energy storage batteries, and inverters, from its CleanBC and BC Hydro rebate programs. The stated reason for the policy change is to preference Canadian goods and exclude U.S.-produced goods where practicable, as part of a broader trade dispute. The EV charger rebate for single-family homes covers up to 50% of the cost, to a maximum of $350. The policy was publicly defended by B.C. Premier David Eby and Energy Minister Adrian Dix. Products purchased or pre-approved before March 12, 2025, remain eligible for the rebate.",

    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "About 1 month (check on/after July 1, 2025)",
    "status_quo_outcome": "Yes — the BC Hydro page continues to state Tesla products are not eligible for the EV home charger rebate.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "BC Hydro removes the brand-specific wording on that specific page (e.g., shifts to generic “U.S.-produced goods are excluded” or omits mention entirely), or reverses the policy and re-includes Tesla.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Policy remains in place and the page retains explicit language that Tesla products are not eligible for the home charger rebate.",
    "rationale": "- Short horizon favors stasis. As of March 12, 2025, BC Hydro explicitly excluded Tesla products from CleanBC/BC Hydro rebates, and provincial leaders publicly defended the move as a Buy-Canadian preference. Over ~1 month, a full policy reversal is unlikely absent legal or trade intervention. The default is that the exclusion stays and the page text remains.\n- Key resolution quirk: The question resolves Yes only if that specific page still explicitly mentions Tesla as ineligible. Even if Tesla remains ineligible in practice, a wording change to brand-neutral language on that page would yield a No. This is the main risk.\n- Why not higher: There is a meaningful chance (roughly 20–30%) that communications teams revise the page to generic “U.S.-produced goods are excluded” language or relocate/condense content, removing the Tesla callout while keeping the policy. Also a small chance of rapid policy softening due to legal pressure or public backlash.\n- Why not lower: Government signaling has been firm; reversal within a month is improbable. Keeping the explicit Tesla mention helps reduce customer confusion, and the page was recently updated to name Tesla, suggesting they might maintain clarity at least through the summer.\n- Up/down updates: I’d increase the probability if BC Hydro or the ministry reiterates the Tesla-specific exclusion or the page gets an update in June that still names Tesla. I’d decrease it if credible reports indicate a legal challenge, policy review, federal/provincial guidance to avoid brand-specific naming, or if the page is revised toward generic U.S.-origin language before July 1.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill BC Hydro still exclude Tesla from its EV charger rebate program for single-family homes in July 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nAccording to the resolution source, \"The Government of B.C. and BC Hydro are taking action to preference Canadian goods in our rebate programs going forward and to exclude, where practicable, U.S. produced goods. As of March 12, 2025, Tesla products (electric vehicle chargers, energy storage batteries and inverters) are not eligible for CleanBC and BC Hydro rebates. If you purchased or have received pre-approval for your Tesla product before March 12, 2025, it can still qualify for rebates and will be processed as normal.\"\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if BC Hydro at [this page](https://www.bchydro.com/powersmart/electric-vehicles/rebates-incentives/rebates-home-chargers.html) when checked by Metaculus on or after July 1, 2025, says that Tesla products are not eligible for the EV charger at home program. If it does not mention Tesla being ineligible, then this question resolves as **No**.\n\n\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nAs of March 12, 2025, BC Hydro officially excluded Tesla products, including electric vehicle chargers, energy storage batteries, and inverters, from its CleanBC and BC Hydro rebate programs.

Products purchased or pre-approved before March 12, 2025, remain eligible for the rebate.\n\nToday is 2025-05-30.\n\nBefore answering you think:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n(e) You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
