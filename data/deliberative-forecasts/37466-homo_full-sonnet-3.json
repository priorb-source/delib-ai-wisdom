    "review": "Both forecasters raise compelling arguments that strengthen the case for a lower probability. Most significantly, they emphasize a point I underweighted: the 3.5+ month delay AFTER WorldAtlas demonstrated clear awareness by updating their article title. This is indeed the strongest signal available. If WorldAtlas intended to update their map, they likely would have done so contemporaneously with the article title change in January/February, or shortly after seeing Google make the change. The fact that they've maintained the traditional naming on their map while acknowledging the controversy in their article suggests a deliberate editorial policy of caution. Forecaster 3's framing is particularly persuasive: 'The long delay after demonstrable awareness is the strongest signal they're unlikely to update the map in the remaining 54 days.' Both forecasters also correctly emphasize that map publishers typically require broad international consensus before changing centuries-old geographical names, and that consensus clearly doesn't exist given Mexican opposition and the IHO's non-recognition.",
    "rationale": "Upon reflection, I initially underweighted the significance of the time gap between awareness and inaction. The pattern is clear: WorldAtlas knows about the name change (article title proves this), had 3.5+ months to update their map, yet chose not to. This suggests their editorial policy is to maintain established geographical names on primary cartographic products absent broad international consensus. The article title accommodation appears to be their compromise position - acknowledging the controversy without endorsing the unilateral U.S. change on their authoritative map. The clustering of expert opinion around 23-25% also suggests my initial 30% was slightly high. However, I don't want to go as low as 23% because: (1) 54 days remains non-trivial time, (2) unexpected developments could occur (though none are signaled), and (3) the article title change does show some willingness to adapt. The evidence suggests strong status quo bias but not absolute certainty.",
