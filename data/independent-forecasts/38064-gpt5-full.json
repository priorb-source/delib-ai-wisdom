  "information": "GameStop's annual shareholder meetings have historically been held in the first half of June. Recent meetings have shown a pattern of being held on a Thursday. Past dates include June 2, 2022 (Thursday), June 15, 2023 (Thursday), and an initial schedule of June 13, 2024 (Thursday). The 2024 virtual meeting was adjourned to a later date after its servers crashed due to overwhelming interest from shareholders attempting to join the webcast.\n\nAs of late May 2025, no definitive proxy statement (DEF 14A) filed by GameStop with the SEC for its 2025 annual meeting has been located. According to SEC rules, such a filing is required ahead of a shareholder meeting. Business information aggregators present conflicting information: Computershare, GameStop's transfer agent, lists the meeting for June 2, 2025, while sources like Business Insider and Bloomberg terminals list June 12, 2025. The Business Insider entry also contains an apparent error regarding a dividend payment.\n\nIt is standard corporate practice for companies to avoid rescheduling an annual meeting within a two-week period unless there is a significant reason. Meetings can sometimes be intentionally adjourned if a controversial proposal requires more time for proxy solicitation. GameStop has previously done this for a share-increase motion. The technical failure that affected GameStop's 2024 meeting is a known risk, though many other large-cap companies regularly hold virtual meetings without major incidents.",

    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "16 days (until June 12, 2025)",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "GameStop files its DEF 14A setting a different date (late June/July), or it does set June 12 but the meeting is adjourned due to technical issues or quorum/solicitation needs, so it does not fully complete on June 12.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "A DEF 14A appears within days naming June 12, the virtual platform handles load without incident, and the meeting fully completes on June 12.",
    "rationale": "- What we know: Per the assistant’s research, there is no DEF 14A on file as of May 27. Aggregators conflict (Computershare lists June 2, Bloomberg/Business Insider list June 12). Historically, GameStop holds early-to-mid June Thursday meetings; June 12, 2025 is a Thursday. In 2024, the virtual meeting crashed and was adjourned.\n- Interpreting the signals: The Computershare June 2 entry is likely wrong given typical notice requirements; there isn’t enough time. Bloomberg/BI showing June 12 fits the weekday pattern, but third-party calendars sometimes carry placeholders. Without a definitive proxy, the date is not confirmed.\n- Process constraints: Public companies usually give 20+ days’ notice via the DEF 14A; Delaware law allows as few as 10 days, so June 12 remains possible but atypically tight. The lack of a proxy by May 27 meaningfully lowers the chance that June 12 is the real date.\n- Completion risk: Even if June 12 is scheduled, the meeting must fully complete that day to resolve Yes. After 2024’s crash, GameStop likely hardens its setup, so the failure/adjournment risk is modest but non-trivial relative to peers.\n- Decomposition: P(meeting scheduled for June 12) is below even odds due to the missing proxy but still material because of the historical pattern and multiple calendars listing that date. Conditional on scheduling, P(full completion on that day) is high but not certain. A plausible split is ~45% it’s set for June 12 and ~85% it completes that day, yielding ~38% overall.\n- Why not higher: No DEF 14A yet; tight notice window; prior-year disruption adds tail risk of adjournment.\n- Why not lower: June 12 is a Thursday matching historic cadence; multiple sources point to that date; minimum 10-day notice makes it still feasible.\n- What would move me up: A DEF 14A or company press release naming June 12; transfer agent/company site confirmation; a disclosed record date consistent with June 12; evidence of a robust webcast plan.\n- What would move me down: Any filing or credible company communication setting a different date; silence through early June; signs of a proxy fight or controversial proposals likely to trigger adjournment.",

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
