    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Approximately 16 days until July 1, 2025",
    "status_quo_outcome": "Most likely an OpenAI model remains at or near the top of the leaderboard, though the exact current ranking is unknown",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "A competitor model from Anthropic, Google, or another company holds the #1 position on July 1st, with OpenAI ranked #2 or lower. This could occur if recent releases from competitors have proven superior or if OpenAI hasn't maintained its competitive edge in recent months",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "An OpenAI model (likely GPT-4-turbo, GPT-4.5, or GPT-5 variant) holds the #1 overall rank on July 1st, either maintaining its current position or having recently claimed it. The resolution criteria counts ties as Yes, which increases the likelihood",
    "rationale": "With only 16 days until resolution, this forecast heavily weights status quo effects - dramatic leaderboard shifts are unlikely in such a short timeframe unless a major new model launches. OpenAI has historically been highly competitive on Chatbot Arena with GPT-4 variants, consistently ranking at or near the top. The research assistant provided no information about current standings, creating significant uncertainty about whether OpenAI currently holds #1. Key considerations: (1) Historical competitiveness: OpenAI has maintained top-tier positions on this leaderboard throughout 2024 and likely into 2025. (2) Short timeframe: 16 days is insufficient for major competitive shifts unless a surprise model release occurs. (3) Competitive landscape: Anthropic (Claude 3.5/4), Google (Gemini), and others present strong competition. (4) Tie allowance: The resolution counts ties as Yes, slightly improving odds. My forecast isn't higher because I lack current data and must account for strong competition from multiple well-resourced labs. It isn't lower because of the extremely short timeframe and OpenAI's strong historical performance. I would update higher with evidence OpenAI currently holds #1, or lower with evidence of a recent competitor surge or imminent rival model launch",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill an OpenAI model be ranked #1 overall on the Chatbot Arena Leaderboard at the end of the 2nd Quarter of 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nMethodology: [Chatbot Arena: An Open Platform for Evaluating LLMs by Human Preference](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.04132)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if a model owned by OpenAI is in the number 1 overall rank (ties count) at the [Chatbot Arena Leaderboard](https://lmarena.ai/leaderboard) when accessed by Metaculus on or after July 1, 2025. If this is not the case, this question resolves as **No**.\n\nScroll down to Arena Overview and the resolution is based on the \"overall\" rank.\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nNo additional information available.\n\nToday is 2025-06-15.\n\nBefore answering you think:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n(e) You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
