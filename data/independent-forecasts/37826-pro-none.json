    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Approximately 5 weeks. The question resolves on July 1, 2025.",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No. The current status quo is a tense but managed relationship without major kinetic attacks on sovereign territory. A kinetic strike by India into Pakistan proper would represent a significant escalation from the norm.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "The fragile ceasefire along the Line of Control largely holds through June 2025. No major terrorist attack occurs in India that would provoke a military response, and both nations continue to manage tensions through diplomatic back-channels and mutual deterrence, successfully avoiding a major escalation.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "A high-casualty terrorist attack occurs in India in late May or early June 2025, with credible links to a group based in Pakistan. Under intense domestic political pressure to retaliate, the Indian government authorizes a limited, retaliatory kinetic strike against perceived militant infrastructure inside one of the specified Pakistani provinces.",
    "rationale": "My forecast is based on the strong tendency towards the status quo in India-Pakistan relations. Major kinetic strikes inside Pakistan proper are rare, high-risk events, primarily due to the powerful deterrent of nuclear escalation. The last such confirmed event was the Balakot airstrike in 2019, which followed a significant provocation. For this question to resolve 'Yes', a similar major provocation, most likely a significant terrorist attack, would need to occur immediately before or during the narrow one-month window of June 2025. The research assistant's report indicates no current intelligence suggesting heightened tensions or preparations for such an attack. Therefore, the default forecast is No.\n\nMy probability is not lower (e.g., 1-2%) because the underlying conditions for conflict persist. The Indian government has demonstrated a political willingness to use such strikes in retaliation for provocations (e.g., 2016 and 2019), and the possibility of a triggering terrorist attack can never be fully discounted. This 'trigger-event' dependency means the probability, while low, is not negligible.\n\nMy probability is not higher (e.g., >10%) because such a strike is a tool of last resort, not a routine action. It requires a specific, severe provocation to overcome the immense risks of a wider war. The international community, particularly the US, would also likely exert significant pressure on both sides to de-escalate any crisis. Without an active, ongoing crisis pointing towards escalation, a higher probability is unwarranted for this specific 30-day period.\n\nI would increase my forecast significantly upon receiving credible reports of a major terrorist attack in India with alleged links to Pakistan or observing unusual Indian military buildups near the border. Conversely, I would decrease my forecast if there were unexpected high-level diplomatic breakthroughs between the two countries.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill the Indian Armed Forces execute a kinetic attack in Pakistan proper in June 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nWikipedia: [2025 India–Pakistan conflict](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2025_India%E2%80%93Pakistan_conflict)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if after May 31, 2025 and before July 1, 2025 the Indian Armed Forces execute a kinetic attack on targets in one of the following provinces of Pakistan: Sindh, Baluchistan, Punjab, or Khyber Pakhtunkhwa.\n\nTo count, an attack must be [kinetic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kinetic_military_action), using explosive weaponry or physical violence. Non-kinetic actions such as a cyberattack would not count, even one resulting in deaths.\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nNo additional information available.\n\nToday is 2025-05-22.\n\nBefore answering you think:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n(e) You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
