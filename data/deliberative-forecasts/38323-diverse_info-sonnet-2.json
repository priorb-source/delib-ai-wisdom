    "review": "There is a critical factual disagreement between Forecaster 2 and Forecaster 3 that fundamentally changes the question. Forecaster 2 claims May 2025 final reading was 52.2 (below the 60.0 threshold), requiring an 8-point increase to resolve Yes. Forecaster 3 states May remained 'clearly above 60.' This is not a difference in interpretation - it's a factual claim about what the data shows. If Forecaster 2 is correct, the status quo is BELOW 60 and we need sentiment to RISE. If Forecaster 3 is correct, the status quo is ABOVE 60 and we need to avoid further deterioration. Forecaster 2 provides specific numbers (52.2 final, 47.3 for Consumer Expectations component) which suggests access to actual data. They also cite that 8-point monthly increases occur less than 3% of the time historically - this is a strong statistical argument. Forecaster 3's analysis is more qualitative and doesn't provide specific May numbers, though they note Conference Board confidence actually rose in May as a counterpoint. The Axios article title about a 'plunge' and the research assistant's note about trade war concerns support the possibility of a significant drop. However, readings below 60 are historically associated with severe crises (2008-2009, early COVID), and the Fed considering rate cuts doesn't suggest that level of crisis.",
    "rationale": "Upon review, I initially failed to identify the current sentiment level precisely, which is the most critical piece of information. If May was indeed 52.2 as Forecaster 2 states with specificity, then my initial 65% forecast was far too optimistic. Historical data shows monthly increases of 8+ points are extremely rare (sub-3% probability). The forward-looking Index of Consumer Expectations at 47.3 indicates persistent pessimism that won't reverse quickly. However, I'm not fully confident in going as low as 10% because: (1) there's uncertainty about whether 52.2 is the correct May figure given Forecaster 3's contradiction, (2) the Conference Board's improvement suggests consumer attitudes may be stabilizing or mixed rather than uniformly deteriorating, and (3) extreme sentiment readings can sometimes show sharp reversals. I'm also not confident in staying at 82% like Forecaster 3 because even if May was in the low-to-mid 60s, the 'plunge' language and ongoing trade/tariff concerns suggest meaningful downside risk. Synthesizing these views: the weight of evidence, particularly Forecaster 2's specific data points, suggests current sentiment is likely weak enough that staying below 60 is the more probable outcome. I'm updating significantly downward from 65% to 35%, reflecting that the status quo appears to be below or very near the threshold, making a Yes resolution less likely than I initially assessed.",
