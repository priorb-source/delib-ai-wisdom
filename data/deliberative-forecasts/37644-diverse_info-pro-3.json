    "review": "The deliberation with my fellow forecasters was highly valuable. We reached a consensus on the primary factors pointing to a 'No' outcome: the extremely short 6.5-week timeline and Anthropic's recent, massive private funding round which reduces their immediate need for public capital. Forecaster 2 compellingly argued that the complete absence of any public preparatory signals—such as hiring investment banks or media leaks—is a strong piece of evidence in itself, given the magnitude of such an IPO. Forecaster 3 provided crucial insights into the procedural mechanics of an IPO, highlighting that a public S-1 filing is typically preceded by a confidential filing process with the SEC, and that a website announcement is highly unlikely due to regulatory 'gun-jumping' concerns. These arguments effectively narrow the path to a 'Yes' resolution and increase the friction within the already tight timeline.",
    "rationale": "I am updating my forecast downward from 10% to 5%. My initial forecast did not adequately account for the specific procedural hurdles of the IPO process, which my fellow forecasters detailed effectively. The point that a confidential S-1 filing would almost certainly precede the public one (which is the resolution trigger) significantly compresses the feasible timeline. If Anthropic had started this process weeks ago to target a pre-July 1 public filing, the complete lack of leaks or rumors, as noted by Forecaster 2, becomes a much more powerful negative signal. The combination of these factors—a very short timeframe, a lack of financial need due to the March 2025 funding round, the absence of any preparatory signals, and the procedural friction of the filing process—convinces me that the probability of a 'Yes' resolution is lower than I originally estimated. I am reducing my forecast by half to reflect this strengthened conviction in a 'No' outcome.",
