    "review": "Both forecasters raised critical information I completely missed. Most importantly, Forecaster 3 identified a 10% U.S. tariff on bananas that began April 5, 2025 - this is a major upward pressure I failed to account for and fundamentally changes the analysis. Even with partial pass-through and promotional pricing dynamics, a tariff of this magnitude could easily add 2-4 cents per pound to retail prices. Forecaster 2's emphasis on Dole's Q1 results showing higher fruit costs and shipping expenses reinforces the cost pressure narrative. However, I find Forecaster 2's claim that recent prices are 'just above $0.630' inconsistent with the March 2025 data at 62.5 cents I was working from. Forecaster 3's forecast of 22% appears more defensible given the tariff evidence, though I think it may be slightly too pessimistic given we're halfway through May without reports of dramatic price spikes. The loss-leader dynamics and typical lag in retail pass-through provide some buffer. Both forecasters appropriately weighted the proximity to the threshold (only 0.5 cents above in March) as a key risk factor I underappreciated.",
    "rationale": "My original 72% forecast was far too optimistic because I failed to account for the April 5, 2025 tariff implementation - a critical piece of policy context that creates strong upward price pressure for May. While I correctly identified the status quo trend (62.1 cents in January, 62.5 cents in March suggesting gradual increase), I significantly underweighted: (1) the magnitude of the new tariff's potential impact, (2) the tightness of the threshold with only 0.5 cents of buffer, and (3) the cumulative effect of multiple cost pressures (tariffs, shipping, port fees) mentioned in the Quartz article. However, I'm not dropping to Forecaster 3's 22% because: we're already halfway through May with no reports of dramatic price increases; bananas' role as loss leaders creates retail pricing stickiness; and there's typically a lag between wholesale cost shocks and retail prices. The tariff only started April 5, so May's average includes early-month data potentially unaffected by it. A 10% tariff on wholesale prices would theoretically add 4-5 cents, but retail pass-through is rarely 100% immediate. Balancing the strong upward pressure against lag effects and promotional pricing, I'm updating significantly downward to 32%.",
