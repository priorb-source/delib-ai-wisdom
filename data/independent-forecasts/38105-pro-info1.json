  "information": "As of late May 2025, an International Monetary Fund (IMF) mission is in Beirut for formal negotiations with the Lebanese government. The first negotiating session took place on May 29-30, with a second round scheduled for June 10. According to officials, a draft 46-month Extended Fund Facility (EFF) worth approximately US$3 billion is being discussed. Lebanon's Finance Minister, Yassine Jaber, stated that there has been progress in the talks, describing them as being on a 'good track.' He also affirmed that the government's plan involves better collection of existing taxes rather than imposing new ones. The Lebanese negotiating team includes the Minister of Economy, the Governor of the Central Bank, and other experts, meeting with the IMF delegation led by Ernesto Rigo.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "1 month",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No agreement is reached. Lebanon's economic crisis continues, with political gridlock preventing the implementation of necessary reforms to secure IMF support.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Despite the ongoing talks, deep divisions within the Lebanese government over key IMF-mandated reforms, such as restructuring the banking sector or implementing capital controls, prevent a consensus. Vested interests block the deal, and the June negotiations stall, causing the IMF mission to leave without an agreement before the July 1 deadline.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "The immense pressure of the ongoing economic collapse forces Lebanon's political factions to reach a consensus. The negotiations in June are successful, leading to a formal announcement of a signed agreement on the ~$3 billion Extended Fund Facility before July 1, 2025.",
    "rationale": "My forecast is driven by the strong, recent evidence of active and formal negotiations, which represents a significant break from the long-term status quo of inaction. The research assistant's report indicates that an IMF mission is currently in Beirut, a draft for a ~$3 billion Extended Fund Facility is on the table, and talks are scheduled to continue on June 10. The Lebanese Finance Minister's public confidence that talks are on a 'good track' is a key positive indicator. These factors suggest a high level of momentum and seriousness that has been absent in previous efforts. \n\nMy forecast is not higher because Lebanon has a well-established history of political gridlock and failure to implement reforms, even after reaching a preliminary staff-level agreement in 2022. Powerful vested interests, particularly in the banking sector and among political elites, have previously scuttled deals, and this remains the single largest risk. The one-month timeline is also very tight for finalizing such a complex agreement and securing the necessary political backing.\n\nMy forecast is not lower because the current negotiations appear more concrete and advanced than prior attempts. The specificity of the draft agreement and the presence of a high-level IMF delegation in Beirut for multiple rounds of talks are strong signals that the probability of success is now higher than the baseline historical failure rate. The severity of the economic crisis may finally be sufficient to force a political compromise.\n\nI would increase my forecast if key political factions, who have previously been obstacles, publicly endorse the reform plan. I would decrease it significantly if the June 10 talks are postponed or if reports emerge of a major political disagreement among the Lebanese negotiators.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill the IMF and Lebanon announce an agreement before July 1, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\n[Lebanon finance minister confident of a new deal with IMF to help crumbling economy](https://www.newarab.com/news/lebanon-finance-minister-confident-new-deal-imf)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if Lebanon and the International Monetary Fund announce any economic agreement between the two entities signed after the launch of this question and before July 1, 2025. In order to count, it must involve the IMF agreeing to provide money to Lebanon, whether through loans, grants, or any other means.\n\n\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nAs of late May 2025, an International Monetary Fund (IMF) mission is in Beirut for formal negotiations with the Lebanese government.

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
