  "information": "The White House has officially confirmed that President Donald Trump will attend the G7 summit in Canada from June 15-17, 2025. White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt stated that details of the visit would be announced shortly. Numerous media outlets reported the confirmation in late May 2025, and official G7 participant lists dated June 3 include Trump.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "About 12–14 days (G7 is June 15–17, 2025; attendance would be evident by arrival on June 15 and certain by June 17).",
    "status_quo_outcome": "Yes — Trump attends in person.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "A late-breaking development prevents in‑person travel: an acute health issue; a major domestic or international crisis that requires him to remain in Washington; a significant security threat; severe travel disruption; the summit is postponed/canceled or moved out of June; or he decides to send the Vice President/Secretary of State or join only virtually.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "He travels to Canada as planned and appears at leaders’ sessions and photo ops June 15–17, physically present with other heads of state (direct, unmediated interaction).",
    "rationale": "The base rate for G7 attendance by a sitting U.S. president is extremely high; non-attendance is rare and typically tied to extraordinary events. The research assistant reports that the White House has officially confirmed President Trump will attend the G7 in Canada (June 15–17) and that official participant lists dated June 3 include him. With roughly 12 days to go and concrete public commitments in place, the status quo strongly favors attendance. Travel to Canada is short and logistically straightforward, further reducing risk. I am not higher than this because there remains residual, non-trivial tail risk in the short run: sudden health issues (given age), an acute domestic or international crisis that compels him to stay in Washington, a credible security threat, severe flight/weather disruptions, or an unexpected schedule/political decision to skip or curtail attendance. I am not lower because (1) the White House’s explicit confirmation and inclusion on official lists are strong signals; (2) G7’s salience for the U.S. president is high; and (3) the time window for something to go wrong is relatively short. I would update upward (to ~98–99%) upon release of a detailed official schedule with specific arrival times, departure of Air Force One, or confirmed arrival on site and participation in the opening events. I would update downward on credible reports of health problems, an urgent domestic/international crisis requiring his presence, security advisories limiting travel, indications he will send a representative or attend virtually, or any sign of postponement/cancellation of the June summit.",

These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if US President Donald J. Trump attends in person a G7 summit held in June 2025.\n\n\"In person\" is defined as occupying the same physical space closely enough at the G7 Summit that he can see and hear other heads of state through direct un-intermediated exchange of photons and sound waves.\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nThe White House has officially confirmed that President Donald Trump will attend the G7 summit in Canada from June 15-17, 2025.

Numerous media outlets reported the confirmation in late May 2025, and official G7 participant lists dated June 3 include Trump.\n\nToday is 2025-06-03.\n\nBefore answering you think:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n(e) You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
