    "review": "Forecaster 2 raises a crucial point I underweighted: the resolution criteria are quite permissive - dual naming like 'Gulf of America formerly known as Gulf of Mexico' resolves as Yes. This is a much lower bar than complete replacement. Their emphasis on the article title 'Gulf Of Mexico (Gulf of America)' as a strong signal of willingness is compelling. This isn't just awareness; it's active implementation of a dual-naming format that could easily extend to the map.\n\nForecaster 3 makes valid counterpoints about technical friction (map assets vs article text) and the 4-month delay suggesting reluctance. However, I think they may be overweighting inertia. The article title change demonstrates WorldAtlas is tracking this and willing to act - the question is whether they'll extend it to the map.\n\nBoth forecasters helped me see that I was thinking too much about complete replacement rather than the dual-naming scenario. The key insight is that adding '(Gulf of America)' to their North America map would be a low-risk, low-cost way to acknowledge U.S. usage without abandoning the international standard. With 54 days remaining, that's sufficient time for a map update if they decide to proceed. The precedent of Google Maps doing exactly this for U.S. users provides cover for similar action by WorldAtlas.",
    "rationale": "I'm updating my forecast upward based primarily on Forecaster 2's argument about the permissive resolution criteria and the significance of the article title precedent. The fact that WorldAtlas already uses dual naming in their article title ('Gulf Of Mexico (Gulf of America)') is a concrete signal they're willing to acknowledge the new U.S. terminology. Extending this existing format to their North America map would be consistent with their demonstrated approach and requires minimal editorial commitment - they're not abandoning 'Gulf of Mexico', just adding a parenthetical acknowledgment.\n\nHowever, I'm not going as high as 65% because: (1) the 4-month delay between the executive order and now, despite the article title update, suggests either technical friction or deliberate caution about map changes, (2) WorldAtlas is Canadian-based with international audience considerations, and (3) major publishers like National Geographic and Apple haven't made changes, reducing peer pressure.\n\nThe balance point is around 47% - meaningfully higher than my original 35% due to the dual-naming criterion and existing precedent, but acknowledging substantial uncertainty about whether they'll take the additional step of updating the map within the 54-day window.",
