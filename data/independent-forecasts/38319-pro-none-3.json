    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Approximately 17 days. The announcement is expected around June 21, 2025.",
    "status_quo_outcome": "Given the high month-to-month volatility of industrial production data, the status quo is not a continuation of strong growth. After a significant 7.6% increase in March, which followed two months of decline, a return to a more muted performance is expected. Therefore, the status quo outcome is a flat or slight month-over-month decrease in April.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "The large 7.6% increase in March was a one-time rebound from previous production disruptions. In April, production regresses toward the mean as industries normalize their output levels or face weakening external demand. The final announced figure is 0.0% or lower.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "The strong performance in March marks the beginning of a broader recovery. Favorable economic conditions, such as sustained domestic and international demand for Tohoku's industrial goods (e.g., automotive parts, electronics), persist into April, leading to another month of positive, albeit likely more modest, growth.",
    "rationale": "My forecast of 45% is based on the inherent volatility of industrial production indices and the principle of mean reversion. The primary piece of information is the 7.6% month-over-month (MoM) increase in March 2025, which followed two consecutive months of decline. While this is a strong positive signal, it is not sufficient to establish a new trend of growth. Large positive swings in volatile data series are often followed by a pullback or consolidation in the subsequent period. The March figure could represent a 'catch-up' from the weakness in January and February rather than the start of a sustained expansion. Therefore, the status quo is one of high volatility, making a slight contraction in April as likely, if not slightly more likely, than continued growth. My probability is not higher because a second consecutive month of growth following such a large jump would be atypical without stronger evidence of a fundamental economic shift. It is not lower because the March data provides clear evidence of existing positive momentum that could have easily carried over into April. I would increase my forecast with data showing strong April export orders, improved business sentiment, or positive PMI readings for the manufacturing sector. I would decrease it upon news of renewed supply chain issues, a substantial appreciation of the yen, or a sharp decline in global demand indicators for April.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill the Northeast Japan region (Tohoku) show a month-over-month increase in April 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\n[Tohoku's March industrial production index rises 7.6% from the previous month, the first increase in three months](https://www.nikkei.com/article/DGXZQOCC214DI0R20C25A5000000/)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if the [industrial production announcement](https://www.tohoku.meti.go.jp/cyosa/tokei/iip.html) for April 2025 (expected approximately June 21, 2025) reports a monthly change in production (\"生産\") of greater than 0.0%.\n\n\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nNo additional information available.\n\nToday is 2025-06-04.\n\nBefore answering you think:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n(e) You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
