    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Approximately 56 days (from May 6, 2025 to July 1, 2025)",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No - Nord Stream 2 AG remains on the OFAC sanctions list",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "The White House debate on lifting sanctions continues or concludes without action before July 1, 2025. Political opposition, concerns about sending the wrong message regarding Russia, ongoing Russia-Ukraine tensions, or Congressional resistance prevent the administration from removing Nord Stream 2 AG from the sanctions list within the timeframe.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "The White House rapidly concludes its internal debate and decides to lift sanctions on Nord Stream 2 AG as part of a broader policy shift, energy strategy, or diplomatic initiative. The administration successfully implements this removal from the OFAC list before July 1, 2025, possibly as part of wider negotiations or an energy security framework.",
    "rationale": "Status quo strongly favors the No outcome. Nord Stream 2 AG is currently sanctioned, and sanctions typically persist unless there is a deliberate policy reversal. The Politico article from April 23, 2025 indicates the White House is 'debating' the issue, suggesting early-stage consideration rather than imminent action. With only 56 days until the resolution date, the window for such a significant policy shift is narrow. Several factors reinforce the status quo: (1) Lifting sanctions on Russian energy infrastructure would be politically controversial and face Congressional scrutiny; (2) The Russia-Ukraine situation likely constrains diplomatic flexibility; (3) Policy changes of this magnitude typically require extensive interagency coordination and vetting, which takes time beyond 56 days. However, the probability is not negligible because: (1) The White House is actively debating this, indicating it's under serious consideration; (2) Executive authority could enable relatively rapid implementation if decided; (3) Unforeseen geopolitical developments could accelerate decision-making. My forecast is not higher because early-stage debates rarely result in major policy actions within 8 weeks, and the political costs are substantial. It's not lower because the active White House consideration documented in recent reporting means this possibility cannot be dismissed entirely. I would update higher with evidence of imminent decisions, senior officials championing the change, or breakthrough diplomatic developments. I would update lower with strong opposition statements, Congressional action to block such moves, or reports that internal deliberations have concluded against lifting sanctions.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill the US lift its sanctions on Nord Stream 2 before July 1, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\n[White House debates lifting sanctions on Russian energy assets, Nord Stream](https://www.politico.com/news/2025/04/23/white-house-debating-lifting-sanctions-on-russian-energy-assets-00306486)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if NORD STREAM 2 AG does not appear at Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) [Sanctions List Search tool](https://sanctionssearch.ofac.treas.gov/) when checked by Metaculus on or after July 1, 2025. If it does appear on the Specially Designated Nationals and Blocked Persons (SDN) List at that time, then this question resolves as **No**.\n\nAt the time of this question, the current listing of Nord Stream 2 by OFAC can be found [here](https://sanctionssearch.ofac.treas.gov/Details.aspx?id=31926).\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nNo additional information available.\n\nToday is 2025-05-06.\n\nBefore answering you think:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n(e) You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
