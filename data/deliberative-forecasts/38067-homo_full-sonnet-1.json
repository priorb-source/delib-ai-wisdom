    "review": "The other forecasters converge strongly with my analysis, all identifying the same key factors: 40% historical base rate, recent male winners in 2023-2024, equity initiatives showing impact on regional but not yet national awards, and Piuma's confirmed finalist status. Forecaster 2 made an excellent point I hadn't fully articulated: with typically ~5 finalists per category, a random baseline would be 20%, but women win at 40% historically, suggesting they win at twice the random rate when competitive. This is actually encouraging for a female winner. However, Forecaster 2 and 3 both settled on 35% versus my 38%, and their reasoning about the typical finalist structure is compelling - if there are approximately 5 finalists and only Piuma is named as female, this implies 4 male finalists who collectively represent strong competition. Forecaster 3 also makes a valid statistical point that two consecutive male winners isn't necessarily a strong trend, though it is relevant recent data.",
    "rationale": "Upon reflection, I think the typical finalist structure argument (approximately 5 finalists, with likely 4 males if only Piuma is named) deserves more weight than I initially gave it. This suggests the male competition is substantial. However, I still believe the 40% historical base rate combined with demonstrable equity momentum (even if lagging in national categories) justifies being slightly above the 35% consensus. The recent 0/2 streak is concerning but not definitively predictive. My original 38% already incorporated most concerns about recent trends and national award conservatism. The tight clustering of forecasts (35%, 35%, 38%) suggests genuine convergence on the evidence rather than any one perspective being dramatically off. I'll update slightly downward to acknowledge the finalist structure argument while maintaining that historical precedent and equity initiatives provide upward pressure that others may be slightly underweighting.",
