    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Slightly less than two months.",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No. The government of Alberta continues to govern within the Canadian federation and does not announce a date for an independence referendum.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "The United Conservative Party government under Premier Danielle Smith continues its strategy of confronting the federal government on policy issues like energy and environmental regulations using tools such as the Alberta Sovereignty Act and legal challenges. However, it stops short of taking the drastic step of calling a referendum, viewing the political and economic risks as too high and support for separation as insufficient to justify such a move. The July 1, 2025 deadline passes without any official announcement.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "A new, major conflict erupts between Alberta and the federal government, such as the imposition of a punitive federal policy seen as catastrophic for Alberta's economy. In response to a surge of public anger and to consolidate her political base, Premier Smith makes a surprise announcement, scheduling an independence referendum as a measure of last resort to assert Alberta's autonomy.",
    "rationale": "My forecast is heavily weighted towards the status quo. While tensions between Alberta and the federal government are significant, as highlighted by the Politico article, moving from political friction to scheduling an independence referendum is a monumental step. The base rate for such events is extremely low, especially on a short timeline of less than two months. Calling a referendum would require immense political capital, a clear strategic plan, and broad caucus support, none of which appears to be in place for an immediate announcement. The current Alberta government's strategy has been to use confrontational rhetoric and legislative tools like the Sovereignty Act to gain leverage within Canada, not to actively pave the way for secession. My probability is not lower than 3% because the political environment is volatile. The Premier has a track record of bold, sometimes unexpected, political maneuvers. A severe, unforeseen provocation from the federal government could conceivably trigger a reactive decision to call a referendum to rally a populist base. This remains a low-probability 'tail risk'. My probability is not higher than 3% because there is no tangible evidence of preparations for such a vote. Furthermore, despite frustration with Ottawa, polls have consistently shown that a clear majority of Albertans do not support independence. Initiating a referendum without a high chance of success would be a massive political gamble with significant economic and political downside. To increase my forecast, I would need to see evidence of active planning, such as senior government officials openly discussing a referendum timeline or a sudden, dramatic spike in polling support for separation following a new federal-provincial crisis. To decrease my forecast, I would look for signs of de-escalation, such as a major collaborative agreement between the two governments.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nBefore July 1, 2025, will the government of Alberta officially announce a date for an independence referendum?\n\nQuestion background:\nPolitico: [The quiet threat to Canadian unity isn’t Quebec — it’s Alberta](https://www.politico.com/news/2025/04/27/the-quiet-threat-to-canadian-unity-isnt-quebec-its-alberta-00311719)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if, before July 1, 2025, a referendum on the independence of Alberta from Canada is officially scheduled. If this does not occur before that date, this question resolves as **No**.\n\nFor purposes of this question, the referendum will be considered \"officially scheduled\" when it is announced by a person or entity with the authority to do so within Alberta. Please note that broader legality, such as within Canada, will be considered irrelevant for this question, so if the federal government declared the referendum illegal, the question would still resolve as Yes.\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nNo additional information available.\n\nToday is 2025-05-07.\n\nBefore answering you think:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n(e) You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
