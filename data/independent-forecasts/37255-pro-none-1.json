    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "2 months",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No. Libya has not ratified the AfCFTA due to persistent political instability and legislative gridlock. Without a significant change, this state of inaction will continue.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Libya's rival political factions fail to reach a consensus or establish a functioning, unified legislature. The country's leaders remain preoccupied with internal power struggles, security, and managing oil revenues. The short two-month deadline passes with no progress on the AfCFTA ratification instrument.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "An unexpected and rapid political reconciliation occurs, uniting the rival governments. As a confidence-building measure and a signal to international partners, the newly unified legislature fast-tracks the ratification of several pending international treaties, including the AfCFTA, pushing it through just before the July 1, 2025 deadline.",
    "rationale": "My forecast is overwhelmingly driven by Libya's deeply entrenched political instability and institutional paralysis, which represents a powerful status quo. The country has been split between rival governments for years, creating a legislative deadlock that prevents the ratification of major international treaties. The process of ratification requires a stable, functioning legislative body to debate and approve the agreement, which Libya currently lacks. The deadline of July 1, 2025, just two months away, is an exceptionally short timeframe for such a complex political and legal procedure, even for a stable country. Libya's political actors are focused on more immediate existential issues like security, political succession, and control over the nation's resources, making a trade agreement a very low priority. The fact that Libya signed the agreement back in 2019 but has made no progress towards ratification in the intervening years underscores the long-standing nature of these obstacles. My probability is not lower than 2% to account for a highly improbable 'black swan' event, such as a sudden internationally-brokered peace deal that includes fast-tracking such agreements. I would raise my forecast only in the event of a credible report of a unified government being formed and scheduling a vote on this specific issue. The lack of any additional information from my research assistant confirms there are no current developments that would challenge this assessment.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill Libya ratify AfCFTA (the pan-African free trade agreement) before July 1, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nWikipedia: [African Continental Free Trade Area](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/African_Continental_Free_Trade_Area)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if Libya ratifies the African Continental Free Trade Area (AfCFTA) Agreement before July 1, 2025.\n\n\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nNo additional information available.\n\nToday is 2025-05-01.\n\nBefore answering you think:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n(e) You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
