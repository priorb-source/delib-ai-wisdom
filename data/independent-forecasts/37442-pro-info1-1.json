  "information": "In late 2024 and early 2025, Berkshire Hathaway was a net seller of stocks, increasing its cash position to $348 billion by May 2025. The company reduced its holdings in Apple by 50% and also sold shares in Bank of America and Citigroup. New positions were initiated in Constellation Brands, while existing stakes in Occidental Petroleum, SiriusXM Holdings, Pool Corp, and Verisign were increased. During the first quarter of 2025, Berkshire's purchases included additions to Verisign, Sirius XM, and Occidental Petroleum, as well as an estimated $2.7 billion investment in five Japanese trading houses.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "The 13F filing for Q1 2025 is due by May 15, 2025. As today is May 6, 2025, the outcome will be known in approximately 9 days.",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No. The status quo would be for Berkshire Hathaway to maintain its existing holdings without making a significant purchase, especially during a quarter where they were reportedly net sellers of stock.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Berkshire Hathaway's Q1 2025 13F filing is released on or before its due date and reports holdings of Domino's Pizza stock at a level of 2,382,000 shares or fewer. This aligns with the report that Berkshire was a net seller of equities and did not mention Domino's among its Q1 purchases.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "The Q1 2025 13F filing reveals that Berkshire Hathaway now holds a quantity of Domino's Pizza shares greater than 2,382,000. This would have occurred if Berkshire's managers saw a compelling value in Domino's during the quarter, prompting them to increase their stake despite their broader trend of selling equities.",
    "rationale": "My forecast heavily weights the provided research indicating Berkshire Hathaway was a net seller of stocks in early 2025, increasing its substantial cash position. This defensive stance makes a significant increase in any single stock position less likely. Furthermore, the report details the specific companies where Berkshire did increase its stakes (e.g., Occidental, Verisign, SiriusXM, Japanese trading houses), and Domino's Pizza is not mentioned. The absence of Domino's from this list is a strong piece of evidence against a 'Yes' outcome. The default action for a long-term holder like Berkshire is often to do nothing, which would also lead to a 'No' resolution.\n\nMy probability is not lower than 15 because Berkshire is famously opportunistic. With a massive cash hoard, they can act quickly if a favored company's stock price becomes particularly attractive. A price dip in DPZ during Q1 could have triggered a purchase by one of the investment managers, even if it ran counter to the firm's overall quarterly trend. The initial investment implies a fundamental belief in the business, making an add-on purchase plausible under the right conditions.\n\nMy probability is not higher because the direct evidence from the research report points overwhelmingly to a 'No' outcome. Ignoring both the firm's macro-level activity (net selling) and the specific list of companies they purchased would be imprudent. To raise my forecast, I would need to see evidence that contradicts the research report, such as a major, unexplained spike in DPZ's trading volume during Q1 or insider reports suggesting Berkshire was accumulating shares.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill Berkshire Hathaway reveal a purchase of more Domino's Pizza stock in its Q1 2025 13F filing?\n\nQuestion background:\nRetailWire: [Domino’s Pizza Stake Purchased by Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway Group](https://retailwire.com/dominos-pizza-warren-buffett/)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if the 13F filing for Berkshire Hathaway, Inc., filed for the period ending 2025-03-31, reports the company holding greater than 2,382,000 shares of Domino's Pizza, Inc. (ticker symbol DPZ).\n\n\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nIn late 2024 and early 2025, Berkshire Hathaway was a net seller of stocks, increasing its cash position to $348 billion by May 2025. The company reduced its holdings in Apple by 50% and also sold shares in Bank of America and Citigroup.

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
