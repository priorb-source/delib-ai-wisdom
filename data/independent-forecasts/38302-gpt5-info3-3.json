  "information": "Specific components influencing China's inflation data include energy and food prices. Brent crude oil averaged $84 in May 2025, a 4% increase from a year earlier. However, the year-on-year change in domestic energy prices remained negative. Pork prices, a key component of the food basket, also remained lower than a year ago due to high inventories. On the policy front, the People's Bank of China implemented a 10 basis point reserve requirement ratio (RRR) cut in mid-May.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "About 10–12 days (NBS May CPI typically released around June 12; FRED usually updates shortly after)",
    "status_quo_outcome": "Yes — another mild negative YoY CPI print (deflation persists)",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Services and core inflation firm on May Day travel and reopening effects; food deflation (esp. pork) eases; domestic energy turns less negative or flat, pushing headline YoY to 0% or slightly positive",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Food (notably pork) remains clearly negative YoY and domestic energy stays negative; core remains subdued, so these drags outweigh modest services inflation and keep headline CPI below 0% YoY",
    "rationale": "- Benchmark and trend: April CPI was negative YoY, and the framing of a potential fourth consecutive negative suggests Feb–Apr were also below 0%. Given China’s slow-moving demand backdrop and weak property sector, the base case is continuation rather than a quick reversal. \n- Components: The research assistant notes (1) Brent crude averaged +4% YoY in May but domestic energy prices remained negative YoY, indicating energy likely still drags on headline CPI; (2) Pork prices remained lower YoY due to high inventories, which is important because pork is a large and volatile food component; (3) A 10bp RRR cut in mid-May signals policymakers see weak demand, and such easing typically has lags too long to lift May CPI materially.\n- Balance of risks: Core/services may firm in May due to holiday travel, which could lift MoM and nudge YoY toward zero. Still, with food and energy both likely negative YoY, headline CPI probably stays slightly below zero unless services strength is unusually robust or food deflation abates sharply.\n- Why not higher than my forecast: Services strength, potential base effects, and any stabilization in pork or energy could tip the headline to flat/slightly positive; China has seen quick swings around zero before. \n- Why not lower: Multiple drags are in place (food and energy) but core is likely modestly positive, limiting the magnitude of negative YoY.\n- What would move me: I’d raise the probability if high-frequency food data show continued pork weakness into late May, or if official previews/press indicate continued energy price declines. I’d lower it if there’s evidence of stronger-than-expected services inflation around the holiday, a noticeable rebound in pork prices late May, or reports that domestic fuel price adjustments turned energy neutral/positive YoY.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill China experience a 4th month in a row of deflation in its May CPI report?\n\nQuestion background:\nSCMP: [China’s consumer prices fall in April, fuelling fears of deflation](https://www.scmp.com/economy/economic-indicators/article/3309834/chinas-consumer-prices-fall-april-fuelling-fears-deflation)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if the \"Percent Change from Year Ago, Not Seasonally Adjusted\" data presented at [FRED Consumer Price Indices (CPIs, HICPs), COICOP 1999: Consumer Price Index: Total for China (CHNCPIALLMINMEI)](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/CHNCPIALLMINMEI#) is negative for May 2025.\n\n\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nSpecific components influencing China's inflation data include energy and food prices. Brent crude oil averaged $84 in May 2025, a 4% increase from a year earlier. However, the year-on-year change in domestic energy prices remained negative. Pork prices, a key component of the food basket, also remained lower than a year ago due to high inventories.

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
