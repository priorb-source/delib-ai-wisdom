    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "27 days",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No — with several bottom-tier teams in contention, the single most likely outcome is that some other team (e.g., White Sox/A’s/Marlins/Angels/Nationals) has the worst winning percentage on the snapshot date.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "By June 15, one of the other projected cellar-dwellers is a few games worse by percentage (or multiple teams are clustered at the bottom and the Rockies are a tick above them). Rockies go roughly .400 over the next four weeks while at least one peer goes .300 or worse.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "The Rockies continue to struggle against a tough NL West/early-summer schedule and post a poor stretch (e.g., 6–16) while peers pick up a bit, leaving Colorado alone (or tied) for the lowest winning percentage on June 15 per the MLB standings page.",
    "rationale": "- Timing and base rates: With ~70 games played by mid-June, variance remains meaningful. Even for a bottom-3 true-talent team, the chance of being the single worst on a specific date is modest unless they are already in last by a clear margin. We’re ~27 days out, so there’s room for swings of 3–5 wins relative to peers.\n- Team quality priors: Preseason projections and general consensus placed Colorado among the league’s worst teams again in 2025, but not uniquely so. The White Sox and A’s (and potentially Marlins/Angels/Nationals) plausibly share similar or worse true talent. That creates a small field (≈4–6 teams) competing for “worst,” which dilutes any one team’s probability absent a current, sizable deficit.\n- Schedule/context: The Rockies face a tough divisional environment (Dodgers, Padres, D-backs, Giants), which slightly increases their risk of being bottom on the snapshot date. Coors Field can produce some offense-driven volatility, so short streaks in either direction are plausible.\n- Evidence available: No current-standings snapshot was provided by the research assistant, so I can’t condition on whether the Rockies are already worst or how large the gap is. Given that, I weight the status quo (No) and rely on priors: Colorado is a prime candidate but not a prohibitive favorite to be dead last exactly on June 15.\n- Why not higher: Multiple similarly weak teams mean it’s less than a one-in-three shot unless the Rockies are already clearly in last (unknown here). Also, a 3–4 game swing over ~3–4 weeks is common, so even if they’re currently near the bottom, leapfrogs are likely.\n- Why not lower: Colorado’s true-talent outlook is poor and their divisional slate is tough, keeping them firmly in the bottom-tier cluster. That warrants a nontrivial probability.\n- Update triggers:\n  • If current standings show the Rockies already worst by ≥2 games in winning percentage: I’d raise to ~45–60%.\n  • If they’re tied for worst or within 1 game: ~30–40%.\n  • If they’re 2+ games better than the current worst: drop to ~10–15%.\n  • Significant injuries to key position players or starting pitchers, or an especially tough upcoming series slate, would move the estimate up; the reverse would move it down.\nNote: If ties count (the wording suggests that having the lowest winning percentage, even if shared, would qualify), that slightly increases the Rockies’ chances relative to a strict “sole worst” interpretation.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill the Colorado Rockies have the lowest winning percentage in the MLB on June 15, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nMile High Sports: [The Colorado Rockies have lost a generation of fans](https://milehighsports.com/the-colorado-rockies-have-lost-a-generation-of-fans/)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if the Colorado Rockies have the lowest winning percentage in Major League Baseball according to the [MLB official standings](https://www.mlb.com/standings/) when checked by Metaculus on or after June 15, 2025.\n\nNo other resolution source will be used to resolve the question. Question resolves based on how the page appears when checked by a Metaculus Admin.\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nNo additional information available.\n\nToday is 2025-05-19.\n\nBefore answering you think:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n(e) You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
