    "review": "Forecaster 2’s framing closely matches my priors: Morgan’s long history of flirting with runs but not entering, his explicit “observe the field” stance, and the heavy lift of launching a new party all push toward No by July 1. I agree with their mid‑teens floor due to active political moves and a campaign “blueprint” that keep a near‑term announcement plausible. Forecaster 3’s main new angle is that the field has now taken shape (Jolly, Pizzo, Donalds, possible Casey DeSantis), arguably satisfying Morgan’s stated condition to observe. I find that only mildly persuasive for a June announcement because (a) he also emphasized a very short campaign, which points to later timing, especially if he’s running outside the two parties, and (b) simultaneous party launch plus candidacy in the next 3–4 weeks still seems unlikely absent leaks or scheduling signals. Their 28% feels high given the very short window and lack of concrete near‑term indicators.",
    "rationale": "Key factors: (1) Time is short (~3.5 weeks). (2) Base rate: Morgan has previously signaled interest and not run (2018, 2022). (3) His May comments suggest waiting to see the field and a preference for a brief campaign—both consistent with announcing later, not by July 1, 2025. (4) Party formation appears to be his main current project; he can launch the party without immediately declaring a candidacy. (5) We lack credible signs of an imminent announcement (no reported event scheduling, filings, major ad buys, or coordinated endorsements). Countervailing: the field is crystallizing (Jolly’s entry), which could satisfy his “observe” criterion and create a window to pair a party launch with a candidacy. Net: I slightly increase my estimate to acknowledge the field‑crystallization argument, but absent concrete signals, a June announcement remains unlikely. I would raise meaningfully on reports of a scheduled announcement, state‑level candidate committee filings, or a party launch explicitly tied to his personal run; I would lower on statements pushing a decision to later in 2025/2026 or endorsing another candidate.",
