  "information": "Sweeping new tariffs were implemented by the US administration on April 2, 2025, which were followed by retaliatory measures from multiple countries. Subsequent shipping data showed that China-US bookings were down 45% year-over-year. Additionally, manufacturing PMI reports from the period indicated contracting activity in the sector.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Approximately 6 weeks. The US Census Bureau typically releases trade data about 6 weeks after month-end, so April 2025 data should be published around mid-June 2025.",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No - exports would not exceed April 2024 levels. When major trade disruptions occur like the tariffs implemented on April 2, 2025, the immediate effect is typically reduced trade volumes, not increases.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "The sweeping tariffs implemented on April 2, 2025, along with retaliatory measures from trading partners, substantially reduce US export volumes. The 45% year-over-year decline in China-US shipping bookings reflects broader export weakness across goods categories. Manufacturing PMI contraction indicates reduced production available for export. These factors combine to push April 2025 exports below the April 2024 baseline of $262,578 million.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Despite tariff disruptions, US exports exceed April 2024 levels due to some combination of: significant front-loading of shipments in the first day or two of April before tariffs fully materialized; strong service export growth offsetting goods declines; robust demand from non-tariff-affected countries; or dollar depreciation making US exports more price-competitive in certain markets.",
    "rationale": "The evidence overwhelmingly points toward a No outcome. The research assistant reports that sweeping tariffs were implemented on April 2, 2025 - meaning nearly the entire month operated under the new tariff regime. The 45% drop in China-US shipping bookings year-over-year is particularly damaging evidence, as China is a major trading partner. Retaliatory measures from multiple countries would further reduce demand for US exports. Manufacturing PMI showing contraction suggests reduced production capacity for exports.\n\nThe threshold requires April 2025 exports to exceed $262,578 million - essentially requiring year-over-year growth despite massive trade disruptions. While some front-loading might have occurred in early April, this would only affect 1-2 days of a 30-day month. Service exports (included in the total) are less affected by goods tariffs, but goods typically dominate total export values.\n\nMy forecast is not lower (closer to 0%) because: (1) there remains uncertainty about the exact composition and timing of export impacts, (2) the full trade data hasn't been released yet, (3) service exports could partially offset goods declines, and (4) some pre-committed contracts may have been fulfilled regardless of tariffs.\n\nMy forecast is not higher because: the evidence of trade disruption is clear and substantial, occurring throughout nearly the entire month of April 2025. A 45% decline in shipping bookings with a major trading partner, combined with retaliatory tariffs and manufacturing contraction, makes year-over-year export growth extremely unlikely.\n\nTo update higher, I would need evidence of: significant front-loading documented in early April data, strong service export growth, or indication that tariff impacts were delayed beyond April. To update lower, I would need preliminary trade indicators showing even steeper declines than the 45% China-US figure.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill the US Census Bureau report an increase in US exports in April 2025 compared with April 2024?\n\nQuestion background:\n[Experts React: How the world is responding to Trump’s ‘liberation day’ tariffs](https://www.atlanticcouncil.org/blogs/new-atlanticist/experts-react/experts-react-how-the-world-is-responding-to-trumps-liberation-day-tariffs/)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if the total amount of exports by the United States for April 2025 reported by the US Census Bureau in its [U.S. International Trade in Goods and Services release](https://www.census.gov/foreign-trade/Press-Release/current_press_release/index.html) encompassing that month, exceeds 262,578 million USD.\n\n\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nSweeping new tariffs were implemented by the US administration on April 2, 2025, which were followed by retaliatory measures from multiple countries. Subsequent shipping data showed that China-US bookings were down 45% year-over-year. Additionally, manufacturing PMI reports from the period indicated contracting activity in the sector.\n\nToday is 2025-04-30.\n\nBefore answering you think:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n(e) You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
