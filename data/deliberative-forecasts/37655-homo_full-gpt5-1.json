    "review": "Both forecasters largely reinforce my priors: (1) the Verkhovna Rada is the authority to set the presidential election date; (2) Article 19’s constraint during martial law is the key barrier; (3) the fresh May 15 extension to Aug 6, 2025, cuts against any near-term move; and (4) the ~90-day lead time after martial law lifts eliminates any necessity to announce before July 1 (especially if an Oct 26 date is contemplated, with a latest practical scheduling point around late July). That last point – reduced urgency before July 1 – is the strongest incremental argument and slightly lowers the odds. Poroshenko’s claim is not an official act and doesn’t meet the authority criterion. The tail paths they cite (early lifting, rapid legal amendment, conditional scheduling) remain theoretically possible but politically heavy. Overall, their reasoning is sound and points to a very low probability.",
    "rationale": "Key facts: Martial law was just extended to Aug 6, 2025; prevailing interpretation prohibits scheduling national elections during martial law; and once lifted, at least ~90 days are required before the election date. This combination removes both the legal ability and the practical incentive to announce before July 1. Official denials of July plans further dampen likelihood. A Yes would require a sharp pivot: either (a) early termination of martial law in June, (b) swift legal changes to permit scheduling under martial law, or (c) an unusually fast, coordinated political decision to set a date imminently. None of these have credible public signals yet. Given short time left (~6 weeks) and the fresh extension, the base case is No with only small tails for a legal/political surprise. I was already low; the added “no urgency pre–July 1” point marginally strengthens the No case but doesn’t warrant a large move.",
