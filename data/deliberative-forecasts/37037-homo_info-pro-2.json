    "review": "My initial forecast of 85% was based on generic bureaucratic inertia and a short timeline. The other two forecasters provided crucial, albeit contradictory, context. Forecaster 2 described a new, intentional 'reciprocal tariff' policy, which would make a reversal highly unlikely (implying my forecast was too low). Forecaster 3, however, described the tariff as a long-standing 'scrivener's error' from 2018, which the US has already acknowledged and promised to fix. I find Forecaster 3's argument more convincing, as it better explains the specific and unusual nature of a 50% tariff on a small country like Lesotho, as suggested by the AP News source article's title. The year-long delay in fixing this acknowledged error is powerful evidence of the bureaucratic inertia I initially considered. However, Forecaster 3's framing changes the nature of the problem from a political negotiation to a purely administrative process awaiting a catalyst.",
    "rationale": "I am adopting Forecaster 3's compelling framework that the tariff is an acknowledged administrative error awaiting a presidential proclamation. While the year of inaction demonstrates profound bureaucratic inertia (favoring a 'Yes' outcome), the original intelligence about a high-level Lesotho delegation traveling to Washington in April 2025 provides a powerful new catalyst. This delegation's focused, in-person diplomatic push is precisely the kind of event that can elevate a low-priority administrative task and break through a bureaucratic logjam. Fixing an acknowledged error carries no political cost for the US administration and can generate positive press. Therefore, the combination of a clear administrative path to resolution (the proclamation) and a timely catalyst (the delegation) significantly increases the probability of the tariff being removed by June 1, 2025, compared to my initial assessment. I am reducing my forecast from 85% to 70%, reflecting a roughly 30% chance that this diplomatic push succeeds in expediting the long-delayed correction within the short timeframe available.",
