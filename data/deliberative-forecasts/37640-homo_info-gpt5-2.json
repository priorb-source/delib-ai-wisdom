    "review": "Both forecasters largely echo my priors: inertia favors the site remaining reachable; a redirect or static landing page would still count as “up;” and federal decommissioning of a .gov domain typically requires coordination with GSA and NARA, which rarely completes in weeks. New, useful framings I hadn’t explicitly emphasized: (1) fiscal-year alignment (Oct 1) making a July shutdown less likely; (2) the breadth of Energy Star integrations, especially Portfolio Manager, arguing for transitional hosting; and (3) the single-point failure risk tied to one uptime monitor at one check time. None of these push me meaningfully away from my initial view; if anything, FY alignment slightly nudges upward, while the single-check risk nudges downward, netting to no change.",
    "rationale": "Key considerations:\n- Baseline: Energystar.gov is up as of May 7. The resolution requires the domain be up when Metaculus checks on or after July 1, not necessarily exactly on July 1, slightly mitigating transient-outage risk.\n- Process inertia: Retiring a .gov domain typically takes months and entails GSA coordination, records retention/archiving, and communications planning. A 7-week window is short for a full takedown.\n- Likely transition path: Even with program elimination, agencies commonly maintain the domain with a notice or redirect. Such responses would register as “up” for the resolution source.\n- Stakeholder/optics: Energy Star’s widespread use (labels, Portfolio Manager, municipal benchmarking) makes abrupt domain disappearance risky and confusing. A phased transition is more probable.\n- Residual risks: A politically driven accelerated decommission, misconfigured redirects/DNS/TLS during a rushed migration, or mere bad luck at the exact check time by the external monitor could still yield a No. These remain low but non-zero.\nNet: The additional points (FY alignment; embedded tools) marginally strengthen the case for continuity, roughly offset by the single-check/monitor risk. I maintain my forecast.",
