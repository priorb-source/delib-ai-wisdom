    "review": "Both forecasters center the right crux: base rates from Morgan’s prior flirtations (strongly “No”) versus his ability to self-fund and move quickly (keeps a non-trivial “Yes”). I especially agree with Forecaster 2’s emphasis on the status quo and absence of concrete pre-launch signals. Forecaster 3 adds a potentially new data point about lawyers preparing party-formation paperwork. If accurate, that increases seriousness, but it also plausibly slows an announcement before July 1. Importantly, the resolution only requires a public announcement, not finalized paperwork—so party/legal prep isn’t strictly necessary—but Morgan may prefer coordination and optics, which argues against a rush. Neither forecaster cites evidence of imminent actions (event holds, named staff, clear timeline), and both correctly note the short runway. I don’t find Forecaster 3’s higher 32% fully justified given the lack of near-term signals and the fact that party formation could push timing later. Overall, their arguments modestly reinforce my view, with a slight nudge upward if the party-formation detail is solid.",
    "rationale": "Time left: ~24–25 days. Status quo: No announcement. A No outcome is favored absent concrete launch indicators. Signals since May 15 (blueprint, serious contemplation) show intent but not urgency. The new Democratic entrant (Jolly) likely reduces Morgan’s incentive to announce immediately as a Democrat; if he’s serious about running outside the party, aligning legal structure/ballot access and messaging could push a launch to later in the summer when media attention is higher. While he could announce without finalized paperwork, Morgan’s style suggests he’d prefer a coordinated rollout, which argues against pre–July 1 timing. On the other hand, his wealth and name ID keep a tail risk that he simply declares on social or in an interview. Balancing base rates (his past pattern of backing out), the compressed window, lack of imminent-launch tells, and a bit more seriousness implied by reported legal prep, I edge my estimate up slightly but remain below peers who are in the low 30s.",
