    "review": "Both forecasters make compelling arguments that I should update downward. Forecaster 2's point about lender due diligence is particularly strong - sophisticated lenders extending $100M secured credit just yesterday would have thoroughly assessed bankruptcy risk in their underwriting. If filing were likely within 54 days, they simply wouldn't have closed the deal. Forecaster 3's emphasis on how rarely firms file within weeks of securing fresh financing, combined with the PIK structure preserving cash, reinforces this. Both correctly identify that asking whether a company files for bankruptcy 7-8 weeks after securing $100M new financing requires a specific acute catalyst, not just general financial distress. Their forecasts of 5% and 9% bracket mine at 10%, suggesting I may have been slightly too pessimistic given the timeline.",
    "rationale": "Upon reflection, I should weight the fresh financing more heavily than I did. The lender due diligence argument is persuasive - these are not naive investors, and they closed this deal knowing the company's situation. The PIK interest structure until 2030 means zero cash drain from interest payments, which I mentioned but underweighted. The 2027 maturity on the converts means no near-term wall. The combination of $216M total liquidity against ~$53M quarterly burn gives genuine runway past July 1. However, I'm not going as low as 5% because the underlying fundamentals remain truly dire - negative gross margins are almost unprecedented for a public company, indicating every sale loses money. The withdrawn guidance signals management's own uncertainty. Covenant breaches, vendor actions, or working capital strain could still precipitate a crisis. The bond market pricing at 17 cents reflects smart money's assessment of eventual default risk, even if not imminent. Balancing the strong near-term liquidity against severe underlying distress and the short timeframe, I'm updating to 8% - acknowledging the force of the fresh financing argument while maintaining appropriate skepticism.",
