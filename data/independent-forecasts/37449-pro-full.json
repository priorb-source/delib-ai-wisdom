  "information": "In April 2025, China conducted the \"Strait Thunder-2025A\" military exercises, which involved dozens of aircraft and warships. According to a spokesperson for the Chinese Eastern Theater Command, the operation aimed to test China's capabilities in \"controlling zones\" and \"blockading\" Taiwan, and included simulations of \"strikes on key ports and energy infrastructure.\" Following these and other drills, US military officials, including US Pacific Army Commander Ronald P. Clark and US Indo-Pacific Command Commander Admiral Samuel Paparo, stated that China's exercises simulating a blockade of Taiwan have become a \"regular occurrence\" and that Beijing is rehearsing the \"full spectrum of military operations.\"\n\nIn response to China's military exercises around Taiwan, the US has used terms such as \"intimidation tactics,\" \"provocative,\" \"coercive military activities,\" and \"aggressive military activities.\" In April 2025, the US Department of State accused China of \"putting regional security at risk\" with its drills. To date, US government statements have not officially characterized China's actions as a \"blockade.\" Historically, even during the 1995-1996 Taiwan Strait Crisis, the US did not formally accuse China of a blockade. Diplomatic talks between the US and China were held in Shanghai in April 2025.\n\nAccording to US military leaders, the upcoming 2025 National Defense Strategy (NDS) will prioritize \"preventing a Chinese attack on Taiwan\" as the sole major assumption scenario. This represents a strategic shift to focus on the Indo-Pacific region. At the same time, US Admiral Samuel Paparo has warned that China is rapidly increasing its production of warships and submarines relative to the US, stating a production ratio of 6 to 1.8 for warships and 2 to 1.4 for submarines. Paparo stated that while the US would prevail in a conflict now, its military forces are on a \"bad trajectory.\"",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Less than 2 months, with the question resolving on July 1, 2025.",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No. China will continue conducting military exercises simulating a blockade, and the US will continue to condemn these actions using strong but calibrated language like 'coercive' or 'provocative,' while avoiding the specific legal and military term 'blockade.'",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "China conducts another large-scale military exercise around Taiwan in June 2025, similar in scale to the 'Strait Thunder-2025A' drills. It declares temporary 'no-sail' and 'no-fly' zones, disrupting some traffic. The US State Department and Pentagon condemn the action as 'reckless' and 'irresponsible,' and sail a carrier strike group through the Taiwan Strait after the exercise concludes. However, because the disruption is temporary and labeled an 'exercise' by China, the US government refrains from calling it a 'blockade,' preserving diplomatic flexibility and avoiding a major escalation.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "In a significant escalation, the PRC's military announces an extended 'quarantine' or 'military exercise zone' directly outside a major Taiwanese port, such as Kaohsiung. Chinese naval vessels begin halting and inspecting commercial ships, effectively interdicting traffic for a period of several days. This action crosses the line from simulation to active interference. In response to the sustained disruption of international commerce and a direct request from Taipei, the US President or Secretary of State holds a press conference and publicly accuses the People's Republic of China of instituting a 'blockade' against Taiwan.",
    "rationale": "My forecast is based on the high rhetorical and legal threshold required for the US to use the term 'blockade.' Such an accusation is tantamount to declaring an act of war and would dramatically escalate the crisis, pressuring the US to intervene militarily. The current status quo, as outlined in the provided research, shows a clear pattern: China conducts drills it calls 'blockade' simulations, and the US condemns them with strong but carefully selected words, avoiding the specific term 'blockade.' This was also the US posture during the 1995-1996 Taiwan Strait Crisis, establishing a historical precedent for verbal restraint. Given that the resolution date is less than two months away, the 'No' outcome, representing a continuation of this status quo, is the most likely scenario. The ongoing diplomatic talks in Shanghai further suggest both sides wish to maintain lines of communication and avoid a point-of-no-return conflict. \n\nMy probability is not lower than 15% because China's military activities are genuinely escalating in frequency and realism. There is a non-trivial risk that Beijing could miscalculate or intentionally escalate from a simulation to a de facto blockade to test US and international resolve. If China were to actively and sustain an interdiction of commercial shipping to a major port, it would become increasingly difficult for the US to describe it as anything other than a blockade. \n\nMy probability is not higher than 15% because of the immense gravity of the term. For the US to make this accusation, China's actions would have to be unambiguous, sustained, and a clear break from their previous 'exercises.' The US military's own assessment of being on a 'bad trajectory' relative to China's production capacity might also encourage caution in Washington against rhetorical escalations that could precipitate a conflict. Therefore, it remains more likely that the US will stick to its established playbook of condemnation without crossing this critical rhetorical line before the deadline. I would raise my forecast if intelligence suggested China planned a sustained, physical interdiction of a major port. I would lower it if high-level US-China talks led to a de-escalation of military exercises.",
