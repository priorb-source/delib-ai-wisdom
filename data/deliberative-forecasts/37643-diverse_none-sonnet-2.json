    "review": "Both forecasters make substantially more compelling temporal and procedural arguments than my initial forecast. Their emphasis on three key constraints is particularly persuasive: (1) the prohibitive 48-day timeline for statutory changes that typically take months; (2) the requirement that PSLF termination would need congressional action, not just regulatory changes; and (3) community tracker standards requiring concrete implementation rather than mere announcements or intent. Forecaster 2's focus on the legislative process timeline is especially strong - even for less controversial items, the committee-hearing-debate-vote-signature process rarely completes in under two months. Forecaster 3's point about tracker behavior requiring 'concrete, verifiable implementation' is crucial; I had been too optimistic about the possibility that aggressive executive action or announced intent might be marked 'complete.' Their analyses also correctly note that any administrative attempt to terminate PSLF would face immediate litigation, making a clean 'complete' status highly unlikely even if action were taken. I failed to adequately weight the base rate of major statutory programs being terminated in such a compressed timeframe, which is essentially zero.",
    "rationale": "Upon reflection, my initial 15% forecast significantly overestimated the probability of completion by July 1. The other forecasters are correct that: (1) PSLF termination requires statutory change, not just regulatory action; (2) 48 days is insufficient for normal or even expedited legislative processes; (3) tracker maintainers would likely require actual implementation, not announcements, to mark 'complete'; and (4) base rates for such rapid statutory terminations are near-zero. My original reasoning gave too much weight to theoretical aggressive executive action and underweighted procedural and temporal constraints. However, I maintain a slightly higher probability than 2-3% because: there remains a small possibility of PSLF termination being attached to must-pass legislation or a reconciliation bill that could move unusually quickly; the 'in progress' status suggests some activity; and administrative actions, while likely insufficient, retain minimal possibility of being marked complete. The evidence strongly supports moving toward the 2-3% range, though I settle at 4% to preserve slightly more probability mass for unlikely but possible legislative scenarios.",
