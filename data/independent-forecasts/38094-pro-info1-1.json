  "information": "Reports from sources including The Boston Globe and The New York Times indicate Senator Fetterman has become increasingly isolated from the Democratic caucus. He has stopped attending the weekly Democratic lunches and has left the party's group chat. Concurrently, Republican colleagues have made deliberate outreach efforts. Newsweek reported that GOP Senators Tom Cotton, Chuck Grassley, and Dave McCormick have contacted Fetterman's office, and Republican Whip John Barrasso has publicly welcomed him to switch parties.",

    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Slightly over one month. The question resolves on July 1, 2025.",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No. Senator Fetterman will continue to caucus with the Democrats.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Despite ongoing friction and policy disagreements with his party's progressive wing, Senator Fetterman maintains his affiliation with the Democratic caucus. The political and structural incentives to remain, such as committee assignments and support from his electoral base in Pennsylvania, outweigh the social discomfort and any overtures from the Republican party. He continues to operate as a maverick Democrat without making a formal break.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "The escalating isolation from his Democratic colleagues, combined with a specific, high-stakes legislative battle where he feels completely alienated, pushes Senator Fetterman to formally change his status. He could either announce he is switching to the Republican party, declare himself an Independent who will caucus with Republicans, or resign from the Senate altogether due to the mounting pressure.",
    "rationale": "My forecast is based on the strong tendency towards the status quo in politics, as switching parties is an exceedingly rare and politically risky event for a sitting senator. The institutional and electoral incentives for Senator Fetterman to remain a Democrat are immense. A switch would alienate the voter base and party apparatus that elected him in a swing state, making re-election incredibly difficult. While the reports of his social isolation from the Democratic caucus and outreach from Republicans are significant and noteworthy, they do not yet outweigh the fundamental political calculus. Senators can be at odds with their caucus for long periods without taking the drastic step of leaving. Fetterman has also publicly stated he will not resign. Therefore, the most probable outcome is that while he continues to be a vocal and independent voice, he will not formally sever ties with the Democratic caucus within the short, one-month timeframe.\n\nMy probability is not lower than 10% because the reporting from credible sources like the Washington Post indicates a level of anger and isolation that is unusual and genuinely destabilizing. Fetterman has shown a consistent willingness to defy party orthodoxy, suggesting he is less constrained by traditional norms than most politicians. The situation appears volatile, and a rapid, emotional decision cannot be entirely ruled out.\n\nMy probability is not higher than 10% because the barriers to switching are incredibly high. It is a career-defining move with immense downsides. Without a clear indication that Fetterman is actively negotiating with Republican leadership or a public statement that he is reconsidering his affiliation, the likelihood of such a monumental shift in the next month remains low.\n\nI would increase my forecast if there were credible reports of formal meetings between Fetterman and the Republican leadership to discuss a switch. I would decrease it upon signs of reconciliation with the Democratic caucus, such as his rejoining of weekly lunches or a joint statement with Senator Schumer.",

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
