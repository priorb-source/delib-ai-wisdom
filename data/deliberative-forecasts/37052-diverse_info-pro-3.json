    "review": "The other forecasters provided critical new information and arguments that challenged my initial assessment. Forecaster 2 introduced the compelling idea that the set of high-risk targets has shrunk because several vulnerable states are now under military rule. However, their argument for a 'cooling' trend was based on a factual error, as the provided data stated there were five successful coups in 2024, not zero. Forecaster 3 provided a higher forecast that I initially found surprisingly aggressive. Their key contribution was highlighting a very recent (April 2025) foiled coup attempt in Burkina Faso, which serves as a powerful, timely indicator of ongoing instability. This recent event directly counters the idea that existing juntas are stable and significantly weakens Forecaster 2's 'shrinking target set' argument. Furthermore, Forecaster 3's use of a higher base rate (2-3 coups/year) prompted me to re-examine the data more closely.",
    "rationale": "After reviewing the other analyses, I am making a significant upward revision to my forecast. My initial estimate of 25% was based on an understated base rate of recent coups. The prompt's data indicates five successful coups in 2024, bringing the 2020-2024 average to approximately 2.6 successful coups per year, a much higher rate than I had initially used. A simple Poisson model with this updated base rate for the remaining 67-day period yields a probability of approximately 38%. This quantitative calculation is much closer to Forecaster 3's position. Forecaster 3's mention of a foiled coup in Burkina Faso in April 2025 is a critical piece of evidence. It demonstrates that instability remains acute and that even countries already under military rule are at risk of further coups, which mitigates the 'shrinking target set' argument raised by Forecaster 2. While I still believe the shrinking set of 'classic' targets (unstable civilian governments) has some minor damping effect on the overall probability, the demonstrably high and recent base rate, combined with current signals of instability, warrants a much higher forecast. I am therefore updating my forecast from 25% to 35%, reflecting the new, higher base rate, while tempering the raw mathematical result slightly to account for the short time-frame and the altered nature of the remaining high-risk states.",
