    "review": "Forecaster 2's analysis is very similar to my own, focusing on the narrowing timeline and the balance between securing a license and navigating local logistics. Their forecast of 55% is close to my original 60%, and their reasoning, particularly noting that two months have passed since licensing without a change, provides a solid, cautious check on my initial optimism. Forecaster 3's analysis is based on a significant factual error, claiming a 6+ month delay since licensing when it has only been two months (license granted March 13, 2025). This invalidates their primary rationale for a low forecast of 32%. However, Forecaster 3's contribution is still valuable as they introduce specific and plausible obstacles not present in the original research: Chad's landlocked geography, limited infrastructure, and potentially unfinalized import rules or spectrum fees. While their conclusion is based on a mistaken premise, these specific risk factors are highly relevant and compelling.",
    "rationale": "I am updating my forecast downward from 60% to 48%. My initial analysis was optimistic, weighing the recent Airtel partnership as a significant accelerator that could push Chad's timeline closer to the rapid 10-week precedent set by the DRC. However, the deliberation has tempered this view. Forecaster 2 rightly points out that two months have already passed with no change, suggesting the process is not frictionless. More importantly, Forecaster 3, despite a factual error in their timeline, introduced critical context about specific country-level challenges in Chad—its landlocked status, infrastructure deficits, and potential for lingering regulatory details on imports and fees. These factors provide a strong explanation for the delay to date and suggest that the longer precedents (16-24 weeks) are more analogous than the fastest one. The total available window from license to deadline is about 15.5 weeks, which is shorter than the 16-week rollout in Malawi and Zambia. While the Airtel partnership is a positive factor for distribution, it cannot instantly resolve these more fundamental logistical and regulatory hurdles. The combination of time already elapsed and these specific operational challenges makes the July 1 deadline look more difficult to meet. The odds, in my revised view, have now tipped slightly in favor of 'No'.",
