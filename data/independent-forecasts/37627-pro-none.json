    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Approximately one month, with the resolution window closing on June 15, 2025.",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No. The two individuals are not currently scheduled to speak and have a complex and often strained history. Without a significant intervening event, a phone call is not the default outcome.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Donald Trump loses the 2024 US Presidential election and remains a private citizen, removing any diplomatic or political necessity for President Zelenskyy to speak with him. Alternatively, even if Trump wins the election, any presidential calls between the two occur before May 12, 2025, or after June 15, 2025, thus falling outside the specified resolution window.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Donald Trump wins the 2024 US Presidential election. As the sitting US President in May 2025, he initiates or accepts a call with President Zelenskyy to discuss the war in Ukraine and US policy, aligned with his publicly stated goal of ending the conflict quickly. The call happens to fall within the specified one-month window.",
    "rationale": "My forecast is primarily driven by the outcome of the 2024 US Presidential election, which at this point introduces significant uncertainty. The research assistant's report provided no additional information to clarify this. \n\nThere are two main scenarios to consider:\n\n1.  **Trump loses the 2024 election:** In this case, he would be a private citizen in May/June 2025. President Zelenskyy's diplomatic efforts would be focused exclusively on the incumbent US administration. A formal phone call with Trump would be diplomatically inappropriate and highly unlikely. The probability in this scenario is very low, perhaps less than 5%.\n\n2.  **Trump wins the 2024 election:** In this scenario, he would be the sitting US President. Given that the US is Ukraine's most vital partner, a phone call between the two leaders would be a diplomatic near-necessity. Trump has repeatedly claimed he would end the war in 24 hours, a process that would almost certainly begin with calls to both Zelenskyy and Putin. By May 2025, four months into his presidency, it is highly probable such a call would have already occurred or is imminent. The probability of a call happening in this specific one-month window, given a Trump presidency, is moderately high.\n\nMy final forecast of 35% is a weighted average of these possibilities, assuming the election is roughly a 50/50 proposition. \n\n**Why my forecast is not higher:** The personal history between the two men, stemming from the 2019 phone call that led to Trump's first impeachment, could create a barrier to communication. Furthermore, even if Trump becomes president, it's possible their initial call would happen before this question's window opens on May 12, 2025, or that Trump pursues a strategy that involves bypassing direct communication with Zelenskyy initially. The narrow one-month timeframe for resolution also constrains the probability.\n\n**Why my forecast is not lower:** The possibility of a Trump presidency cannot be dismissed. If he is in the White House, the geopolitical realities surrounding the war in Ukraine would create immense pressure on both sides to establish a direct line of communication. It would be a significant and noteworthy diplomatic event if the US President and the leader of a major ally in an active war had not spoken four to five months into a new administration.\n\nMy forecast would increase substantially if Donald Trump wins the 2024 election and would decrease to a near-zero value if he loses.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill Donald Trump and Volodymyr Zelenskyy speak on the phone with each other before June 15, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nSky News: [Key moments that have shaped Trump and Zelenskyy's relationship](https://news.sky.com/story/trump-and-zelenskyys-relationship-from-perfect-phone-call-to-oval-office-clash-13331892)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if, after May 12, 2025 and before June 15, 2025, Donald Trump and Volodymyr Zelenskyy speak on the phone with each other, according to [credible sources](https://www.metaculus.com/faq/#definitions).\n\nBoth sides must acknowledge the phone call took place for it to count. \"Speak on the phone with each other\" is defined as both individuals, from different physical spaces, orally uttering words intended for the other individual into a telephone or equivalent device, those words being converted into electrical or digital signals in real time, and then transferred to the other individual via telecommunications links, where they are reconverted into sound waves at the other individual's listening device.\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nNo additional information available.\n\nToday is 2025-05-13.\n\nBefore answering you think:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n(e) You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
