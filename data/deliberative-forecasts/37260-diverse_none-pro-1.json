    "review": "The deliberation reveals a strong consensus among all three forecasters. We all agree that the primary obstacles to a 'Yes' outcome are the extremely high constitutional and procedural barriers to banning a political party in Germany, combined with the severely compressed timeline of less than two months. Both other forecasters compellingly referenced the historical precedent of the failed, multi-year attempt to ban the NPD party, which reinforces the core of my initial argument. Forecaster 3's specific mention of the legal standard from the 2017 NPD ruling (finding anti-constitutional aims but no potential to overthrow the order) provides additional, concrete support for the extreme difficulty of such a case. There are no substantive disagreements in reasoning; the minor variance between a 1% and 2% forecast reflects a slightly different subjective weighting of a 'black swan' or an unprecedented acceleration of the judicial process, rather than any different interpretation of the available evidence.",
    "rationale": "After reviewing the analyses from the other forecasters, my confidence in my initial assessment is strengthened. The deliberation confirmed that the central and decisive factor is the German legal process itself, which is designed to be slow, deliberate, and cautious when dealing with the fundamental right to form a political party. As all forecasters noted, the formal process to request a ban from the Federal Constitutional Court has not even been initiated as of May 2, 2025. Given that past proceedings have taken years, the idea that a petition could be filed, accepted by the Court, argued with extensive evidence, and decided upon in less than two months is procedurally inconceivable under normal circumstances. The other analyses reinforce that there is no evidence to suggest any deviation from these established norms. Therefore, the status quo is overwhelmingly likely to hold. I am maintaining my forecast at 1% to account for a non-zero, but vanishingly small, possibility of an extraordinary and unprecedented political or judicial event that bypasses all normal timelines. The other forecasters' arguments have solidified my view that the probability is not higher than this.",
