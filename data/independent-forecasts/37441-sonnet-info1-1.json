  "information": "As of early May 2025, the USD/EUR exchange rate is approximately 0.884, requiring a 9.5% depreciation of the US dollar to fall below the 0.80 EUR threshold. Economic data from the United States indicated a contraction of 0.3% in the first quarter of 2025, though the economy added 177,000 jobs in April. In the Eurozone, consumer inflation rose by 2.2% in April, which was higher than expected. The Eurozone's Harmonized Index of Consumer Prices (HICP) had previously risen to 2.5% year-over-year in January, the highest rate since July 2024. Market expectations for the US Federal Reserve include a 33-37% probability of an interest rate cut by July 2025.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Approximately 55 days, from May 12, 2025 through July 1, 2025",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No - the USD remains above 0.80 EUR",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "The USD stabilizes around current levels (0.88 EUR) as US economic data improves, the Federal Reserve maintains its current interest rate policy without cuts, or the Eurozone economy weakens relative to expectations. The tariff turmoil subsides and currency markets return to more typical trading ranges.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "The USD experiences accelerated depreciation driven by multiple factors: the Federal Reserve implements emergency rate cuts in response to deteriorating economic conditions, the Q1 contraction extends into Q2 creating a confirmed recession, tariff policies escalate causing severe economic disruption, or a financial crisis event triggers rapid dollar selling. The momentum from the recent 3-year low accelerates.",
    "rationale": "The USD would need to depreciate approximately 9.5% in roughly 55 days to reach the 0.80 EUR threshold. This represents an extremely rapid move for a major currency pair. While the dollar is currently under pressure (having hit a 3-year low) and facing headwinds from the Q1 economic contraction and tariff turmoil, several factors suggest this probability remains relatively low. First, the Federal Reserve rate cut probability by July is only 33-37%, indicating markets don't expect dramatic policy shifts. Second, the US economy still added 177,000 jobs in April, suggesting resilience despite the contraction. Third, major currencies typically don't move 9.5% in 8 weeks without extraordinary circumstances like financial crises or coordinated policy interventions. The status quo strongly favors gradualism in currency markets. For my forecast to move higher, I would need to see: multiple Fed officials signaling imminent rate cuts, Q2 economic data showing accelerating contraction, or geopolitical/policy shocks that specifically weaken the dollar. For my forecast to move lower, I would need: stabilization in US economic data, hawkish Fed communications, or Eurozone weakness. Given current momentum is toward dollar weakness but the required move is extreme, I assess this at 18%.",

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any).
