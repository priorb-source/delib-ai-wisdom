  "information": "The advance estimate for Q1 2025 annualized real GDP growth was -0.3%. The second estimate, released on May 29, 2025, was an upward revision to -0.2%. Key factors driving the contraction in the first quarter included a significant increase in imports, which subtracted 4.90 percentage points from GDP, and a reduction in government spending, which subtracted 0.12 percentage points. These negative factors were partially offset by positive contributions from investment (+3.98 percentage points) and consumer spending (+0.80 percentage points).\n\nHistorical analyses of BEA data by the St. Louis Fed show that revisions which change the sign of GDP growth from negative to positive are uncommon, happening in less than 20% of such cases. Another analysis covering the period from 1996 to 2024 indicates that when an advance estimate is between -0.5% and 0%, the third estimate turns positive in roughly 35-40% of instances. The typical absolute revision from the second to the third estimate is about 0.1 to 0.2 percentage points, while the absolute average revision from the advance to the third estimate is larger, at approximately 0.5 percentage points.\n\nThe third estimate for Q1 2025 GDP incorporates more comprehensive source data than was available for previous estimates. This includes complete data for March on international trade in goods and services, construction spending, and manufacturers' and trade inventories. The third estimate will also incorporate updated data on federal and state government spending, as well as the results of annual benchmark revisions to trade and services data which can affect the final figures.",

    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Approximately 3-4 weeks. The BEA typically releases the third estimate about 3 months after the quarter ends. Given that Q1 2025 ended March 31 and the second estimate was released May 29, the third estimate should be released around late June 2025.",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No - the second estimate shows -0.2% annualized real GDP growth, which is negative. The status quo would be that the third estimate remains negative.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "The third estimate either maintains the -0.2% figure or revises it by less than 0.2 percentage points upward, keeping GDP growth negative. Additional comprehensive data for March could reveal that the initial weakness in trade and government spending persists or worsens, preventing a positive revision large enough to cross the 0% threshold.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "The third estimate revises upward by more than 0.2 percentage points, bringing Q1 2025 real GDP growth to positive territory. This could occur if more complete data on March trade, construction spending, inventories, or government expenditures reveals stronger-than-initially-estimated economic activity, or if benchmark revisions to trade and services data materially improve the quarterly calculation.",
    "rationale": "The current estimate stands at -0.2%, requiring an upward revision of more than 0.2 percentage points to reach positive territory. The trend has been upward (from -0.3% advance to -0.2% second estimate), but this represents only a 0.1 pp revision. Historical analysis provides two relevant data points: (1) sign changes from negative to positive occur in less than 20% of cases overall, but (2) when advance estimates fall between -0.5% and 0%, third estimates turn positive in 35-40% of instances. Since our advance estimate of -0.3% falls in this range, the 35-40% figure is most applicable. However, several factors warrant caution. Typical second-to-third estimate revisions are 0.1-0.2 percentage points in absolute terms, and we need a revision exceeding 0.2 pp. The second estimate already incorporated additional data and only managed a 0.1 pp upward revision, suggesting remaining data may not contain major surprises. Good forecasting practice emphasizes status quo bias - the economy is currently showing negative growth, and dramatic revisions are less common than incremental ones. That said, we're very close to the threshold, the revision trend is favorable, and historical precedent shows meaningful probability. The third estimate will include comprehensive March data and benchmark revisions that could materially affect the outcome. My forecast is not higher because we need a larger-than-typical revision and the second estimate already captured some new information. It's not lower because historical data for similar situations shows 35-40% probability, we're very close to the threshold, and the upward revision trend has begun. I would revise upward if economic indicators or preliminary data suggest March was stronger than initial estimates, or if BEA commentary hints at significant benchmark adjustments. I would revise downward if no new positive signals emerge or if typical revision patterns strongly reassert themselves.",
