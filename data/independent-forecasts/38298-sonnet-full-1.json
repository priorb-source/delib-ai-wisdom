  "information": "According to NOAA data cited in reports, the warmest May on record was in 2020 with a temperature anomaly of +0.95°C versus the 1901-2000 mean, followed by 2016 at +0.93°C. For the current year, preliminary data showed January 2025 was the hottest January on record, March 2025 ranked first or tied for first, and April 2025 ranked as the second warmest. The first three months of 2025 were the second-warmest first quarter recorded. The strong El Niño event that persisted from May 2023 to April 2024 has transitioned to a neutral ENSO (El Niño–Southern Oscillation) state.\n\nSeveral regional weather events were reported globally during May 2025. In Ahmedabad, India, the month was one of the coolest in recent years, with an average maximum temperature 3.3 degrees Celsius below normal due to record rainfall. In contrast, Europe experienced several heat events. On May 1, the UK recorded its warmest start to May on record with temperatures reaching 28°C. Scotland saw its hottest day of the year so far on May 13, reaching 25.4°C. On May 30, a heatwave in Brittany, France broke local heat records for May, reaching 31.1°C in La Noë-Blanche. In the United States, International Falls, Minnesota, recorded temperatures around +32°C in early May.\n\nThe U.S. National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's (NOAA) Climate Prediction Center released an outlook stating that the summer of 2025 was expected to be 'overwhelmingly above normal' across the United States. The forecast indicated that nearly all states were favored to see a warmer-than-average summer, with the highest probabilities for extreme heat in the West and Southwest. The outlook also noted an increased risk of drought and wildfires. Separately, Roman Vilfand, the scientific director of the Russian Hydrometeorological Center, stated that preliminary forecasts suggested 2025 could rank among the top three or five hottest years on record.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Approximately 2-4 weeks. NOAA typically releases monthly global temperature data within 2-3 weeks after the month ends, so the May 2025 data should be available by mid-to-late June 2025.",
    "status_quo_outcome": "May 2025 will likely rank among the warmest Mays on record but will not surpass the 2020 record. The status quo suggests continuation of the warming trend seen in early 2025, placing May 2025 in the top 3-5 warmest Mays, but falling short of the #1 position.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Regional cooling anomalies, particularly the record rainfall and significantly below-normal temperatures in parts of India and South Asia, are sufficient to drag down the global average temperature. Combined with the absence of El Niño conditions that boosted previous record Mays (2020, 2016), the global temperature anomaly for May 2025 remains below the +0.95°C threshold set in 2020, resulting in May 2025 ranking 2nd or 3rd warmest rather than 1st.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "The exceptional warmth evident in early 2025 (record January, near-record March, second-warmest April) continues into May. The heat records broken in Europe, the UK, and parts of the United States represent broader hemispheric warmth that overwhelms regional cooling in India. The underlying climate change trend and oceanic heat content push the global May 2025 temperature anomaly above +0.95°C, narrowly surpassing 2020's record.",
    "rationale": "The evidence presents a mixed picture. Strong positive indicators include: (1) exceptional warmth in early 2025 with multiple months at or near records, suggesting momentum; (2) NOAA forecasts predicting above-normal summer temperatures; (3) multiple regional heat records broken in Europe and parts of North America during May 2025; (4) continued long-term warming trend from climate change. However, significant countervailing factors exist: (1) the bar is high—May 2020's +0.95°C anomaly was exceptional; (2) ENSO is in a neutral state, whereas previous record Mays (2020, 2016) benefited from El Niño conditions; (3) significant regional cooling in India with record rainfall and 3.3°C below-normal temperatures suggests heterogeneous conditions; (4) month-to-month variability means early-year warmth doesn't guarantee May will follow suit. The probability is not higher because beating a specific monthly record requires exceptional conditions globally, not just regionally, and the mixed signals (extreme European heat vs. Indian cooling) create uncertainty. The probability is not lower because the consistent early-2025 warmth and climate change baseline provide a strong foundation. I would revise upward if preliminary reports indicate widespread warmth across multiple continents beyond just Europe, or if ocean temperature data shows exceptional warmth. I would revise downward if reports emerge of cooling in other major regions beyond India or if preliminary analyses suggest the anomaly is tracking well below +0.90°C.",
