    "review": "Both forecasters add useful nuance. Forecaster 2 reinforces the administrative steps (type approval, local operations, payments/logistics) and the “default is No unless Starlink acts” framing; I agree those are the real gating items. Forecaster 3 highlights a specific, underappreciated risk: Lesotho’s enclave status and likely dependence on South African transit/customs for hardware, plus the lack of an Airtel Africa presence—both could slow practical launch even if the license is granted. The point that Starlink sometimes leaves countries as Coming Soon for months post-license is a meaningful counter to my earlier weight on quick turnarounds like DRC. I’m less convinced that South Africa’s licensing status materially increases geofencing or technical spillover risk for activation in Lesotho (Starlink can geofence), but I do find the customs/import/transit risk and small-market deprioritization convincing.",
    "rationale": "Net, I slightly lower my estimate. Reasons down: (1) Three weeks since the Lesotho license with no map change suggests remaining administrative steps (type approvals, distributor setup, payments/tax config) aren’t done yet; (2) Enclave logistics via South Africa could delay shipments and make SpaceX hesitant to mark Available until fulfillment is reliable; (3) Small market prioritization risk; (4) No clear evidence yet of LCA approvals or local reseller announcements. Reasons to keep it above 50%: (1) License is in hand; (2) Starlink has recently flipped availability quickly in some African markets (e.g., DRC), and there’s ample time (~7–8 weeks) for a batch update before quarter-end; (3) Technical enablement is straightforward with ISL and existing regional coverage; (4) Starlink has incentives to show momentum in Africa. I’ll revisit upward if LCA publishes terminal type approvals, a local distributor is named, or the order flow for Lesotho appears; downward if we see signs of import/transit friction via South Africa or continued silence while other newly licensed countries flip.",
