    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "About 60 days (until July 1, 2025)",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "No application to ban AfD is filed by the federal government, Bundestag, or Bundesrat; or an application is filed but the Federal Constitutional Court does not issue a final ban decision before July 1, 2025 (typical proceedings take many months to years).",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "A highly atypical, ultra-expedited proceeding at the Federal Constitutional Court culminates in a ban announced before July 1, 2025, or an unprecedented interim order effectively banning the party is issued and officially described as a ban. This would require a sudden, severe triggering event plus cross-institutional consensus and court prioritization—none of which is currently evident.",
    "rationale": "- Process and precedent: Under Article 21(2) of Germany’s Basic Law, only the Federal Constitutional Court can ban a political party. Past party-ban cases (e.g., NPD) took years from filing to judgment. Even with political momentum, a ban by July 1, 2025 is practically impossible given the procedural steps (formal application, submissions, hearings, deliberation, and judgment).\n- Current state: As of May 2, 2025, there has been parliamentary debate and a motion by 124 MPs to pursue proceedings, but no public indication that a formal application has been filed and accepted by the Court, let alone scheduled for hearing. The research assistant provided no additional information pointing to imminent action.\n- Status quo weight: The default is that AfD remains legal; changing that requires a rare, high-threshold legal process. Germany has historically been extremely reluctant to ban parties; the most recent attempt (NPD, 2017) failed despite acknowledging anti-constitutional aims due to lack of concrete potential to undermine the democratic order.\n- Why not higher: The timeline and legal hurdles are decisive; there is no realistic path to a final ban ruling in the next ~60 days.\n- Why not lower (not exactly zero): In theory, an extraordinary national security event tied directly to the party’s leadership could prompt emergency filings and an unprecedented expedited or interim measure by the Court. While this is highly unlikely and lacks precedent, it is not logically impossible.\n- What would move me up: (1) Official filing of a party-ban application by the federal government, Bundestag, or Bundesrat; (2) the Court publicly fast-tracking the case with immediate hearings; (3) credible, severe new evidence prompting calls for urgent interim measures described explicitly as a ban.\n- What would move me down: Public statements from key institutions ruling out filing before July; confirmation from the Court that no hearings will be scheduled in the period; or clear reporting that any potential case is in early, exploratory stages only.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill Germany ban the AfD before July 1, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nLe Monde: [Germany's Bundestag debates banning far-right AfD party](https://www.lemonde.fr/en/international/article/2025/01/31/germany-s-bundestag-debates-banning-far-right-afd-party_6737637_4.html) \"A cross-party group of 124 MPs put a motion on the agenda to bring proceedings before the Federal Constitutional Court to ban the party, whose unprecedented alliance with the CDU caused a shock.\"\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if there is an official announcement of a ban on the Alternative for Germany (AfD) by a German government entity with the authority to make such an announcement (e.g., the Federal Constitutional Court).\n\n\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nNo additional information available.\n\nToday is 2025-05-02.\n\nBefore answering you think:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n(e) You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
