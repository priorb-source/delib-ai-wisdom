    "review": "Both forecasters emphasize the short runway to July 1, the typical avoidance of the July 4 period for active IPO execution, and the practicality that most companies will either keep filings confidential or time the public S‑1 closer to the roadshow—points that reinforce a lower base within this narrow window. I agree that a company blog announcement is unlikely, and that the most realistic “Yes” path is a public S‑1. I’d refine one nuance: a confidential submission alone wouldn’t count unless Discord itself posts a specific announcement on its News/Blog, which Forecaster 3 flags correctly and Forecaster 2 also allows for if it’s explicitly announced. Their shared point that Discord could still choose a late‑June public S‑1 to preserve fall optionality is credible and keeps the probability from drifting too low.",
    "rationale": "- Time left and status quo: ~5.5 weeks remain with no public S‑1 or qualifying company news. Over short horizons, status quo persistence is strong.\n- Resolution mechanics: Only a public S‑1 (EDGAR-visible) or a specific, explicit IPO-plans announcement on Discord’s News/Blog will resolve Yes. Confidential filings don’t count unless Discord itself announces them on its site.\n- Likely behavior: Large consumer/consumer‑adjacent tech names typically avoid unnecessary early public filings if they target a fall window, and rarely pre‑announce IPO intent on a blog due to regulatory/quiet‑period sensitivities. A late‑June public S‑1 is plausible to maintain fall optionality, but it’s not necessary.\n- Market tape: Mixed. That doesn’t create urgency to act before July 1.\nNetting these, I still see the most probable outcome as No by June 30, with a nontrivial chance of a late‑June S‑1. The deliberation did not surface decisive new evidence, but it slightly strengthens the case that a public S‑1 in late June is a live option, nudging me a hair upward.",
