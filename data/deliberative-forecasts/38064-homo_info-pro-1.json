    "review": "Forecaster 3's analysis mirrored my initial assessment, focusing on the operational risk of a technical failure, and we arrived at similar, high-probability conclusions. However, Forecaster 2 introduced a critical piece of evidence I had completely missed: the date itself is not confirmed. Forecaster 2's argument, based on conflicting information from GameStop's official transfer agent (listing June 2) and the crucial absence of an official DEF 14A filing with the SEC, is exceptionally convincing. This evidence fundamentally changes the question from one of execution risk to one of scheduling uncertainty. Forecaster 2's reasoning has correctly identified the primary driver of uncertainty, and it invalidates the premise upon which both my and Forecaster 3's initial analyses were built.",
    "rationale": "I am making a significant update to my forecast, lowering it from 75% to 25%. My initial analysis was predicated on the flawed assumption that June 12, 2025, was the confirmed date for the meeting. Forecaster 2's introduction of new evidence—namely, that GameStop's transfer agent, Computershare, lists the meeting for June 2, and that no definitive proxy statement (DEF 14A) has been filed with the SEC—compels this revision. The transfer agent is a highly credible source, and the absence of the official SEC filing is the most important factor. Without the DEF 14A, there is no officially confirmed date. The uncertainty has shifted from 'Will the meeting on this date succeed?' to 'Is this even the correct date?' The evidence provided by Forecaster 2 strongly suggests that June 12 is likely not the correct date. I have lowered my probability drastically to reflect that the 'Yes' scenario is now an outlier. The remaining 25% chance accounts for the possibility that the financial data providers (like Bloomberg) have more recent, albeit unfiled, information and that the transfer agent's data is outdated.",
