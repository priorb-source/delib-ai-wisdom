    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "About 33 days (until June 1, 2025)",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No — he has not declared yet, and absent a new announcement in the next month, the question resolves No.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Ouattara keeps his options open and defers any declaration until later in the summer, or signals he will not run; RHDP focuses on internal consultations or a later congress without naming him in May.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "RHDP convenes a May meeting/congress and formally urges Ouattara to be its standard-bearer; he accepts and publicly declares. Alternatively, he uses a high-profile speech or media interview in May to announce his candidacy.",
    "rationale": "Short fuse and status quo favor No: there are only ~33 days left, and he has not yet declared. In 2020 he declared relatively late (August) for an October election, suggesting no need to announce by early June. There is no legal filing deadline forcing a May decision, and keeping ambiguity preserves leverage inside RHDP. Age (83) and domestic/international sensitivities after the contentious 2020 third-term bid also argue against a hasty early declaration. These factors anchor the base rate for an early (pre–June 1) declaration low.\n\nWhy not lower: There is a plausible path to a May announcement if RHDP schedules a congress or executive meeting with “designation du candidat” on the agenda and rallies around him. Ouattara has previously reversed positions late and could choose to pre-empt opponents (e.g., Tidjane Thiam’s PDCI) by locking in the race early. Any credible reporting (Reuters/AFP) about a late-May RHDP congress to crown a candidate would raise the odds meaningfully.\n\nWhy not higher: Absent concrete, scheduled party events in May pointing to a candidacy proclamation, history and incentives point to delay. He can declare later without strategic cost, and he may still prefer to anoint a successor. The research assistant provided no new information indicating imminent declaration or a May RHDP congress focused on candidacy.\n\nWhat would move me up: Announcement of an RHDP congress or political bureau in May explicitly to choose/designate the presidential candidate; senior RHDP figures publicly calling on him to run with him signaling acceptance; leaks to major wires that he has decided to run and timing is imminent. What would move me down: Signals he will decide only after mid-year, moves to elevate an alternative RHDP figure, or a public statement that he will not be a candidate.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill Alassane Ouattara declare his candidacy for president of Ivory Coast (Côte d’Ivoire) before June 1, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nAfrica Center for Strategic Studies: [Côte d’Ivoire: Efforts to Forge Resiliency Face Stiff Test](https://africacenter.org/spotlight/2025-elections/cotedivoire/)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if Alassane Ouattara declares his candidacy for the [2025 Ivorian presidential election](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2025_Ivorian_presidential_election), according to credible sources, before June 1, 2025.\n\n\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nNo additional information available.\n\nToday is 2025-04-29.\n\nBefore answering you think:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n(e) You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
