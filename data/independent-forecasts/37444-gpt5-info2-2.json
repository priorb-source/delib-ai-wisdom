  "information": "A Politico report from April 24, 2025, citing multiple sources, claimed the White House was discussing the possibility of lifting sanctions on the Nord Stream 2 pipeline as part of negotiations to end the conflict in Ukraine. The report stated that U.S. Special Envoy Steve Wietkoff was the main proponent of the initiative and had instructed his team to compile a list of all energy sanctions imposed on Russia. Other reports have mentioned proposals from American investors and the former CEO of Nord Stream 2 AG to restart the pipeline with U.S. participation.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "About 56 days (until July 1, 2025)",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No — Nord Stream 2 AG remains on OFAC’s SDN list when checked on/after July 1, 2025.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Talks continue but stall; the administration keeps sanctions as leverage. No ceasefire/peace framework is finalized, Germany/EU remain opposed to reviving NS2, and Treasury/State see high political cost with little practical benefit. OFAC leaves NS2 AG on the SDN list through July 1.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "The White House decides to make a visible concession to jump-start Ukraine negotiations or as part of a preliminary framework. Treasury issues a delisting notice removing Nord Stream 2 AG from the SDN list before July 1, possibly paired with conditions or snapback provisions.",
    "rationale": "a) Timing: There are roughly eight weeks left. Delisting of a high-profile Russia-related SDN entity typically requires a clear policy decision and interagency alignment; that is a tight window absent a breakthrough.\n\nb) Status quo: NS2 AG is currently on the SDN list and has been since 2022. Inertia favors remaining listed, especially given the pipeline’s damaged/inoperable status and Germany’s shift away from Russian gas, which lowers the benefit of delisting.\n\nc) No outcome pathway: Without a concrete Ukraine deal, sanction relief is unlikely. The political costs (domestic and allied backlash) outweigh benefits, and the White House can continue to use the listing as leverage. This is the baseline.\n\nd) Yes outcome pathway: A rapid move tied to a broader negotiation on Ukraine, where the administration opts to delist NS2 AG as an early confidence-building measure. OFAC could execute quickly if directed, but such a decision would likely follow a public signaling shift or a concrete framework.\n\ne) Reasoning and evidence: The research assistant notes an April 2025 Politico report that the White House discussed lifting energy sanctions, including NS2, with a named envoy driving a review. There have also been proposals from investors and the former NS2 AG CEO to restart the pipeline with U.S. participation. This shows the idea is on the table, so probability is not negligible. However, absent a visible diplomatic breakthrough, delisting a symbolic, controversial entity like NS2 AG before July 1 seems unlikely. The pipeline’s limited near-term utility (damage, insolvency of NS2 AG, Germany/EU political stance) reduces the policy upside, while the domestic/ally political cost remains high. Hence, I put extra weight on the status quo.\n\nWhy not higher: Tight timeline; no publicly credible peace framework yet; high political cost; limited practical benefit. Why not lower: The White House has actively debated the option; the executive can act unilaterally; a sudden negotiation shift could trigger a fast delisting.\n\nSignals to move up: Credible reports of an imminent Ukraine ceasefire/peace framework that includes energy sanctions relief; explicit administration or Treasury/State signaling about reviewing/removing NS2 sanctions; supportive statements from Germany/EU; OFAC delisting of related Russia energy entities. Signals to move down: Clear White House denial of delisting, congressional pushback, escalation in Ukraine prompting tighter sanctions, or allied opposition statements.\n",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill the US lift its sanctions on Nord Stream 2 before July 1, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\n[White House debates lifting sanctions on Russian energy assets, Nord Stream](https://www.politico.com/news/2025/04/23/white-house-debating-lifting-sanctions-on-russian-energy-assets-00306486)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if NORD STREAM 2 AG does not appear at Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) [Sanctions List Search tool](https://sanctionssearch.ofac.treas.gov/) when checked by Metaculus on or after July 1, 2025. If it does appear on the Specially Designated Nationals and Blocked Persons (SDN) List at that time, then this question resolves as **No**.\n\nAt the time of this question, the current listing of Nord Stream 2 by OFAC can be found [here](https://sanctionssearch.ofac.treas.gov/Details.aspx?id=31926).\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nA Politico report from April 24, 2025, citing multiple sources, claimed the White House was discussing the possibility of lifting sanctions on the Nord Stream 2 pipeline as part of negotiations to end the conflict in Ukraine.

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
