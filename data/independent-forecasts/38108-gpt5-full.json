  "information": "As of late May 2025, the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) publicly claims total estimated savings of approximately $175 billion on its official tracker website. This figure represents a series of increases throughout early 2025. In late February, the claimed savings were $55 billion, which grew to $115 billion by mid-March. The claimed savings have been attributed to the cancellation of over 25,000 federal contracts and grants. According to DOGE, the most significant savings have been achieved at the Department of Health and Human Services, the General Services Administration, and the Education Department.\n\nElon Musk, who led the DOGE initiative, has departed from his public-facing role but will remain an advisor. The project's work is transitioning to the White House Office of Management and Budget (OMB), under the direction of Russell Vought. The US Treasury Secretary has stated that several members of the DOGE team will be integrated into the Treasury to apply its cost-saving principles on a long-term basis. Both Musk and President Trump have publicly expressed confidence that savings will continue to grow, with Musk suggesting a long-term goal of $1 trillion.\n\nMultiple external analyses and news reports have questioned the accuracy of DOGE's savings claims. A report by watchdog group Open The Books found that only 42% of the terminated contracts and 27% of the grants cited by DOGE could be publicly tracked. Media investigations, including one by The New York Times, have alleged numerous errors in DOGE's accounting, such as double-counting, including contracts that had already expired, and taking credit for 'zombie contracts' that never existed. An estimate by The Atlantic suggested actual verified savings may only amount to $2 billion. Furthermore, a CNN analysis projected that the effort could ultimately cost the government $135 billion due to the expense of retraining and rehiring workers who were let go.",

    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "About 31 days (until July 1, 2025)",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No — the public tracker is ~$175B; if nothing changes by July 1, it stays below $200B.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Updates stall during the transition to OMB/Treasury, or the tracker is rebaselined/paused, leaving the displayed total under $200B when Metaculus checks after July 1.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "DOGE/OMB posts another tranche of cancellations/“estimated savings,” pushing the tracker to ≥$200B by late June/early July, timed to mid‑year communications or a round‑number milestone.",
    "rationale": "- Where things stand: The RA reports DOGE’s public claim is ~$175B in late May, up from $55B in late Feb and $115B mid‑March. The page has shown steady increases. The resolution hinges only on what DOGE claims on its site (doge.gov/savings) when checked on/after July 1, not on independent verification.\n- Momentum vs. time: They need ~+$25B over ~1 month. That’s within the recent cadence (roughly +$60B over ~10 weeks). Hitting a round $200B mid‑year is politically attractive, increasing the incentive to post another update before/around July 1.\n- Headwinds: The Musk-to-OMB/Treasury transition could slow updates or change methodology. Heightened scrutiny (OpenTheBooks/NYT/CNN) may make officials more cautious or prompt a re‑baseline that delays a milestone crossing. A temporary freeze or site migration near July 1 would yield a No at check time.\n- Tailwinds: Leadership (Trump, Musk) signaling continued growth and OMB Director Vought’s reputation for aggressive framing suggest they may prioritize clearing $200B publicly. Because the criterion is the displayed claim, not audited savings, external criticism matters only insofar as it deters posting bigger numbers.\n- Why not higher: Nontrivial risk of bureaucratic slowdown, re‑scoping, or simply missing the date due to update timing (even if they later cross 200). Also possible deceleration as easy cancellations have been counted.\n- Why not lower: The remaining gap (~$25B) is modest relative to past increments, and the incentive to tout a mid‑year $200B figure is strong. No evidence of prior downward revisions on the tracker.\n- What would move me up: Any mid‑June update pushing the total to ≥$185–190B; public teasers from OMB/DOGE about surpassing $200B by July 4; increased update frequency.\n- What would move me down: No site updates by mid‑to‑late June; messaging about a methodology overhaul; site archival/migration notices; visible rollback of previously claimed savings.",

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
