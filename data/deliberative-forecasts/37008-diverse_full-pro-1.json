    "review": "The other forecasters provided compelling arguments that I had not sufficiently weighted in my initial analysis. Forecaster 2's analysis was strong and aligned with my initial thoughts but assigned a slightly higher weight to the uncertainty, which seems reasonable. Forecaster 3's analysis was particularly persuasive, introducing two crucial points: 1) the precedent of the Samoan government using rolling monthly extensions in past emergencies (e.g., COVID), which suggests a lower administrative and political barrier for an extension, and 2) the strategic logic of extending the emergency for a short 'buffer period' to ensure the new temporary power system is stable before relinquishing emergency powers. These arguments provide a strong rationale for a higher probability than my initial forecast.",
    "rationale": "I am increasing my forecast from 15% to 30%. My initial forecast was primarily based on the government's public statements and the planned timeline, which pointed toward the state of emergency ending on April 29. However, the other forecasters, particularly Forecaster 3, raised convincing arguments that suggest the probability of an extension is higher. The two key factors driving my update are the precedent of rolling extensions in past crises and the high likelihood that the government will want a 'buffer period' to ensure the new generators are stable before lifting the emergency declaration. While the most likely single outcome is still that the declaration lapses as scheduled, these new considerations make a short extension into early May significantly more plausible. I am essentially adding the probability of a strategic, precautionary extension on top of my original probability which was focused on an extension forced by delays. Therefore, I have doubled my forecast to reflect this increased likelihood of a 'Yes' outcome.",
