    "review": "My initial forecast of 35% was positioned between Forecaster 3's 30% and Forecaster 2's 76%. The core of the disagreement lies in how to weigh two competing factors: the transition away from a strong El Niño versus the persistence of unprecedented background warmth. Forecaster 3 and I both emphasize the historical impact of the ENSO cycle, where a transition to neutral or La Niña conditions typically leads to cooler global temperatures than the preceding El Niño peak, making a new record unlikely. Forecaster 2 provides a strong counterargument, focusing on the sustained, record-breaking warmth of the past 18 months, driven by exceptionally high ocean heat content and other radiative forcings, arguing this new 'status quo' of extreme heat makes another record the most likely outcome. The most decisive piece of new information came from Forecaster 3, who noted that April 2025 was only the second warmest on record. This is a critical data point, as it breaks the streak of consecutive monthly records and provides the first concrete evidence that the fading El Niño is indeed reducing the likelihood of setting new records. While Forecaster 2's points about the elevated thermal baseline are valid and prevent me from lowering my forecast substantially, the April data provides tangible support for my original thesis.",
    "rationale": "I am slightly decreasing my forecast from 35% to 32%. My original reasoning, shared by Forecaster 3, was that the shift from a strong El Niño (which almost certainly set the May 2024 record) to ENSO-neutral or La Niña conditions would make it difficult for May 2025 to be warmer. The most compelling piece of evidence introduced during this deliberation was Forecaster 3's observation that April 2025 ranked as the second-warmest April, not the first. This is a crucial development because it demonstrates that the record-breaking streak observed from mid-2023 through early 2025 has been broken, suggesting the cooling influence of the ENSO transition is now manifesting in the global data. This strengthens the case that May will follow a similar pattern: exceptionally warm, but falling just shy of the record set during the El Niño peak. \n\nI am not lowering my forecast more significantly because I find Forecaster 2's arguments about the unprecedentedly high baseline warmth compelling. The immense heat stored in the oceans, particularly the Atlantic, and other lingering factors mean the planet's overall temperature is exceptionally high. This makes a new record plausible even without the boost from an El Niño. However, the April data point is a direct counterexample to Forecaster 2's persistence-based argument. Therefore, my modest downward adjustment reflects an increased conviction that the ENSO transition will be the decisive factor, while still acknowledging that the high baseline makes a new record a very real possibility.",
