    "review": "The deliberation presented two well-reasoned, opposing adjustments to my initial forecast. Forecaster 2 argued for a lower probability (85%), emphasizing that the question resolves on the website's text, not the underlying regulation. This makes a fast, symbolic change by a motivated new administration a significant risk. They correctly identified that an administration could accept the legal chaos of a cosmetic website change to score a quick political point. Conversely, Forecaster 3, who arrived at the same 95% forecast as me, introduced a critical piece of evidence I had not considered: the existence of state-level waiver requests from Nebraska and Arkansas with resolution dates in 2026. This is a very strong signal that the accepted and currently operating pathway for this type of policy change is slow, deliberate, and state-driven.",
    "rationale": "I am maintaining my forecast of 95%. The discussion with my peers was valuable and forced me to weigh two competing new arguments. Forecaster 2's point about the possibility of a purely cosmetic website update apart from any formal rule change is valid and represents the most likely path to a 'No' outcome. However, Forecaster 3's evidence regarding the ongoing, multi-year state waiver process is more compelling. The fact that states are currently engaged in this slow process strongly implies they do not anticipate an imminent, sweeping federal change that would override their efforts. This real-world evidence of how such restrictions are being pursued provides a strong counterbalance to the speculation about a rapid, symbolic federal action. The institutional inertia, combined with the evidence from the state waiver system, makes the status quo the overwhelmingly likely outcome. My 5% uncertainty is reserved for the non-trivial risk of an unconventional, politically-motivated directive to change the website text without a corresponding rule change, as highlighted by Forecaster 2.",
