    "yes_outcome_scenario": "A batch announcement in June (e.g., tied to Juneteenth, Trump’s birthday, or a political messaging push) grants clemency to multiple people at once, or a blanket action (e.g., for a category of Jan 6 defendants or nonviolent drug offenses) is issued and publicly disclosed, covering more than two individuals.",
    "rationale": "- Baseline/status quo: Presidents typically issue clemency in sporadic batches, with many months seeing none. Early-term months often have little activity; large waves tend to cluster around political milestones or late in terms. If nothing special happens in June, the default is 0–2 grants. \n- Trump-specific behavior: In his first term, clemency came in bursts rather than a steady trickle, including high-profile and sometimes controversial grants. That raises the upside risk of a batch in any given month. However, outside of end-of-year or end-of-term periods, months with more than two grants were not the norm. \n- June catalysts: Potential hooks exist (Juneteenth, Trump’s birthday, general summer messaging), and a blanket or semi-blanket action for a defined group (e.g., some Jan 6 defendants or select nonviolent offenders) would easily push the count above two. Still, there is no concrete public reporting pointing to a June clemency push right now. \n- Information available: The research assistant provided no additional info; I’m not aware of credible reporting of imminent June clemencies, which keeps the forecast anchored to base rates and status quo. \n- Why not higher: Lack of specific signals for June, early-term months often quiet, and the political calculus may favor timing such moves for maximum impact at a later date. \n- Why not lower: Trump’s demonstrated willingness to use clemency for political and symbolic purposes creates real tail risk of a batch or blanket action in any month; June offers a few plausible narrative hooks. \n- Update triggers upward: Credible reports/leaks of a planned batch; White House/DOJ scheduling hints; public statements telegraphing imminent Jan 6 or other category clemencies; a policy speech tied to criminal justice reform around mid-June. \n- Update triggers downward: Reputable reports that clemency actions are being deferred; signals that any contemplated blanket action is legally or politically delayed past June; June news agenda dominated by unrelated priorities.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill Donald Trump grant executive clemency to more than 2 individuals in June 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nGuardian: [Trump white-collar criminal pardons cost public $1bn, says ex-DoJ official](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/may/02/trump-pardons-cost-liz-oyer)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if Donald J. Trump grants [executive clemency](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_people_granted_executive_clemency_in_the_second_presidency_of_Donald_Trump) to greater than 2 individuals in June 2025.\n\nPartial pardons or clemencies count. They will only count if publicly disclosed. Wide-reaching blanket pardons or commutations also count.\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nNo additional information available.\n\nToday is 2025-05-29.\n\nBefore answering you think:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n(e) You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
