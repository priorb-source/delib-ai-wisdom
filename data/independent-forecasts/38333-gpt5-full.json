  "information": "The 2026 Florida gubernatorial race involves several candidates. For the Republican nomination, Congressman Byron Donalds has launched his campaign and received an endorsement from former President Trump. Other potential Republican candidates include Florida First Lady Casey DeSantis, former U.S. Rep. Matt Gaetz, and Lt. Governor Jeanette Nuñez. On the Democratic side, former U.S. Representative David Jolly has announced his candidacy. State senator Jason Pizzo also announced he will run as an independent. Florida's primary election is scheduled for August 18, 2026, with the general election on November 3, 2026.\n\nAs of early June 2025, Miami Mayor Francis Suarez has publicly stated he is considering a run for governor. A poll conducted by The James Madison Institute in May 2025 showed Suarez with 5% support in the Republican primary field. In local politics, the Miami City Commission was set to vote on a proposal to move the city's November election to 2026, which would extend the terms of current commissioners and Mayor Suarez by one year.\n\nHistorically, in the last two open Florida gubernatorial cycles (2018 and 2022), major candidates typically announced their campaigns 12 to 18 months before the primary election. For the 2026 cycle, some contenders, such as Republican Byron Donalds and Democrat David Jolly, had already announced their candidacies by early June 2025. Reports note that as of early June, there have been no leaks of a launch date, no exploratory committee paperwork filed by Suarez, and no scheduled kickoff events for a gubernatorial campaign.",

    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "About 26 days (until July 1, 2025)",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Suarez continues to signal interest but delays a formal launch until later in the summer or fall to build infrastructure, watch the field (especially Byron Donalds with Trump’s endorsement and any decision by Casey DeSantis), and court donors; July 1 passes with only “considering” language or exploratory steps but no explicit candidacy announcement.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Sensing a need to stake a claim and capitalize on end-of-quarter fundraising, Suarez announces in late June via a Miami event and/or social media, kicks off finance activity before June 30, and frames himself as a South Florida, business-friendly alternative in the GOP field.",
    "rationale": "- Timeframe: We have less than four weeks. Announcements can happen quickly, but major statewide launches often show advance signals (staff hires, event leaks, paperwork). The research assistant notes none of these as of early June.\n- Field dynamics: Byron Donalds has already launched and has Trump’s endorsement, creating headwinds for late or lower-polling entrants. Potential heavyweights like Casey DeSantis and others remain possibilities, which likely encourages Suarez to wait rather than rush.\n- Historic timing: In recent open Florida gubernatorial cycles, many announcements cluster 12–18 months before the primary. Announcing by July 1 (≈14.5 months out) is within that window, so the timing would not be abnormal; this keeps the probability from being too low.\n- Signals to date: Polling shows Suarez around 5% (per RA), he has publicly said he’s considering, but there are no leaks of a launch date, no exploratory paperwork, and no scheduled kickoff events as of early June. That’s a strong status-quo signal against a near-term announcement.\n- Offsetting factors: End-of-quarter fundraising (June 30) gives a tangible incentive to announce in late June. Suarez has a history of making relatively quick, media-forward announcements (e.g., his 2023 presidential bid), suggesting he could move with minimal lead time. These factors keep the probability from being too low.\n- Status-quo weight: With no preparatory signs and a competitive GOP field, the base case is no announcement before July 1. World changes slowly; absent new evidence, “No” is more likely.\n- What would raise my estimate: Credible reporting of a planned launch window, filings that indicate an imminent run (state-level committee/candidacy paperwork tied explicitly to governor), staff hires, venue holds, donor meeting blitz, or Suarez publicly teasing a date. Any retreat by major rivals (e.g., Casey DeSantis definitively not running) coupled with donor enthusiasm could also bump odds up.\n- What would lower my estimate: Public indications that Suarez is waiting until later in 2025, additional high-profile endorsements consolidating behind Donalds, weak donor interest reports, or new negative press that would make an immediate launch imprudent.\n\nWhy not higher: Lack of concrete pre-launch signals and a strong rival with Trump’s endorsement suggest low near-term hazard. Why not lower: The timing window is still standard for a launch, Q2 fundraising incentives exist, and Suarez has shown willingness to announce with limited runway.",
