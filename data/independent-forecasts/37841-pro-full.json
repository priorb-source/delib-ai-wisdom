  "information": "On May 21, 2025, Kneecap member Liam Óg Ó hAnnaidh (also known as Mo Chara) was charged with a terrorism-related offence under Section 13 of the Terrorism Act 2000. The charge relates to an allegation that he displayed a Hezbollah flag during a concert in London in November 2024. A court date at Westminster Magistrates' Court has been set for June 18, 2025, approximately one week before the Glastonbury festival is scheduled to begin. The band has publicly denied the charge, describing it as 'political policing'.\n\nThe Metropolitan Police's Counter Terrorism Command is formally investigating the band over footage from two separate events. One investigation concerns a video from a 2024 concert where a band member allegedly said, 'The only good Tory is a dead Tory. Kill your local MP.' Another investigation relates to a 2023 concert where a band member appeared to chant, 'up Hamas, up Hezbollah.' Following public backlash, the band issued an apology to the families of murdered MPs Jo Cox and Sir David Amess. Several UK politicians and government ministers have publicly called for Glastonbury to remove Kneecap from the festival's lineup.\n\nAs of late May 2025, Kneecap remains officially listed on the Glastonbury 2025 lineup for the West Holts stage, and festival organizers have not issued any public statement regarding the controversies or the recent charge. Several venues and European festivals, including the Eden Project, Plymouth Pavilions, and Germany's Hurricane and Southside festivals, have cancelled Kneecap's scheduled appearances. However, other events have proceeded; London's Wide Awake Festival confirmed the band would still perform on May 24, and the band played a surprise gig in London on May 22, the day after the terrorism charge was made public.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Approximately one month, with the festival scheduled for June 25-29, 2025.",
    "status_quo_outcome": "Kneecap performs at Glastonbury 2025 as they are currently still on the official lineup released by the festival.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Glastonbury organisers remove Kneecap from the lineup due to escalating political and public pressure following a band member being charged under the Terrorism Act, viewing the association as an unacceptable reputational and security risk.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Glastonbury organisers resist calls for the band's removal, citing principles of free expression and the presumption of innocence. The band's legal issues do not result in a direct impediment, and they perform their scheduled set.",
    "rationale": "The core of this forecast is weighing the status quo against the severity of recent events. While Kneecap remains on the lineup, the situation has escalated significantly. The controversy is no longer just about provocative lyrics but now involves a formal charge against a band member under the UK's Terrorism Act. This is a material change that dramatically increases the pressure on Glastonbury. Several other UK and European venues have already cancelled the band's performances, setting a powerful precedent. Glastonbury, as the UK's flagship festival with a global audience and a major broadcasting partnership with the BBC, is highly sensitive to controversies of this nature, especially those involving terrorism and incitement to violence against politicians. The risk to the festival's brand, security, and political relationships is substantial. While Glastonbury has a history of embracing counter-culture, these allegations cross a line that a mainstream event of this scale is unlikely to tolerate. The court hearing scheduled for June 18, just a week before the festival, will act as a final catalyst for a decision, and it is more likely that the organisers will choose to de-risk the event by cancelling the performance. The probability is not lower than 25% because there is a non-trivial chance the organisers will make a principled stand for free expression, or that the legal case will weaken, allowing them to justify keeping the band on the bill. The probability is not higher because the combination of a formal terrorism charge, political pressure, and the precedent of other cancellations presents an overwhelming case for the festival to act protectively and remove the band.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill Kneecap perform at Glastonbury 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\n[Kneecap](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kneecap_\\(band\\)) are an Irish band who have significantly risen in popularity since their formation in 2017.&#x20;\n\nThe band is a trio consisting of: \"Mo Chara\" (Liam Óg Ó hAnnaidh), \"Móglaí Bap\" (Naoise Ó Caireallain), and \"DJ Próvaí\" (J. J. Ó Dochartaigh) whose songs consist of rap in a mixture of Irish Gaelic and English giving them a unique style.\n\nNamed after a [torture technique](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kneecapping) made infamous by the Irish Republican Army, the group are no stranger to controversies. Whilst most have been minor - complaints about profanity, drug use, violence in their songs, music videos and concerts, and promotion of Irish Republicanism - the band have come under a large amount of controversy resulting in cancelled performances which initially stemmed from a Coachcella performance where the band, \"described Israel's military action in Gaza as a US-funded genocide\".&#x20;\n\nOn top of this, [two reports were made](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/cly5r4gg7l6o) to the UK Metropolitan police:\n\n> \\[...] the band allegedly call for the death of Conservative MPs. Another seems to show a band member shouting \"up Hamas, up Hezbollah\". Both groups are banned in the UK and it is a crime to express support for them.\n\n> \\[...]\n\n> They claimed that footage where they appeared to say \"the only good Tory is a dead Tory\" had been \"taken out of all context\", and apologised for the hurt caused to the families of murdered MPs Jo Cox and Sir David Amess.\n\nThe band are [due](https://www.glastonburyfestivals.co.uk/line-up/) to play at Glastonbury 2025 - the UK's largest and most prestigious music festival - however there have been [calls](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/politics/2025/04/30/kneecap-should-be-banned-full-stop-after-dead-tories-video/) for the band to be removed from the lineup.\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question will resolve as **Yes** if Kneecap officially performs at Glastonbury 2025, scheduled for June 25 to June 29, 2025.\n\n* If Glastonbury 2025 does not take place before September 1, 2025 this question will be **annulled**.\n* Officially perform is defined as a planned performance as allowed by the festival organisers.\n* Any official performance is considered sufficient for this question. If, for example, one band member is banned from the festival, the question will still resolve as **Yes** if the other member(s) perform under the name Kneecap.\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nOn May 21, 2025, Kneecap member Liam Óg Ó hAnnaidh (also known as Mo Chara) was charged with a terrorism-related offence under Section 13 of the Terrorism Act 2000.

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any).
