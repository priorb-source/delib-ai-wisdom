    "no_outcome_scenario": "The ongoing civil war between the Sudanese Armed Forces (SAF) and the Rapid Support Forces (RSF) continues. The state institutions required for ratification remain non-functional or non-existent. The warring factions prioritize military objectives and humanitarian crisis management over long-term economic policy, and the deadline of July 1, 2025, passes without Sudan depositing its instrument of ratification.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "A sudden and unexpected comprehensive peace agreement is signed within the next week. A transitional government of national unity is rapidly formed and, as a powerful symbol of its commitment to economic reconstruction and re-engagement with Africa, it fast-tracks the ratification of AfCFTA. The instrument of ratification is processed and deposited with the African Union Commission just before the deadline.",
    "rationale": "My forecast is overwhelmingly driven by the current political and security situation in Sudan. The country has been engulfed in a devastating civil war since April 2023, which has effectively paralyzed all normal functions of the state, including legislative processes. For Sudan to ratify an international treaty like AfCFTA, a stable, recognized, and functioning legislative body would need to approve it, followed by the executive depositing the instrument of ratification. No such body currently exists, and the country is divided between warring factions.\n\nThe deadline is July 1, 2025, which is less than a month from today. The logistical and political timeline to achieve a ceasefire, form a functioning government, and then proceed with the ratification process within this period is virtually zero. The status quo is intense conflict, making non-ratification the default and most likely outcome.\n\nThe background information provided, regarding a draft implementation strategy from late 2022, indicates there was pre-war momentum. However, the subsequent outbreak of war has rendered this earlier progress moot for the current forecasting period.\n\nMy probability is not lower than 1% because I cannot completely rule out a 'black swan' event, such as a sudden military collapse of one side and a unilateral decision by the victor to ratify as a political statement, however improbable this is. My probability is not higher because a 'Yes' outcome would require a chain of extremely low-probability events to occur in rapid succession within the next few weeks. For me to update my forecast towards 'Yes', I would need to see credible, verifiable news of a comprehensive and lasting peace agreement and the immediate formation of a functional, unified government.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill Sudan ratify AfCFTA (the pan-African free trade agreement) before July 1, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\n[Draft National AfCFTA Implementation Strategy for Sudan Reviewed and Validated by Stakeholders](https://igad.int/draft-national-afcfta-implementation-strategy-for-sudan-reviewed-and-validated-by-stakeholders/)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if Sudan ratifies the African Continental Free Trade Area (AfCFTA) Agreement before July 1, 2025.\n\n\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nNo additional information available.\n\nToday is 2025-06-06.\n\nBefore answering you think:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n(e) You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
