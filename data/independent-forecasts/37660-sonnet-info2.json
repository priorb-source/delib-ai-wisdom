  "information": "A separate report from March 23, 2025, stated that the Sri Lankan government had put Starlink services on hold until the company guarantees government agencies the right to intercept data or communication details for national security reasons. According to the Deputy Minister of Information Technology, discussions between the Defence Ministry, TRCSL, and Starlink were still at a preliminary stage. The report also noted that the TRCSL had already approved tariff plans for Starlink services.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Approximately 6.5 weeks until July 1, 2025",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No - Starlink remains unavailable in Sri Lanka",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Negotiations between Starlink and the Sri Lankan government over data interception requirements remain unresolved or progress too slowly. The government maintains its position requiring guarantees for data access, while Starlink either cannot or will not agree to these terms within the remaining timeframe. Even if technical agreements are reached, the operational setup and website update do not occur before the July 1 deadline.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Starlink agrees to the Sri Lankan government's data interception requirements in the next few weeks. The Defence Ministry, TRCSL, and Starlink quickly finalize their discussions and complete all remaining regulatory approvals. Starlink then rapidly establishes the necessary operational infrastructure, processes final paperwork, and updates their availability map to show Sri Lanka as 'Available' before July 1.",
    "rationale": "The status quo strongly favors a No outcome. As of March 23, 2025 (nearly 2 months ago), the government had put Starlink services on hold pending data interception guarantees, with discussions still at a 'preliminary stage.' With only 6.5 weeks remaining until the deadline, several significant hurdles remain: (1) Concluding sensitive negotiations on government data access rights - historically contentious issues that often take months to resolve; (2) Obtaining final regulatory approvals; (3) Establishing operational infrastructure; (4) Updating the availability map. The timeline is extremely compressed given that negotiations were preliminary just 2 months ago. While positive signals exist (license granted in August 2024, tariff plans approved), the lack of any reported progress since March and the sensitive nature of data interception requirements suggest slow movement. For my forecast to increase, I would need evidence that negotiations have advanced significantly or that Starlink has agreed to the government's terms. For it to decrease further, I would need confirmation that talks have stalled or that Starlink has rejected the requirements. The 12% probability reflects the small but non-zero chance that negotiations concluded rapidly in recent weeks and that launch preparations are underway, but heavily weights the status quo given the short timeline and lack of progress indicators.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill Starlink's website show Sri Lanka as a country with Starlink availability before July 1, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nReuters: [Musk's Starlink wins Sri Lanka licence](https://www.reuters.com/business/media-telecom/sri-lanka-regulator-grants-licence-musks-starlink-satellite-broadband-2024-08-13/)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if, before July 1, 2025, the [Starlink Availability Map](https://www.starlink.com/us/map) has anywhere in Sri Lanka listed as \"Available.\"\n\n\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nA separate report from March 23, 2025, stated that the Sri Lankan government had put Starlink services on hold until the company guarantees government agencies the right to intercept data or communication details for national security reasons.

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
