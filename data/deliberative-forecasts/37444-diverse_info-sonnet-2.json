    "review": "Forecaster 2 raised critically important new information that I had not considered: Secretary of State Rubio's May 2, 2025 statement calling reports of lifting Nord Stream 2 sanctions 'unequivocally false,' Interior Secretary Burgum's reported opposition, and May 5 reporting that Trump is weighing a bill to expand sanctions on Russian energy. This is extremely recent, high-level evidence directly contradicting the hypothesis that sanctions will be lifted soon. Forecaster 2's analysis is more thorough and accounts for these hawkish signals that postdate the original Politico article. Forecaster 3's reasoning mirrors my own initial analysis at 15%, but neither of us accounted for these crucial recent developments. The explicit denial from the Secretary of State, combined with movement toward tightening rather than loosening sanctions, significantly undermines the case for a Yes outcome within the 56-day timeframe.",
    "rationale": "Upon reviewing the evidence, I need to significantly downgrade my forecast. The combination of: (1) Rubio's explicit May 2 denial that sanctions relief is being considered; (2) May 5 reporting on expanding sanctions; (3) Burgum's opposition; (4) only 56 days remaining; (5) EU disinterest and preparation of new Russia sanctions; (6) physical pipeline damage; and (7) the company's financial collapse all point strongly toward maintaining the status quo. While the original Politico article suggested internal debate, the subsequent public statements from senior officials contradict this and signal policy movement in the opposite direction (tightening). The Trump administration's volatility keeps this from being extremely low, but the weight of recent evidence is overwhelmingly against sanctions relief in this timeframe. I am updating down from 15% to 8% to align with Forecaster 2's more evidence-based analysis.",
