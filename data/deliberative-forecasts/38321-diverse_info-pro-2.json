    "review": "Both other forecasters make compelling arguments that are strengthened by new information I had not initially considered. Forecaster 3's report of official White House confirmation, corroborated by allied leaders, is the most decisive piece of evidence. This fundamentally shifts the question from one of intent to one of execution. Forecaster 2's point about the ongoing defense spending negotiations being a signature issue for President Trump provides a strong, specific motive for his attendance, adding significant weight to the confirmation. I found their reasoning convincing, as it grounds the high probability in concrete evidence (confirmation) and clear motivation (policy goals), while still appropriately acknowledging the tail risks associated with any presidential travel and the specific unpredictability of this president.",
    "rationale": "I am significantly increasing my forecast based on the deliberation. My initial forecast of 78% was based on the high base rate of presidential attendance but handicapped by the lack of explicit confirmation and President Trump's known unpredictability. The new information, particularly the official confirmation of his attendance as reported by Forecaster 3, is a game-changer. Historically, once a major summit trip is officially confirmed, the probability of attendance rises into the high 90s, with non-attendance typically resulting only from acute crises. Furthermore, Forecaster 2's argument that Trump has a strong personal political stake in the defense spending negotiations provides a powerful 'why' that makes the confirmation highly credible; he is not just attending out of obligation but to pursue a core policy objective. I am therefore updating my probability upward by 12 percentage points. The remaining 10% chance of a 'No' outcome accounts for the small but non-zero risks of a sudden health emergency, a major domestic or international crisis demanding his presence at home, or a last-minute political decision to boycott, with the latter risk being slightly elevated for this particular president compared to his predecessors.",
