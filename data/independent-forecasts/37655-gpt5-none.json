    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "About 46 days (until July 1, 2025)",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Martial law remains in force and the Verkhovna Rada does not (and legally cannot) schedule a presidential election. Government leaders continue to state that elections will occur only after martial law ends and conditions permit, so no official date is set or announced before July 1, 2025.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "A sharp change occurs: either (1) martial law is lifted before July 1 and the Verkhovna Rada promptly sets a specific election date (likely in fall 2025), or (2) Ukrainian authorities determine they can lawfully announce a precise post–martial law election date while martial law is still in effect (e.g., a Rada resolution setting a date contingent on, but not prevented by, current law), possibly following a ceasefire or major diplomatic development.",
    "rationale": "- Status quo and law: Under Ukraine’s constitutional framework and wartime legislation, nationwide elections are not held during martial law, and scheduling typically occurs via Verkhovna Rada resolution within defined timelines before the vote. Amending the Constitution during martial law is itself restricted, making a rapid legal rewrite unlikely. Since 2022, Kyiv has repeatedly extended martial law and deferred national elections. Leaders have consistently messaged that presidential elections will be held after martial law ends. This strongly points to No absent a major shift. \n- Time constraint: Only ~1.5 months remain. Scheduling would require a clear legal basis and political decision; neither seems imminent. \n- Path to Yes exists but is narrow: A sudden ceasefire/armistice enabling the lifting of martial law by late June, or a legally vetted mechanism to announce a specific post–martial law date while ML is still in force. These are possible but unlikely in the short window. \n- Why not higher: Strong legal and political inertia against announcing under martial law; ongoing security situation. \n- Why not lower: Nonzero chance of a diplomatic breakthrough, stabilization, or a legal interpretation that allows announcing a specific future date even before ML ends. \n- What would move me up: Credible reports of an impending lift of martial law; a Rada bill or official statements signaling imminent scheduling; a ceasefire framework endorsed by top Ukrainian officials; Constitutional Court or CEC guidance enabling advance scheduling. \n- What would move me down: Fresh extension of martial law well past July with explicit statements ruling out any scheduling until after it ends; escalation on the front that makes even preparatory steps politically untenable. \n- Research assistant input: None beyond the prompt; assessment relies on widely reported legal constraints and established practice since 2022.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill Ukraine announce a presidential election before July 1, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\n[Next Ukrainian presidential election](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Next_Ukrainian_presidential_election)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if, before July 1, 2025, a specific date on which a presidential election will be held is officially announced by the government of Ukraine or any of its agencies that have the authority to do so. If no such announcement occurs before that date, this question resolves as No.\n\nThe election does not have to be held before July 1, 2025; this question resolves based on an announcement.\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nNo additional information available.\n\nToday is 2025-05-16.\n\nBefore answering you think:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n(e) You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
