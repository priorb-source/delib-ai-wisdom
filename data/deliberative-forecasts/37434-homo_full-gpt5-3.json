    "review": "Both forecasters emphasize the short window (~8 weeks) and low leverage reducing creditor-forced timing—points I agree with. New/useful angles they added: (1) If a filing were imminent, it likely would have happened around the December shutdown or by the late‑March FY results/10‑K timing; surviving into May without filing is weak evidence for delay beyond July. (2) Involuntary bankruptcy risk is probably low given low secured debt and likely diffuse unsecured creditors. (3) Bankruptcy is expensive; inability to fund a retainer can itself delay a filing, nudging probability down in the short horizon. These collectively push modestly lower versus my prior. Counterpoints they also note (and I share): caretaker/public‑company costs, a missed 10‑Q or auditor/going‑concern stress, or failed asset sale could catalyze a June filing. Overall, I find their reasoning convincing and broadly consistent with mine, with a slight tilt to the downside due to timing and funding-a-filing constraints.",
    "rationale": "Key facts remain: near-zero cash at 12/31/24, operations ceased, failed capital raises, going‑concern warning, and no operating inflows—all consistent with high distress. However, leverage is low, creditors appear unlikely to force court protection, and the company has already managed through several months post‑shutdown without filing. Bankruptcy costs and the availability of out‑of‑court alternatives (asset sale, ABC, dissolution) also reduce the likelihood of a near‑term court filing. The short remaining window further favors the status quo outcome (No filing by July 1), even if bankruptcy later in 2025 remains plausible. Potential near‑term catalysts for a Yes include inability to fund public‑company obligations (e.g., Q1 10‑Q), caretaker costs for the Ohio facility, or disclosure of defaults/retention of restructuring counsel. Potential No‑preserving events include a small bridge, LOI/deposit or sale of the Ohio asset, or a decision to pursue a non‑bankruptcy wind‑down. Weighing the additional deliberation points—particularly timing around the 10‑K and the costs/retainer hurdle—I lower my estimate slightly.",
