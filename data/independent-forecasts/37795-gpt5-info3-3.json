  "information": "During the season, the Rockies' manager Bud Black was fired and replaced by Warren Schaeffer. Hitting coach Jordan Pacheco was also part of the new staff. On May 18, 2025, the team achieved a 14-12 comeback win against the Arizona Diamondbacks, which was their first victory under Schaeffer. A key contributor to this win was shortstop Ezequiel Tovar, who had recently returned from injury and went 5-for-5 with his first home run of the season. The team's upcoming schedule before June 15 included games against several high-performing teams.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "~27 days (until June 15, 2025)",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No — while the Rockies appear to be in the bottom cluster, the most likely outcome on any specific check date is that another team edges them out (or ties) for worst percentage.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Another cellar-dweller (e.g., White Sox, Athletics, or another struggling team) has an equal or worse winning percentage on the MLB standings page when Metaculus checks on/after June 15, 2025, pushing the Rockies to 29th or higher.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "The Rockies continue to underperform against a tough pre–June 15 schedule, winning at a sub-.350 clip while rival bottom teams pick up just enough wins, leaving Colorado alone (or tied, depending on interpretation) with the lowest winning percentage when the standings are checked.",
    "rationale": "Evidence and status quo: The research assistant indicates the Rockies performed poorly enough to fire Bud Black by mid-May, with Warren Schaeffer securing his first win only on May 18. That strongly suggests Colorado is currently at or near the MLB’s worst record. The assistant also notes a tough upcoming slate before June 15, which modestly increases the likelihood Colorado keeps or reclaims the basement spot. Ezequiel Tovar’s return and a 5-for-5 game are positives, but single-position player returns rarely swing team win rates materially over a 3–4 week window. \nComparative field: Even if the Rockies are currently the worst or among the worst, there are likely 3–5 teams plausibly in the mix (historically weak rosters such as the White Sox or Athletics, plus one or two others). Over a ~25-game stretch, volatility is high; the probability that any one specific team is in sole possession of last on a particular date is limited. Within a bottom cluster of ~4 teams, a naive split is ~25% per team. Colorado’s apparent current position and tougher schedule nudge that upward, but only somewhat. \nTies and resolution: The prompt doesn’t explicitly state whether a tie for the lowest winning percentage counts as “have the lowest.” If ties count as Yes (common in similar questions), that bumps the probability slightly. If ties require sole possession, the probability would be a few points lower. \nWhy not higher: Several other teams could plausibly be worse by June 15, and randomness over ~3–4 series can flip positions. A few timely wins (or rainouts altering denominators) can easily move a team out of last by percentage. \nWhy not lower: Managerial change implies underperformance already; schedule strength before June 15 is unfavorable; and there’s no strong countervailing signal of imminent improvement beyond Tovar’s return. \nWhat would move me up: Rockies extending a multi-series losing run while key rivals (e.g., White Sox/A’s) show even modest improvement; injuries to key Rockies contributors; confirmation that ties count as Yes. \nWhat would move me down: Rockies winning a couple series, meaningful returns of impact pitching or bats, or rival bottom teams entering prolonged slumps that put them clearly below Colorado by percentage.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill the Colorado Rockies have the lowest winning percentage in the MLB on June 15, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nMile High Sports: [The Colorado Rockies have lost a generation of fans](https://milehighsports.com/the-colorado-rockies-have-lost-a-generation-of-fans/)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if the Colorado Rockies have the lowest winning percentage in Major League Baseball according to the [MLB official standings](https://www.mlb.com/standings/) when checked by Metaculus on or after June 15, 2025.\n\nNo other resolution source will be used to resolve the question. Question resolves based on how the page appears when checked by a Metaculus Admin.\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nDuring the season, the Rockies' manager Bud Black was fired and replaced by Warren Schaeffer.

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
