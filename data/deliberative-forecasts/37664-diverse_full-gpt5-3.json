    "review": "Forecaster 2 largely aligns with my original view: recent, specific reports of a late May/early June GA after red-team completion are strong evidence and match Anthropic’s historical no-waitlist rollouts. Forecaster 3 adds two useful cautions: (1) give more weight to naming risk (Neptune could ship as a 3.x) and (2) status-quo/lengthening release cadence implies slippage risk. I find F2’s confidence reasonable given the timing and specificity of leaks; F3’s 38% feels too low given multiple corroborating reports and the competitive pressure to ship. But F3’s emphasis on naming ambiguity and schedule slip is a valid downward adjustment from my prior.",
    "rationale": "I previously forecast 80%. I’m maintaining a high likelihood based on: (a) multiple recent, specific reports (Cursor-IDE, ZDNet) pointing to red-team completion around May 18 and GA in late May/early June; (b) Anthropic’s history of public, no-waitlist availability within ~48 hours of announcement; and (c) competitive incentives to release before July. I am lowering modestly to account for: (1) naming risk—if the model is branded as Claude 3.x/Neptune without “4,” it won’t resolve Yes; (2) slippage risk pushing GA into early July; and (3) a small chance of an initial enterprise/partner-only or gated rollout. Net, I update down from 80% to 72%, primarily due to the naming and slippage risks highlighted in Forecaster 3’s analysis, while still weighting the recent, specific launch-timing signals heavily.",
