  "information": "Historical timelines for major Texas campaigns show variation. For the 2024 Senate race, Democrat Colin Allred announced his candidacy in May 2023, 17 months before the election. Beto O'Rourke's own record includes announcing his 2018 Senate bid 20 months early (March 2017) and his 2022 gubernatorial run 12 months early (November 2021). The question's deadline of July 1, 2025, is approximately 16 months prior to the November 2026 general election.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Approximately 5 weeks.",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No. Beto O'Rourke has not announced a candidacy for the US Senate.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Beto O'Rourke continues to gauge support and explore a potential run but withholds a formal announcement, either because he is genuinely undecided, or he is strategically waiting until late 2025 or early 2026 to launch a potential campaign, thus missing the July 1, 2025 deadline.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Following positive feedback from his recent public statements, O'Rourke's team decides to capitalize on the momentum and clear the Democratic field early. He makes a formal announcement in June 2025 to get a head start on fundraising and organizing for the 2026 election cycle.",
    "rationale": "My forecast is heavily weighted by the status quo and the short time frame until the question resolves. As of today, May 22, 2025, Beto O'Rourke is not a candidate, and there are only about five weeks until the July 1, 2025 deadline. Major campaign launches are typically well-planned events, and the current lack of significant operational signals—such as confirmed staff hirings, media leaks of a pending announcement, or FEC filings—suggests a launch is not imminent. The information from my research assistant indicates that while an announcement 16 months before the election is within the historical precedent for Texas (O'Rourke's own 2018 bid was 20 months out), his more recent 2022 gubernatorial announcement was closer to 12 months out. This suggests he could plausibly wait until after the deadline. Given his three consecutive high-profile losses, he and his potential backers likely have a strong incentive for a more cautious and deliberative approach, which argues against a rushed announcement in the next month. My probability is not lower than 15% because O'Rourke is a known political figure who could launch a campaign more quickly than a newcomer. The provided news clip confirms he is actively considering a run, and an early announcement to consolidate support is a viable, albeit less likely, strategy. My forecast is not higher because the short time horizon makes the status quo—no candidacy—the most probable outcome. I would increase my forecast upon credible reports of imminent campaign activity. I would decrease it if O'Rourke made statements pointing towards a later decision timeline or if another major Democrat signaled their intent to run.",
