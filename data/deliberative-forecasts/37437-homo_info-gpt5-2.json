    "review": "Both forecasters make tightly reasoned, consistent low-probability cases. They add two useful nuances: (1) the near-term May 20 Lai inauguration anniversary as a potential spike in coercive drills; and (2) the linguistic/threshold challenge that even some PLA actions (blockade, air/missile strikes, Coast Guard/PAP moves) wouldn’t meet the “PLA ground forces + U.S. ‘invasion’ accusation” bar. The reference to Adm. Paparo’s framing of intensified PLA pressure and to the 2027 readiness window supports a deteriorating medium-term picture but not an imminent amphibious landing. I also agree with their point that a limited seizure of an outlying feature (Pratas/Kinmen/Matsu islets) is the most plausible tail-risk pathway, and that U.S. wording could be pivotal. Overall, their arguments largely reinforce my prior view; the May 20 window slightly increases the tail risk in the remaining weeks.",
    "rationale": "Time remaining is roughly eight weeks. Baseline inertia, the complexity and telegraphing required for an amphibious/airborne landing, and the strict resolution requirement (U.S. public accusation of an invasion explicitly tied to PLA ground forces entering Taiwan-controlled territory) keep the odds very low. Most plausible near-term escalations—expanded encirclement drills, quasi-blockade, missile tests, Coast Guard/PAP actions—would not resolve this to Yes, and Washington may avoid the term “invasion” for limited/ambiguous incidents to manage escalation. However, the one-year Lai inauguration anniversary around May 20 modestly increases the chance of unusually assertive PLA activity. If a limited fait accompli against an outlying feature involved identifiable PLA marines/airborne, the U.S. might opt for “invasion” language to rally a response, which is the main upside tail. Net of these considerations, I make a small upward adjustment from 1% to 2%. Key up-movers: credible reports of PLA amphibious/airborne loading and staging, mass RO-RO requisitions, large coastal closure zones adjacent to Taiwan landing beaches, evacuation/civil defense measures in Fujian/Guangdong, PRC political signaling for imminent conflict, or U.S. intel leaks of near-term landing. Down-movers: visible de-escalation, exercise patterns without amphibious components, or simply approaching late June without mobilization indicators.",
