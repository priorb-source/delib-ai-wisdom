    "review": "The other two forecasters provided analyses that were highly convergent with my own, both in reasoning and in their final probability. We all identified the same key drivers: the extremely short 1.5-month timeline, the significant procedural hurdles required to formally 'break up' a federal agency, the tracker's strict resolution criteria requiring a signed order or statute, and the low base rate of change for other objectives on the tracker. Forecaster 3 added a useful nuance by pointing out that this specific task is likely more complex than the average 'in progress' item, which further strengthens the case for a 'No' resolution. The strong consensus reinforces my confidence in the initial assessment.",
    "rationale": "After reviewing the analyses from the other forecasters, I am maintaining my forecast of 15%. The deliberation process did not introduce new evidence or arguments that would compel a change, but rather confirmed the core reasoning. The consensus among all three forecasters is that the timeline is the primary constraint. Completing the complex legal and administrative process of dismantling a federal agency and securing a signed executive order or enacted legislation in under six weeks is highly improbable, even if it is a high political priority. The actions taken to date, such as discontinuing a database and proposing budget cuts, are significant but fall short of the tracker's criteria for 'Complete'. The strong agreement among the experts at 15% suggests this probability correctly balances the high political will against the formidable bureaucratic and temporal barriers.",
