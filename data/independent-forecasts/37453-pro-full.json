  "information": "Alberta Premier Danielle Smith has stated that her government will permit a citizen-led referendum on independence in 2026 if a public petition gathers sufficient signatures. Smith has personally said she does not support separation but believes the decision should be made by Albertans. To facilitate this process, her government introduced Bill 54, which lowers the threshold for initiating a referendum from 20% to 10% of eligible voters (approximately 177,000 signatures) and extends the time for collection from 90 to 120 days. The government also formed a panel called 'Alberta Next' to explore the province's autonomy and future relationship with the federal government.\n\nThe process for triggering a referendum requires a successful citizen petition. The petition must gather at least 177,000 signatures, which then must be officially verified by Elections Alberta before the government can formally schedule a vote. As of early May 2025, a group named 'Project for Alberta Prosperity' announced its intention to organize a signature collection campaign. Its president claimed they had already exceeded the required signature threshold, while other unverified reports mentioned 80,000 signatures being collected in 36 hours. However, no petition had been formally submitted or certified by Elections Alberta.\n\nThe discussion around a potential referendum occurs amid heightened tensions between Alberta and the federal government over energy policies, the carbon tax, and fiscal distribution, particularly following the re-election of the federal Liberal party. The proposal has faced opposition from within Alberta. Leaders of the Sturgeon Lake and Mikisew Cree Nations have publicly opposed an independence referendum, stating their treaties were with the Crown, not the province. The official provincial opposition, the New Democratic Party of Alberta, has accused Premier Smith of promoting separatism.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Less than two months, as the question closes on July 1, 2025.",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No. The government of Alberta has not scheduled an independence referendum, and the citizen-led petition process required to trigger such an announcement has not been completed.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "The primary 'No' scenario is driven by bureaucratic timelines. Although a petition may be submitted, the process for Elections Alberta to verify the required 177,000+ signatures is thorough and lengthy. This verification process is not completed before the July 1, 2025 deadline, meaning the government does not receive the official trigger needed to schedule the referendum. The pro-independence group may also simply fail to collect and submit enough valid signatures in time.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "The 'Project for Alberta Prosperity' immediately submits a petition with a number of valid signatures well in excess of the threshold. Under significant political pressure from the government, Elections Alberta prioritizes and dramatically expedites the verification process, certifying the results by early June. Seizing the political momentum, Premier Danielle Smith's government then acts swiftly to officially announce a date for the referendum before the July 1, 2025 deadline.",
    "rationale": "My forecast is based primarily on the extremely compressed timeline and the procedural hurdles involved. The status quo is 'No,' and overcoming the inertia to reach a 'Yes' outcome in under two months is a significant challenge. The process requires a petition with at least 177,000 signatures to be submitted and, crucially, verified by Elections Alberta before the government can act. Verifying this number of signatures is a meticulous and time-consuming task that would be difficult to complete in a few weeks under normal circumstances. While the 'Project for Alberta Prosperity' claims to have significant support, such claims are unverified and often optimistic. Furthermore, Premier Smith's political stance appears to be one of leveraging the threat of a referendum for autonomy negotiations with the federal government, rather than actively seeking a rapid vote on separation. Her stated timeline for a potential referendum in 2026 aligns with a slower, more deliberate process. A higher probability would be unjustified without confirmation that a valid petition has been submitted and that Elections Alberta is fast-tracking its verification. A lower probability would be inappropriate because the political environment is volatile, the legislative framework is in place, and a highly motivated group is actively working to trigger the referendum. For my forecast to increase, I would need to see the petition formally submitted to Elections Alberta and an official statement confirming an expedited verification timeline. Conversely, my forecast would decrease if the pro-independence group announces delays or if Elections Alberta indicates a standard, multi-month processing time.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nBefore July 1, 2025, will the government of Alberta officially announce a date for an independence referendum?\n\nQuestion background:\nPolitico: [The quiet threat to Canadian unity isn’t Quebec — it’s Alberta](https://www.politico.com/news/2025/04/27/the-quiet-threat-to-canadian-unity-isnt-quebec-its-alberta-00311719)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if, before July 1, 2025, a referendum on the independence of Alberta from Canada is officially scheduled. If this does not occur before that date, this question resolves as **No**.\n\nFor purposes of this question, the referendum will be considered \"officially scheduled\" when it is announced by a person or entity with the authority to do so within Alberta. Please note that broader legality, such as within Canada, will be considered irrelevant for this question, so if the federal government declared the referendum illegal, the question would still resolve as Yes.\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nAlberta Premier Danielle Smith has stated that her government will permit a citizen-led referendum on independence in 2026 if a public petition gathers sufficient signatures.

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
