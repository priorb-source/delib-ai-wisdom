    "review": "Both forecasters make compelling arguments that challenge my initial assessment. Forecaster 3's political-strategic framing is particularly strong: even if a petition is submitted and verified quickly, announcing a date by July 1 would be a dramatic escalation that removes the strategic ambiguity currently giving Smith leverage with Ottawa. Keeping the referendum threat latent preserves negotiating power without forcing immediate economic and political costs. This is a critical consideration I underweighted. Forecaster 2 reinforces this by emphasizing that Smith's stance appears focused on leveraging the threat rather than actively seeking an immediate vote, and that signature verification is a meticulous process that Elections Alberta would be reluctant to rush. Both correctly note that Smith's explicitly stated 2026 timeline signals a more deliberate approach. Their forecasts of 5% and 6% versus my 10% suggest I may have been too generous about the possibility of rapid action, particularly given the political disincentives for early announcement.",
    "rationale": "After reviewing the other analyses, I'm updating downward but not to their levels. The political-strategic argument is the most important new consideration: Smith likely prefers to maintain the referendum as a negotiating tool rather than force an immediate confrontation. Even if administrative steps complete quickly, the government has strong incentives to delay any announcement. However, I'm not going as low as 5-6% because: (1) political situations can be volatile and governments sometimes act against their strategic interests under pressure, (2) the legislative framework is in place and there appears to be genuine organizing activity, and (3) if a petition is submitted soon and signatures vastly exceed requirements, political pressure for rapid action could mount. The key insight from the deliberation is that this requires both administrative speed AND a political decision to escalate - the latter being less likely than I initially assessed. My updated forecast of 8% reflects stronger weight on political incentives for delay while maintaining meaningful probability for unexpected rapid developments.",
