  "information": "In May 2025, HR tech firm Rippling raised $450 million in a Series G funding round, which increased its valuation to $16.8 billion. As part of this event, the company also committed to a tender offer to repurchase up to $200 million in equity from current and former employees. Reports indicate Rippling has surpassed $100 million in annual recurring revenue and doubled it to over $350 million by the end of 2023. The company serves over 20,000 customers and the new funds are intended for enhancing its workforce management products and expanding global revenue.",

    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "About 39 days (until July 1, 2025)",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Rippling focuses on deploying its May 2025 Series G funds and completing the $200M employee tender offer, makes no blog announcement about an IPO, and does not publicly file an S-1 on EDGAR by July 1.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Rippling either publicly files a Form S-1 on EDGAR in June 2025 to begin an IPO process or posts on its company news/blog explicitly stating it is planning an IPO before July 1.",
    "rationale": "- Resolution hinges only on two observable triggers: a public S-1 filing or a company blog/news announcement. Confidential S-1 submissions would not be observable and likely would not satisfy this question.\n- Time window is short (~39 days). Base rates for a specific late-stage startup to publicly file an S-1 or explicitly announce an IPO in any given five-to-six-week span are low.\n- Recent facts (from the research assistant): In May 2025 Rippling raised a sizable $450M Series G at a $16.8B valuation and launched a tender offer of up to $200M for current/former employees. The stated use of proceeds is to expand products and global revenue. This combination—fresh primary capital plus a secondary liquidity program—often indicates the company is not racing to go public in the next few weeks, since the tender offers employees near-term liquidity and reduces pressure for an immediate IPO.\n- While the 2025 IPO window is relatively open and Rippling appears scaled (20k+ customers; ARR >$350M by end-2023 and reportedly strong growth), the recent large private round reduces the near-term necessity of public capital. Moreover, a public S-1 typically follows visible steps (bank mandates, credible press leaks about imminent filing, CFO/finance infrastructure signaling), none of which are cited here.\n- Why not higher: The short timeline, fresh capital and tender offer all push against a near-term public S-1 or explicit blog announcement.\n- Why not lower: Rippling is a mature, high-growth company in a window where tech IPOs are possible. If they had already confidentially prepared, a public S-1 in June is feasible.\n- What would move me up: Credible reporting (e.g., WSJ/Bloomberg) that Rippling has hired underwriters for a 2025 listing; evidence of a confidential submission with timing implying a June public S-1; a Rippling blog post hinting at near-term public markets plans; macro market strength and a wave of peer SaaS/HR tech filings in June.\n- What would move me down: Announcements emphasizing a longer private roadmap, extension of the tender timeline into late June, deterioration in IPO market conditions, or lack of any banking/filing rumors by mid-June.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nBefore July 1, 2025, will Rippling announce that it is planning an IPO?\n\nQuestion background:\n[Startup News: Shares of HR firm Rippling gain value as its business expands](https://forgeglobal.com/insights/blog/startup-news-shares-of-rippling-gain-value-as-its-business-expands/)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question will resolve as **Yes** if Rippling, Inc., announces before July 1, 2025, that it is planning an initial public offering. In order to streamline the resolution of this question, there are two resolution sources for the IPO announcement: 1) The company filing an [SEC Form S-1](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/sec-form-s-1.asp) or 2) An announcement at the [news](https://www.rippling.com/blog) section of its website. If there is no such announcement before that date, this question resolves as **No**.\n\n\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nIn May 2025, HR tech firm Rippling raised $450 million in a Series G funding round, which increased its valuation to $16.8 billion.

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
