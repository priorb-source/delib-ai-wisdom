  "information": "A high-level international conference on the two-state solution is scheduled for June 17-20, 2025, at the UN headquarters in New York. The conference is co-chaired by France and Saudi Arabia and is based on a UN General Assembly resolution from December 2024. Its stated aim is to generate momentum for more countries to recognize a Palestinian state. Supporting this effort, the Arab Group at the UN has urged member countries to recognize Palestine as a step toward lasting peace. Additionally, the 'Madrid+' group, comprising Spain, Ireland, Slovenia, and Norway, has called for Palestine's full UN membership, describing it as a \"political and diplomatic necessity.\"\n\nFrench President Emmanuel Macron has stated that recognizing a Palestinian state is a \"moral and political obligation\" and has indicated that France may officially grant recognition during the June UN conference, although he has also tied the move to certain conditions. In May 2025, the UK announced it had joined France's initiative for the recognition of a Palestinian state. According to a report by Axios, Malta is also preparing to declare Palestine's independence at the summit on June 20. Five Arab countries—Egypt, Jordan, Qatar, the UAE, and Saudi Arabia—have announced their active participation in organizing the conference.\n\nAs of May 2025, 147 out of 193 UN member states officially recognize the State of Palestine, while 46 members do not. The non-recognizing states include most Western European nations, the United States, Canada, Australia, Japan, and South Korea. In 2024, five countries newly recognized Palestine: Norway, Ireland, Spain, Slovenia, and Armenia. The Israeli government strongly opposes the international recognition effort. An Israeli official stated the country \"will not cooperate\" with such measures and warned of potential further annexation of the West Bank. The United States and several other G7 members also continue to withhold official recognition.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "1 month. The resolution period is from June 1 to June 30, 2025.",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No new UN member country recognizes the State of Palestine in June 2025, and the number of recognizing states remains at 147.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Despite the high-level UN conference, intense diplomatic pressure from the United States and Israel persuades key potential recognizers, such as France and Malta, to postpone their decision. The conference concludes with a statement of intent rather than a concrete recognition announcement from any new country within the month of June.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "During or shortly after the UN conference on the two-state solution (June 17-20), at least one country, such as France or Malta, officially announces its recognition of the State of Palestine, following through on recent public statements and diplomatic initiatives.",
    "rationale": "The forecast probability is high due to a powerful confluence of diplomatic momentum and specific, public commitments. The primary driver is the UN conference scheduled for June 17-20, which is explicitly designed to generate momentum for recognition. The initiative is led by France, whose president has called recognition a 'moral and political obligation' and hinted at an announcement during the conference. This momentum is bolstered by the UK joining the French initiative, and a specific report from Axios that Malta is preparing to recognize Palestine at the summit. The recent recognitions by Spain, Ireland, Norway, and others in 2024 have lowered the political barrier for other European nations to follow suit. With several countries signaling their intent, there are multiple pathways to a 'Yes' resolution. My forecast is not higher because recognition is a significant foreign policy decision subject to intense counter-pressure. The US and Israel strongly oppose this effort, and their diplomatic influence could lead to a last-minute delay. President Macron's statements have also been tied to unspecified conditions, providing a potential off-ramp. My forecast is not lower because that would understate the strength and specificity of the current diplomatic push. Unlike vague calls for peace, this initiative involves a major conference, high-level leadership from a G7 nation (France), and explicit reports of imminent action from at least one country (Malta). To significantly lower my forecast, I would need to see evidence of key participants like France publicly walking back their commitments or the conference being postponed. Conversely, an unequivocal pre-conference confirmation of recognition from a country's foreign ministry would increase my confidence further.",
