    "review": "Forecaster 2 and I share similar reasoning about the strong status quo forces: recent implementation, high-level political backing, broader trade policy context, and short timeframe. However, Forecaster 2's 98% confidence seems too high given the uncertainties involved. Forecaster 3 raises a critical point I underweighted: the resolution depends on the specific webpage wording, not just the policy substance. BC Hydro could maintain the Tesla exclusion but revise the language to be more generic (e.g., 'certain U.S.-manufactured products' rather than naming Tesla specifically). This could happen for legal compliance reasons, to reduce perceived brand discrimination, or through routine communications updates. Government agencies do sometimes shift from brand-specific to general policy language. While the current explicit naming suggests political willingness to be direct, and such a wording change would require active decision-making within a month, this is still a meaningful 10-15% risk I hadn't fully considered. The distinction between policy substance and webpage wording is crucial for this resolution criterion.",
    "rationale": "My core analysis remains sound: the March 12 policy has strong institutional backing, fits within broader Canadian trade strategy, faces minimal reversal pressure given Tesla's declining Canadian market position, and has only one month until resolution. The probability of full policy reversal remains very low (~2%). However, Forecaster 3's insight about potential wording changes represents a genuine additional risk. BC Hydro could theoretically shift to brand-neutral language while maintaining the substance of the exclusion, which would resolve as No despite the policy continuing. This wording-change scenario might account for 10-12% probability. Balancing these factors: (1) very strong status quo inertia and political commitment supporting current explicit wording (~82-85%), (2) small chance of policy reversal (~2%), (3) meaningful chance of wording modification while policy persists (~10-12%), and (4) other unlikely scenarios (~1-3%). Given this more nuanced view, I'm revising slightly downward from 85% to 83%, aligning with Forecaster 3's well-reasoned position. This accounts for the wording risk while still reflecting the strong likelihood that both policy and explicit naming will persist through July.",
