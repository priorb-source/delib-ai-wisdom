    "review": "My initial forecast of 19% was overly anchored on the high political salience of tariffs. I assumed this salience would translate directly to daily front-page mentions. The other forecasters, particularly Forecaster 3, provided two critical arguments I had undervalued. First, the 'exact-word' constraint. I did not sufficiently consider that news coverage could discuss the topic using synonyms like 'duties' or 'levies', which would not trigger a 'No' resolution. This significantly increases the chance of a day passing without the specific words 'tariff' or 'tariffs' appearing. Second, Forecaster 3's quantitative framing of the problem as 'the probability of at least one success over N trials' was highly convincing. Breaking the problem down into a daily probability of omission and aggregating it over the ~35 remaining days reveals how likely a 'Yes' outcome becomes, even with a low daily probability. Forecaster 2 correctly notes the strong status quo pattern from the first week, which is a valid counterpoint, but Forecaster 3's probabilistic model demonstrates that such a streak is not inconsistent with a high overall probability of an eventual 'Yes'. Forecaster 3's analysis was superior and has persuaded me to significantly revise my forecast.",
    "rationale": "I am substantially updating my forecast from 19% to 81%. The primary driver for this large update is the reasoning provided by Forecaster 3, which exposed flaws in my initial analysis. \n\nMy initial forecast failed to properly account for two key factors: \n1.  **Exact Wording:** The resolution hinges on the precise words 'tariff' or 'tariffs'. News articles, especially front-page summaries, may use synonyms ('duties', 'levies', 'trade barriers'), which would result in a 'Yes' resolution for that day. This greatly lowers the bar for a 'Yes' outcome compared to just the topic being discussed. \n2.  **Probabilistic Framing:** The question resolves 'Yes' if the criteria are met on just *one single day* out of approximately 35 remaining days. Forecaster 3's use of a '1 - (1 - p)^n' model is the correct way to approach this. Even a low daily probability ('p') of both papers omitting the specific words compounds over 35 days ('n') into a high likelihood of the event occurring at least once. For example, if there is a mere 5% chance on any given day that both papers omit the word, the probability of at least one such day occurring over 35 days is approximately 83%. \n\nThe observation from Forecaster 2 that the event has not occurred in the first week of the resolution period is important context and suggests the daily probability of a miss is not extremely high, but it does not overcome the powerful compounding effect of the long time horizon. My new forecast of 81% reflects a belief that the daily chance of both papers omitting the specific words is roughly 4-5%, which I now see as a much more realistic assessment given the factors of editorial rotation, weekend news cycles, and the potential use of synonyms.",
