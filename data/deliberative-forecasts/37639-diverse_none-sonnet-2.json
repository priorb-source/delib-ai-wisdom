    "review": "Both forecasters make compelling arguments that significantly challenge my initial 20% forecast. Forecaster 3 raises a critical point I had underweighted: the phrase 'challenge to his detention moves forward' likely refers to habeas or Zadvydas-type litigation, which typically exists precisely because removal is NOT reasonably foreseeable. This is an important signal I didn't fully appreciate. Both forecasters also correctly emphasize base rate reasoning - without any positive evidence of deportation machinery in motion (final order, travel documents, scheduled removal date), the probability should be very low. Forecaster 2 appropriately anchors on the slow pace of legal proceedings as the strong prior. Their systematic breakdown of what would be needed to increase the forecast (evidence of finalized legal process, travel documents, etc.) versus what we actually have (active litigation) is persuasive. The 5-8% range they converge on appears more justified than my initial estimate.",
    "rationale": "Upon reflection, my 20% forecast overestimated the probability by insufficiently weighting the implications of active detention litigation and the absence of any positive signals of imminent deportation. The key insight from the other forecasters is that detention challenges 'moving forward' suggests the legal system is actively working on custody issues, which typically occurs when removal itself is not feasible in the near term. Additionally, even with a final deportation order, the administrative execution requires coordinated steps (travel documents, country cooperation, flight arrangements) that rarely happen within 6-7 weeks. The base rate for deportation of a specific detainee with active litigation and no evidence of imminent removal is genuinely quite low. I should have given more weight to the lack of positive indicators and the specific nature of the legal challenge mentioned. I'm revising significantly downward to align with the base rate reasoning, though staying slightly above the 5% floor to account for some possibility of information asymmetry or unexpected rapid developments.",
