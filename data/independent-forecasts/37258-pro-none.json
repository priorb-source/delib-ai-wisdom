    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Less than two months.",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No, because the legal and political barriers to holding a referendum remain in place, and the Scottish Government has not announced a date.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "The Scottish Government continues to advocate for independence but, constrained by the UK Supreme Court's 2022 ruling and the consistent refusal of the UK Government to grant a Section 30 order, refrains from announcing a specific referendum date. The political focus remains on longer-term strategy rather than setting a short-term, legally unenforceable deadline.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "In a strategic political move, perhaps to energize supporters or create a constitutional conflict with the UK government following a recent election, the First Minister of Scotland officially announces a date for a new independence referendum. This action would satisfy the question's criteria, even if the referendum is not sanctioned by the UK government and cannot legally proceed.",
    "rationale": "My forecast is based primarily on the powerful status quo. The deadline of July 1, 2025, is less than two months away, an extremely short timeframe for such a significant political development. The primary obstacle is the November 2022 UK Supreme Court ruling, which determined the Scottish Parliament cannot legislate for a referendum without UK Parliament consent. Both major UK parties, Conservative and Labour, remain firmly against granting this consent via a Section 30 order. Therefore, any date announced by the Scottish government would be purely symbolic and legally impotent. The Scottish National Party (SNP) has previously set a target date (in 2023) which passed without event, making them cautious about repeating a strategy that could be perceived as an empty promise. Given that a UK General Election must have occurred by January 2025, the new political landscape in May 2025 would still almost certainly feature a UK government staunchly opposed to a referendum, providing no new impetus for the Scottish government to act.\n\nMy probability is not lower than 5% because the question's resolution criteria are specific: a simple announcement by an authorised Scottish government official is sufficient, irrespective of UK legality. This lowers the bar for a 'Yes' outcome significantly. A purely political gesture, designed to provoke a response or rally the base, remains a possibility, however unlikely. The article mentioning a poll with a lead for 'Yes' is noted, but a single poll is insufficient to trigger a major strategic shift, especially with an unknown publication date.\n\nMy probability is not higher than 5% because the strategic incentives for the SNP to make such an announcement in the next two months are very weak. It would be a high-risk move with little tangible reward, likely dismissed by opponents and potentially demoralizing for supporters if the date inevitably passes without a vote. The path of least resistance and greater strategic sense is to focus on building long-term support and await a more fundamental shift in the political or legal landscape.\n\nI would raise my probability if the UK government unexpectedly softened its stance or if a series of polls showed a dramatic and sustained surge in independence support to over 60%. I would lower it if the First Minister explicitly ruled out any referendum announcements for the rest of the year.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nBefore July 1, 2025, will the government of Scotland officially announce a date for an independence referendum?\n\nQuestion background:\nThe National: [Yes posts huge 11-point lead in new Scottish independence poll](https://www.thenational.scot/news/25089457.yes-posts-huge-11-point-lead-new-scottish-independence-poll/)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if, before July 1, 2025, a referendum on the independence of Scotland from the United Kingdom is officially scheduled. If this does not occur before that date, this question resolves as **No**.\n\nFor purposes of this question, the referendum will be considered \"officially scheduled\" when it is announced by a person or entity with the authority to do so within Scotland. Please note that broader legality, such as within the United Kingdom, will be considered irrelevant for this question, so if the federal government declared the referendum illegal, the question would still resolve as Yes.\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nNo additional information available.\n\nToday is 2025-05-02.\n\nBefore answering you think:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n(e) You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
