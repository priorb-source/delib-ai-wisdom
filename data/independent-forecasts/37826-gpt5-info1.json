  "information": "Following a terrorist attack in Pahalgam, Jammu and Kashmir on April 22, 2025, which killed 26 tourists, the Indian government took several actions against Pakistan. These included suspending the Indus Water Treaty, closing the Attari-Wagah border, and banning the SAARC visa scheme for Pakistan. The Indian military launched 'Operation Sindoor' (also referred to as 'Operation Sundar'), a series of targeted strikes against what were described as terrorist camps in Pakistan-occupied Kashmir and Pakistan proper. Indian sources reported that over 100 terrorists were killed in these operations, including high-value targets. The operation targeted infrastructure linked to groups like Lashkar-e-Taiba and Jaish-e-Mohammed.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Approximately 40 days (the resolution window is June 1–30, 2025; known by July 1, 2025)",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No — no additional Indian kinetic strike in Pakistan proper during June 2025",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "The April–May punitive actions (diplomatic, economic, and limited military) are judged sufficient. India keeps pressure via the Indus Treaty suspension, border closure, and international diplomacy while confining any military activity to the LoC/PoK. International actors push de-escalation; Pakistan avoids major direct retaliation; no new mass-casualty attack in India compels further cross-border strikes into Pakistan’s provinces.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "A new high-profile terror attack in India tied to Pakistan-based groups or time-sensitive intelligence on high-value targets/launch sites in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa prompts Indian air/drone/missile/artillery strikes into Pakistan proper (e.g., KP or Pakistani Punjab). Alternatively, Operation Sindoor conducts another publicly reported wave that extends into June, hitting targets in KP, Punjab, Sindh, or Balochistan.",
    "rationale": "I put extra weight on the status quo: historically, Indian kinetic strikes into Pakistan proper are rare (Balakot 2019 is the main clear precedent), and crises often plateau after an initial retaliatory action. The research assistant reports that after the April 22 Pahalgam attack, India escalated sharply—suspending the Indus Water Treaty, closing Attari-Wagah, banning SAARC visas, and launching ‘Operation Sindoor’ with targeted strikes including some in Pakistan proper. That recent precedent does raise the risk of follow-on action, but it can also satisfy domestic demands for retribution, reducing the need for additional June strikes. Strong international pressure (U.S., Gulf states, China) and Pakistan’s fragile economic/political context favor de-escalation over a sustained campaign inside Pakistan’s provinces. Moreover, many Indian cross-border actions occur in PoK, which would not count for this question. Why not higher: base rate for June strikes into Pakistan proper remains low; nuclear-escalation risks and diplomatic costs are significant; Eid al-Adha in mid-June may further disincentivize a fresh strike window absent a trigger. Why not lower: the environment is already escalatory; India has demonstrated willingness to hit in Pakistan proper in 2025 per the RA; an ongoing named operation creates some probability of additional waves; leadership incentives to maintain deterrence are present. Updaters: I would raise the probability materially if (1) there is a significant new attack in India credibly linked to Pakistan-based militants; (2) credible reporting of Indian force mobilization, NOTAMs/airspace restrictions near the western sector, or public threats by senior Indian officials; (3) indications Operation Sindoor is explicitly continuing into June. I would lower it if (1) there are signs of backchannel talks/mediation producing CBMs, (2) partial reversal/softening on diplomatic/economic steps (e.g., reopening the border), or (3) Pakistan undertakes visible steps against implicated groups reducing Indian casus belli.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill the Indian Armed Forces execute a kinetic attack in Pakistan proper in June 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nWikipedia: [2025 India–Pakistan conflict](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2025_India%E2%80%93Pakistan_conflict)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if after May 31, 2025 and before July 1, 2025 the Indian Armed Forces execute a kinetic attack on targets in one of the following provinces of Pakistan: Sindh, Baluchistan, Punjab, or Khyber Pakhtunkhwa.\n\nTo count, an attack must be [kinetic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kinetic_military_action), using explosive weaponry or physical violence. Non-kinetic actions such as a cyberattack would not count, even one resulting in deaths.\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nFollowing a terrorist attack in Pahalgam, Jammu and Kashmir on April 22, 2025, which killed 26 tourists, the Indian government took several actions against Pakistan.

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
