    "review": "Forecaster 2’s core claim—that the absence of evidence about opponents implies Jones is effectively unopposed—doesn’t hold up. In Virginia, if a candidate is unopposed, there typically isn’t a primary for that office; a statewide primary date doesn’t imply a contested AG primary is absent or present. With two weeks to go, relying on “no news” to infer a cleared field is risky and likely overconfident. Forecaster 3’s approach is more cautious and acknowledges the limits of available information, though simply dividing odds by an assumed number of candidates is too naive. Structural factors (NOVA turnout strength, prosecutor credentials being salient for AG) remain relevant and were central to my initial view. Overall, F3 is closer to my prior; F2 is overconfident given the mechanics of VA primaries and typical media coverage patterns.",
    "rationale": "Time left: ~14 days. If there were a runaway frontrunner or an uncontested race, we would likely see clearer public indicators by now; the question’s annulment clause also reminds us a primary may not occur for this office if uncontested. The most plausible contested scenario features Jones versus at least one Northern Virginia, prosecutor-credentialed Democrat—historically a strong profile for AG in VA—with NOVA’s large primary turnout a key structural advantage. Jones’s strengths: prior statewide exposure, potential to consolidate Black voters, and a strong Hampton Roads base. His hurdles: needing to win or remain competitive in NOVA and the tendency for prosecutor experience to be a persuasive credential in an AG primary. Given the proximity to Election Day and lack of clear evidence of dominance by Jones, I continue to see a competitive race with a slight structural lean against him. Forecaster 2’s argument doesn’t justify a big upward move; Forecaster 3’s uncertainty case supports staying near my prior. I make a small upward nudge to reflect the possibility of opponent vote-splitting or late consolidation for Jones, but I still see no basis for treating him as a prohibitive favorite.",
