    "review": "- Forecaster 2 reinforces the low base-rate and channel-awareness constraints (NUFORC’s U.S.-centric intake; rarity of pilot-tagged reports), which aligns with my prior reasoning. No new evidence, but the emphasis on the reporting funnel is persuasive.\n- Forecaster 3 posits 1–2 African pilot reports per year, implying ~8–17% per month. That assumption meaningfully raises the monthly estimate if true, but it is not backed by historical counts from NUFORC. The Rwanda example referenced is not clearly a pilot report, so it doesn’t credibly anchor that annual rate.\n- Neither forecaster addressed NUFORC posting/labeling lag risk explicitly; that remains a downward factor because the resolution hinges on what’s visible on/after July 1.\n- Net: F2’s reasoning supports my low base rate. F3’s upward argument depends on an unsubstantiated annual frequency. I find F2 more convincing; F3’s estimate seems optimistic without data to support 1–2/year specifically labeled as pilot reports from Africa.",
    "rationale": "I maintain a low probability due to: (1) conjunctive criteria (Africa + pilot + June window + visible on NUFORC by or soon after July 1), (2) NUFORC’s predominantly U.S. intake and limited international awareness, and (3) the historically small share of pilot-tagged reports. I acknowledge upside factors (growing UAP attention; widespread aviation over Africa; potential satellite/reentry stimuli), but without evidence of a higher historical rate of African pilot reports or of faster NUFORC posting cadence, I see limited basis to move materially higher. I make a slight upward nudge to reflect Forecaster 3’s point that only one incident is needed and the plausibility that at least some African pilot reports do reach NUFORC each year, even if the exact annual count is uncertain.",
