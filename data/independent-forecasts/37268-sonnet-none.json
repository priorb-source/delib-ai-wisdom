    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Approximately 59 days until July 1, 2025",
    "status_quo_outcome": "NO - Muqtada al-Sadr has recently reaffirmed his election boycott and rejected the Iraqi President's plea to participate",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Sadr maintains his current boycott position, viewing the Iraqi political system as too corrupt or compromised by foreign influence to legitimize through participation. He continues his strategy of political opposition from outside the electoral system through the end of June 2025.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Sadr reverses his position following successful political negotiations, concessions from the government, electoral reform agreements, or pressure from his base who want representation. He announces that the Alliance Towards Reforms will field candidates, possibly framing it as a tactical shift to better serve the reform agenda.",
    "rationale": "The status quo strongly favors a NO outcome. According to the background article, Sadr has recently rejected the Iraqi President's plea and reaffirmed his election boycott. This represents his current, publicly stated position. With approximately 59 days remaining until the resolution date, there is limited time for a major policy reversal. While Muqtada al-Sadr has historically demonstrated unpredictability in Iraqi politics - including withdrawing his bloc from parliament in 2022 and fluctuating between participation and boycott - recent reaffirmations of political positions typically persist in the short term. The fact that this is described as a 'reaffirmed' boycott suggests he has doubled down on this stance, making a near-term reversal less likely. However, several factors prevent assigning an extremely low probability: (1) The Iraqi President's plea indicates active political negotiations are occurring, (2) Sadr has changed course dramatically in the past, (3) Boycotting means forfeiting significant political influence, which may prove strategically costly, (4) Grassroots pressure from his supporters for representation could mount. The probability is not higher because the recent public reaffirmation creates political costs to reversing course quickly, and no information suggests imminent political developments that would trigger such a reversal. The probability is not lower because Iraqi politics remains volatile, and two months provides some window for changed circumstances. For me to update significantly higher, I would need evidence of: active negotiations producing concrete results, signs of internal pressure within his movement, or Sadr softening his rhetoric. To update lower, I would need additional statements reinforcing the boycott or explicit rejection of any participation scenarios.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nBefore July 1, 2025, will Muqtada al-Sadr's Alliance Towards Reforms party announce that it will participate in the 2025 Iraqi parliamentary election?\n\nQuestion background:\nbasnews: [Sadr Rejects Iraqi President’s Plea, Reaffirms Election Boycott](https://www.basnews.com/en/babat/881132)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if, before July 1, 2025, the Alliance Towards Reforms announces that it will field candidates in Iraq's [2025 parliamentary elections](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2025_Iraqi_parliamentary_election).\n\n\"Alliance Towards Reforms\" refers to the \"**تحالف سائرون للإصلا**ح\" or \"سائرون\" coalition, party or movement headed by Muqtada al-Sadr, as decribed at [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alliance_Towards_Reforms). Name changes will not affect resolution.\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nNo additional information available.\n\nToday is 2025-05-03.\n\nBefore answering you think:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n(e) You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
