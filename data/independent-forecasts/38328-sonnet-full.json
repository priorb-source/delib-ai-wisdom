  "information": "A lobbying scandal involving Huawei has led to a probe by Belgian prosecutors. On June 5, 2025, EPP MEP Fulvio Martusciello was arrested in connection with the investigation. Authorities have also requested that the parliamentary immunity be lifted for at least four other MEPs. The Parliament's Committee on Legal Affairs was expected to vote on these immunity waivers in mid-June, with the full plenary potentially confirming the decision during its session from June 16-19. Citing the precedent set during the 'Qatargate' scandal, major political groups like the EPP, S&D, and Renew have signaled zero-tolerance positions on corruption.\n\nHistorically, the 705-seat European Parliament sees between 80 and 120 replacements over a five-year term, which averages to approximately 1-2 departures per month. This turnover can be due to a variety of reasons, including appointments to national posts, retirement, scandals, or health issues. The rate of departures is often higher during the first year of a new parliamentary term. Precedents from previous scandals are mixed; while events like 'Qatargate' did lead to resignations, some indicted MEPs, such as Eva Kaili and Marc Tarabella, resisted calls to step down for several months while legal proceedings were ongoing.\n\nResignations from the European Parliament frequently occur when a sitting MEP is appointed to a ministerial position within their national government. Following elections in several member states, new governments were in the process of being formed. Specifically, after the May 18 elections in Portugal, there were rumors that at least two MEPs were being considered for cabinet positions in the new government. Other countries, including Germany, the Netherlands, and Belgium, also had fluid political circumstances that could lead to cabinet reshuffles.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "26 days (from June 5 to July 1, 2025), though the window for qualifying resignations is June 10-30, 2025 (21 days)",
    "status_quo_outcome": "Yes - at least one MEP resigns",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "The MEPs implicated in the Huawei scandal resist calls to resign while legal proceedings unfold, similar to Qatargate where some held out for months. No cabinet appointments materialize in Portugal or elsewhere. Normal parliamentary turnover happens to fall outside the June 10-30 window, with any departures occurring before June 10 or after June 30.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Political pressure from major groups forces at least one of the MEPs implicated in the Huawei scandal to resign during June 10-30. Alternatively, one or more of the Portuguese MEPs rumored for cabinet positions accepts an appointment and resigns. Or simply normal parliamentary turnover results in at least one resignation for standard reasons (health, retirement, other appointments) within the qualifying window.",
    "rationale": "The status quo strongly suggests Yes. The European Parliament historically experiences 80-120 replacements over five years, averaging 1-2 departures per month, with higher rates in the first year of a term. Over a 21-day window (June 10-30), the baseline probability of at least one resignation from normal turnover alone would be approximately 40-50%.\n\nSeveral factors push probability higher: (1) The active Huawei scandal with one arrest already made and immunity waivers pending for at least four more MEPs creates immediate pressure; (2) Major political groups (EPP, S&D, Renew) have declared zero-tolerance positions on corruption; (3) The plenary session June 16-19 will likely vote on immunity waivers, creating a focal point for decisions; (4) Portugal's May 18 elections have created concrete cabinet appointment opportunities for at least two MEPs; (5) Other countries have fluid political situations that could generate additional resignations.\n\nCountervailing factors include: (1) Qatargate precedent shows some MEPs resist resignation for months despite indictments; (2) Legal proceedings move slowly; (3) The qualifying window specifically excludes June 5-9, missing any immediate scandal-driven resignations.\n\nMy forecast is not higher (e.g., 85%+) because MEPs under investigation may choose to fight rather than resign immediately, and the specific date restrictions create risk. It's not lower (e.g., 50%) because normal turnover alone provides substantial baseline probability, and we have multiple independent pathways to Yes (scandal, cabinet appointments, normal turnover). For me to revise upward, I'd need to see explicit resignation announcements imminent or confirmed cabinet appointments. To revise downward, I'd need evidence that implicated MEPs are digging in to resist, cabinet formations excluding MEPs, or data showing current turnover rates are unusually low.",
