    "review": "All three forecasters, including myself, identified institutional inertia and the extremely short timeline as the dominant factors making a 'Yes' outcome highly likely. The consensus is that a full scientific review and publication of new guidance by July 1, 2025, is nearly impossible. The primary difference in our forecasts (85%-90%) lies in the perceived probability of a politically motivated, rapid change that would result in a 'No' resolution. Forecaster 3 raised a point I had not fully weighted: the specific and plausible scenario of an 'interim measure' where the recommendation is removed and replaced with an 'Under Review' notice. This is a realistic bureaucratic response to political pressure and a more likely path to a 'No' outcome than a completed review.",
    "rationale": "I am updating my forecast downward from 90% to 85%. My initial analysis was strongly aligned with Forecaster 2's, focusing on the high bar for changing a major public health recommendation in under three months. However, Forecaster 3's reasoning has convinced me to slightly increase the probability of a 'No' outcome. Their articulation of a specific failure mode—the CDC updating the webpage to state the recommendation is 'Under Review' rather than providing a specific number—is a compelling and plausible scenario. This action would meet the resolution criteria for 'No' and represents a realistic, low-effort way for the agency to respond to political pressure without needing to complete the entire scientific review process. My core belief that the status quo will hold remains, but I now see a clearer and slightly more probable path for a 'No' resolution, warranting a 5-point adjustment from 90% to 85%.",
