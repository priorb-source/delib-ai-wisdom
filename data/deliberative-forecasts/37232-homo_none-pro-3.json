    "review": "Both other forecasters arrived at a nearly identical conclusion for the same primary reason: the strong, cyclical forcing function of a Q1 2025 earnings report, which is almost certain to occur in May and be posted to the company's news page. This consensus strongly validates my initial analysis. We all agree that the status quo (a three-month silence) is a much weaker signal than the institutional obligation to report earnings. The only difference is a minor one of probability (7% vs. 10%), reflecting a slightly different weighting of small tail risks, such as a scheduling delay into June or a change in the company's web communication strategy. Neither forecaster raised evidence or arguments I had not already considered.",
    "rationale": "I am maintaining my forecast of 10%. The deliberation process with the other forecasters has reinforced my confidence in my original reasoning. The core of the forecast remains that Virgin Galactic, as a publicly-traded company, has an extremely high likelihood of posting its Q1 2025 financial results to its news page in May, consistent with its historical reporting calendar. This single, highly predictable event would resolve the question as 'No'. My forecast remains at 10% rather than dropping to 7% because I believe the existing and unusual three-month gap in communications provides a small but important signal. This silence could indicate a lower priority on external communications or internal shifts that slightly increase the probability of an administrative oversight (e.g., not cross-posting the release to the main news page) or a delay in the earnings release past May 31. The strong consensus on the core logic means a large revision is not warranted, but I believe my 10% forecast appropriately prices in this minor additional uncertainty.",
