    "review": "All three forecasters arrived at remarkably similar conclusions (78-82% range), which increases my confidence in this probability range. Forecaster 3 makes the strongest structural argument I hadn't fully emphasized: even at the low end of Bloc projections (19 seats) combined with the high end of Conservative projections (12 seats), the Bloc still wins more seats by a 7-seat margin. This is powerful evidence that the outcome would require a significant deviation from current projections. Forecaster 2 appropriately emphasizes the time factor and the Bloc's demonstrated vulnerability, having already lost 10-14 percentage points. Both forecasters correctly note that Conservative support remains geographically concentrated, limiting their ability to win seats across Quebec despite stable polling. The consensus around key factors - historical precedent, current seat projections, polling leads, and the nature of the Liberal surge - validates the core analytical framework. No fundamentally new evidence was presented that changes the calculus, though the framing of best-case/worst-case scenarios by Forecaster 3 strengthens the Yes case.",
    "rationale": "After reviewing the other analyses, I maintain my assessment at 82%. The structural argument that even pessimistic scenarios for the Bloc (19 seats) exceed optimistic Conservative scenarios (12 seats) reinforces confidence in the Yes outcome. The 5-17 point polling advantage and consistent seat projection models across multiple sources (Canada388, The Writ) provide robust quantitative support. The historical pattern of Bloc dominance over Conservatives in Quebec (32-10 in both recent elections) remains highly relevant. However, I acknowledge the meaningful downside risks: the Bloc has already demonstrated significant vulnerability with a 10-14 point decline, showing they can lose support rapidly. The Liberal surge to 40-42% creates ongoing political volatility, and several months may remain until the election. Conservative geographic concentration in Quebec City, while limiting their ceiling, does provide efficiency in their stronghold regions. The balance of evidence strongly favors Yes, but the demonstrated Bloc weakness and remaining time prevent me from forecasting above 85%. The convergence of three independent forecasts in the 78-82% range suggests this probability band appropriately captures both the strong base case for Yes and the non-trivial possibility of further negative developments for the Bloc.",
