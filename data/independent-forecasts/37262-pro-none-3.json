    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Less than two months, as the question concerns events with a start date before July 1, 2025.",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No. The world changes slowly, and while India has several ongoing protest movements, the strict criteria require a *new* protest to begin and reach a significant scale within a very short timeframe.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "The period before July 1, 2025, passes without a new, distinct protest movement emerging that mobilizes over 10,000 people. Existing protests continue or subside, but because they started before the question's launch, they do not qualify for a 'Yes' resolution.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "A new trigger event, such as a controversial government policy, a significant court ruling, or a major political scandal, occurs after May 2, 2025. This event ignites a fresh wave of protests, independent of existing movements, which rapidly grows to include a gathering of over 10,000 people. This new protest is then cataloged by the Global Protest Tracker.",
    "rationale": "My forecast is primarily based on the restrictive criteria of the question, weighed against the high base rate of social unrest in India. While India is a frequent site of large-scale protests, two key factors heavily constrain the probability of a 'Yes' outcome. \n\nFirst, the timeframe is very short—less than two months. Mobilizing over 10,000 people for a new cause within this window is challenging.\n\nSecond, and more importantly, the resolution criteria specify that a protest active at the time of the question's launch does not count. This is a critical filter. It disqualifies an escalation of ongoing movements, such as the farmers' protests or the recent deadly protests in eastern India over a land law mentioned in the Reuters backgrounder. Therefore, a 'Yes' outcome requires an entirely new protest movement to spark, organize, and reach significant scale. The emergence of a completely new mass movement is a much rarer event than the continuation or intensification of an existing one.\n\nMy probability is not lower than 20% because India's political and social environment is consistently volatile. The existence of known tensions, like the land law dispute, demonstrates that the potential for new flashpoints that could trigger a qualifying protest is very real. A 'No' outcome requires two months of relative calm in terms of new mass mobilizations, which is not a certainty.\n\nMy probability is not higher than 20% due to the high bar set by the 'new protest' requirement. Betting on the emergence of a novel mass movement in such a short period is speculative. Furthermore, resolution is dependent on a single source, the Global Protest Tracker, which may have a reporting lag or specific inclusion criteria that could exclude a qualifying event. I would update my forecast upwards if a clear, new national-level trigger event were to occur, and downwards if the current political climate remains stable without new major controversies.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill the Global Protest Tracker report any protests in India with 10,000+ participants, before July 1, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nReuters: [Three dead as protests against Muslim land law turn violent in eastern India](https://www.reuters.com/world/india/three-dead-protests-against-muslim-land-law-turn-violent-eastern-india-2025-04-14/)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if the [Global Protest Tracker](https://carnegieendowment.org/features/global-protest-tracker?lang=en) reports a protest in India with 10,000 or more participants with a start date after the launch of this question and before July 1, 2025.\n\nA protest with at least 10,000 participants that is active at the launch of this question does not count for resolution.\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nNo additional information available.\n\nToday is 2025-05-02.\n\nBefore answering you think:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n(e) You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
