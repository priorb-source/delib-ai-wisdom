    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Approximately 1-2 weeks. Since today is April 22, 2025, we are near the end of April. Monthly inflation data is typically released by national statistical agencies in the first 1-2 weeks of the following month, so we should know Ukraine's April 2025 inflation rate by mid-May 2025 at the latest.",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No - inflation remains below 15.0%",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Ukraine's April 2025 inflation rate comes in between 10-14%, elevated but below the 15% threshold. This could occur if government monetary policy measures prove effective, international financial aid helps stabilize the hryvnia, or if supply chains show some resilience despite ongoing war pressures.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Ukraine's April inflation surges above 15% driven by a combination of factors: continued war-related disruptions to domestic production, energy price pressures, currency devaluation against major currencies, and increased government spending on defense crowding out economic stabilization measures. The stagflation warning signals in the April 10 article prove prescient.",
    "rationale": "The key piece of information is the April 10, 2025 article stating Ukraine is 'one step away from stagflation.' This language suggests inflation is elevated and trending worrisome, but has not yet reached crisis levels. Stagflation typically involves inflation rates in the mid-to-high teens or higher. The phrasing 'one step away' implies Ukraine's inflation is likely in the 10-14% range currently, approaching but not yet at the 15% threshold. Since we're on April 22 and most of the month has passed, the underlying economic conditions for April are largely determined. The 15% threshold is quite specific and represents a meaningful psychological and economic barrier. While Ukraine's wartime economy faces severe pressures that typically produce high inflation, it also receives substantial international financial support aimed at economic stabilization. The status quo principle suggests betting on continuity - if Ukraine was 'one step away' as of mid-April, it's more likely to remain just below 15% than to have suddenly crossed that threshold in the latter half of the month. I'm not forecasting higher because the source material suggests the situation hasn't reached full stagflation yet. I'm not forecasting lower because the economic pressures are real and substantial, and 15% is achievable under continued stress. I would revise upward if I learned Ukraine's March 2025 inflation was already at 13-14%, or if there were reports of sharp hryvnia devaluation or major supply disruptions in April. I would revise downward if I learned current inflation was only 8-10% or if there were reports of successful stabilization measures.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill Ukraine's inflation rate increase to at least 15.0% for April 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\n[Ukraine is one step away from stagflation. And here's why](https://en.iz.ru/en/1868046/2025-04-10/ukraine-one-step-away-stagflation-and-heres-why)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if Ukraine's annualized inflation rate is greater than or equal to 15.0% for the month of April 2025, according to the number presented by [Trading Economics](https://tradingeconomics.com/ukraine/inflation-cpi). Under 15.0% resolves as **No**.\n\n\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nNo additional information available.\n\nToday is 2025-04-22.\n\nBefore answering you think:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n(e) You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
