The database, created in 1980 to track the financial costs of major climate events, will not be updated beyond 2024 and its existing information will be archived. According to AM Best, a credit rating agency, the removal of this centralized data source could hinder insurance companies' ability to model, price, and manage risks associated with climate-related disasters.

These actions are seen by some as aligning with the 'Project 2025' plan promoted by the Heritage Foundation, which proposes dismantling the agency. Additionally, some of NOAA's regional climate centers have been shut down, and all contributors to the National Climate Assessment have been fired.\n\nOn April 4, 2025, a NOAA spokesperson stated that the agency's websites will remain online. Following an internal memo that had warned of potential data loss if sites went down, the spokesperson confirmed, 'There will be no interruption in service.

The statement specifically referred to websites connected to NOAA's Office of Oceanic and Atmospheric Research, which focus on climate change, extreme weather research, and drought monitoring.",

    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "About 41 days (until July 1, 2025)",
    "status_quo_outcome": "Yes",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "NOAA takes Climate.gov offline (e.g., decommissioning or consolidating web properties without a live redirect), or a prolonged outage/DNS/SSL misconfiguration or DDoS happens exactly when Metaculus checks IsItDownRightNow, causing the service to report the site as down.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Climate.gov remains live as a functioning site or even just a simple landing/redirect page that responds to HTTP requests, leading IsItDownRightNow to report it as up when Metaculus checks on/after July 1.",
    "rationale": "- Status quo and base rates: Climate.gov is currently up (IsItDownRightNow reported it reachable on May 7, 2025). Government .gov domains are typically stable; over a 41‑day horizon, the base rate of continued availability is very high. Even with policy shifts, agencies usually keep domains live or maintain redirects rather than abruptly pulling them. The resolution source only needs the site to be reachable, not to host specific content.\n- Evidence supporting continued uptime: A NOAA spokesperson (Apr 4, 2025) said NOAA Research sites will remain online. Climate.gov sits under NOAA’s Climate Program Office within OAR, so this statement is directly relevant. This is a strong near-term commitment.\n- Signals of change but not necessarily shutdown: The research assistant notes NOAA is decommissioning the Billion‑Dollar Disasters database (no updates beyond 2024, archive preserved) and reports of broader cuts aligned with “Project 2025.” These indicate content reduction and reprioritization, not necessarily domain takedown. Historically, even when climate content was altered during 2017–2020, high‑profile NOAA web properties generally stayed online.\n- Why not higher: (1) Political/organizational risk: accelerated decommissioning or consolidation that removes Climate.gov without a live redirect. (2) Operational risk: certificate lapse, DNS change, or maintenance outage coinciding with Metaculus’s check. (3) The criterion depends on a third‑party status page at the specific time Metaculus looks; a transient issue or a false negative could flip the outcome.\n- Why not lower: (1) Short time frame to July 1. (2) Explicit NOAA assurance of site continuity. (3) Current verified uptime as of May 7. (4) Even aggressive content changes typically preserve site reachability.\n- Update triggers:\n  • Upward: Additional NOAA/OAR confirmation specific to Climate.gov; visible preparations for continuity (e.g., explicit redirect plans, renewed SSL certs, DNS stability notices); no further shutdown rumors by mid‑June; continued normal posting on Climate.gov through late June.\n  • Downward: Credible reporting of NOAA web consolidations targeting Climate.gov; internal memos/orders to retire or freeze the domain; noticeable DNS/WHOIS changes (nameserver swaps, expiration warnings); outages or certificate warnings in late June; announcements of cost‑cutting that include web hosting reductions.\nIn sum, inertia plus explicit assurances and current uptime outweigh the risks of a sudden, complete takedown or poorly timed outage. The chance of a transient failure exactly at the Metaculus check is nonzero but small.",

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
