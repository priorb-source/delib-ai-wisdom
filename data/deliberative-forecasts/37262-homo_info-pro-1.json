    "review": "The deliberation provided crucial new information and perspectives that altered my initial assessment. Forecaster 2's analysis was particularly impactful. Their points about the high base rate of large protests in India, the specific intelligence regarding a planned farmers' march of 10,000 people, and—most importantly—the clarification that the resolution depends on the protest's *start date* and not the *date of entry* into the tracker were highly convincing. This last point directly negated a key uncertainty I had about reporting lags. Forecaster 3 provided a valuable counter-perspective, rightly emphasizing the short timeframe and the potential for government suppression to reduce turnout. While I found their arguments for caution valid, they were largely outweighed by the specific, positive evidence for a 'Yes' outcome presented by Forecaster 2.",
    "rationale": "I am increasing my forecast from 70% to 80%. This 10-point increase is primarily driven by the arguments raised by Forecaster 2. My initial forecast was tempered by the short two-month window and the potential for a qualifying protest to occur but not be recorded in the Global Protest Tracker in time. Forecaster 2's clarification that the resolution criterion is the protest's *start date* removes this concern about reporting lag, which was a significant source of my uncertainty. Furthermore, the introduction of a specific, planned farmers' march provides a very concrete, high-probability pathway for this question to resolve as 'Yes', moving beyond the generalized potential for unrest I had initially considered. While I still incorporate the potential for protest cancellations or government suppression, as noted by Forecaster 3, the combination of a high base rate and at least one explicitly planned event makes an 80% probability a more accurate reflection of the situation.",
