    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "57 days until July 1, 2025",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No - legislation is not enacted before the deadline, and real estate transactions remain subject to VAT in Nigeria",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "The Tax Reforms Bill faces procedural delays in the National Assembly, requires extensive committee reviews or amendments, or encounters opposition that slows its progress. Even if passed by both legislative chambers, it may not receive presidential assent and be formally enacted before July 1, 2025. Legislative processes often take longer than anticipated, particularly for significant tax reforms.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "The Tax Reforms Bill moves rapidly through the National Assembly with strong government backing, passes both chambers within the next few weeks, quickly receives presidential assent, and is formally enacted into law by late May or June 2025. The government prioritizes this as part of its housing affordability agenda and fast-tracks the legislative process.",
    "rationale": "This question has a very tight timeline of approximately 57 days. The positive signal is that as of April 25, 2025 (10 days ago), the Tax Reforms Bill was actively being considered by the National Assembly, suggesting current momentum. The government has clearly identified this as a priority for boosting housing affordability. However, several factors weigh against successful enactment in this timeframe: (1) Nigerian legislative processes typically involve multiple stages including committee reviews, debates in both chambers, and presidential assent; (2) tax reforms can be contentious and require careful deliberation; (3) we lack specific information about the bill's current stage or any announced timeline; (4) even with urgency, two months is a compressed timeframe for major legislation. Good forecasting practice suggests weighting the status quo heavily - most things don't change quickly, and legislative delays are common. For my forecast to move higher, I would need evidence that the bill has already passed at least one chamber of the National Assembly or statements from government officials committing to enactment by a specific date. For my forecast to move lower, I would need reports of significant opposition or procedural delays. Balancing the active consideration against the tight timeline and typical legislative pace, I estimate a 40% probability.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill Nigeria enact legislation exempting real estate transactions from VAT before July 1, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\n[FG: Tax reform bill to exempt real estate transactions from VAT, boost housing affordability in Nigeria](https://nairametrics.com/2025/04/25/fg-tax-reform-bill-to-exempt-real-estate-transactions-from-vat-boost-housing-affordability-in-nigeria/)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if, before July 1, 2025, the government of Nigeria enacts legislation exempting real estate transactions from the Value Added Tax (VAT) according to [credible sources](https://www.metaculus.com/help/faq/#definitions).\n\nFor example, the current iteration of the Tax Reforms Bill that is [being considered](https://brtnews.ng/tax-reforms-bill-to-exempt-real-estate-transactions-from-vat/) by the National Assembly, if it should be enacted, would count for purposes of this question.\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nNo additional information available.\n\nToday is 2025-05-05.\n\nBefore answering you think:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n(e) You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
