    "review": "All three forecasters have reached a strong consensus, identifying the same core drivers and risks. We all agree that the June 17-20 UN conference is a powerful \"action-forcing mechanism\" (a term from Forecaster 3 that I found particularly apt). We also all highlight the specific, credible Axios report about Malta's intention to recognize Palestine at the summit as a key piece of evidence. The recent 2024 recognitions by European nations and the Franco-British initiative are seen by all as creating significant momentum. Similarly, we all identify the main countervailing forces as diplomatic pressure from the United States and Israel, and the risk that President Macron's 'conditions' could be used as a reason to delay. Forecaster 2 effectively articulated a plausible failure scenario where the conference results in strong commitments but the formal announcements are pushed to a later date. There was no new factual evidence introduced, but the other analyses reinforced the weight of the key risk factors.",
    "rationale": "My initial forecast was 85%. After reviewing the analyses of the other two forecasters, both of whom arrived at 80%, I am revising my forecast down to 80%. I am not making this change due to any new evidence, but rather due to a re-weighting of the identified risks. Both Forecaster 2 and 3 convincingly argued for the plausibility of a specific 'No' outcome: that the conference succeeds in generating commitments and a joint declaration, but the individual, formal recognitions are deliberately postponed until after June to create a larger, more coordinated bloc. This is a common pattern in multilateral diplomacy. While the evidence for a 'Yes'—especially the Malta report—remains very strong, my initial 85% may have slightly underestimated the possibility of a strategic delay. Aligning with the 80% consensus better reflects this specific uncertainty about the exact timing, even if recognition in the near future seems highly probable. The fundamental case remains robust, so a small adjustment is all that is warranted.",
