  "information": "A proposal was made for direct Russia-Ukraine talks to be held in Istanbul on May 15, 2025. Volodymyr Zelenskyy agreed to attend and invited Donald Trump to be present at the meeting. Trump expressed optimism about the talks and stated he was considering attending, but noted his schedule was busy. His schedule included a trip to Saudi Arabia, Qatar, and the UAE from May 12, concluding on May 15, the same day as the proposed meeting.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "33 days (from May 13, 2025 to June 15, 2025)",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No phone call occurs",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Trump attends the Istanbul meeting on May 15 and only communicates with Zelenskyy in person at that meeting and potentially other in-person meetings, with no phone calls occurring. Alternatively, Trump doesn't attend and all coordination happens through intermediaries and staff rather than direct phone contact between the two leaders.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Trump cannot attend the Istanbul meeting due to his Middle East trip schedule and calls Zelenskyy to discuss the talks either before or after May 15. Alternatively, even if they meet in Istanbul, they have follow-up phone calls during the ongoing peace negotiations over the next month to coordinate next steps or discuss developments.",
    "rationale": "The 33-day window provides a reasonable timeframe for a phone call to occur, especially given active peace negotiations. Trump has expressed optimism about the Istanbul talks and is considering attending, suggesting engagement with the Ukraine situation. However, several factors work against a phone call: (1) Trump's busy Middle East trip schedule may preclude coordination calls, (2) if Trump does attend Istanbul on May 15, they would meet in person rather than by phone, which wouldn't count toward this question, (3) high-level diplomatic coordination often occurs through staff and intermediaries rather than direct leader-to-leader calls, and (4) the very specific requirement that both sides acknowledge the call adds an additional hurdle. The research assistant's information about the Istanbul meeting is crucial - it suggests imminent high-level engagement but potentially through in-person rather than phone communication. World leaders do regularly speak by phone during active negotiations, but the preference for in-person meetings at this critical stage and the potential for staff-level coordination both reduce the likelihood. The forecast would go higher if: Trump confirms he won't attend Istanbul (making a phone call more necessary), if reports emerge of regular Trump-Zelenskyy phone coordination, or if the peace process extends beyond a single meeting. The forecast would go lower if: Trump confirms in-person attendance, if the talks collapse quickly, or if reporting suggests all communication is through intermediaries.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill Donald Trump and Volodymyr Zelenskyy speak on the phone with each other before June 15, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nSky News: [Key moments that have shaped Trump and Zelenskyy's relationship](https://news.sky.com/story/trump-and-zelenskyys-relationship-from-perfect-phone-call-to-oval-office-clash-13331892)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if, after May 12, 2025 and before June 15, 2025, Donald Trump and Volodymyr Zelenskyy speak on the phone with each other, according to [credible sources](https://www.metaculus.com/faq/#definitions).\n\nBoth sides must acknowledge the phone call took place for it to count. \"Speak on the phone with each other\" is defined as both individuals, from different physical spaces, orally uttering words intended for the other individual into a telephone or equivalent device, those words being converted into electrical or digital signals in real time, and then transferred to the other individual via telecommunications links, where they are reconverted into sound waves at the other individual's listening device.\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nA proposal was made for direct Russia-Ukraine talks to be held in Istanbul on May 15, 2025.

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
