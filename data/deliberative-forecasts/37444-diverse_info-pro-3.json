    "review": "The other forecasters provided critical new information and context that I had not fully weighed. Forecaster 2 introduced the most impactful evidence: a public and 'unequivocal' denial from the Secretary of State regarding any plan to lift sanctions, and reports that the President is actively considering a bipartisan bill to *tighten* sanctions on Russian energy. This new information directly refutes the premise of the initial Politico report that was the primary basis for a 'Yes' probability. Forecaster 3 added valuable context regarding the EU's lack of interest in the pipeline and the sanctioned company's bankruptcy status, which persuasively argues that there is little practical incentive for the US to delist the entity, even if it were politically feasible. Both analyses convincingly highlighted that the political momentum and practical realities are overwhelmingly aligned against lifting the sanctions within this short timeframe.",
    "rationale": "My initial forecast of 15% was predicated on the idea that the internal White House debate reported by Politico signaled a non-trivial possibility of a policy shift. However, the deliberation with my peers has introduced decisive new evidence that fundamentally weakens this assumption. The explicit denial from the Secretary of State significantly reduces the credibility or relevance of the earlier report. More importantly, the news that the President is considering legislation to increase pressure on Russian energy indicates the administration's policy vector is pointing in the exact opposite direction of lifting sanctions. Combined with the compelling points about the pipeline's physical and financial non-viability and opposition from European allies, the rationale for a 'Yes' outcome has all but evaporated. The political cost of such a move would be enormous for virtually no strategic or economic gain. Given that all recent, high-level signals point towards maintaining or increasing sanctions, and with less than two months until the resolution date, a policy reversal of this magnitude is extremely unlikely. I am therefore substantially lowering my forecast from 15% to 4%. The small remaining probability accounts for the remote chance of a radical, unexpected diplomatic breakthrough or a highly characteristic, transactional policy decision, but the overwhelming balance of evidence now supports the 'No' outcome.",
