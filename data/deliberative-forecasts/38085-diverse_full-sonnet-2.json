    "review": "All three forecasters agree on the fundamental dynamics: the status quo strongly favors Yes, with 14.5M residents currently in drought providing a 500K buffer. However, we differ on how to weigh the risks.\n\nForecaster 3 provides the most compelling analysis by framing the challenge as requiring a ~12 percentage-point statewide reduction in approximately 4 weeks. Their key insight about early-season (June) tropical cyclone impacts on Florida being 'relatively infrequent' is important historical context I underweighted. The observation that weekly USDM changes 'typically chip away rather than erase drought statewide' is particularly persuasive - gradual improvement is the base case, not rapid reversal.\n\nForecaster 2's 65% seems to overweight the rainy season risk. While the seasonal shift is certain, the question is whether it will be sufficient in magnitude and timing to produce a 12 pp reduction. Normal rainy season onset typically brings gradual improvement, not dramatic reversal, especially given the depth of deficit (6-10 inches in some areas) and NOAA's explicit forecast for persistence through June.\n\nThe evidence supporting higher confidence in Yes includes: (1) the unprecedented drought severity (worst Everglades conditions in 13 years), (2) the large accumulated deficit built since October 2024, (3) NOAA's March forecast specifically calling for persistence through June, (4) the short 30-day window, and (5) the historical rarity of rapid, statewide drought improvements without major tropical events.\n\nThe main downside risk remains an early tropical system, but as Forecaster 3 notes, June impacts are less common than later-season events.",
    "rationale": "After reviewing the other forecasters' analyses, I'm updating my forecast upward. Forecaster 3's framing of the challenge - achieving a 12 percentage-point statewide reduction in about 4 weeks - highlights how demanding the requirements for a No outcome truly are. Combined with their observation about the historical infrequency of early-season tropical impacts on Florida and the typical gradual nature of USDM improvements, the case for persistence is stronger than I initially assessed.\n\nThe 500K buffer (14.5M vs 14.0M threshold) represents a meaningful cushion. Given the depth of the current drought (12th driest April-March period since 1895, 6-10 inch deficits, worst Everglades conditions in 13 years), NOAA's explicit persistence forecast through June, and the short 30-day timeframe, the probability that Florida drops below 14.0M residents in drought areas by June 28 appears lower than my initial 25% (implied by my 75% forecast).\n\nWhile I maintain some weight on the possibility of exceptional rainfall or an early tropical system providing rapid relief, these scenarios are less likely than I initially considered. The rainy season's onset is gradual, and June tropical impacts on Florida are historically uncommon. I'm updating to 77%, slightly below Forecaster 3's 78% to maintain modest weight on precipitation scenarios, but above my initial 75% based on the stronger arguments for drought persistence.",
