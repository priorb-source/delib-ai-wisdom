    "review": "Both forecasters make a crucial methodological point I didn't sufficiently emphasize: this is a conjunction probability requiring P(fight occurs at UFC 316) × P(Merab wins | it occurs). They're right to decompose it this way.\n\nForecaster 2 and 3 both estimate ~75-80% probability the fight happens, citing injury risk and cancellation potential months out. This is a valid concern I understated. However, their uncertainty about the prior fight result is resolved by actual history: Merab defeated O'Malley decisively via unanimous decision (49-46 across all cards) at UFC 306 in September 2024 to become champion. This wasn't close.\n\nOn conditional win probability, they estimate 58-60% for Merab if the fight occurs. Given the decisive first victory and persistent stylistic advantages (Merab's relentless wrestling vs. O'Malley's weak takedown defense), I think this is slightly conservative. First fight winners in decisive fashion typically maintain an edge in immediate rematches, especially when the stylistic mismatch remains.\n\nTheir arguments about O'Malley's KO power are valid but somewhat offset by Merab's proven durability and smothering style that limits striking opportunities. The ESPN listing suggests official booking, which is stronger evidence than they weighted.",
    "rationale": "I'm updating my forecast downward to explicitly account for fight cancellation risk, which I previously understated. Using the conjunction framework:\n\nP(fight occurs at UFC 316 as booked): I estimate 82% - the ESPN listing indicates official booking, but high-profile fights months out face meaningful injury/withdrawal risk.\n\nP(Merab wins | fight occurs): I estimate 62% - slightly higher than the other forecasters because: (1) the first fight was decisively one-sided, not competitive, (2) stylistic advantages persist (wrestling/cardio vs. vulnerable takedown defense), (3) immediate rematches typically favor the dominant winner unless major tactical adjustments occur, and (4) Merab's proven durability limits O'Malley's KO threat.\n\nConjunction: 0.82 × 0.62 = 0.508 ≈ 51%\n\nI'm moving down from 55% to 51% primarily due to better accounting for cancellation risk. I'm not going as low as 45-48% because I believe the first fight's decisiveness and stylistic persistence warrant a slightly higher conditional win probability than the others estimated.",
