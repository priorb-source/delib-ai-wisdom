  "information": "According to news reports from February and March 2025, U.S. Representative Ralph Norman is \"seriously considering\" a run for Governor of South Carolina in 2026, when the incumbent will be term-limited. Several outlets, including The State, Roll Call, and Politico, have noted that Norman's office has denied any plans for a Senate run. Norman has officially filed for his own House re-election.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Approximately one month. The deadline is July 1, 2025.",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No. Ralph Norman is currently a U.S. Representative who has filed for re-election to the House and whose office has denied plans for a Senate run.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Ralph Norman continues to focus on his potential 2026 gubernatorial campaign and his current House duties. The July 1, 2025 deadline passes without any announcement of a Senate candidacy, and the question resolves as 'No'.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "In a significant and unexpected reversal, internal polling or a change in the political landscape convinces Norman that the Senate is a more viable path. He makes a surprise announcement in June 2025 declaring his candidacy for the U.S. Senate.",
    "rationale": "My forecast is heavily influenced by the most recent reporting from early 2025, which indicates a clear focus on a different political ambition. The research shows that Norman is 'seriously considering' a run for Governor of South Carolina, a demanding statewide race that would conflict with a Senate campaign. Furthermore, his office has explicitly denied any plans for a Senate run, directly refuting the older speculation from 2023. His filing for re-election to his House seat is another concrete action that reinforces the status quo. The deadline is only a month away, which is an extremely short timeframe to pivot strategy and launch a major Senate campaign. The status quo, in which he is not a Senate candidate, is well-established by his actions and a a a his team's statements. \n\nMy probability is not lower than 5% because political calculations can change unexpectedly. A sudden scandal involving the incumbent, or immense pressure from key donors and activists, could theoretically prompt a last-minute change of heart. \n\nMy probability is not higher than 5% because all available evidence points away from a Senate run. To launch a campaign now would require a complete reversal of his team's public statements and reported exploratory efforts for the governorship. I would need to see credible reports of him forming a Senate exploratory committee or a public statement walking back his gubernatorial interest to increase my forecast.",
