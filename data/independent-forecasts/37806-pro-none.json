    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "42 days (resolves July 1, 2025)",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No. The Diversity Visa lottery program continues to operate under existing regulations, and no new presidential action mentioning it is issued by the deadline.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "President Trump's administration prioritizes other pressing domestic or foreign policy issues in its first six months. While the administration may intend to end or reform the Diversity Visa program, the process of drafting, vetting, and issuing a specific presidential action is not completed and published by the July 1, 2025 deadline.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "As part of a focused 'Day One' or 'first 100 days' immigration agenda, the Trump administration uses a pre-drafted plan to quickly issue a series of executive actions. One of these actions, a proclamation or executive order, explicitly targets the Diversity Visa program and is published on the White House website in June 2025.",
    "rationale": "My forecast is based on the significant tension between President Trump's clear, long-standing opposition to the Diversity Visa program and the practical constraints of a very short timeline. The primary factor supporting a 'Yes' outcome is that restricting this program is a known policy goal for Trump, and immigration is a cornerstone of his political platform. A new administration is often most active in its first few months, and by June 2025, it would be in a prime window to enact its agenda, likely using pre-vetted plans from transition teams or allied think tanks. However, the most significant factor supporting a 'No' outcome, and the reason for my relatively low probability, is the extremely short timeframe of just 42 days. A new administration faces a multitude of competing priorities, and even within the immigration portfolio, issues like border security or asylum reform might consume more immediate bandwidth. The bureaucratic process for issuing a formal presidential action, which requires legal and departmental review, takes time. The status quo, in which no such action is taken, is the default outcome. My forecast of 30% reflects that while the intent is strong, the probability of this specific action being completed and published within this narrow six-week window is less than likely. My forecast is not higher because the 42-day deadline is a severe constraint, and it is very plausible this action could be delayed until July or later. It is not lower because Trump's history of using executive orders for immigration policy and his specific animus towards this program make it a very credible target for early action. I would raise my forecast upon news of a draft order circulating within the administration, and lower it if a major crisis emerged that would predictably divert all of the White House's attention.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill President Trump issue a new presidential action mentioning the Diversity Visa before July 1, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\n[Federal judge’s order leaves many visa lottery winners out of luck](https://www.siliconvalley.com/2020/10/01/judges-order-leaves-many-visa-lottery-winners-out-of-luck/) | The American Conservative: [Trump Should Cancel the Diversity Visa Program](https://www.theamericanconservative.com/trump-should-cancel-the-diversity-visa-program/) | Mint: [US Green Card Diversity Visa 2026 Lottery results released: What you need to know](https://www.livemint.com/news/us-news/us-green-card-diversity-visa-2026-lottery-results-released-what-you-need-to-know-11746381683106.html)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if, before July 1, 2025, President Donald J. Trump issues a [presidential action](https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/) mentioning the \"Diversity Visa\" (using exactly those words). If this does not occur before that date, this resolves as **No**.\n\nTo count, the presidential action must be published and publicly accessible (appearing on the presidential actions section of the White House website) before the specified time. A verbal statement or other written announcement besides a presidential action (for example a post on social media), is not sufficient.\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nNo additional information available.\n\nToday is 2025-05-20.\n\nBefore answering you think:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n(e) You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
