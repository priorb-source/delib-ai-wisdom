  "information": "Domestically, U.S. tariff policy has drawn media commentary. The New York Post's editorial board warned of 'tariff burnout' among President Trump's supporters due to inconsistent implementation. The Wall Street Journal's editorial board has also criticized the tariffs, suggesting they would primarily benefit lobbyists and could be used by politicians to leverage campaign contributions. Internationally, Vietnam is reportedly fast-tracking a $1.5 billion Trump golf resort, a move linked to efforts to secure a new trade agreement with the U.S. and avoid potential tariffs as a 90-day pause on trade levies approaches its end.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Approximately 35 days. The resolution window runs from May 20, 2025 through June 30, 2025, and today is May 26, 2025, placing us currently within the evaluation period.",
    "status_quo_outcome": "NO - The word 'tariff' or 'tariffs' continues to appear on at least one of the two newspapers' front pages every single day through June 30, 2025.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Tariffs remain a dominant economic and political story through June. Trump administration continues active tariff policy implementation, trade negotiations with various countries generate daily coverage, and the ending of the 90-day pause creates ongoing news. On every day in the window, at least one of the two papers features tariff-related content on its front page.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "A major breaking news event (geopolitical crisis, natural disaster, significant domestic political development) dominates coverage for a day, or there's a temporary lull in tariff-related developments. On at least one day, both papers simultaneously choose to prioritize other stories, and 'tariff' or 'tariffs' appears on neither front page.",
    "rationale": "The status quo strongly favors NO. My research indicates tariffs are currently a dominant story - Trump has 'renewed love' for tariffs, there's active policy debate (Wall Street Journal editorial criticism, discussion of 'tariff burnout'), and a 90-day trade levy pause is approaching its end. This suggests sustained newsworthiness. However, the question only requires ONE day where BOTH papers simultaneously omit the word, and the resolution window contains approximately 36+ remaining days. The broad definition (word can appear anywhere on front page, not just headlines) makes daily appearance more likely. Two factors create some probability for YES: (1) the relatively long time window increases chances of at least one day with different editorial priorities, and (2) weekend editions or major breaking news could temporarily displace tariff coverage. The requirement for simultaneous omission across both papers is demanding - if one paper covers tariffs even briefly, the question resolves NO for that day. Given the sustained importance of tariffs in current policy debates and the approaching end of the trade pause (which should generate more coverage, not less), I expect tariffs to maintain front-page presence. My forecast is not higher because the long time window and requirement for just a single day creates meaningful possibility for YES. It's not lower because tariff policy appears to be in an active phase with upcoming developments likely to sustain media attention.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill the word \"tariff\" disappear from the front pages of The New York Times and Wall Street Journal before July 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nWhether reading the newspaper or social media or watching the news, it is highly likely you are going to see something about tariffs - mainly due to US President Donald Trump's [renewed love](https://www.france24.com/en/live-news/20250401-tariff-man-trump-s-long-history-with-trade-wars) for this somewhat antiquated form of taxation.\r\n\r\nThe New York Times and the Wall Street Journal are two of the largest print newspapers in the US. Before July, will we see tariffs wiped from the front pages of both papers?\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question will resolve as **Yes** if, on any single day after May 19, 2025 and before July 1, 2025, the words \"tariff\" or \"tariffs\" appear on neither the digital version of the front page of The New York Times nor the Wall Street Journal. The following URLs will be used to resolve the question:\r\n\r\n* The New York Times: [https://www.nytimes.com/section/todayspaper](https://www.nytimes.com/section/todayspaper)\r\n* Wall Street Journal: [https://www.wsj.com/print-edition/20250515/frontpage](https://www.wsj.com/print-edition/20250515/frontpage)\r\n\r\n***\r\n\r\n<sup>Note: WSJ front page URL for May 15, 2025. Format is: yyyy-mm-dd.</sup>\n\n* Grammar or spelling will not prevent a **No** resolution.\r\n* \"Tariff(s)\" must be omitted from both papers' front pages on the same day.\r\n* \"Tariff(s)\" can appear anywhere on the page, including \"Pages A2-A3 and Corrections\", \"What's News: Business & Finance\" not just the initial section at the top. The only sections that do not qualify are those that do not change between different front pages such as the \"Most Popular News\" or \"Recommended Videos\" sections on WSJ.\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nDomestically, U.S. tariff policy has drawn media commentary.

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
