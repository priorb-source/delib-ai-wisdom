    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "32 days (until July 1, 2025)",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No - Ralph Norman has not declared his candidacy for the US Senate race in South Carolina as of May 30, 2025",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Ralph Norman either decides not to challenge Lindsey Graham for the Senate seat, or he delays any announcement until after July 1, 2025. This could be due to insufficient fundraising commitments, personal reasons, political calculations about his chances, or simply a strategic decision to announce later in the election cycle.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Ralph Norman announces his candidacy for the 2026 US Senate race in South Carolina within the next 32 days. This could be triggered by mounting pressure from conservative activists, securing key endorsements or financial commitments, or a perceived vulnerability in Senator Graham's position that makes Norman believe this is an opportune moment to launch a challenge.",
    "rationale": "This forecast strongly weights the status quo outcome given the very short timeframe remaining. As of May 30, 2025, there are only 32 days until the July 1 deadline. The research assistant provided no additional information suggesting Norman is preparing to announce, has formed an exploratory committee, or has taken other preliminary steps toward a Senate campaign. While the September 2023 Axios article mentioned him as a potential challenger, that was speculative reporting nearly two years ago. If Norman were seriously planning to run and announce before July 1, we would expect to see signal indicators: staff hiring, donor meetings, increased media presence, or leaked reports of his intentions. The absence of such information strongly suggests either he is not running, or if he is planning to run, he intends to announce after July 1. Senate primary campaigns typically require extensive preparation, and candidates usually announce 12-18 months before the primary. We're now in that window for 2026, but the specific July 1, 2025 cutoff is arbitrary and creates a narrow timeframe. The probability is not lower (e.g., 2-5%) because 32 days is still enough time for a surprise announcement, and political decisions can happen quickly. It's not higher (e.g., 25-30%) because there are no concrete indicators of an imminent announcement, and the status quo strongly suggests no declaration will occur in this specific timeframe.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill Ralph Norman declare his candidacy for the US Senate race in South Carolina before July 1, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nAxios: [Sen. Lindsey Graham may face right-wing primary challenge in 2026](https://www.axios.com/2023/09/13/lindsey-graham-primary-challenge-ralph-norman)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if Will Ralph Norman declares his candidacy for the US Senate race in South Carolina before July 1, 2025. If no such announcement has been made before that date, the question resolves as **No**.\n\n\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nNo additional information available.\n\nToday is 2025-05-30.\n\nBefore answering you think:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n(e) You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
