  "information": "Data from the shipping and logistics sector in April 2025 reflected the impact of new tariffs. Freightos and Hillebrand data showed that Asia-U.S. container rates had fallen by 5%. Shipping lines reported an increase in 'blank sailings' (cancelled voyages) and vessels from China that were only half-full. In 2024, China accounted for approximately 36% of U.S. imports, with its share being higher at key ports like Los Angeles (51%) and Long Beach (61%). Port data indicated that the number of ships scheduled to arrive in May 2025 had decreased significantly. Separately, Mexico had become the U.S.'s top trading partner in early 2025, with its exports to the U.S. growing 9.6% in January to a record $41.68 billion.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Approximately 1 month. The U.S. Census Bureau typically releases the international trade data for a given month in the first week of the second subsequent month (e.g., April data is released in early June).",
    "status_quo_outcome": "Yes. In the absence of major economic shocks or policy changes, US imports would typically be expected to grow year-over-year due to baseline economic growth and inflation.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "The new tariffs targeting China, a major source of US imports, cause a sharp contraction in trade volume. Increased imports from other partners, like Mexico, are insufficient to offset this decline, and the total value of imports for April 2025 falls below the April 2024 level of $338,483 million.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Trade diversion is more rapid and widespread than anticipated. A surge of imports from Mexico, Canada, and Southeast Asian nations more than compensates for the tariff-induced decline from China. Alternatively, high inflation in the price of imported goods could push the total nominal value above the threshold, even with flat or slightly lower import volumes.",
    "rationale": "My forecast is heavily influenced by the recent imposition of tariffs and the near-real-time data reflecting their impact. While the status quo expectation would be for year-over-year import growth, the new tariffs represent a significant disruption. The research assistant's report provides compelling evidence for a 'No' outcome. The data from the shipping sector for April 2025—including a 5% drop in Asia-U.S. container rates, increased 'blank sailings,' and half-full vessels from China—is a strong leading indicator of reduced import volumes. Given China accounted for 36% of US imports in 2024, a significant downturn in this trade relationship has an outsized negative effect on the total import figure. While the reported 9.6% growth in imports from Mexico is a notable countervailing factor, it is unlikely to be sufficient in scale to fully offset the large deficit from China. The forecast is not lower than 20% because the US economy may still exhibit strong consumer demand, pulling in goods from non-tariffed countries, and nominal values could be buoyed by inflation. The probability is not higher because the shipping data provides direct, timely, and powerful evidence of a slowdown in the most significant import corridor. For me to raise my forecast, I would need to see evidence that trade diversion to Mexico and other nations is happening at a much faster rate than is currently apparent. To lower my forecast, I would look for signs of weakening US domestic demand, which would compound the effect of the tariffs.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill the US Census Bureau report an increase in US imports in April 2025 compared with April 2024?\n\nQuestion background:\n[Experts React: How the world is responding to Trump’s ‘liberation day’ tariffs](https://www.atlanticcouncil.org/blogs/new-atlanticist/experts-react/experts-react-how-the-world-is-responding-to-trumps-liberation-day-tariffs/)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if the total amount of imports by the United States for April 2025 reported by the US Census Bureau in its [U.S. International Trade in Goods and Services release](https://www.census.gov/foreign-trade/Press-Release/current_press_release/index.html) encompassing that month, exceeds 338,483 million USD.\n\n\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nData from the shipping and logistics sector in April 2025 reflected the impact of new tariffs.

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower.
