    "review": "The other forecasters and I agree on the core tension: Muqtada al-Sadr's current, firm boycott versus his history of unpredictable reversals. Forecaster 3's analysis is almost perfectly aligned with my own, emphasizing the structural barrier of the May 4 alliance registration deadline and Sadr's history of making such reversals much closer to an election date to maximize leverage. This reinforces my confidence in my initial reasoning. Forecaster 2 arrives at a higher probability (25%) by placing more weight on Sadr's general history of U-turns, arguing this pattern is significant enough to warrant a higher chance of reversal even within this specific, early timeframe. While I find their argument for Sadr's unpredictability convincing in principle, I believe their analysis underweights the specific temporal constraints of this question. They do not offer a compelling reason why Sadr would break his established pattern of late-stage brinkmanship and announce his participation more than four months before the election, which is long before the July 1 deadline. My initial analysis already accounted for his unpredictability and the possibility of procedural workarounds; the other forecasts have not introduced new evidence to persuade me that the probability of such an early announcement is higher than I first estimated.",
    "rationale": "After reviewing the other forecasts, I will not change my initial probability of 15%. My reasoning remains centered on the specific deadline of July 1, 2025. The primary factors supporting a 'No' outcome are compelling. First, the political alliance registration deadline is May 4, 2025. If this deadline passes without Sadr's alliance registering, it creates a significant procedural hurdle that makes an official announcement of participation before July 1 much less likely. While workarounds, such as fielding 'independent' candidates, are possible, this leads to the second and more critical point: political strategy. Sadr's past reversals, such as in 2021, occurred much closer to the election (mid-August for an October election). This brinkmanship maximizes his political leverage. Announcing participation before July 1—over four months before the November election—would be strategically premature, sacrificing the element of surprise and giving his rivals ample time to adjust their own strategies. His current, vociferous reaffirmation of the boycott further raises the political cost of a reversal, making a sudden, early change of heart less probable. My 15% forecast accounts for Sadr's notorious unpredictability and the non-zero chance that a major political crisis or a uniquely favorable backroom deal could compel him to act early. However, the strategic logic of his past behavior and the imminent registration deadline strongly suggest that if a reversal is to happen, it is far more likely to occur after July 1.",
