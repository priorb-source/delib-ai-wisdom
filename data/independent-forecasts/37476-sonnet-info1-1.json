  "information": "GoPro's financial results for 2024 showed a full-year revenue of $801 million, a 20% decline year-over-year, with a net loss of $432 million, or $2.82 per share. As of December 31, 2024, the company held $283 million in cash reserves against $131 million in debt. The company's current ratio was reported at 0.5, and its market capitalization was approximately $90.68 million as of May 1, 2025, with a stock price of $0.58.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Approximately 53 days (from May 9, 2025 to July 1, 2025)",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No - GoPro has not filed for bankruptcy and continues operating",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "GoPro continues operations through July 1, 2025 without filing for bankruptcy. The company manages its remaining cash reserves, potentially secures bridge financing, negotiates with creditors for extended payment terms, implements further cost reductions, or identifies a strategic buyer or partner. Despite severe financial distress, management delays or avoids bankruptcy filing.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "GoPro's liquidity crisis accelerates rapidly. The company exhausts its remaining cash reserves, creditors refuse to extend further credit or demand immediate payment, debt covenants are violated, suppliers require cash-on-delivery terms, and management determines bankruptcy protection is necessary to continue operations or restructure obligations.",
    "rationale": "GoPro's financial position is severely distressed. Key indicators include: a catastrophic net loss of $432M on $801M revenue (54% loss margin), a current ratio of 0.5 indicating current liabilities are double current assets, a collapsed market capitalization of only $91M, and a penny stock price of $0.58. As of December 31, 2024, they held $283M in cash against $131M in debt. At a monthly burn rate extrapolated from the annual loss (~$36M/month), approximately five months have elapsed, potentially leaving around $100M in remaining cash, though Q1 2025 results could differ. However, several factors favor the status quo 'No' outcome over the short 53-day window: (1) Bankruptcy is a dramatic corporate action typically preceded by extensive negotiations and warning signs; (2) Companies generally exhaust alternatives before filing; (3) No immediate news suggests an imminent filing; (4) Even with severe distress, 53 days is a short timeframe for such a major decision. The forecast isn't higher because of this short time horizon and the typical lag between distress and bankruptcy filing. It isn't lower because the financial metrics indicate genuine insolvency risk - the current ratio and burn rate are critical red flags that could force action. I would revise upward with news of: creditor demands, failed financing attempts, or covenant violations. I would revise downward with: successful financing announcements, strategic transaction news, or evidence of stabilized cash position.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill GoPro file for bankruptcy before July 1, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\n[GoPro Announces Fourth Quarter and 2024 Results](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1500435/000150043525000003/gpro2024-12x31exh991xer.htm)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question will resolve as **Yes** if GoPro, Inc., files any petition for bankruptcy protection in the United States, under any chapter of the United States Bankruptcy Code, before July 1, 2025. The question will resolves on the filing of such a petition, not on whether any bankruptcy protection is granted by a court. If no such petition is filed by that date, this question will resolve as **No**.\n\n\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nGoPro's financial results for 2024 showed a full-year revenue of $801 million, a 20% decline year-over-year, with a net loss of $432 million, or $2.82 per share.

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
