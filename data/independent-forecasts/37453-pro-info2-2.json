  "information": "The process for triggering a referendum requires a successful citizen petition. The petition must gather at least 177,000 signatures, which then must be officially verified by Elections Alberta before the government can formally schedule a vote. As of early May 2025, a group named 'Project for Alberta Prosperity' announced its intention to organize a signature collection campaign. Its president claimed they had already exceeded the required signature threshold, while other unverified reports mentioned 80,000 signatures being collected in 36 hours. However, no petition had been formally submitted or certified by Elections Alberta.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Less than two months, as the final outcome will be determined by the July 1, 2025 deadline.",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No. The status quo is that Alberta remains a province of Canada and no independence referendum is officially scheduled. The required procedural steps have not been completed.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "The citizens' petition is submitted to Elections Alberta, but the official verification process for the 177,000+ signatures takes longer than the time remaining before the July 1, 2025 deadline. As a result, the government has no verified petition upon which to act and thus does not announce a referendum date.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "The petition is formally submitted within days with a number of signatures far exceeding the requirement. Citing immense public will, the Premier's office pressures Elections Alberta to expedite verification, which they complete in record time. The government then immediately announces a referendum date before the July 1, 2025 deadline.",
    "rationale": "My forecast is based primarily on the significant procedural hurdles that must be cleared within a very short timeframe. The deadline is less than two months away. The process requires a petition to be formally submitted, have at least 177,000 signatures officially verified by Elections Alberta, and then for the government to officially schedule the vote. As of early May 2025, the petition has not even been submitted. The verification of such a large number of signatures is a meticulous and time-consuming bureaucratic process that is highly unlikely to be completed before July 1. While there is political momentum behind the movement, it is unlikely to be sufficient to overcome this procedural inertia. The probability is not lower because the political situation is volatile, and an extraordinary effort by the provincial government could theoretically expedite the process, however improbable. I would raise my probability if the petition were submitted with a vast number of signatures within the next week and Elections Alberta simultaneously announced a specific, expedited timeline for verification. The probability will decay rapidly as we approach the deadline without these steps being met.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nBefore July 1, 2025, will the government of Alberta officially announce a date for an independence referendum?\n\nQuestion background:\nPolitico: [The quiet threat to Canadian unity isn’t Quebec — it’s Alberta](https://www.politico.com/news/2025/04/27/the-quiet-threat-to-canadian-unity-isnt-quebec-its-alberta-00311719)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if, before July 1, 2025, a referendum on the independence of Alberta from Canada is officially scheduled. If this does not occur before that date, this question resolves as **No**.\n\nFor purposes of this question, the referendum will be considered \"officially scheduled\" when it is announced by a person or entity with the authority to do so within Alberta. Please note that broader legality, such as within Canada, will be considered irrelevant for this question, so if the federal government declared the referendum illegal, the question would still resolve as Yes.\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nThe process for triggering a referendum requires a successful citizen petition.

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
