  "information": "Several airlines announced the resumption or launch of new flights to Beirut for the summer 2025 season. Scandinavian Airlines (SAS) is resuming service from Copenhagen and Stockholm in June. Emirates resumed its daily service from Dubai in February 2025 and added a second daily flight in April. Air France and its subsidiary Transavia also resumed flights from Paris in February. Other confirmed additions include a Wizz Air flight from Abu Dhabi starting June 4, a seasonal Middle East Airlines (MEA) route to Barcelona from June 26, and a LOT Polish Airlines flight from Warsaw beginning July 1, 2025.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "41 days until July 1, 2025",
    "status_quo_outcome": "If current trends continue with the announced airline additions through June 2025, the number of direct destinations from Beirut will likely be close to the 51 threshold, creating genuine uncertainty about whether it will exceed this number.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Despite several airlines resuming service, the cumulative number of direct destinations from Beirut remains at or below 51 on July 1. This could occur if: (1) the baseline number of destinations is currently in the low-to-mid 40s and the announced additions don't fully compensate, (2) some airlines cancel planned routes due to security concerns related to ongoing regional tensions with Israel, or (3) other airlines suspend routes offsetting new additions.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "The combination of summer season peak travel and the multiple announced airline additions (SAS from Copenhagen/Stockholm, Wizz Air from Abu Dhabi, MEA to Barcelona, LOT Polish from Warsaw, plus the extra Emirates flight) push the total beyond 51 destinations. This assumes the current baseline is already in the high 40s and these additions, combined with other typical summer seasonal routes, exceed the threshold.",
    "rationale": "The threshold of 51 direct destinations suggests a moderate level of connectivity that could realistically go either way. The research assistant's report provides concrete evidence of airline expansion: at least 6-7 new routes or service resumptions are confirmed for May-July 2025. This indicates recovery momentum in Beirut's aviation sector despite the challenging context described in the background articles (Israeli attacks, economic struggles, low tourism). The timing is crucial - July 1 marks the beginning of peak summer travel season when airlines typically maximize route offerings. However, several factors create uncertainty: (1) I lack baseline data on current destination count, (2) Lebanon's security situation remains volatile and could cause cancellations, (3) the threshold is specific enough to suggest the outcome could go either way, and (4) economic challenges may limit overall connectivity despite individual airline optimism. The status quo principle suggests modest change from current levels, and with multiple confirmed additions 1-2 months out, most summer schedules are already set. The fact that established carriers like Emirates, Air France, and SAS are expanding service suggests confidence in demand, but regional instability remains a significant risk. For me to update higher (70%+), I would need: confirmation of a current baseline above 47-48 destinations, or additional major airline announcements. For me to update lower (40% or below), I would need: news of major airline suspensions/cancellations, or data showing current connectivity is in the low 40s. Given the evidence of recovery but significant remaining uncertainty, I assess this at moderately favorable odds for exceeding 51 destinations.",
