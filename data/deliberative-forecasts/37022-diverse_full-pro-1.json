    "review": "The other forecasters provided valuable perspectives that tempered my initial optimism. Forecaster 2's analysis mirrored my own component-based approach but assigned a more conservative probability, correctly highlighting the uncertainty inherent in forecasting without final published data. Forecaster 3 introduced a crucial point I had undervalued: the distinction between gross domestic bond issuance (~26B UAH) and the *net* change after accounting for redemptions. This is a significant source of uncertainty. Forecaster 3 also grounded their analysis in the historical base rate (7 of 12 prior months exceeded the threshold), which is a sound starting point. Both forecasters correctly identified the same key drivers (IMF loan, FX effect, domestic borrowing), but their more cautious assessment of the net impact of these drivers, particularly the uncertainty around debt redemptions, was convincing.",
    "rationale": "I am revising my forecast downwards from 90% to 80%. My initial analysis was too confident and did not sufficiently account for the uncertainty surrounding the *net* change from domestic borrowing. While domestic bond auctions raised approximately 26B UAH, significant redemptions during the month could have reduced the net contribution substantially, a point Forecaster 3 rightly emphasized.\n\nMy revised calculation is more conservative. The starting point is the 1.869T UAH debt in February, requiring a 31B UAH increase. The positive drivers remain strong: a confirmed +16B UAH from the IMF and an estimated +10B UAH from currency devaluation. These two factors alone contribute +26B UAH. The question then hinges on whether the net effect of domestic borrowing and other debt servicing was at least +5B UAH.\n\nGiven the historical median monthly increase was +25B UAH and seven of the last twelve months saw increases over 30B UAH, a positive net contribution from domestic activities is highly probable. However, acknowledging the uncertainty raised by my peers, a 'Yes' outcome is no longer a near-certainty in my view. An 80% probability reflects the strong tailwinds from the IMF and FX effects, making the threshold likely to be passed, but incorporates the valid uncertainty about domestic redemptions preventing me from holding my previous conviction.",
