    "review": "Forecaster 3 provides critical new information that I lacked: **current data showing 22.7 million Californians are already in drought as of May 27**. This fundamentally changes my analysis from uncertainty about the baseline to assessing whether a 2.7 million person reduction is likely in 30 days. Forecaster 2 adds valuable context about NOAA Climate Prediction Center forecasts for heat and drought persistence. Both forecasters correctly emphasize the seasonal timing - late June is California's dry season when improvements are historically rare. The key insight is that dropping below 20M would require removing drought classifications from major metropolitan areas within a single month, which contradicts both climatology and the time lag inherent in USDM classifications that reflect longer-term conditions. My original 68% forecast underweighted the informational value of having a current 2.7M buffer above the threshold during the transition into summer.",
    "rationale": "I am significantly updating upward based on Forecaster 3's data point. With 22.7M currently in drought and only 30 days until resolution during California's dry season, the probability of dropping below 20M is quite low. To lose 2.7M people from drought status would require reclassifying significant urban areas - this typically doesn't happen quickly even with rainfall, as USDM integrates longer-term indicators. The USDM updates weekly, so the June 26 release will likely be accessed on June 28. While there's mention of potential tropical storm activity, such systems rarely deliver sufficient widespread, sustained rainfall to reverse drought classifications across major population centers within a month. I'm not going as high as Forecaster 2's 90% because a 12% buffer (2.7M/22.7M) leaves some room for reclassification uncertainty, and weather modeling for tropical systems carries inherent unpredictability. However, the combination of current baseline data, seasonal patterns, and the mechanics of drought classification strongly favor the 'Yes' outcome.",
