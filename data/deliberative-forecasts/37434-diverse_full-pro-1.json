    "review": "The other forecasters presented two compelling arguments that I had previously underweighting. Both Forecaster 2 and Forecaster 3 correctly emphasized that AquaBounty's extremely low debt-to-equity ratio of 0.05 is a critical factor. This means there is minimal pressure from creditors to force an involuntary bankruptcy, giving management significant flexibility and control over the timing of any filing. Secondly, they both noted that the company has already survived for over four months since its year-end report showed near-zero cash. This demonstrated resilience, combined with the short two-month window until the resolution date, suggests they may be able to delay a filing longer than I initially anticipated. While I find Forecaster 3's reasoning sound, their 45% forecast seems too low for a company that has ceased all revenue-generating operations and admitted it lacks liquidity. Forecaster 2's conclusion that bankruptcy remains the most likely path, but with more uncertainty than I first assessed, is highly convincing.",
    "rationale": "I am revising my forecast down from 85% to 70%. My initial assessment was driven primarily by the company's catastrophic cash position, cessation of all operations, and management's own going-concern warning. These factors still make a bankruptcy filing the most probable outcome. However, the deliberation has highlighted two crucial tempering factors. \n\nFirst, the company's low debt burden is the most significant reason for my revision. Without aggressive creditors forcing their hand, the board has the discretion to pursue an out-of-court asset sale or other alternatives, which could extend past the July 1 deadline. \n\nSecond, the company has already proven it can survive for months on financial fumes, lasting from January to May 2025. This, combined with the short remaining timeframe of less than two months, makes a delay past the deadline more plausible.\n\nDespite this revision, the probability remains high at 70%. The company is not a going concern. It has no operating income and a history of failed capital raises. A Chapter 11 filing is often the most orderly and legally sound method to conduct a sale of remaining assets (like the Ohio facility) while protecting the directors. Therefore, a voluntary filing remains a very likely strategic choice for the board within the resolution window, even in the absence of creditor pressure.",
