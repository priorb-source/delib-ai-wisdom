    "review": "Both forecasters sensibly anchor on the scheduled Apr 29 expiry as the status quo and articulate the main pathways to extension. New/useful elements they add: (1) explicit status quo framing with a hard end date, (2) Samoa’s precedent of extending SOEs (e.g., during COVID), and (3) the NEOC Apr 15 note that current orders run only to Apr 29. I find their reasoning broadly convincing. The precedent point increases my weight on a short rollover even if temporary generation is close but not fully stabilized. I agree that the absence of extension signals by Apr 21 nudges toward No, but last‑minute extensions are common in similar contexts.",
    "rationale": "I initially put more weight on the scheduled end and the expectation that temporary generators would be operational by end‑April. The deliberation added two considerations: (a) Samoa’s demonstrated willingness to extend SOEs when underlying conditions persist, and (b) practical risks of slippage/commissioning and the desire to retain emergency powers briefly while testing new capacity and managing fuel/logistics. These increase the chance of a short extension that covers Apr 30. Countervailing factors remain: political incentives to end extraordinary measures and no extension hints yet. On balance, I modestly raise my probability. I would move up further on credible reports of continued widespread outages or official indications that Cabinet intends to extend; I would move down on confirmation that temporary units are online and stable before Apr 29 or explicit statements that the SOE will lapse.",
