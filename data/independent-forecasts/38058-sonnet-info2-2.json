  "information": "Domestically, U.S. tariff policy has drawn media commentary. The New York Post's editorial board warned of 'tariff burnout' among President Trump's supporters due to inconsistent implementation. The Wall Street Journal's editorial board has also criticized the tariffs, suggesting they would primarily benefit lobbyists and could be used by politicians to leverage campaign contributions. Internationally, Vietnam is reportedly fast-tracking a $1.5 billion Trump golf resort, a move linked to efforts to secure a new trade agreement with the U.S. and avoid potential tariffs as a 90-day pause on trade levies approaches its end.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Approximately 36 days remain until July 1, 2025, when the resolution window closes",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No - tariffs continue to appear on at least one of the two papers' front pages every single day",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Tariffs remain continuously newsworthy throughout the period as Trump pursues active tariff policy, the 90-day trade pause expires leading to renewed implementation, international negotiations continue making headlines, and economic impacts generate ongoing coverage. The Wall Street Journal, as a business-focused publication, maintains consistent front-page coverage of this economically significant story, ensuring tariffs appear on at least one paper's front page every day through July 1.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "A major breaking news event (international crisis, natural disaster, significant domestic incident, or major Supreme Court ruling) dominates both papers' front pages on the same day, pushing tariff coverage to interior pages. Alternatively, during a weekend edition or slower news cycle, both papers simultaneously prioritize other stories while tariff policy temporarily stabilizes without major new developments, creating a single day where neither front page mentions tariffs.",
    "rationale": "This question requires only ONE day out of 36 remaining days where BOTH papers omit tariff coverage from their front pages. While this might seem achievable, several factors strongly favor continued prominent coverage. The research assistant notes that tariffs remain highly salient with Trump's active implementation, Vietnam's trade negotiations linked to avoiding tariffs, and critically, that a 90-day pause on trade levies is approaching its end - likely triggering renewed intensive coverage. The Wall Street Journal, as a business-focused publication, has particularly strong incentives to consistently cover trade policy on its front page given its readership's economic interests. The requirement for BOTH papers to simultaneously not feature tariffs on the same day significantly increases the difficulty, as the papers have different editorial priorities and audiences. While 'tariff burnout' among supporters is mentioned, this reflects public fatigue rather than diminished newsworthiness. The status quo of major, evolving policy stories is continuous coverage, especially when active implementation is ongoing. However, 36 days provides multiple opportunities for competing major news events to temporarily dominate both front pages simultaneously, particularly during weekend editions or extraordinary breaking news. Major international incidents, Supreme Court decisions, or natural disasters could create such days. The probability would be higher if we needed only one paper to drop coverage, or if the time window were longer. It would be lower if tariffs were in a stable policy phase rather than approaching the end of a significant pause period. I would update higher if evidence emerged of tariff policy stabilizing or other major ongoing stories developing. I would update lower if the 90-day pause ending generates the expected spike in coverage intensity.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill the word \"tariff\" disappear from the front pages of The New York Times and Wall Street Journal before July 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nWhether reading the newspaper or social media or watching the news, it is highly likely you are going to see something about tariffs - mainly due to US President Donald Trump's [renewed love](https://www.france24.com/en/live-news/20250401-tariff-man-trump-s-long-history-with-trade-wars) for this somewhat antiquated form of taxation.\r\n\r\nThe New York Times and the Wall Street Journal are two of the largest print newspapers in the US. Before July, will we see tariffs wiped from the front pages of both papers?\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question will resolve as **Yes** if, on any single day after May 19, 2025 and before July 1, 2025, the words \"tariff\" or \"tariffs\" appear on neither the digital version of the front page of The New York Times nor the Wall Street Journal.

Format is: yyyy-mm-dd.</sup>\n\n* Grammar or spelling will not prevent a **No** resolution.\r\n* \"Tariff(s)\" must be omitted from both papers' front pages on the same day.\r\n* \"Tariff(s)\" can appear anywhere on the page, including \"Pages A2-A3 and Corrections\", \"What's News: Business & Finance\" not just the initial section at the top. The only sections that do not qualify are those that do not change between different front pages such as the \"Most Popular News\" or \"Recommended Videos\" sections on WSJ.\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nDomestically, U.S. tariff policy has drawn media commentary.

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
