    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "The Q1 2025 13F filing for Berkshire Hathaway is due by May 15, 2025. As today is May 7, 2025, the outcome will be known within 8 days.",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Berkshire Hathaway's investment managers adhered to their established value-investing principles during the first quarter of 2025. Finding the valuations of the specified technology companies unattractive or the businesses outside their circle of competence, they refrained from initiating any new positions. The Q1 2025 13F filing is subsequently released and confirms no holdings in Microsoft, Nvidia, Alphabet, Meta, or Tesla.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "One of Berkshire's portfolio managers, most likely Todd Combs or Ted Weschler, identified a compelling long-term opportunity in one of the specified stocks, such as Microsoft or Alphabet, perhaps during a moment of market volatility. A starter position was acquired during Q1 2025, and this new holding is disclosed in the company's 13F filing.",
    "rationale": "My forecast is anchored to the high probability of the status quo persisting. As of the last filing, Berkshire Hathaway holds none of the five specified stocks (Microsoft, Nvidia, Alphabet, Meta, Tesla). Warren Buffett's long-standing investment philosophy prioritizes buying businesses he understands at reasonable prices. Historically, he has been wary of the high valuations and rapid technological change characteristic of this group, with the notable exception of Apple, which he views as a consumer products company. His recent cautious commentary on Artificial Intelligence suggests he is not imminently preparing to invest heavily in its primary enablers like Nvidia or Microsoft.\n\nMy probability is not lower than 10% because Berkshire's approach is not static. The firm's deputies, Todd Combs and Ted Weschler, have a broader mandate and are responsible for past tech investments like Amazon and Snowflake. One of them could have initiated a new position. Among the potential targets, Microsoft is the most plausible. The historical barrier to investment—Buffett's friendship with Bill Gates and his presence on the board—is no longer a factor, and Microsoft exhibits many Berkshire-friendly traits like a wide competitive moat and strong free cash flow. A market dip in Q1 2025 could have provided an attractive entry point for a small position.\n\nConversely, the probability is not higher than 10% because a new investment in any of these names goes against the grain of Berkshire's recent actions and Buffett's commentary. The firm has been a net seller of stocks and is holding a record cash pile, signaling a lack of attractive opportunities at current market valuations. The base rate for Berkshire making a surprise, large-cap tech investment is very low. For me to increase my forecast, I would need to see evidence of a significant market correction in Q1 2025 focused on these names or hear public comments from Buffett or Munger's successor signaling a shift in their assessment of the tech sector's value proposition.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill Berkshire Hathaway reveal a purchase of any Magnificent 7 stock other than Amazon and Apple in its Q1 2025 13F filing?\n\nQuestion background:\nInvestopedia: [Berkshire Hathaway Doesn't Hold Nvidia Stock—Will Warren Buffett Come to Regret it?](https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/warren-buffetts-secret-portfolio-dumping-shares-3-supercharged-artificial-intelligence-ai)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if the 13F filing for Berkshire Hathaway, Inc., filed for the period ending 2025-03-31, reports the company holding shares of Alphabet, Meta Platforms, Microsoft, Nvidia, or Tesla.\n\n\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nNo additional information available.\n\nToday is 2025-05-07.\n\nBefore answering you think:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n(e) You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
