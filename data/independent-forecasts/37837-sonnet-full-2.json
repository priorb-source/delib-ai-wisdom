  "information": "Historical data from the National UFO Reporting Center (NUFORC) shows the following counts of reported sightings for the month of June: 357 in 2019, 470 in 2020, 407 in 2021, and 603 in 2022. While specific numbers for June 2023 and June 2024 were not provided in the source material, data tables indicated that all reported months in 2023 exceeded 600 reports and all reported months in 2024 exceeded 450 reports. For the current year, a data scrape on May 22, 2025, showed a total of 2,067 sighting reports for January through April 2025, yielding a monthly average of approximately 517. Each of ahe first four months of 2025 individually exceeded 400 reports.\n\nBetween May 2023 and June 2024, the US government documented 757 reports of Unidentified Aerial Phenomena (UAPs), with 708 of them occurring in the air. Of these, only 49 cases were officially closed. A notable number of these sightings occurred near the U.S.-Mexico border, particularly in Arizona. Media reports have covered recent military-related incidents, including a US Air Force F-16 fighter jet that was struck and damaged by an object over Arizona in January 2023. In a separate event from September 2024, a US Air Force pilot reported a close encounter with an object traveling at Mach 2 during a mission in California.\n\nPublic interest in UFO-related topics is supported by ongoing events and media attention. The 11th annual 'Contact in the Desert' conference, a major gathering for UFO experts and enthusiasts, is scheduled to run from May 29 to June 2, 2025, in California. Regionally, Washington state ranks third in the U.S. for the total number of UFO reports submitted to NUFORC, and several sightings have been reported from the state's Columbia Basin region since the beginning of 2025. The topic of UAPs also continues to receive attention from mainstream news outlets and the U.S. Congress.",

    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Approximately 5-6 weeks. Today is May 23, 2025, and the outcome will be determined when Metaculus accesses the NUFORC data on or after July 1, 2025, to check June 2025 reporting numbers.",
    "status_quo_outcome": "Yes, the question resolves as Yes. The strong trend from historical data indicates June 2025 will exceed 400 reports. Every month in 2023 exceeded 600 reports, every month in 2024 exceeded 450 reports, and all four months of 2025 so far have exceeded 400 reports with an average of 517 per month.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "June 2025 reports fall below 400, representing a significant deviation from the established trend. This could occur due to technical issues with NUFORC's reporting system, a sudden drop in public engagement, changes to report validation procedures that filter out more submissions, or an unprecedented seasonal anomaly that causes reporting to drop by more than 20% below the 2025 average.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "June 2025 continues the established pattern of recent years, with reports exceeding 400. The month follows the 2025 trend (averaging 517 per month) or falls somewhere between recent June performances (407-603 in 2021-2022). Ongoing public interest, government attention to UAPs, and events like the Contact in the Desert conference (May 29-June 2) maintain or increase reporting levels.",
    "rationale": "The historical data presents an exceptionally clear upward trend. June has exceeded 400 reports in 3 of the last 4 available years (470 in 2020, 407 in 2021, 603 in 2022), with only June 2019 falling short at 357. More significantly, the trend has strengthened dramatically: every single month in 2023 exceeded 600 reports, every month in 2024 exceeded 450, and January through April 2025 have each exceeded 400 with a robust average of 517. This represents 28+ consecutive months above the 400 threshold. The status quo strongly favors a Yes outcome. The threshold of 400 is actually quite conservative - it's 23% below the 2025 monthly average. For June to fall below 400 would require a drop of at least 100+ reports from recent monthly averages, representing a break from an extremely consistent pattern. Supporting factors include sustained government and media attention to UAPs and scheduled events like the Contact in the Desert conference at the end of May that could boost awareness. My forecast is not higher (95%+) because: (1) we're forecasting before June begins, introducing some inherent uncertainty, (2) there's a small but non-zero risk of technical or systemic issues with NUFORC's reporting platform, and (3) unexpected events could theoretically cause a sharp decline. My forecast is not lower (70-75%) because: (1) the trend is remarkably strong and consistent across 28+ months, (2) the threshold is well below recent averages, (3) there's no evidence of declining reports in current 2025 data, and (4) June historically performs well. I would update lower if May 2025 data (when available) shows an unexpected significant drop, or if there's news of changes to NUFORC's reporting system. I would update higher if May 2025 continues the strong trend or exceeds the current 2025 average.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill the number of UFO sightings reported by the National UFO Reporting Center exceed 400 for June 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nAccording to the [National UFO Reporting Center](https://nuforc.org/about-us/): \"The National UFO Reporting Center was founded in 1974 by noted UFO investigator Robert J. Gribble. The Center’s primary function over the past five decades has been to receive, record, and to the greatest degree possible, corroborate and document reports from individuals who have been witness to unusual, possibly UFO-related events. Throughout its history, the Center has processed over 180,000 reports, and has distributed its information to thousands of individuals.\"\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if The National UFO Reporting Center posts greater than 400 UFO/UAP sighting reports at [this link](https://nuforc.org/ndx/?id=event) for the month of June 2025, as displayed when accessed by Metaculus on or after July 1, 2025.\n\n\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nHistorical data from the National UFO Reporting Center (NUFORC) shows the following counts of reported sightings for the month of June: 357 in 2019, 470 in 2020, 407 in 2021, and 603 in 2022.

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
