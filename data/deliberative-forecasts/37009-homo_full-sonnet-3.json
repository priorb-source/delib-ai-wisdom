    "review": "Both forecasters provide thoughtful analyses that largely align with my initial reasoning. Forecaster 3 reached the identical 72% forecast using very similar logic. Forecaster 2's more conservative 60% estimate raises an important consideration I underweighted: the base rate of political announcement delays. This is a valid empirical concern - political announcements frequently slip for strategic, logistical, or coordination reasons. Forecaster 2 also appropriately emphasizes the status quo bias (she hasn't announced yet) and would update significantly if we pass April 25-26 without action. However, I believe Forecaster 2 may be overweighting these factors relative to the specificity and recency of the Politico reporting. The April 19 report stating 'as early as next week' is not only credible but extremely fresh - only 2 days old as of April 21. This reduces the concern about stale information or outdated timelines. The phrase 'as early as next week' does introduce some ambiguity about potential delays, but 'next week' from April 19 still places us in the April 26-30 window, which is before May 1. All forecasters agree on the key evidence: strong preparation signals, tight timeline, no FEC filing yet, and ambiguous secondary reporting. The differences come down to how much weight to assign to delay risk versus recent specific reporting.",
    "rationale": "After reviewing the other forecasts, I'm making a modest downward adjustment to account more explicitly for Forecaster 2's valid point about base rates of political announcement delays. While I maintain that the April 19 Politico report is highly specific and recent (reducing staleness concerns), the historical tendency for political announcements to slip for various reasons deserves more weight than I initially assigned. The lack of FEC paperwork filing is also a concrete indicator that final preparations may not be complete. However, I'm not moving all the way down to 60% because: (1) the Politico reporting is extremely fresh and specific, (2) the preparation signals are very strong and concrete, (3) we have sufficient time (9 days) within the projected 'next week' window, and (4) the competitive dynamics (McMorrow and El-Sayed already in the race) create pressure to announce soon. My updated forecast of 68% reflects a balance between the strong recent evidence for an imminent announcement and the empirical reality that political timelines frequently slip. This represents a modest 4-point downward adjustment from my initial 72% to better account for delay risk while still assigning higher-than-even odds based on the totality of evidence.",
