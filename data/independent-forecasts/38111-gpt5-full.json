  "information": "A high-level international conference on the two-state solution is scheduled for June 17-20, 2025, at the UN headquarters in New York. The conference is co-chaired by France and Saudi Arabia and is based on a UN General Assembly resolution from December 2024. Its stated aim is to generate momentum for more countries to recognize a Palestinian state. Supporting this effort, the Arab Group at the UN has urged member countries to recognize Palestine as a step toward lasting peace. Additionally, the 'Madrid+' group, comprising Spain, Ireland, Slovenia, and Norway, has called for Palestine's full UN membership, describing it as a \"political and diplomatic necessity.\"\n\nFrench President Emmanuel Macron has stated that recognizing a Palestinian state is a \"moral and political obligation\" and has indicated that France may officially grant recognition during the June UN conference, although he has also tied the move to certain conditions. In May 2025, the UK announced it had joined France's initiative for the recognition of a Palestinian state. According to a report by Axios, Malta is also preparing to declare Palestine's independence at the summit on June 20. Five Arab countries—Egypt, Jordan, Qatar, the UAE, and Saudi Arabia—have announced their active participation in organizing the conference.\n\nAs of May 2025, 147 out of 193 UN member states officially recognize the State of Palestine, while 46 members do not. The non-recognizing states include most Western European nations, the United States, Canada, Australia, Japan, and South Korea. In 2024, five countries newly recognized Palestine: Norway, Ireland, Spain, Slovenia, and Armenia. The Israeli government strongly opposes the international recognition effort. An Israeli official stated the country \"will not cooperate\" with such measures and warned of potential further annexation of the West Bank. The United States and several other G7 members also continue to withhold official recognition.",

    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "About 30 days (from May 31 to June 30, 2025)",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No new UN member recognizes Palestine in June 2025",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "The June 17–20 UN conference produces statements and a roadmap but no formal recognition announcements. France reiterates conditions and delays, the UK remains supportive but noncommittal, and other EU/NATO holdouts (Germany, Italy, Netherlands, Denmark, Finland, Baltics, Czechia) stay put. Any potential recognitions slip to July or later, or rumored moves (e.g., Malta) don’t materialize.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "At least one non-recognizing UN member formally announces recognition during or around the June 17–20 conference. Candidates include France (if Macron judges conditions satisfied), Belgium or Portugal (if they coordinate with France/Arab Group), or a European microstate aligned with France/Spain (e.g., Monaco/Andorra/San Marino). Alternatively, a smaller non-European holdout breaks ranks. Al Jazeera’s tracker or other credible outlets record the addition.",
    "rationale": "- What I’m weighing:\n  - Status quo pressure: Most of the 46 non-recognizers are closely aligned with the US/Israel (US, Canada, Australia, Japan, South Korea), or are risk‑averse EU/NATO states (Germany, Italy, Netherlands, Baltics, Denmark, Finland, Czechia). In a typical month, no changes would be expected.\n  - Event-driven upside: A high-profile UN conference (June 17–20) is explicitly designed to catalyze recognitions, co-chaired by France and Saudi Arabia. The Arab Group is urging recognition; the Madrid+ group is pushing full UN membership. In 2024 there was a surge (Norway, Ireland, Spain, Slovenia, Armenia), showing recognitions can come in coordinated waves.\n  - France as the swing: Macron has called recognition a “moral and political obligation” and hinted June could be the moment, but also tied it to conditions. If France moves, it meaningfully raises the odds and could pull a microstate (e.g., Monaco) or a like‑minded EU partner along. If France holds, the bar for others is higher.\n  - UK joined France’s initiative (per Le Monde), adding momentum but not a commitment to recognize in June. G7 dynamics and US opposition are still headwinds.\n  - Rumor signal: Axios reportedly said Malta may “declare Palestine’s independence” at the June 20 summit. If that truly implies new recognition by a current non‑recognizer, it boosts odds; if it’s mischaracterized or Malta already recognizes, it does not.\n\n- Why not higher: Many of the remaining 46 are hard cases; US pressure and domestic politics make a June move costly. Macron’s conditionality is a clear risk of delay; recognitions could slip to July or be tied to ceasefire/hostage or governance benchmarks. The conference could end with communiqués but no formal recognitions.\n\n- Why not lower: The conference is purposely timed to generate recognitions; France is openly entertaining the step; UK’s alignment adds diplomatic cover; recent 2024 recognitions show momentum and a willingness for coordinated action. Even one small state would suffice for a Yes.\n\n- Update triggers:\n  - Up: Credible pre-briefs or leaks that France will recognize at or during the conference; firm governmental statements from Belgium/Portugal/Greek or microstates; confirmation that the June event is structured for announcements.\n  - Down: French officials reiterate that conditions are unmet; US/G7 pushback intensifies; reports that the conference will focus on process only; any sign rumored moves (e.g., Malta) are walk-backs or already counted recognizers.\n\nSummary of assistant’s info used: June 17–20 UN conference co‑chaired by France/Saudi to spur recognitions; Arab Group urging recognition; Madrid+ pressing full UN membership; Macron’s statements about possible June recognition with conditions; UK joining France’s initiative; Axios rumor on Malta; 147 recognizers as of May 2025 (46 non‑recognizers concentrated among Western-aligned states); 2024 saw five new recognitions. These signals raise the base rate for June but do not overcome the structural caution of key holdouts.",
