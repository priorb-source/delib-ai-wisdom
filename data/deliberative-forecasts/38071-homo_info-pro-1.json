    "review": "My initial forecast of 25% was based on the general competitive landscape of a crowded primary. The other forecasters introduced two crucial pieces of specific data I had not considered: Forecaster 2 highlighted Levar Stoney's significant fundraising lead (~$1.4 million), while Forecaster 3 cited a March internal poll placing Stoney ahead of Rouse 16% to 10%. Critically, Forecaster 3 also noted that this poll found 63% of voters were undecided. I find both new pieces of information highly relevant. Forecaster 2's argument about the power of a financial advantage in the final weeks is very convincing and establishes Stoney as the clear favorite. Forecaster 3's point about the high number of undecided voters is also compelling, as it indicates the race is extremely fluid and an upset is certainly possible. Together, these points create a more detailed picture: Stoney is the frontrunner with concrete advantages, but the race is far from locked up, and Rouse is his primary challenger.",
    "rationale": "After reviewing the other analyses, I am increasing my forecast. The new data confirms that Aaron Rouse is a top-tier candidate and the most likely challenger to the frontrunner, Levar Stoney. My initial 25% was slightly too low for a candidate who is polling in second place and has a strong base of support. However, I am not raising my forecast as high as Forecaster 3's 40%. I believe Forecaster 2's reasoning is most sound; Stoney's significant fundraising advantage is a hard, predictive metric that cannot be overlooked, especially in the final weeks of a campaign when advertising and get-out-the-vote efforts are paramount. While the high number of undecided voters cited by Forecaster 3 creates volatility and gives Rouse a clear opportunity, he is still starting from behind in both polling and fundraising. A victory for him is plausible but would require him to capture the vast majority of late-deciding voters, making it the less likely outcome. I am updating my forecast from 25% to 30%, which I believe better reflects Rouse's position as the primary underdog challenger with a substantial, but not probable, chance of winning.",
