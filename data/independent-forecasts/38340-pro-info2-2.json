  "information": "Across Africa, 47 of the 54 signatory nations had ratified the AfCFTA agreement as of July 2024. However, overall implementation of the trade area since its 2021 launch has been described as sluggish. According to trade policy analysts, key impediments include production-related challenges like low industrial output, poor infrastructure, and non-tariff barriers. The original goal of removing tariffs on 90% of goods has been pushed back to 2034.",

    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Less than one month. The deadline is July 1, 2025.",
    "status_quo_outcome": "Sudan has not ratified the AfCFTA agreement. If the current situation continues, the outcome will be No.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "The Sudanese government remains preoccupied with the ongoing civil war. State institutions lack the capacity and political focus to complete the legislative process for ratification before the July 1, 2025 deadline.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "A sudden, unexpected ceasefire or peace agreement is reached in early June 2025. As a powerful symbol of commitment to economic recovery and regional reintegration, the re-established government fast-tracks and completes the ratification process in the final weeks before the deadline.",
    "rationale": "My forecast is overwhelmingly driven by the current political and security situation in Sudan. The country has been in a state of intense civil war since April 2023, which has effectively paralyzed normal state functions, including the legislative processes required for ratifying international treaties. The status quo is non-ratification, and with less than a month until the deadline, the inertia is incredibly strong. While the background information notes that a draft implementation strategy was reviewed, this predates the full-scale conflict which has undoubtedly halted any such bureaucratic progress. The government's entire focus is on the war, and there is no indication that ratifying AfCFTA is a priority or even feasible at this moment. The research assistant's report on the sluggish implementation of AfCFTA across the continent, even in stable nations, further suggests that this is not a process that can be completed hastily under ideal conditions, let alone during a civil war.\n\nMy forecast is not lower than 1% because ratification is not a physical impossibility. A highly improbable 'black swan' event, such as a sudden peace accord, could lead to a symbolic, rushed ratification. However, the probability is not higher because doing so would require ignoring the severe and debilitating reality of the ongoing conflict. The government's capacity is severely degraded, and its political will is directed elsewhere. For me to update my forecast upward, I would need to see credible, high-level reports of an imminent and lasting peace agreement. Conversely, any major escalation of the conflict would further solidify my near-zero forecast.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill Sudan ratify AfCFTA (the pan-African free trade agreement) before July 1, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\n[Draft National AfCFTA Implementation Strategy for Sudan Reviewed and Validated by Stakeholders](https://igad.int/draft-national-afcfta-implementation-strategy-for-sudan-reviewed-and-validated-by-stakeholders/)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if Sudan ratifies the African Continental Free Trade Area (AfCFTA) Agreement before July 1, 2025.\n\n\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nAcross Africa, 47 of the 54 signatory nations had ratified the AfCFTA agreement as of July 2024.

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
