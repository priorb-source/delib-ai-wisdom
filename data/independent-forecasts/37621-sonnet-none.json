    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Approximately 20 days until June 1, 2025",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No - the tush push remains legal and unbanned",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "The NFL does not hold an owners meeting or vote on the tush push ban in the remaining 20 days before June 1, 2025. The next owners meeting occurs after the resolution date, likely in the fall, and no emergency session is called.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "The NFL holds a special or previously scheduled owners meeting in the next 20 days where they vote on and approve a rule restricting or banning the tush push play, with an official announcement made before June 1, 2025.",
    "rationale": "With only 20 days remaining until the resolution date, the probability of a ban is very low. Key factors: (1) NFL owners' meetings are typically scheduled well in advance, with the main annual meeting in March and fall meetings in October/November; (2) The previous vote was tabled for more discussion, indicating the issue wasn't ready for immediate resolution; (3) While CBS Sports reports strong support at the 'next owners meeting,' there's no indication this meeting is scheduled before June 1; (4) No additional information from the research assistant suggests any imminent action. The status quo strongly favors no change - implementing a rule ban requires a formal owners meeting, agenda placement, sufficient votes, and official announcement. In a 20-day window during mid-May (outside typical meeting periods), these steps are highly unlikely to occur unless already scheduled. This isn't an urgent safety matter requiring emergency action. The probability isn't zero because we cannot completely rule out a special session or pre-scheduled meeting we're unaware of. It's not higher because there's no evidence of imminent action and the timeframe is extremely compressed. I would update higher with news of a scheduled meeting before June 1 or statements indicating imminent action. I would update lower with confirmation the next meeting is after June 1.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill the NFL ban the \"Tush-Push\" before June 1, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nESPN: [Vote on tush push ban tabled by NFL owners for more discussion](https://www.espn.com/nfl/story/_/id/44490292/sources-tush-push-ban-vote-tabled-nfl-owners) | CBS Sports: [Expansive 'Tush Push' ban could have strong support at NFL's next owners meeting, per report](https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/news/expansive-tush-push-ban-could-have-strong-support-at-nfls-next-owners-meeting-per-report/)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if the National Football League officially approves or announces a rule restricting the quarterback sneak known as the [Tush-Push](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quarterback_sneak#Tush_push) before June 1, 2025. If there are no reports of this occurring before that date, this question resolves as **No**.\n\n\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nNo additional information available.\n\nToday is 2025-05-12.\n\nBefore answering you think:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n(e) You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
