    "review": "All three forecasts converged remarkably at 20-25%, which validates the core reasoning. The other forecasters reinforced key points I considered: the compressed 20-day timeframe, lack of evidence for active transition planning, and the general pattern that political statements about stepping down don't always translate to immediate action. Forecaster 2 made a particularly strong point about Russian political transitions typically requiring 'behind-the-scenes negotiations and formal procedures that take weeks or months' - this is a more specific articulation of the bureaucratic inertia I noted. Forecaster 3 usefully emphasized that 'no urgent crisis or health emergency has been reported,' which counters any speculation about forced immediate departure. Neither forecaster provided new information that wasn't in my original analysis, and their update conditions mirror mine (would increase with evidence of succession planning, decrease with walkback statements). The convergence suggests we're appropriately weighing the tension between a significant recent signal and an extremely short resolution window.",
    "rationale": "After reviewing both analyses, I remain confident in my original reasoning. The key factors remain unchanged: (1) Kadyrov's May 6th statement is genuine and significant, preventing a baseline <10% forecast; (2) The 20-day window is extraordinarily compressed for formal political transitions in Russia's system, where even willing changes typically involve extensive coordination with the Kremlin; (3) No evidence has emerged of active succession planning, successor naming, or formal procedures being initiated; (4) Historical precedent shows these transitions take weeks to months, not days. The convergence of all three forecasters at 20-25% suggests this range appropriately captures the uncertainty. While I acknowledge Forecaster 2's slightly higher 25% is defensible given the explicit nature of the statement, I don't see compelling evidence to deviate from my original assessment. The probability remains elevated above baseline due to the recent statement, but the dominant factor is the extreme time constraint making rapid resolution unlikely.",
