    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Approximately 55 days until July 1, 2025",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No - if no major political events or catalysts trigger large-scale protests in Turkey over the next 55 days, or if protests occur but don't reach the 10,000+ participant threshold, or aren't captured by the Global Protest Tracker",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Turkey experiences relative political calm over the next two months. Any protests that occur remain localized or smaller in scale (under 10,000 participants). Alternatively, protests may occur but the Global Protest Tracker either doesn't capture them or reports participant numbers below the 10,000 threshold before the July 1 deadline.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "A significant political event, controversial government policy, economic crisis, or social trigger sparks mass demonstrations in major Turkish cities. These protests attract 10,000 or more participants, and the Global Protest Tracker documents and reports these events with participant counts meeting the threshold before July 1, 2025.",
    "rationale": "The existence of a Wikipedia article on '2025 Turkish protests' is a notable positive signal suggesting that significant protests have occurred or are occurring in Turkey this year. However, my research assistant provides no additional detail about the scale of these protests or whether they've been documented by the Global Protest Tracker. Turkey has demonstrated capacity for large-scale protests historically (e.g., Gezi Park 2013), and as a country of 85 million with ongoing political tensions under Erdogan's government, 10,000+ participant protests are plausible. The 55-day timeframe is relatively short, which limits opportunities for new protest movements to develop and be documented. Key uncertainties include: (1) whether current 2025 protests mentioned in Wikipedia meet the 10,000+ threshold, (2) whether the Global Protest Tracker has captured or will capture these events, and (3) the reporting lag of the Global Protest Tracker. I'm not forecasting higher because I lack concrete evidence of current large-scale protests or triggering events, and the timeframe is short. I'm not forecasting lower because the Wikipedia article suggests protest activity is already occurring, and Turkey's political environment makes large protests feasible. I would update higher with evidence of: ongoing large protests in Turkey, specific triggering events (policy changes, economic shocks), or confirmation the Global Protest Tracker is actively tracking Turkish protests. I would update lower with evidence of: protest suppression effectiveness, lack of mobilizing issues, or learning the Wikipedia article refers to smaller-scale events.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill the Global Protest Tracker report any protests in Turkey (Türkiye) with 10,000+ participants, before July 1, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nWikipedia: [2025 Turkish protests](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2025_Turkish_protests)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if the [Global Protest Tracker](https://carnegieendowment.org/features/global-protest-tracker?lang=en) reports a protest in Turkey (Türkiye) with 10,000 or more participants with a start date after the launch of this question and before July 1, 2025.\n\nPlease note that the Global Protest Tracker uses the name Türkiye in its database.\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nNo additional information available.\n\nToday is 2025-05-07.\n\nBefore answering you think:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n(e) You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
