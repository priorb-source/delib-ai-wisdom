    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Approximately 2 months. The final OCHA snapshot published before July 1, 2025, will determine the outcome.",
    "status_quo_outcome": "Yes. The ongoing conflict continues to produce casualties, including among UN staff. With the current reported number at 295, the addition of just 5 more fatalities over the next two months is highly likely if the conflict's intensity remains consistent.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "A 'No' outcome would likely require a comprehensive and durable ceasefire to be implemented immediately, leading to a near-complete cessation of UN staff casualties for May and June 2025. Alternatively, if OCHA stops publishing new reports, the final count would remain at 295.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "A 'Yes' outcome is expected if the conflict continues, even at a significantly reduced intensity. Given the dangerous operating environment, isolated incidents such as airstrikes or ground operations could easily result in the 5 additional UN staff fatalities required to meet the 300 threshold before July 1, 2025.",
    "rationale": "My forecast is based on the proximity of the current number to the threshold. As of the hypothetical April 30, 2025 report, the count stands at 295, requiring only 5 more fatalities to resolve as 'Yes'. The resolution window is two months (May and June 2025). The historical context of the conflict shows a high rate of casualties among humanitarian workers. Even a substantial de-escalation from previous months would likely see this small, remaining number of casualties surpassed. The status quo is an active conflict where UN personnel are at constant risk. For the outcome to be 'No', there would need to be a rapid and lasting cessation of hostilities, which appears improbable given the entrenched nature of the conflict. My probability is not higher than 90% to account for the small but real possibility of a sudden, lasting ceasefire agreement or a political decision for OCHA to cease this specific reporting, which would lock the number at 295. My probability is not lower because the threshold is incredibly close, and the time frame is long enough that even sporadic incidents are likely to result in the required number of additional casualties. I would update my forecast down if a credible, long-term ceasefire is announced and holds, or up if a major new military offensive begins in a populated area with a significant UN presence.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill 300 or more UN staff be reported to be killed in Gaza according to UN's OCHA in its final impact snapshot before July 1, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nSee accompanying Humanitarian update [here](https://www.ochaopt.org/content/humanitarian-situation-update-284-gaza-strip).\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if the number of reported UN staff killed in Gaza is greater than or equal to 300 according to the most recent impact snapshot for the Gaza Strip posted [here](https://www.ochaopt.org/publications) by the United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs as of July 1, 2025. For example, a snapshot dated April 30, 2025, [reports](https://www.ochaopt.org/content/reported-impact-snapshot-gaza-strip-30-april-2025) 295 UN staff fatalities.\n\nIf OCHA stops posting new updates, this resolves as the most recent number, which as of the time of this question would be the impact snapshot posted on April 30, 2025.\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nNo additional information available.\n\nToday is 2025-05-05.\n\nBefore answering you think:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n(e) You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
