  "information": "The U.S. Department of State released the results for the Diversity Visa Program (DV-2026) lottery in early May 2025. Applicants can check their status online through the Entrant Status Check page until September 30, 2026. This followed the release of the DV-2025 results on May 3, 2025. The registration period for the DV-2026 lottery ran from October to November 2024. The program awards up to 55,000 permanent residence visas annually. The State Department has emphasized that the official website, dvprogram.state.gov, is the only channel for results.\n\nThe Diversity Visa program was established by the Immigration Act of 1990. The Trump administration, which began in January 2025, has previously expressed opposition to the program. The administration issued executive orders in January 2025 concerning Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion (DEI) related websites across federal agencies. In April 2025, a bill was introduced in the House of Representatives with the goal of terminating the statutory DV program.\n\nIn May 2025, the US Department of State imposed visa restrictions on Indian travel agency executives and staff who were found to have knowingly enabled unlawful entry into the US. In a separate action, the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) announced the termination of Temporary Protected Status (TPS) for Afghanistan, scheduled to take effect on July 14, 2025. Concurrently, a federal court issued a preliminary injunction that blocked a DHS attempt to terminate TPS for Venezuelan nationals.",

    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "About 42 days (as of 2025-05-20)",
    "status_quo_outcome": "Yes — the Step 1 “Submit an Entry” DV instructions page remains accessible at the specified travel.state.gov URL.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "The page is removed, renamed, or reorganized (e.g., 301/302 redirect or 404) before July 1; or the content at that URL is replaced with a non-instruction/termination notice; or a transient outage occurs exactly when checked; or Congress and the Administration terminate the DV program and the Department promptly pulls or repurposes the page.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "The DV program continues unchanged into July; State keeps the long-standing Step 1 instructions page live at the same URL (perhaps with “entry period closed” language) as it has across prior years and administrations.",
    "rationale": "- Baseline and inertia: The DV program is statutory (Immigration Act of 1990). Even with an administration that opposes the program, removal of the program requires legislation. Historically, during 2017–2021 the DV instructions pages stayed online. Government sites, especially State’s travel.state.gov, tend to keep stable URLs for core program pages.\n- Timing: The window to July 1 is short. The DV-2026 results were posted in early May 2025 and the Entrant Status Check remains open through Sept 2026. Given active program operations, it is likely the Step 1 instructions page remains up, even outside the entry window. The next entry period (DV-2027) would typically open in Oct/Nov 2025, making it reasonable to keep the instructions page accessible in the interim.\n- Political/legislative risk: A bill to terminate the DV program was introduced in April 2025. Swift enactment by July 1 is possible but not likely. Even if passed, agencies often update web content with a lag; they may retain the page with modified language rather than immediately removing it. However, if the page is replaced by a termination notice without instructions, the question could resolve No under a strict reading.\n- Website reorganization risk: There is some chance State restructures the DV pages or changes the slug (e.g., removing “diversity” from URLs or rebranding), which could produce a redirect or 404 at the exact path. That, plus low-probability transient downtime at the moment of check, are the main non-political risks.\n- Research assistant highlights: DV-2026 results released May 2025; official status-check site is dvprogram.state.gov; administration has signaled opposition and issued DEI-related web directives; a termination bill exists. These increase tail risk but don’t outweigh the short time horizon and institutional inertia.\nWhy not higher: Non-trivial chance of URL changes/redirects, content replacement due to political optics, or rare outages. Why not lower: The program is active, the time window is short, and prior precedent shows the page persisting across administrations. \nUpdate triggers upward: Clear signals that Congress won’t act before July and no web reorg underway; confirmation from State that URLs remain stable. Downward: Rapid legislative progress with imminent signature; State posts notices about DV page consolidation/rebranding; observed redirects/404s at the URL; new executive directives targeting DV web content specifically.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill the US State Department's Diversity Visa page still be online on July 1, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\n[Federal judge’s order leaves many visa lottery winners out of luck](https://www.siliconvalley.com/2020/10/01/judges-order-leaves-many-visa-lottery-winners-out-of-luck/) | [Donald Trump's 2017 tweet discussing the DV program](https://x.com/realDonaldTrump/status/925684982307348480)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below.

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
