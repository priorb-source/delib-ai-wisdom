    "review": "The other two forecasters and I are in broad agreement on the fundamental drivers of this question: India is in a volatile state with multiple active flashpoints (religious/land laws, farmers' rights) and a demonstrated history of mass mobilization. We all identify the primary uncertainties as the short two-month timeframe and the reliance on a specific reporting source, the Global Protest Tracker. Forecaster 3's analysis aligns very closely with my own, arriving at the same 75% probability and highlighting the planned 10,000-person farmers' march as a key indicator. They made a persuasive point that I hadn't explicitly articulated: a protest of this size is inherently newsworthy, making it highly likely to be captured by the international news sources the tracker monitors, which mitigates the reporting risk. Forecaster 2 is more cautious, arriving at 65% by placing greater weight on the short timeframe and potential reporting lag. Their caution provides a valuable check on overconfidence, forcing me to reconsider how significant those risks are.",
    "rationale": "After reviewing my peers' analyses, I am maintaining my forecast at 75%. My core reasoning remains unchanged: the confluence of multiple, high-intensity social and political grievances in India, combined with specific intelligence about a planned mobilization of 10,000 farmers, makes a qualifying protest highly probable within the next two months. The deliberation reinforced this view. Forecaster 3's argument that a protest meeting the 10,000-participant threshold would be a major news event, and thus very likely to be picked up by the tracker's sources, successfully addresses my primary concern about the resolution mechanism. While I agree with Forecaster 2 that the two-month window is short and government suppression is a real factor, the current high tensions and recent violent clashes suggest that protest momentum is building, not waning. Historically, such suppression has not always succeeded in preventing mass demonstrations in India. Therefore, I believe the strong positive drivers for a 'Yes' outcome outweigh the moderate risks posed by the timeline and the reporting mechanism.",
