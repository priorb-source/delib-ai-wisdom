  "information": "Several jurisdictions on the FATF grey list are actively seeking removal. The Nigerian government is working to exit the list by the end of May 2025, with its Minister of Interior emphasizing the administration's commitment to improving financial transparency. South Africa's National Treasury has stated that the country has addressed or largely addressed 20 of its 22 action items and aims to resolve the remaining two by June 2025, for a potential exit from the list by October 2025. Mozambique completed its technical reforms, and an FATF on-site visit, which is a prerequisite for removal, reportedly took place in April 2025 with positive feedback.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "About 5–6 weeks (FATF June 2025 plenary, typically concluding in late June).",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No change to the grey list; the question resolves No.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "On-site visit conclusions for candidate exits (e.g., Mozambique, Nigeria) are deemed insufficient or are procedurally delayed to October; South Africa’s remaining items slip to October as planned; and FATF identifies no new jurisdictions warranting addition in June—resulting in no changes announced.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "FATF removes at least one country (most plausibly Mozambique, and possibly Nigeria if an on-site is completed and positive) and/or adds at least one new jurisdiction to increased monitoring; any single addition or removal leads to a Yes resolution.",
    "rationale": "Base rate: In recent years, virtually every FATF plenary (Feb/Jun/Oct) has produced at least one change to the grey list. That alone pushes the prior notably above 50%. The bar for removals is completion of the action plan plus a successful on‑site visit; additions occur when strategic AML/CFT deficiencies are identified and the jurisdiction commits to an action plan.\n\nSignals for June 2025:\n- Mozambique: Reportedly completed technical reforms and had an FATF on‑site visit in April 2025 with positive feedback. This is the strongest single signal for a June delisting.\n- Nigeria: Officials are aiming to exit by end‑May 2025. That suggests substantial progress, but timing is tight—an on‑site and subsequent ICRG/FATF processing may push a decision to October.\n- South Africa: Treasury indicates 20/22 items addressed, aiming for October 2025 rather than June—so a June exit is less likely.\n- Additions: After Laos and Nepal were added and the Philippines removed in Feb 2025, further June additions are possible but less predictable; still, even one new addition would resolve this question as Yes.\n\nWhy not higher? Even with positive Mozambique signals, FATF sometimes defers removals to the next plenary for procedural reasons. Nigeria’s timeline could slip. It’s also plausible that no new jurisdictions are added in June after multiple changes in February.\n\nWhy not lower? The combination of (a) a strong candidate for removal (Mozambique) with an April on‑site, and (b) the historical pattern that most plenaries produce at least one grey‑list change, makes a clean “no changes” outcome relatively unlikely.\n\nWhat would move me up: Credible reporting that the ICRG recommended Mozambique delisting for June; confirmation of a completed and positive Nigeria on‑site; pre‑plenary briefings hinting at at least one new addition. What would move me down: Reports that Mozambique’s on‑site raised concerns or that FATF plans to defer delistings to October; explicit indications there will be no list changes in June.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill any jurisdictions be added to or removed from the FATF \"grey list\" following the FATF Plenary meeting in June 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nAML Intelligence (February 2025) [UPDATE: Philippines removed from FATF ‘grey list’ as Laos, Nepal added to watchlist](https://www.amlintelligence.com/2025/02/breaking-fatf-grey-list-update-laos-and-nepal-added-the-philippines-removed/)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if following its June 2025 plenary, the Financial Action Task Force (FATF) has made any changes to its \"Jurisdictions under Increased Monitoring\" list, which at the time of this question consists of Algeria, Angola, Bulgaria, Burkina Faso, Cameroon, Côte d'Ivoire, Croatia, the Democratic Republic of Congo, Haiti, Kenya, the Lao People's Democratic Republic, Lebanon, Mali, Monaco, Mozambique, Namibia, Nepal, Nigeria, South Africa, South Sudan, Syria, Tanzania, Venezuela, Vietnam, and Yemen. Resolves according to the [official list](https://www.fatf-gafi.org/en/countries/black-and-grey-lists.html).\n\nThe question may resolve according to [credible sources](https://www.metaculus.com/help/faq/#definitions) in case the website is unavailable or not timely updated.\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nSeveral jurisdictions on the FATF grey list are actively seeking removal.

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
