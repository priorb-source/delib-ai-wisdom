    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Approximately 5 weeks. The resolution window closes on June 15, 2025.",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No, Donald Trump and Xi Jinping will not speak on the phone in the specified timeframe.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "The current diplomatic situation persists. Communications between the US and China continue through official channels involving the sitting Biden administration. Donald Trump, as a private citizen, does not have a formal reason to speak with Xi Jinping, and the Chinese government adheres to diplomatic protocol by not engaging with him directly, thus no mutually acknowledged call takes place.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "A sudden and acute international crisis, for example a major military escalation in the Taiwan Strait, creates an urgent need for de-escalation. Trump, positioning himself as a unique dealmaker, initiates contact. Xi agrees to the call to assess the views of a potential next US president during a volatile period. Both sides decide there is strategic value in publicizing the contact and therefore mutually acknowledge the call took place.",
    "rationale": "The basis for my forecast is the strong diplomatic norm that foreign heads of state engage with their current counterparts, not with private citizens or political opponents. Donald Trump is not the sitting US President. A direct, acknowledged phone call between him and President Xi would be a significant breach of protocol and could antagonize the current US administration. The legal framework of the Logan Act, while rarely enforced, also discourages such unauthorized diplomacy. The time window for this event is very narrow, from May 12 to June 15, 2025, reducing the likelihood of a sufficiently compelling trigger event occurring. Furthermore, the resolution criteria are strict, requiring both parties to acknowledge the call. As the provided background information from CBS News indicates, there have been instances of disputed claims about talks, making this high bar for confirmation a crucial factor. The status quo, in which no such call is planned or expected, is the most powerful predictor. My forecast is not lower than 3% because Donald Trump has a history of unconventional actions, and the possibility of a sudden international crisis that scrambles typical diplomatic procedures is never zero. My forecast is not higher because the structural barriers—diplomatic protocol, the short timeframe, and the lack of a clear incentive for Xi to bypass the current administration—are substantial. I would raise my probability if a major US-China crisis erupted or if credible sources reported that back-channel preparations for such a call were underway. I would lower it as the deadline approaches without any such developments.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill Donald Trump and Xi Jinping speak on the phone with each other before June 15, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nCBS News: [Trump says he's talked with Xi about tariffs. China has denied talks are taking place](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/trump-xi-china-tariffs/)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if, after May 12, 2025 and before June 15, 2025, Donald Trump and Xi Jinping speak on the phone with each other, according to [credible sources](https://www.metaculus.com/faq/#definitions).\n\nBoth sides must acknowledge the phone call took place for it to count. \"Speak on the phone with each other\" is defined as both individuals, from different physical spaces, orally uttering words intended for the other individual into a telephone or equivalent device, those words being converted into electrical or digital signals in real time, and then transferred to the other individual via telecommunications links, where they are reconverted into sound waves at the other individual's listening device.\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nNo additional information available.\n\nToday is 2025-05-07.\n\nBefore answering you think:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n(e) You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
