    "review": "Both forecasters make compelling arguments that I insufficiently weighted in my initial analysis. They emphasize the *logistical impossibility* rather than mere difficulty of organizing proper security for a Prime Minister's visit in under two weeks - this is a critical distinction. Prime Ministers require advance security teams, coordination with local authorities, and extensive preparations that cannot be rushed without serious risks. Forecaster 3's point about Canada's *selective invitation decisions* is particularly persuasive - they deliberately chose to invite Australia, Ukraine, South Africa, and Brazil but not India, suggesting this is a considered decision rather than an oversight. Both forecasters also correctly note that even if an invitation were extended immediately, Modi would still need to accept on extremely short notice despite poor optics and domestic Canadian political opposition, adding another layer of improbability. While I still believe diplomatic surprises occasionally occur (hence not forecasting 1%), the convergence of (1) no invitation yet, (2) genuine security/logistics impossibility in the timeline, (3) deliberate exclusion pattern, and (4) domestic Canadian opposition creates more severe constraints than I initially assessed.",
    "rationale": "Upon reflection, I was too generous with 10%. The security and logistics timeline is not just 'unusual' but approaches impossibility - proper advance security preparations for a PM visit typically require 4-6 weeks minimum, not 12 days. The selective invitation pattern (inviting other non-G7 countries but deliberately excluding India) strengthens the case that this is intentional rather than an oversight. Combined with diplomatic tensions and active lobbying against the invitation by Sikh organizations, the barriers are more severe than I initially weighted. While I maintain there's a small probability of a dramatic last-minute diplomatic breakthrough - perhaps Carney issuing a surprise invitation as a bold reset gesture and Modi accepting despite the rushed circumstances - the compound probability of all necessary events occurring (invitation + acceptance + security waivers + political will to override domestic opposition) in 12 days is extremely low. I'm updating downward to 6%, aligning with Forecaster 2's assessment, as this better reflects the binding nature of the security/logistics constraints while acknowledging the non-zero possibility of diplomatic surprises.",
