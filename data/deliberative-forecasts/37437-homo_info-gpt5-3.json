    "review": "Both forecasters converge on a low single-digit probability and sharpen a few points I only implied. New/valuable angles: (1) The May 20 Lai inauguration anniversary as a near-term coercive signaling window—useful for thinking about a short-lived tail risk; (2) The linguistic hurdle is twofold: not just that Washington might avoid the word “invasion,” but also that Beijing could use Coast Guard/PAP/maritime militia rather than PLA ground troops for any deniable seizure, failing the resolution outright; (3) The 2027 PLA-readiness consensus and Paparo’s remarks underscore medium-term danger versus near-term imminence. None of their arguments raise the probability; if anything, the Coast Guard/PAP nuance slightly lowers it. However, the May 20 window offsets that with a small uptick in short-term risk. Net effect: their reasoning largely reinforces my 2% baseline.",
    "rationale": "The event requires both (a) PLA ground forces physically entering Taiwan-controlled territory and (b) a public U.S. accusation framing that as an invasion—within ~8 weeks from May 5, 2025. This is an extreme and complex action that would likely show observable mobilization (amphibious/airborne units loading out, RO-RO requisitions, coastal closures, logistics staging) and prewar political signaling; none is publicly evident at scale. Many plausible escalations—blockade-like drills, air/missile coercion, or law-enforcement seizures—do not satisfy the resolution. Even a limited outlying-islet grab might be executed by Coast Guard/PAP, not PLA Marines, and Washington could avoid “invasion” language to manage escalation. A modest tail risk persists around the May 20 political window or a surprise move against a lightly defended feature (e.g., Pratas), combined with a deliberate U.S. choice to use invasion framing. Balancing: the Coast Guard/PAP pathway and wording hurdle push odds down; the May 20 signaling window nudges them up. With no credible indications of imminent amphibious mobilization, my prior remains appropriate. I therefore keep 2%. What would move me up: verified PLA amphibious/airborne staging, mass RO-RO requisitions, large exclusion zones adjacent to Taiwan beaches, PRC domestic war-prep signals, or U.S. intel leaks of imminent landing. What would move me down: clear de-escalation, exercise patterns without amphibious components near Taiwan, or approaching late June without mobilization indicators.",
