    "review": "Both forecasters make compelling arguments that I underweighted. Forecaster 2's point that 'a full month with two or fewer clemencies would be a significant deviation from the established norm' is well-taken - the second-term infrastructure and pace fundamentally differ from the first term. Forecaster 3 astutely emphasizes how low the threshold is (just 3 individuals) and that operational capacity is high with minimal legal constraints. They both properly weight the recent May spree and explicit signaling of more clemencies as strong predictors of continued activity. However, I believe they may be slightly underweighting the first-term June pattern (0 clemencies across all 4 Junes) and the possibility that the late-May 'blitz' of 25+ pardons could temporarily satisfy political pressure or represent a batching strategy that might skip June for early-July timing around symbolic dates. Their analyses are more persuasive than initially credited, particularly regarding how easy it is to clear such a low threshold with existing infrastructure.",
    "rationale": "After reviewing their arguments, I'm updating upward but not fully to their range. Key factors causing me to revise up: (1) The threshold is indeed very low - only 3 individuals - making it easier to hit even with reduced activity; (2) The second-term pattern with dedicated infrastructure (Ed Martin, Alice Marie Johnson) is likely more predictive than first-term behavior; (3) Explicit reporting about forthcoming pardons suggests an active pipeline; (4) Even sporadic June activity could exceed 2 individuals. However, I maintain some caution because: (1) The first-term June drought across 4 consecutive years remains a notable pattern worth considering; (2) The late-May clemency spree of 25+ could represent batching behavior that reduces June activity; (3) Trump may target early July for symbolic/headline reasons. Balancing these considerations, 70% represents reasonable confidence that the low threshold will be exceeded while acknowledging meaningful uncertainty about June specifically.",
