    "review": "Forecaster 2 raises important points I underweighted. The status quo principle is particularly relevant: if Ukraine was 'one step away' from stagflation on April 10, and we're now on April 22, the most likely scenario is continuity rather than sudden threshold crossing. The linguistic interpretation is also compelling - 'one step away' more naturally suggests NOT YET at the threshold rather than already there. If inflation were already at 15%+, the article would likely have stated Ukraine IS experiencing stagflation, not that it's approaching it. Forecaster 2 also appropriately emphasizes international financial support as a stabilizing force. Forecaster 3's analysis aligns closely with mine but takes a slightly more cautious middle position at 55%, which seems reasonable given the uncertainties. All three analyses acknowledge we're working with limited hard data - just one qualitative signal from the article.",
    "rationale": "Upon reflection, I overweighted the wartime pressure arguments and underweighted the status quo and linguistic interpretation arguments. The phrase 'one step away from stagflation' most naturally suggests inflation is elevated and concerning (likely 11-14% range) but has not yet reached the 15% threshold. If current inflation were already at 15%+, the article would more likely have stated Ukraine is experiencing stagflation rather than being one step away from it. The status quo principle suggests that conditions described on April 10 likely persist through April 22 - meaning still elevated but below threshold. The 15.0% threshold is also quite specific, and being at 14.5% vs 15.0% makes all the difference for resolution. While Ukraine's wartime economy faces genuine inflationary pressures, international support and stabilization efforts provide countervailing forces. I'm updating down from 60% to 56% - slightly above Forecaster 3's 55% because I still assign meaningful probability to the scenario where 'one step away' means inflation is already at 14%+ and could round to or exceed 15%, but acknowledging the status quo and linguistic arguments reduce confidence in crossing the threshold.",
