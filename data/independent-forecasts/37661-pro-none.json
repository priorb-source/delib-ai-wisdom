    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Approximately one and a half months, with a deadline of July 1, 2025.",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No. As of May 16, 2025, Starlink's official availability map does not list Bangladesh as 'Available'. The service has not yet launched in the country.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Despite receiving high-level government approval a year ago, persistent bureaucratic, logistical, or final licensing hurdles continue to delay the operational launch. Starlink is unable to resolve these issues, and the availability map remains unchanged past the July 1, 2025 deadline.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Following the Prime Minister's final approval in May 2024, Starlink has spent the past year quietly establishing the necessary ground infrastructure and supply chains. With preparations complete, the company officially launches service, and the availability map is updated to show 'Available' in parts of Bangladesh before the deadline.",
    "rationale": "My forecast is primarily driven by the report of 'final approval' from Bangladesh's leader. Securing top-level government endorsement is the most significant hurdle for Starlink's entry into any new market. In this timeline, that approval was granted a full year ago. This long lead time could be interpreted positively, suggesting that Starlink has used the year to complete the necessary technical and logistical groundwork for a launch that is now imminent. However, this same one-year delay is also the main reason for my uncertainty and why the forecast is not higher. A year is a long time to wait after a 'final' approval, which suggests the existence of significant, non-public friction in the process, be it bureaucratic, technical, or commercial. The status quo is non-availability, and this has persisted for a year post-approval. While the world changes slowly, the initial approval was a major event that makes a change in status more likely. I am weighing the powerful signal of top-level political will against the strong counter-signal of a year of inaction. I lean towards 'Yes' because a year is a plausible, albeit lengthy, timeframe to prepare a national service launch, and that work may be about to culminate. My probability would be higher with reports of ground station completion or imminent kit shipments. It would be lower if there were news of new regulatory disputes or if Starlink publicly shifted its focus to other regions.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill Starlink's website show Bangladesh as a country with Starlink availability before July 1, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\n[Bangladeshi leader gives final approval to Musk's Starlink service](https://www.aa.com.tr/en/asia-pacific/bangladeshi-leader-gives-final-approval-to-musks-starlink-service/3551404)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if, before July 1, 2025, the [Starlink Availability Map](https://www.starlink.com/us/map) has anywhere in Bangladesh listed as \"Available.\"\n\n\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nNo additional information available.\n\nToday is 2025-05-16.\n\nBefore answering you think:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n(e) You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
