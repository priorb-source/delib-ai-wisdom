    "review": "All three forecasters reached remarkably similar conclusions using comparable reasoning. Forecasters 2 and 3 identified the same core challenge I did: a 9.5% depreciation in approximately 50 days is an unusually large move for a major currency pair. We all noted the same supporting factors (USD weakness, Q1 contraction, trade tensions) and opposing factors (Bank of America forecast, May seasonality, technical targets for late 2025). The key insight from Forecaster 2 that I should weight more heavily is the 'crisis-level event' framing. Forecaster 2 correctly emphasizes that movements of this magnitude in this timeframe typically require crisis conditions - not just gradual deterioration or policy drift. Looking at historical precedent, 10% moves in major currency pairs over 2 months are indeed rare outside of major shocks (2008 financial crisis, COVID, etc.). This is a more rigorous way to think about base rates than I originally applied.",
    "rationale": "Upon reflection, I believe Forecaster 2's emphasis on requiring a 'crisis-level event' is the strongest argument for lowering my forecast. While I acknowledged the difficulty of the required move, I didn't sufficiently weight how rare such rapid movements are in stable market conditions. For USD/EUR to drop from 0.884 to below 0.80 in 50 days would require: (1) a major economic/financial crisis, (2) an emergency Fed pivot to aggressive easing, or (3) severe trade war escalation. None of these scenarios appear highly likely in the next 50 days, though they remain possible given current uncertainties. The existing USD weakness (7% YTD) and trade policy risks justify keeping the probability above Forecaster 2's 12%, but the crisis threshold argument warrants a downward revision from my initial 18%. I'm updating to 15% to better reflect that this outcome requires an unusually sharp acceleration of current trends or a discrete shock, not merely continuation of existing USD weakness.",
