    "review": "The analyses from the other two forecasters are highly congruent with my own, both in reasoning and in the final probability. All three of us independently identified the core dynamic at play: the statistical principle of mean reversion for a volatile economic indicator following a significant one-month spike. Forecasters 2 and 3 both correctly highlighted that the strong 7.6% increase in March, while positive, sets a high base and makes a consecutive increase less probable than a slight pullback or normalization. They did not introduce any new evidence or arguments that I had not already considered. This strong consensus serves as a powerful confirmation of my initial assessment rather than a challenge to it.",
    "rationale": "After reviewing the other expert forecasts, I am maintaining my initial forecast of 45%. The deliberation process has reinforced my confidence in my original reasoning. The unanimous agreement among all three forecasters on both the 45% probability and the underlying rationale—mean reversion in a volatile series—is significant. The primary factor remains that a single, large positive data point (+7.6% in March) after a period of decline is more often a statistical correction or a one-off event than the beginning of a sustained trend. Without any positive leading indicators for April, betting on a second consecutive monthly increase is statistically the less likely outcome. The strong consensus provides no new information or compelling counter-argument that would warrant an adjustment to my forecast.",
