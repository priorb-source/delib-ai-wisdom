  "information": "The 2026 Florida gubernatorial race involves several candidates. For the Republican nomination, Congressman Byron Donalds has launched his campaign and received an endorsement from former President Trump. Other potential Republican candidates include Florida First Lady Casey DeSantis, former U.S. Rep. Matt Gaetz, and Lt. Governor Jeanette Nuñez. On the Democratic side, former U.S. Representative David Jolly has announced his candidacy. State senator Jason Pizzo also announced he will run as an independent. Florida's primary election is scheduled for August 18, 2026, with the general election on November 3, 2026.\n\nAs of early June 2025, Miami Mayor Francis Suarez has publicly stated he is considering a run for governor. A poll conducted by The James Madison Institute in May 2025 showed Suarez with 5% support in the Republican primary field. In local politics, the Miami City Commission was set to vote on a proposal to move the city's November election to 2026, which would extend the terms of current commissioners and Mayor Suarez by one year.\n\nHistorically, in the last two open Florida gubernatorial cycles (2018 and 2022), major candidates typically announced their campaigns 12 to 18 months before the primary election. For the 2026 cycle, some contenders, such as Republican Byron Donalds and Democrat David Jolly, had already announced their candidacies by early June 2025. Reports note that as of early June, there have been no leaks of a launch date, no exploratory committee paperwork filed by Suarez, and no scheduled kickoff events for a gubernatorial campaign.",

    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "About 25 days (until 11:59pm ET on June 30, 2025)",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Suarez continues to float a run and fundraise for allies but does not formalize anything in June; with Trump backing Byron Donalds and no clear lane or infrastructure in place, he opts to wait past July 1 (or not run).",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Suarez quickly assembles a launch (video + Miami presser), files/announces a state committee, and tries to grab early-summer attention and Q2 fundraising before the holiday weekend, positioning himself as a metropolitan, Latino Republican alternative.",
    "rationale": "- Timing: Florida’s 2026 primary is Aug 18, 2026—14.5 months out, which sits inside the common 12–18 month announcement window. That makes a June 2025 launch plausible in principle.\n- Current signals: As of early June, there are no leaks of a launch date, no exploratory/committee paperwork, no scheduled kickoff events, and only a modest 5% in a May GOP primary poll. Those are weak near-term indicators for a June announcement.\n- Competitive landscape: Byron Donalds is already in and has Trump’s endorsement, which likely deters late-breaking rivals and donors. Other potential GOP contenders (Casey DeSantis, Jeanette Nuñez, Matt Gaetz) further cloud Suarez’s lane. This environment lowers the incentive to rush a June launch.\n- Incentives to announce soon: A June announcement could help capture Q2 fundraising and fit the historical window. Suarez has shown a willingness to launch splashy bids (e.g., 2023 presidential run), so a quick-turn rollout is feasible if he chooses.\n- Weighing the evidence: The status quo favors inaction over the next ~3.5 weeks, given the absence of groundwork and a consolidated rival with Trump’s backing. However, the open window and Suarez’s past behavior keep the chance above a very low single digit.\n- Why not higher: No preparatory signals; weak polling; adverse endorsement dynamics; local term/municipal timing considerations reduce urgency.\n- Why not lower: The timing window is live; Suarez is publicly weighing the race; he could execute a fast, media-forward launch.\n- What would move me up: Any report of staff hires, committee filings, venue holds/media invites, donor meetings signaling an imminent launch, or Suarez stating a June decision. What would move me down: Public hints of waiting until later in summer/fall, further GOP consolidation behind Donalds, or Suarez explicitly punting the decision beyond July 1.",
