  "information": "A lobbying scandal involving Huawei has led to a probe by Belgian prosecutors. On June 5, 2025, EPP MEP Fulvio Martusciello was arrested in connection with the investigation. Authorities have also requested that the parliamentary immunity be lifted for at least four other MEPs. The Parliament's Committee on Legal Affairs was expected to vote on these immunity waivers in mid-June, with the full plenary potentially confirming the decision during its session from June 16-19. Citing the precedent set during the 'Qatargate' scandal, major political groups like the EPP, S&D, and Renew have signaled zero-tolerance positions on corruption.\n\nHistorically, the 705-seat European Parliament sees between 80 and 120 replacements over a five-year term, which averages to approximately 1-2 departures per month. This turnover can be due to a variety of reasons, including appointments to national posts, retirement, scandals, or health issues. The rate of departures is often higher during the first year of a new parliamentary term. Precedents from previous scandals are mixed; while events like 'Qatargate' did lead to resignations, some indicted MEPs, such as Eva Kaili and Marc Tarabella, resisted calls to step down for several months while legal proceedings were ongoing.\n\nResignations from the European Parliament frequently occur when a sitting MEP is appointed to a ministerial position within their national government. Following elections in several member states, new governments were in the process of being formed. Specifically, after the May 18 elections in Portugal, there were rumors that at least two MEPs were being considered for cabinet positions in the new government. Other countries, including Germany, the Netherlands, and Belgium, also had fluid political circumstances that could lead to cabinet reshuffles.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "26 days",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No members of the European Parliament resign in the specified timeframe.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "The MEPs implicated in the Huawei scandal, including the arrested Fulvio Martusciello, follow the precedent of some 'Qatargate' figures and refuse to resign while legal proceedings unfold. Simultaneously, any appointments of MEPs to national government positions in countries like Portugal are either not confirmed or are announced after the July 1 deadline. No other MEP resigns for personal or health reasons within the short 21-day resolution window.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Under immense pressure from their political group (EPP) following the arrest and with the threat of parliamentary immunity being lifted for others, at least one of the MEPs implicated in the Huawei scandal resigns before July 1. Alternatively, following recent national elections, a sitting MEP from a country like Portugal is appointed to a ministerial role in their new government and announces their resignation from the European Parliament.",
    "rationale": "My forecast is based on the convergence of three distinct potential drivers for a resignation within the short 21-day window (June 10-June 30, 2025). The primary driver is the ongoing Huawei lobbying scandal. The arrest of MEP Fulvio Martusciello on June 5 and the request to lift immunity for four others creates significant political pressure. Political groups, citing a 'zero-tolerance' policy, will likely push for quick resignations to manage the reputational damage at the very start of a new parliamentary term. The parliamentary vote on immunity waivers is scheduled for mid-June, fitting perfectly within the resolution window and acting as a likely catalyst. The second driver is the formation of new national governments. After recent elections, at least two MEPs are reportedly being considered for cabinet posts in Portugal. Such appointments are a common reason for resignation. The third factor is the baseline turnover rate of 1-2 MEPs per month for various reasons (health, personal, etc.). While this is a short window, the probability of a 'random' resignation is not zero. The combined probability of a resignation from at least one of these causes is substantial. The probability is not higher because the timeframe is very narrow, and legal and political processes can face delays. As seen in the 'Qatargate' scandal, accused MEPs may resist calls to resign for months. Furthermore, rumors of national appointments may not materialize within the required period. The probability is not lower because for a 'No' outcome, all of these potential triggers would need to fail simultaneously, which seems less likely than at least one of them occurring. I would increase my forecast upon confirmed reports of a party expelling an implicated MEP or a definitive announcement of an MEP's impending cabinet appointment. I would decrease it if the implicated MEPs publicly state their intention to fight the allegations without resigning, or if there are procedural delays pushing the immunity votes into July.",
