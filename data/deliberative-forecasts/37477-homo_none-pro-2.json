    "review": "My initial forecast of 25% was too low. The other two forecasters provided a critical argument I had underweighted: the power of compounding a daily probability over the 23-day window. Forecaster 3's probability of 68% seems too high, as their assumed 5% daily chance of a 'clean' day underestimates the persistence of a presidential signature economic policy, especially in the Wall Street Journal. Forecaster 2's analysis was the most compelling. Their method of creating a simple quantitative model with differentiated daily probabilities for weekdays (1%) versus weekends/holidays (5%) is a more robust approach than my initial qualitative assessment. Crucially, Forecaster 2 raised a specific point I had missed: the period includes the Memorial Day holiday weekend, a time when the hard news cycle typically slows, which measurably increases the probability of a 'Yes' outcome.",
    "rationale": "I am significantly increasing my forecast from 25% to 43%. My initial reasoning correctly identified the high salience of tariffs as the main driver for a 'No' outcome but failed to properly quantify the chance of a successful day occurring over the 23-day period. The other forecasters, particularly Forecaster 2, convinced me that my qualitative approach was insufficient.\n\nThe primary reason for my update is the adoption of a quantitative model similar to Forecaster 2's. Their logic of assigning a low but non-zero probability to a 'clean' day and then compounding that over the entire period is sound. I find their estimates of a 1% chance on a typical weekday and a 5% chance on a weekend or holiday to be reasonable. These figures acknowledge the topic's persistence while allowing for the volatility of the news cycle. Applying these probabilities over the 23-day window (which includes 15 weekdays and 8 weekend/holiday days including the Memorial Day weekend) yields a cumulative probability of approximately 43%. This represents a more rigorous and defensible position than my initial, more intuitive forecast.",
