    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Approximately 33 days (from May 29, 2025 to July 1, 2025)",
    "status_quo_outcome": "Without access to the January 2025 Morning Consult data, the status quo is uncertain. However, if current relative standings remain stable over the next month, that would likely be the outcome on July 1, 2025.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Erdoğan maintains or increases his approval rating advantage over Sánchez through July 1, 2025. This could occur if Turkey's economic situation stabilizes, Erdoğan handles any domestic or international events favorably, or if Sánchez faces political challenges in Spain such as coalition tensions, corruption allegations, or unpopular policy decisions that further erode his support.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Sánchez's approval rating surpasses Erdoğan's by July 1, 2025. This could happen if Spain's economy performs well, Sánchez successfully navigates political challenges, or if Turkey experiences economic difficulties, significant protests, or other events that damage Erdoğan's standing. Additionally, any domestic scandals or policy failures in Turkey could reduce Erdoğan's approval while Sánchez remains stable or improves.",
    "rationale": "This forecast faces significant uncertainty because my research assistant provided no information about current approval ratings from January 2025 or subsequent months. Without knowing the starting positions, I must rely on historical patterns and general knowledge. Historically, Erdoğan has maintained approval ratings generally in the 40-55% range, while Sánchez has typically been in the 30-45% range, though both have experienced fluctuations. The short timeframe (approximately one month) suggests the status quo is likely to persist, as approval ratings rarely change dramatically over such brief periods. However, both leaders operate in volatile political environments. Erdoğan faces ongoing economic challenges in Turkey including inflation concerns, while Sánchez leads a coalition government in Spain that faces its own political pressures. Without current data, I cannot confidently predict which leader currently holds the advantage. My forecast of 42% reflects this substantial uncertainty while incorporating a slight lean toward historical patterns where Erdoğan has often maintained relatively strong approval compared to many European leaders. This forecast would increase if I learned that Sánchez currently has a higher rating or if Turkey faces significant negative developments. It would decrease if data showed Erdoğan with a substantial lead or if Spain experiences major political crises.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill Spanish Prime Minister Pedro Sánchez have a higher approval rating than Turkey's President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan on July 1, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nResolution source updates monthly. According to Morning Consult for January 2025: \"The latest approval ratings are based on data collected from Jan. 21-27, 2025. Ratings reflect a trailing seven-day simple moving average of views among adults in each country surveyed.\"\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if Pedro Sánchez has a higher approval rating than Recep Tayyip Erdoğan according to [Morning Consult](https://pro.morningconsult.com/trackers/global-leader-approval) when checked by Metaculus on or after July 1, 2025. If this not the case (including due to a tie), this resolves as **No**.\n\n\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nNo additional information available.\n\nToday is 2025-05-29.\n\nBefore answering you think:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n(e) You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
