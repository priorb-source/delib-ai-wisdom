  "information": "Y Combinator (YC) is launching its inaugural AI Startup School in San Francisco on June 16-17, 2025. The event is a free conference intended for 2,000 top AI students, researchers, and recent graduates, with YC offering up to $500 for travel expenses. The program's goal is to shape the next generation of AI startups by focusing on entrepreneurship, product building, and fundraising. YC has announced that Sam Altman and Elon Musk are among the event's headline speakers.\n\nSam Altman and Elon Musk co-founded OpenAI in 2015 as a non-profit foundation, with Musk providing significant initial funding. Musk left the organization in 2018 citing disagreements with Altman and the company's direction. After OpenAI was re-launched as a for-profit entity, Musk filed a lawsuit alleging a violation of the original non-profit principles. Their public rivalry has also included a hostile, unsolicited $97.4 billion takeover bid for OpenAI led by Musk, which Altman publicly dismissed, and reported competition for influence over U.S. government AI projects.\n\nIn May 2025, news reports indicated that Sam Altman had made conciliatory gestures towards Elon Musk. Altman reportedly wrote to Musk proposing a collaboration on the development of artificial general intelligence (AGI) and extended an 'olive branch.' While Musk had not publicly responded to the written offer, reports mentioned that informal contacts had occurred between the technical teams of their respective organizations. Separately, Altman publicly posted on social media to Musk, stating, 'AGI is too important, can't let petty grudges get in the way.'",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "The outcome will be known by the end of the conference on June 17, 2025, with a final resolution date of July 1, 2025. This is approximately 5 weeks from now.",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No. The default expectation is that two speakers with a significant public rivalry, including an active lawsuit and a hostile takeover bid, will be given separate, non-overlapping stage time.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Sam Altman and Elon Musk both deliver their headline speeches or participate in panels at separate times during the conference. The event organizers schedule them on different days or in different sessions to manage their public disagreement, and they do not share the stage at any point.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Leveraging its unique position and the context of nurturing the next generation of AI leaders, Y Combinator successfully brokers a joint appearance. Following Altman's recent conciliatory gestures, Musk agrees to a moderated discussion on stage, focusing on a shared vision for the future of AGI.",
    "rationale": "My forecast leans heavily on the status quo, which points to a 'No' outcome. The public and acrimonious history between Sam Altman and Elon Musk, which includes Musk's lawsuit against OpenAI and a hostile takeover attempt, creates a very strong barrier to a voluntary joint appearance. Typically, high-profile speakers with such conflicts are handled with care by event organizers to avoid incident, meaning separate scheduling is the standard procedure. However, I am assigning a non-trivial 25% probability to a 'Yes' outcome due to several key factors that challenge the status quo. First, the report of Sam Altman's recent 'olive branch' and his public statement that 'AGI is too important' for grudges is a significant new development. It signals a willingness to publicly reconcile from at least one side. Second, the host, Y Combinator, is a highly influential entity with deep ties to both individuals, particularly Altman, its former president. YC has a strong incentive to create a landmark moment for its inaugural AI conference and may be uniquely positioned to mediate. Third, the context of the event—shaping the next generation of AI leaders—provides a powerful narrative for a public reconciliation. My forecast is not higher than 25% primarily because Musk has not publicly reciprocated Altman's outreach, and the active lawsuit remains a major practical and symbolic obstacle. For the forecast to increase, I would need to see a positive public response from Musk, the lawsuit being dropped, or credible reports of a planned joint session. My forecast is not lower than 25% because Altman's public gesture is a clear attempt to change the dynamic, and the possibility of a surprise, high-drama reconciliation brokered by YC cannot be dismissed given the personalities and stakes involved.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill Sam Altman and Elon Musk be on the stage together at YC AI Startup School?\n\nQuestion background:\nY Combinator is an American venture capital firm known for launching over 5,000 companies including Airbnb, Stripe, and Reddit. In 2025, Y Combinator announced AI Startup School, a conference in San Francisco held on June 16–17, aimed at 2,000 final-year students and recent graduates in computer science, artificial intelligence, and related fields.&#x20;\n\nY Combinator has announced that both Sam Altman and Elon Musk are among the headline speakers at the AI Startup School, but it is unknown whether they will appear on stage together at the same time.\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question will resolve as Yes if Sam Altman and Elon Musk share a stage together at YC AI Startup School after 7:59 AM, June 16, 2025, and before 00:00 AM, June 18, 2025. Otherwise, this question will resolve as No.\n\nSharing a stage is defined as both individuals being physically present on the same platform at the same time.&#x20;\n\nThis question will resolve according to a preponderance of evidence. If there is no clear evidence of this occurring before July 1, 2025, this question will resolve as No.\n\nAll times for this question are in Pacific Daylight Time (PDT).  &#x20;\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nY Combinator (YC) is launching its inaugural AI Startup School in San Francisco on June 16-17, 2025.

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
