  "information": "The U.S. Supreme Court unanimously ruled that Kilmar Abrego Garcia's deportation was unlawful and ordered the Trump administration to 'facilitate' his return. Subsequently, U.S. District Judge Paula Xinis ordered the administration to explain its diplomatic efforts with El Salvador regarding his return and set deadlines for the government to provide information and documents. An earlier court-ordered deadline for Garcia's return of April 7, 2025, passed without compliance.\n\nThe Trump administration has publicly resisted the court orders. President Trump stated the case is 'in the hands of lawyers' but also claimed he 'could' have Garcia returned with a single phone call but would not, citing alleged MS-13 gang affiliations. The Department of Homeland Security acknowledged the initial deportation was an 'administrative mistake'. Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem stated that if Garcia were to return to the U.S., he would be immediately deported again.\n\nKilmar Abrego Garcia was deported to El Salvador around March 15, 2025, and is being held in a maximum-security prison. The President of El Salvador, Nayib Bukele, has publicly labeled Garcia a 'terrorist' and has stated that he will not be released or returned to the United States. U.S. Senator Chris Van Hollen traveled to El Salvador to demand Garcia's release from prison, but reported that the U.S. embassy in El Salvador had not received instructions to assist in the matter.",

    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "About 61 days (until July 1, 2025)",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "El Salvador keeps Garcia in maximum-security detention and refuses release; the U.S. administration continues resisting court orders, provides only minimal diplomatic gestures, and no transfer logistics (travel documents, flight arrangements) are put in place before July 1.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Court pressure and political costs spike, prompting real U.S. diplomatic engagement; El Salvador quietly agrees to expel or parole Garcia to U.S. custody, allowing him to land at a U.S. port of entry (even if he is immediately detained and re-deported).",
    "rationale": "Time is short, the executive is resisting, and El Salvador is publicly opposed. The Supreme Court’s unanimous ruling requires the U.S. to facilitate his return, and a district judge is monitoring compliance, but the April 7 court deadline already passed without action—signaling slow-walking. Garcia is reportedly in a Salvadoran maximum-security prison, with President Bukele labeling him a terrorist and saying he will not be released or returned. The administration has stated it would immediately deport him if he did arrive. All of this makes a return before July 1 unlikely absent a sharp change. Status quo favors No: international custody cases with hostile counterparties and an uncooperative home executive almost never resolve in weeks. Why not lower? A nonzero chance remains because a unanimous Supreme Court decision raises legal and political pressure; courts could escalate (e.g., contempt, daily reporting, mandated steps), producing real diplomatic movement. The U.S. could also use leverage (aid, visas, public concessions), and El Salvador could decide it is preferable to expel him to the U.S. to shift responsibility. Any such resolution would count as Yes even if followed by immediate removal. Why not higher? The combination of (1) firm Salvadoran opposition, (2) explicit U.S. executive resistance, and (3) the extremely short runway to arrange release, travel documents, and transport from a maximum-security facility keeps the base probability low. What would move me up: concrete reports of Salvadoran willingness to release/expel; issuance of Salvadoran or U.S. travel documents; transfer from max security to a staging facility; court orders with enforceable remedies (e.g., contempt with personal sanctions) and evidence of executive compliance; clear instructions to the U.S. embassy to facilitate return. What would move me down: additional Salvadoran legal actions extending detention; U.S. court signals narrowing remedies or accepting minimal compliance; further public hardening by both governments; evidence that logistics (docs/flight) cannot be completed before July.",

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
