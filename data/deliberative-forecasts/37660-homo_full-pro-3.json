    "review": "The other two forecasters and I have reached a strong consensus on the key factors driving this forecast. We all agree that while Starlink received an initial license, the more recent information from March 2025 regarding unresolved national security demands and regulatory system delays are the critical issues. Both forecasters correctly highlight that the government's requirement for data interception is a major hurdle and that discussions were still at a 'preliminary stage' just a few months before the deadline. They also correctly identify the missed April 2025 launch projection as a powerful signal that official timelines are unreliable and obstacles are significant. Their use of the Starlink-Pakistan situation as an analogue for protracted delays over security concerns was a useful framing that reinforced my own thinking. Their reasoning is highly convincing, as it is based on the same core evidence and leads to a similar conclusion: a 'Yes' outcome is unlikely.",
    "rationale": "My initial forecast was 30%. After reviewing the analyses of the other forecasters, I am lowering my probability to 25%. While my peers did not introduce new evidence, the deliberation process highlighted the combined weight of the negative signals. Specifically, their emphasis on two points convinced me to become slightly more pessimistic: 1) The description of the national security talks as 'preliminary' as late as March 23, 2025, implies a very long road to resolution, making a pre-July 1 agreement highly improbable. 2) The missed April 2025 launch deadline is a concrete piece of evidence that the process is already stalled by these issues. The short timeframe of approximately 45 days is insufficient to overcome what appear to be fundamental disagreements on national security policy and concurrent bureaucratic delays (the 'dashboard system'). The status quo is one of delay, and the evidence suggests this will continue past the resolution date. I am therefore aligning with the more bearish forecast of 25%, as it better reflects the significant inertia and the low likelihood of a swift resolution.",
