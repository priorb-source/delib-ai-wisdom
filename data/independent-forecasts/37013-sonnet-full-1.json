  "information": "The composition of the Cornwall Council prior to the 2025 election consisted of 44 seats for the Conservatives, 13 for the Liberal Democrats, 4 for Labour, 1 for Reform UK, and 1 for the Greens, with the remainder held by others or independents. This represents a 31-seat lead for the Conservatives over the Liberal Democrats. Historically, the Liberal Democrats have never been the largest party on the Cornwall Council.\n\nNational polling data shows the Conservative party with a 22% approval rating, while Reform UK is polling at 25% and the Liberal Democrats at approximately 14-16%. In the 2024 UK general election, the Liberal Democrats regained the constituencies of North Cornwall and St Ives. Political analyst Professor John Curtice has noted that the surge in support for Reform UK is likely to split the right-wing vote, which could indirectly benefit the Liberal Democrats.\n\nFor the 2025 election, the Liberal Democrat party has launched a significant fundraising effort, including a £100,000 fund, and is fielding a near-full slate of candidates. An Electoral Calculus MRP poll has been cited in analyses of the election. On the Conservative side, several high-profile councillors announced their retirement, including the council leader Linda Taylor.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Approximately 2-3 weeks. The 2025 Cornwall Council election is scheduled for early May 2025, with results expected shortly after polling day on May 1, 2025.",
    "status_quo_outcome": "The Conservatives remain the largest party on Cornwall Council. Before the election, they held 44 seats compared to the Liberal Democrats' 13 seats - a commanding 31-seat advantage. The Lib Dems have never historically been the largest party on Cornwall Council.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "The Conservatives retain enough seats to remain the largest party despite losses, or Reform UK/independents win the plurality. The Conservative vote base remains consolidated enough in their stronghold wards, or Reform UK's rise translates into seat wins that prevent the Lib Dems from achieving plurality despite Conservative losses.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "The Liberal Democrats capitalize on Conservative collapse, Reform UK splits the right-wing vote without winning many seats themselves, and the Lib Dems convert their 2024 Westminster momentum (winning North Cornwall and St Ives) into local gains. Their near-full slate of candidates and £100,000 fundraising effort enables them to gain 20+ seats while Conservatives lose heavily to both Lib Dems and Reform UK, allowing Lib Dems to overcome the 31-seat deficit.",
    "rationale": "The status quo strongly favors a No outcome. The Conservatives hold a 31-seat advantage (44 vs 13), and the Liberal Democrats have never been the largest party on Cornwall Council. Overcoming this deficit would require an unprecedented swing. While there are favorable factors for the Lib Dems - Conservative national approval at 22%, Reform UK at 25% splitting the right-wing vote, high-profile Conservative retirements including council leader Linda Taylor, and Lib Dem momentum from winning two Westminster constituencies in 2024 - these must be weighed against the sheer magnitude of seats needed. To win plurality, Lib Dems would likely need 30+ seats of roughly 87 total, requiring them to more than double their representation. Even with Conservative collapse, Reform UK likely wins some seats themselves rather than all Conservative losses flowing to Lib Dems. The Lib Dems' strong local campaign (near-full slate, significant fundraising) and traditional strength in Southwest local elections provide some upside, but the historical precedent and mathematical challenge remain formidable. My forecast is not higher because the seat deficit is simply enormous and no MRP poll details suggesting a Lib Dem plurality have been provided. It's not lower because the combination of Conservative weakness, Reform rise, and Lib Dem local strength creates a non-negligible possibility of an upset in what appears to be an exceptional political moment.",
