  "information": "Protests have been ongoing in Turkey since the arrest of Istanbul Mayor Ekrem İmamoğlu on March 19, 2025, on corruption charges. Reports from various news outlets cited turnouts in the hundreds of thousands. The Republican People's Party (CHP) claimed that over 2 million people participated in a protest in Istanbul on March 29. The party announced plans for continued protests. Following the initial wave of demonstrations, Turkish authorities detained 1,133 people between March 19 and March 23. In response to the protests, nearly 1,900 people, including journalists, had been rounded up by late March.",

    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Approximately 55 days until July 1, 2025",
    "status_quo_outcome": "Large protests are reported to be occurring in Turkey but it is uncertain whether the Global Protest Tracker has documented them or will document them before the deadline",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "The Global Protest Tracker fails to report any Turkish protest with 10,000+ participants before July 1, 2025, either because the database has not been updated to include the recent large protests, because their methodology does not capture these events, or because protest activity diminishes below the 10,000 threshold",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "The Global Protest Tracker reports at least one protest in Turkey with 10,000+ participants before July 1, 2025, most likely by documenting the ongoing protests that began in March 2025 following Mayor İmamoğlu's arrest, which have reportedly drawn hundreds of thousands of participants",
    "rationale": "The research assistant reports significant ongoing protests in Turkey since March 19, 2025, with multiple events drawing hundreds of thousands of participants according to news outlets, and the CHP claiming over 2 million participants on March 29. The critical factor is not whether large protests occurred, but whether the Global Protest Tracker has documented or will document them before July 1. Strong evidence suggests Yes: (1) Multiple credible reports of very large protests well exceeding 10,000 participants; (2) The protests are significant enough to warrant a Wikipedia page and massive government crackdowns with nearly 1,900 detentions; (3) The CHP announced plans for continued protests, suggesting sustained scale; (4) There are still 55 days for the Tracker to update its database. However, uncertainty remains because: (1) Database updates can lag real-time events; (2) We don't have confirmation the Tracker has already captured these March protests; (3) The Tracker may have specific methodologies that could exclude certain events; (4) The government crackdown could suppress future large gatherings. The status quo strongly suggests large protests are occurring and likely to continue, and with nearly two months remaining, it is probable the Tracker will capture at least one event meeting the criteria. My forecast is not higher (85-90%) because of uncertainty about the Tracker's update frequency and methodology. It is not lower (60-65%) because the scale of reported protests is so large and well-documented that exclusion seems unlikely. I would update higher with confirmation the Tracker has already documented these events or evidence of continued large-scale protests. I would update lower if the Tracker shows no Turkish protests despite the deadline approaching, or if protest activity significantly diminishes.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill the Global Protest Tracker report any protests in Turkey (Türkiye) with 10,000+ participants, before July 1, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nWikipedia: [2025 Turkish protests](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2025_Turkish_protests)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if the [Global Protest Tracker](https://carnegieendowment.org/features/global-protest-tracker?lang=en) reports a protest in Turkey (Türkiye) with 10,000 or more participants with a start date after the launch of this question and before July 1, 2025.\n\nPlease note that the Global Protest Tracker uses the name Türkiye in its database.\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nProtests have been ongoing in Turkey since the arrest of Istanbul Mayor Ekrem İmamoğlu on March 19, 2025, on corruption charges.

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
