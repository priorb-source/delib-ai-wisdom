    "review": "The other two forecasters presented compelling and well-structured arguments that have convinced me to revise my forecast. Their shared core argument, anchoring the forecast on the median rollout time of ~16 weeks for other African nations, is a crucial piece of quantitative reasoning I had previously underweighted. This median falls just after the July 1 deadline (at 15.5 weeks), providing a strong statistical basis for a forecast below 50%. I also found Forecaster 3's point about the operational prerequisites for updating the map—that Starlink waits until payment and shipping logistics are fully ready—to be a particularly sharp insight. This adds another potential layer of administrative and logistical delay that I had not fully considered, strengthening the case for a 'No' outcome. My initial optimism was based too heavily on the outlier case of Niger's same-day launch and the potential of the new Airtel partnership, without sufficiently accounting for the more probable, slower timeline suggested by the central tendency of the data and Chad's specific logistical challenges.",
    "rationale": "I am lowering my forecast significantly from 60% to 45%. The primary reason for this change is the persuasive analysis from my colleagues, particularly their emphasis on the median rollout timeline of approximately 16 weeks derived from regional precedents. With the resolution deadline falling at 15.5 weeks, a forecast below 50% is more statistically sound. My initial forecast overweighted the positive signals—such as the rapid Niger launch and the new Airtel partnership—and did not adequately account for the specific frictions Chad faces as a landlocked country with potential for administrative delays in finalizing import rules and other details.\n\nThe 45% probability reflects a revised view that the outcome is slightly more likely to be 'No' than 'Yes'. It acknowledges that while a rapid, sub-15-week rollout is possible (as seen in the DRC), it is not the most probable scenario according to the available base rates. I am not lowering my forecast further to match the consensus of ~40% because I maintain a slightly higher weighting on the potential for the new Airtel partnership to accelerate the ground logistics in a way that makes the historical benchmarks slightly less predictive. However, the core of my thinking has shifted to align with a more conservative, data-anchored perspective.",
