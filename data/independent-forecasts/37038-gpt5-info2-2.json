  "information": "The US is Israel's largest trading partner, with bilateral trade valued at $34 billion in 2024. The two countries have a 40-year-old free trade agreement. On April 1, 2025, the Israeli government announced the immediate cancellation of all its remaining tariffs on U.S. imports. Following the US tariff announcement, Israeli Economy Minister Nir Barkat stated that officials from both countries are optimistic about reaching a new trade agreement before the suspension period expires on July 9, 2025. Ongoing discussions also aim to address the trade deficit between the nations.",

    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "About 38 days (until June 1, 2025)",
    "status_quo_outcome": "Yes — the HTS continues to show a 17% duty for Israel through early June",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "A US–Israel deal restores preferential IL rates (Free) before June 1, or the measure is rescinded/paused, and the HTS is updated in time so Israel no longer shows 17% at the applicable subheadings on or before Metaculus’s check.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "The temporary suspension of Israel’s FTA preferences remains in force into June, and the USITC HTS continues to display a 17% rate (or a clearly denoted +17% additional duty applicable to Israel) when checked on or after June 1.",
    "rationale": "Baseline: Historically, the US–Israel FTA yields Free rates for most industrial goods, so the long-run status quo would be No. However, the research assistant notes an April 2025 US tariff announcement affecting Israeli exports and a defined suspension window through July 9, 2025, with Israel responding by eliminating its own remaining tariffs on US imports on April 1. If accurate, the near-term operative status quo is that a 17% rate applies and is intended to persist into July unless a new agreement is reached sooner. Given bureaucratic timing and typical HTS update cycles, once such a change is posted it usually remains until a formal action reverses it. That suggests a higher likelihood that a 17% entry will still be present on June 1.\nKey uncertainties lowering confidence: (1) It is unusual for the US to impose a flat, across-the-board 17% rate; implementation could be via Chapter 99 additional duties rather than replacing the IL “Special” rate. While the HTS often surfaces such additional duties in-line, there is a chance the site’s presentation does not clearly show “+17% for Israel” at the applicable subheadings in a way that meets this question’s criterion. (2) Rapid de-escalation: If negotiations conclude faster than expected, a proclamation could restore IL Free rates before June 1, and the USITC could update the HTS accordingly. (3) Political/legal reversal: domestic political pushback or legal constraints could narrow or suspend the measure before June.\nWhy not higher: Non-trivial chances of an early diplomatic deal, ambiguous HTS presentation (e.g., duties shown only through Chapter 99 notes), or a delayed/partial posting that doesn’t meet the precise criterion reduce the probability from the 80–90% range.\nWhy not lower: The RA indicates a defined suspension period ending July 9 and active negotiations targeting that date. If the measure is already announced/implemented, inertia and update lags make it likely to still be visible on June 1.\nWhat would move me up: Clear confirmation that the USITC HTS currently displays “IL 17%” (or an explicit +17% additional duty tied to Israel) across applicable subheadings, with effective dates extending beyond June 1; credible reports that no interim agreement will be reached before mid-June.\nWhat would move me down: A joint US–Israel announcement of a new deal effective before June 1; a Presidential proclamation restoring IL Free rates with an effective date in May; or USITC posting a revision removing the 17% before June 1. Also, evidence that any 17% measure is administered entirely outside the HTS display used for resolution.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill the US government's harmonized tarifff schedule list the tariff on Israel as 17% on June 1, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nTimes of Israel: [Israeli exports to US will take annual $2.3B hit under tariffs, industrial org warns](https://www.timesofisrael.com/israeli-exports-to-us-will-take-2-3-billion-hit-under-tariffs-industrialist-org-warns/)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if the duty provided in the applicable subheading is + 17% for Israel at the American government's [harmonized tariff schedule](https://hts.usitc.gov/search?query=israel) when accessed by Metaculus on or after June 1, 2025.\n\nWhether the provision is listed as suspended will not affect resolution.\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nThe US is Israel's largest trading partner, with bilateral trade valued at $34 billion in 2024.

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
