  "information": "According to public statements, François Villeroy de Galhau, a member of the European Central Bank (ECB) council, indicated there is room for gradual interest rate reductions as inflation approaches the central bank's 2% target. The ECB has implemented seven interest rate cuts since mid-2024, lowering the benchmark deposit rate to 2.25% as of its April 2025 meeting. ECB President Christine Lagarde has noted that future policy decisions will be data-dependent, citing 'unprecedented uncertainty'. A report from Qatar National Bank (QNB) stated that the ECB is expected to continue its interest rate cutting cycle in 2025, driven by a weak economic outlook for the Euro Area and stabilized inflation.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Approximately 2-5 days. April 2025 inflation data for the Euro Area is typically released in early May, and since today is April 28, 2025, the official data should be published imminently.",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No - inflation will be at or below 2.2%",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Inflation continues its trajectory toward the ECB's 2% target, with April 2025 data showing headline inflation between 1.8-2.2%, reflecting the weak economic outlook, continued disinflation pressures, and the impact of seven interest rate cuts since mid-2024. The downward revisions seen in February 2025 continue into April.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Unexpected supply-side pressures, energy price spikes, or temporary factors cause April inflation to tick up above 2.2%, representing a temporary deviation from the general downward trend. This could result from seasonal adjustments, food price increases, or services inflation proving stickier than anticipated.",
    "rationale": "The evidence strongly suggests inflation will be below 2.2% in April 2025. Key factors supporting this view: (1) The ECB has implemented seven rate cuts since mid-2024, bringing the deposit rate to 2.25%, indicating confidence that inflation is under control; (2) Officials like Villeroy de Galhau indicate inflation is approaching the 2% target with room for further rate cuts; (3) February 2025 saw downward revisions to eurozone inflation; (4) QNB reports the ECB will continue cutting rates due to weak economic outlook and stabilized inflation - weak growth typically suppresses price pressures. The threshold of 2.2% sits only 0.2 percentage points above the ECB's target. If inflation were running above 2.2%, the ECB would not be pursuing such an aggressive easing cycle. Monthly inflation data can exhibit volatility from temporary factors like energy prices or seasonal adjustments, which prevents me from assigning an even lower probability. For my forecast to move higher, I would need evidence of: unexpected supply shocks, energy price spikes, or early data leaks suggesting April inflation exceeded expectations. For it to move lower, I would need: preliminary estimates showing inflation well below 2%, or additional ECB commentary emphasizing continued disinflation progress.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill the Euro Area Inflation Rate be above 2.2% for April 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nEuro News: [Euro falls as eurozone inflation sees downward revisions in February](https://www.euronews.com/business/2025/03/19/euro-falls-as-eurozone-inflation-sees-downward-revisions-in-february)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below.

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
