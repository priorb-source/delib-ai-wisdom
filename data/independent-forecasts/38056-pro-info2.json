The reason provided for the withdrawal was an injury. Walker's official Wikipedia page was also updated to reflect his withdrawal from the event.",

    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Approximately 2.5 months (assuming a hypothetical event date of August 9, 2025).",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Johnny Walker's withdrawal due to injury is confirmed, and he does not fight Azamat Murzakanov at UFC 316. The UFC officially finds a replacement opponent for Murzakanov or removes the bout from the card.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "The initial reports of Johnny Walker's withdrawal are reversed. His injury is revealed to be minor, he is cleared to compete, and the UFC officially re-books the fight against Azamat Murzakanov for UFC 316. Walker must then win this re-instated fight.",
    "rationale": "My forecast is overwhelmingly driven by the research provided, which indicates that Johnny Walker has withdrawn from the fight due to injury. This has been reported by multiple reliable MMA news outlets and is reflected on his Wikipedia page. The resolution criteria are very specific: for a 'Yes' outcome, not only must the fight happen as scheduled, but Walker must also be the victor. Given the announced withdrawal, the status quo is that the fight is cancelled. In the world of MMA, once a fighter officially withdraws from a bout due to injury, it is exceedingly rare for that decision to be reversed for the same event. The UFC typically moves quickly to find a replacement or reschedule the remaining fighter for a future card. Therefore, the probability of the necessary precondition for a 'Yes' vote – the fight itself taking place – is extremely low.\n\nMy forecast is not 0 because there remains a marginal, non-zero possibility that the reports were premature, the injury was misdiagnosed, or a series of unusual events leads to the fight being re-booked. However, this is a highly improbable scenario.\n\nMy forecast is not higher because that would require dismissing credible, multi-sourced reports of the fight's cancellation. A higher probability would imply a significant chance of the withdrawal being reversed, which is contrary to standard UFC operating procedure.\n\nI would significantly increase my forecast if the UFC or Walker's official camp were to announce that the withdrawal was reported in error and the fight is officially proceeding. Conversely, my confidence in the 'No' outcome would increase to near-certainty if the UFC formally announces a replacement opponent for Murzakanov.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill Johnny Walker defeat Azamat Murzakanov at UFC 316?\n\nQuestion background:\nPlease see [UFC Stats](http://ufcstats.com/fight-details/dab807a99d295832) for statistical details of the two opponents.\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if Johnny Walker defeats Azamat Murzakanov at [UFC 316](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UFC_316).\n\nIf Walker does not fight anyone at UFC 316 or fights someone else, this resolves as No.\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nMultiple news outlets, including RotoWire on May 6, 2025, and MMA Fighting on May 9, 2025, reported that Johnny Walker had withdrawn from his scheduled bout against Azamat Murzakanov at UFC 316. The reason provided for the withdrawal was an injury. Walker's official Wikipedia page was also updated to reflect his withdrawal from the event.\n\nToday is 2025-05-26.\n\nBefore answering you think:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n(e) You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
