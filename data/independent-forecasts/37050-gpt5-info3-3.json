  "information": "The broader US stock market is experiencing significant volatility driven by corporate earnings, trade policy uncertainty, and economic indicators. President Trump's tariffs sparked a 2,200-point drop in the DJIA on April 4, 2025. In response to the impact of tariffs, Deutsche Bank strategists cut their year-end S&P 500 target by 12%. The Federal Reserve is described as cautious due to persistent inflation.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "About 67 days (until July 1, 2025)",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "S&P Dow Jones Indices makes no membership changes to the DJIA before July 1, 2025; no constituent faces a merger, delisting, or restructuring that compels immediate replacement; the committee opts for stability after multiple 2024 changes.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "S&P Dow Jones Indices announces a swap before July 1, 2025—for example, replacing a lagging or less-representative component (e.g., Verizon, IBM, Cisco, 3M, Boeing) with a firm seen as more representative of the U.S. economy (e.g., Alphabet or another large-cap growth name), or reacting to a major corporate action (merger/spin-off) that necessitates removal. The announcement alone before July 1 would resolve Yes even if effective later.",
    "rationale": "Base rate: DJIA membership changes are infrequent but not rare. Over the past decade there have been roughly 5–6 change events (2013, 2015, 2018, 2020, and twice in 2024), implying ~0.5 events/year. Over a ~2.2-month window, a Poisson approximation yields ~8% odds of at least one change. Recent context: The index already saw notable turnover in 2024 (Intel replaced by NVIDIA; Walgreens replaced by Amazon), which slightly lowers near-term hazard—committees often avoid back-to-back tweaks absent a compelling catalyst. Known catalysts: I see no imminent, public corporate actions among current constituents (e.g., mergers, breakups, delistings) that would force a change before July 1. While Boeing’s issues, 3M’s underperformance, and legacy telecom/tech representation (Verizon, IBM, Cisco) are perennial candidates for speculation, there’s no concrete trigger on the calendar. Sector representation is broadly balanced after 2024 adjustments. Price-weight dynamics and extremely high-priced potential additions (e.g., Meta) also reduce the likelihood of abrupt adds unless preceded by a split. Research assistant’s note: Elevated macro volatility, tariff shocks, and cautious Fed do not typically drive DJIA membership decisions; the committee focuses on representation and corporate actions, not market swings. Why not higher: Lack of clear, time-bound catalysts; very short time horizon; multiple recent changes in 2024 reduce urgency. Why not lower: The committee can act without warning; one change is enough to resolve Yes; there are plausible replacement narratives (e.g., adding Alphabet) if the committee decides representation needs updating. What would move me up: Credible reporting or S&P Dow Jones Indices commentary about contemplated changes; a major constituent corporate event (spin-off, merger, split) that affects index construction; rumors from reputable outlets (WSJ, Bloomberg) naming specific replacements. What would move me down: Passing of key decision windows without chatter; explicit statements from the index provider signaling preference for stability; confirmation that no imminent corporate actions are pending among constituents.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill any of these companies get dropped from the Dow Jones Industrial Average before July 1, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nOregon Business: [Intel Ousted From Dow Jones By Rival Nvidia](https://oregonbusiness.com/intel-ousted-from-dow-jones-by-rival-nvidia/)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if before July 1, 2025, there is any official announcement or confirmation (or credible source reporting) that any of the following companies will no longer be a component of the Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA) either on the official announcement or that the company has been or will be removed from the index: Amazon.com Inc, American Express Co, Amgen Inc, Apple Inc, Boeing Co, Caterpillar Inc, Cisco Systems Inc, Chevron Corp, Goldman Sachs Group Inc, Home Depot Inc, Honeywell International Inc, International Business Machines Corp, Johnson & Johnson, Coca-Cola Co, JPMorgan Chase & Co, McDonald’s Corp, 3M Co, Merck & Co Inc, Microsoft Corp, Nike Inc, Procter & Gamble Co, Sherwin-Williams Co, Travelers Companies Inc, Unitedhealth Group Inc, Salesforce Inc, NVIDIA Corp, Verizon Communications Inc, Visa Inc, Walmart Inc, Walt Disney Co.\n\nAlthough removals from the index are generally effective immediately in order to forestall frontrunning, this is not a requirement for this question. All that is required is for there to be an announcement or confirmation before the resolution date about the removal from the DJIA at any point in time. Therefore this question will resolve based on the announcement or confirmation, not on the actual removal date.\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nThe broader US stock market is experiencing significant volatility driven by corporate earnings, trade policy uncertainty, and economic indicators. President Trump's tariffs sparked a 2,200-point drop in the DJIA on April 4, 2025. In response to the impact of tariffs, Deutsche Bank strategists cut their year-end S&P 500 target by 12%. The Federal Reserve is described as cautious due to persistent inflation.\n\nToday is 2025-04-25.\n\nBefore answering you think:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n(e) You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
