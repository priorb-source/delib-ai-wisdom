    "status_quo_outcome": "No phone call has occurred yet in the qualifying period (since May 12, 2025)",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Trump and Zelenskyy do not speak by phone during this period because Trump prefers other communication channels, uses intermediaries for Ukraine discussions, or diplomatic tensions prevent direct communication. Alternatively, Zelenskyy may be engaged in other priorities or the two leaders simply don't have an urgent need requiring a phone conversation in this specific 33-day window.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Developments in the Ukraine-Russia war require direct presidential-level communication. This could involve discussions about military aid packages, peace negotiations, urgent battlefield situations, or coordination on diplomatic initiatives. Given Trump's stated interest in ending the war and the US's role as Ukraine's primary supporter, a phone call occurs as part of routine diplomatic engagement or in response to a specific event.",
    "rationale": "With 33 days remaining in the forecast window, I need to assess the likelihood of at least one phone call between these two heads of state. Several factors are relevant: First, Ukraine remains in active conflict with Russia, and the US under Trump is presumably still a major stakeholder. This creates natural pressure for regular high-level communication. Second, Trump took office in January 2025 and would have established some pattern of engagement with Zelenskyy by now - if they haven't spoken in the first few days of the qualifying period, this might indicate either infrequent contact or a preference for other communication methods. Third, Trump's historical relationship with Ukraine is complex, involving his first impeachment and criticism of aid levels, which could reduce call frequency compared to other presidents. However, as sitting president dealing with an active war, complete avoidance seems unlikely. The 33-day window is substantial enough that routine diplomatic engagement would normally produce at least one call. Against this, Trump is known for unconventional diplomatic approaches and might use in-person meetings, envoys, or other channels. The research assistant provided no additional information about recent contact patterns. My forecast is not higher because: Trump's unique approach to Ukraine, the possibility of alternative communication methods, and the specific nature of their relationship introduce significant uncertainty. My forecast is not lower because: 33 days is a reasonable timeframe, the ongoing war creates genuine need for coordination, and complete communication avoidance between a US president and Ukrainian president seems unlikely during active conflict. I would update higher if reports emerged of scheduled diplomacy or urgent developments requiring communication. I would update lower if reports suggested Trump is deliberately avoiding direct contact or using only intermediaries.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill Donald Trump and Volodymyr Zelenskyy speak on the phone with each other before June 15, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nSky News: [Key moments that have shaped Trump and Zelenskyy's relationship](https://news.sky.com/story/trump-and-zelenskyys-relationship-from-perfect-phone-call-to-oval-office-clash-13331892)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if, after May 12, 2025 and before June 15, 2025, Donald Trump and Volodymyr Zelenskyy speak on the phone with each other, according to [credible sources](https://www.metaculus.com/faq/#definitions).\n\nBoth sides must acknowledge the phone call took place for it to count. \"Speak on the phone with each other\" is defined as both individuals, from different physical spaces, orally uttering words intended for the other individual into a telephone or equivalent device, those words being converted into electrical or digital signals in real time, and then transferred to the other individual via telecommunications links, where they are reconverted into sound waves at the other individual's listening device.\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nNo additional information available.\n\nToday is 2025-05-13.\n\nBefore answering you think:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n(e) You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
