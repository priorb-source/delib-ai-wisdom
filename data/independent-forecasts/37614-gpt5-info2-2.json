  "information": "A recall election for Brent Metz is scheduled for May 20, 2025, after a recall petition was successfully certified. The election is being conducted by mail, and ballots were sent to voters in late April 2025. Mountain View is a small town with a population of approximately 500-600 residents and fewer than 400 active voters. No public polling data on the recall election is available.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "About 8–10 days (election May 20, 2025; results likely on election night or within 1–2 days due to Colorado’s mail-ballot process).",
    "status_quo_outcome": "Metz retains his seat (recall fails).",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Voter backlash over the shooting allegation drives high turnout against Metz; recall proponents convert their petition energy into votes, and a majority votes to remove him.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Metz benefits from incumbency and local ties; enough voters accept his explanation/self-defense framing or view the recall as overreach. Turnout is average-to-low or composition skews toward his supporters, so the recall fails.",
    "rationale": "- Baseline/status quo: Incumbents generally have an edge, and in very small electorates personal networks and inertia can matter. Starting point would be modestly above 50% for retention in the absence of strong contrary factors.\n- Contravening factors: The triggering incident is severe (accused of shooting a teen in the face). Local recalls that make the ballot tend to succeed more often than they fail because the opposing side has already demonstrated organization and salience by qualifying the petition. The small electorate (fewer than 400 active voters) means motivated opposition can readily prevail.\n- Mail-ballot dynamics: Colorado’s all-mail process typically yields solid turnout even in off-cycle contests, which reduces the incumbent’s ability to rely on apathy. If recall proponents remain motivated, this likely helps them more than it helps him.\n- Lack of polling: With no public polling, uncertainty is high. In such small towns, outcomes hinge on a few dozen votes and local reputations. The fact that the recall advanced to an election signals nontrivial opposition.\n- Net assessment: I start near 55% for retention (status-quo bias), then adjust down substantially for the seriousness of the allegation and the fact the recall qualified (−10 to −15), and a bit more for mail-ballot turnout dynamics (−5). I add back a small amount (+3) for small-town incumbency and personal networks. That yields roughly 40% for retention.\n- Why not higher: The severity and salience of the allegation, plus an organized recall effort and likely decent turnout, make retention less likely than not.\n- Why not lower: He’s still the incumbent in a very small electorate where personal relationships can outweigh headlines; without polling, there’s meaningful chance the community rallies behind him or views the recall as premature.\n- What would move me up: Evidence of strong public endorsements for Metz from respected local figures, positive local press, visible yard-sign advantage for him, favorable early ballot-return patterns from his known supporter base, or legal developments that credibly bolster his account.\n- What would move me down: New damaging reporting or legal developments, high early turnout driven by recall organizers, or visible community mobilization against him (events, endorsements, or clear sign of opposition enthusiasm). The research assistant’s key inputs—mail-ballot timing, tiny electorate, and no polling—reinforce the high-variance but opposition-favored setup.",
