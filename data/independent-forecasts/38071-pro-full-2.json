  "information": "Six Democrats are running in the June 17 primary for Virginia lieutenant governor: Alex Bastani, State Sen. Ghazala F. Hashmi, Babur B. Lateef, State Sen. Aaron R. Rouse, Victor Salgado, and former Richmond Mayor Levar Stoney. While the candidates agree on many core policies, such as repealing Virginia's right-to-work law and increasing the minimum wage, they differ on specific issues like gaming and education. Rouse, a former Virginia Beach City Council member, has sponsored legislation to strengthen protections for renters and to create a regulatory framework for the state's recreational cannabis market. Stoney has positioned himself as both business-friendly and committed to helping families. Hashmi, a former professor, highlights her six years of experience in the Senate.\n\nAccording to campaign finance records reported around May 1, 2025, Levar Stoney led the six-candidate field in fundraising, having raised approximately $1.4 million. State Senators Aaron Rouse and Ghazala Hashmi were also among the fundraising leaders. In late May, Carl Eggleston, a former candidate for lieutenant governor and the first African American to be elected to the Farmville Town Council, endorsed Levar Stoney, citing his executive experience. Reports also indicate Stoney has the backing of several Richmond-area elected officials, while Rouse has support from labor and progressive-issue groups.\n\nAn internal poll conducted for the Levar Stoney campaign in March 2025 showed Stoney leading the primary field with 16% support, followed by Aaron Rouse at 10%, and Ghazala Hashmi at 8%; 63% of voters were undecided. Geographically, Rouse's political base is in the Hampton Roads area (Virginia Beach/Norfolk), while Stoney's is in the Richmond metro area. Northern Virginia represents the largest voting bloc in the primary but does not have a candidate from the region.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Approximately 3 weeks, with the primary scheduled for June 17, 2025.",
    "status_quo_outcome": "Based on the available polling and fundraising data, Levar Stoney is the marginal frontrunner. Therefore, if nothing changed, the status quo outcome would be 'No' for Aaron Rouse winning.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Levar Stoney leverages his fundraising advantage and support from the Richmond political establishment to consolidate undecided voters, particularly in Northern Virginia. Stoney wins the crowded primary with a plurality, preventing an Aaron Rouse victory.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Aaron Rouse's campaign effectively mobilizes his base in the populous Hampton Roads region and uses support from labor groups to run a strong get-out-the-vote operation. Ghazala Hashmi splits the vote with Levar Stoney in Central Virginia, allowing Rouse to win with a plurality by making inroads with undecided voters across the state.",
    "rationale": "This is a competitive six-way Democratic primary where the winner will likely secure a plurality, not a majority, of the vote. The most significant factor is the March 2025 internal poll for the Stoney campaign, which showed 63% of voters were undecided. This indicates a highly fluid race where any of the top-tier candidates has a path to victory. Levar Stoney currently holds a small advantage, leading in fundraising as of May 1 and in that single internal poll (16% Stoney, 10% Rouse, 8% Hashmi). This makes him the slight favorite. However, Aaron Rouse is also a top-tier fundraiser and has a strong political base in the Hampton Roads area, a key source of Democratic primary votes. Furthermore, his support from labor and progressive groups could be crucial for turnout in the final days. The presence of two strong candidates from the Richmond area (Stoney and Hashmi) could divide the vote in that region, potentially benefiting Rouse. My forecast of 35% reflects that Rouse is a very strong contender with a clear path to victory, but he is not the current frontrunner based on the limited public data. The probability is not higher because Stoney leads in the key metrics of fundraising and polling. It is not lower because Stoney's lead is small and the race is exceptionally volatile due to the massive number of undecided voters, making an upset plausible. I would increase my forecast if new, independent polling shows Rouse closing the gap or if he lands a major endorsement from Northern Virginia. I would decrease it if Stoney's lead solidifies in new polls or if he significantly outpaces Rouse in the final fundraising reports.",
