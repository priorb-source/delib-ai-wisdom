  "information": "During his first presidential term, Donald Trump did not grant any clemencies during the month of June in any of the four years. For his second term, a May 28, 2025, report from the Washington Times indicated that Trump has signaled more pardons could be forthcoming, including for two men convicted in the plot to kidnap Michigan Governor Gretchen Whitmer. A White House official was also quoted stating the President has come to the aid of political supporters and donors and has expressed sympathy for allies caught in the judicial system.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "About 32 days (until June 30, 2025; confirmation likely by early July via public disclosures)",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Trump issues zero or only one or two clemencies in June (e.g., just the two Whitmer-plot defendants) or delays a larger wave until a symbolic date like July 4.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "A batch action in June: the Whitmer-plot pair plus at least one more ally; or a broader June action (e.g., a group of Jan. 6 defendants or a blanket/criteria-based clemency) announced around a symbolic date like June 14 (his birthday), Juneteenth, or after late-June Supreme Court rulings.",
    "rationale": "Baseline: In Trump’s first term he granted no clemencies in any June, and most of his mass clemency activity clustered around late-year or high-visibility moments. That history, plus the general tendency for most months to see few or no clemencies, makes the status quo outcome a No. \nCountervailing factors: The Washington Times (May 28, 2025) reporting that Trump has signaled more pardons are forthcoming—specifically including the two Whitmer-plot convicts—raises the near-term probability of some June clemency action. Trump often acts in batches, so conditional on acting, the chance of doing more than two in a single tranche is non-trivial. The White House posture (per the report) that he aims to aid supporters/donors and allies in the judicial system also supports the prospect of broader actions (e.g., Jan. 6 cases). Additionally, late-June Supreme Court decisions could create a political moment for announcements. Symbolic June dates (June 14 birthday, Juneteenth) provide plausible timing hooks. \nWhy not higher: Several reasons keep this below 50%. First-term June inactivity suggests low base-rate seasonality. The specific float of clemency for the two Whitmer-plot men could materialize as exactly two, which would not meet the threshold. Trump may also prefer the optics of a July 4 rollout for broader or blanket clemencies. \nWhy not lower: Trump’s demonstrated willingness to use clemency for allies, recent public signaling of more to come, and his tendency to issue multiple grants at once argue for a meaningful chance that a June action exceeds two. \nWhat would move me up: Credible reporting of an imminent June batch/blanket action; leaks of prepared warrants; a White House schedule note or on-record official previewing a June clemency event; early-June grants of 1–2 that indicate a larger list is being processed; a favorable late-June SCOTUS decision that the White House links to justice-system overreach. \nWhat would move me down: Signals that decisions are being timed for July 4 or later; public pushback that causes a pause; indications that only the two Whitmer-plot grants are planned for now; competing priorities dominating the June calendar.",

They will only count if publicly disclosed. Wide-reaching blanket pardons or commutations also count.\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nDuring his first presidential term, Donald Trump did not grant any clemencies during the month of June in any of the four years.

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
