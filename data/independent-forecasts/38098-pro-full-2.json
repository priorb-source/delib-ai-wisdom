  "information": "Incumbent Republican Senator Lindsey Graham, in office since 2003, has commenced his 2026 re-election campaign. He has secured endorsements from prominent party figures, including former President Donald Trump, Governor Henry McMaster, and Senator Tim Scott. On the Democratic side, Dr. Annie Andrews, a pediatrician who ran for a House seat in 2022, announced on May 29, 2025, that she would be a candidate in the 2026 Senate race.\n\nAccording to news reports from February and March 2025, U.S. Representative Ralph Norman is \"seriously considering\" a run for Governor of South Carolina in 2026, when the incumbent will be term-limited. Several outlets, including The State, Roll Call, and Politico, have noted that Norman's office has denied any plans for a Senate run. Norman has officially filed for his own House re-election.\n\nAs of late May 2025, there was no publicly available evidence of preparatory activities for a Senate campaign by Ralph Norman. Reports indicated an absence of actions typically preceding a major campaign launch, such as filings with the Federal Election Commission (FEC) for a statement of candidacy, the formation of an exploratory committee, significant staff hires, or major donor activity. The official filing period for the 2026 South Carolina primary does not open until the spring of 2026.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Approximately 1 month (the question resolves on July 1, 2025).",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No. Rep. Norman has not declared his candidacy and his focus appears to be elsewhere.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Rep. Norman continues to focus on his House re-election and his exploration of a 2026 gubernatorial run. The July 1, 2025 deadline passes without any announcement from him regarding a Senate candidacy.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "A sudden, major political event occurs, such as a significant scandal involving Sen. Graham or immense pressure from key donors, causing Norman to abruptly pivot from his gubernatorial considerations and hastily declare a Senate candidacy in June 2025.",
    "rationale": "My forecast is based on the overwhelming evidence that Rep. Norman is not preparing for a Senate run and the extremely short time frame before the question resolves. The key factors supporting a 'No' outcome are: 1) Timing: There is only one month until the deadline. Launching a primary challenge against a powerful incumbent like Lindsey Graham requires extensive preparation, none of which has occurred. 2) Lack of groundwork: There are no public indicators of a nascent campaign, such as FEC filings, an exploratory committee, key staff hires, or significant fundraising efforts. 3) Stated intentions: Norman's office has explicitly denied plans for a Senate run, and multiple news outlets report he is 'seriously considering' a run for Governor, a more politically viable path as the incumbent is term-limited. 4) Incumbent strength: Sen. Graham has already secured endorsements from former President Trump and other key South Carolina Republicans, presenting a formidable challenge. My probability is not lower than 2% because unforeseen events in politics can cause rapid shifts, and a surprise announcement, while highly improbable, cannot be entirely ruled out. My forecast is not higher because the complete absence of any preparatory action and the explicit denials make a 'Yes' outcome an extreme long shot within the next month. I would increase my forecast if there were any credible reports of Norman hiring campaign staff for a Senate run, filing with the FEC, or publicly walking back his denials. Conversely, an official announcement for a gubernatorial run would cause me to lower this forecast even further.",
