  "information": "As of early May 2025, Republika Srpska (RS) has taken several legislative and political steps. A draft for a new constitution, which includes rights to self-determination and provisions for confederal relationships, completed its public consultation phase in mid-April 2025. The RS government has also passed laws to ban Bosnia's central judicial, police, and intelligence agencies from operating within its territory. Milorad Dodik, the leader of RS, has stated he is willing to declare independence if the central authorities, with international support, attempt to take control of RS property. Similarly, Nenad Stevanović, President of the RS Parliament, warned that continued pressure would lead to a declaration of independence, stating that RS is a functional entity capable of implementing its decisions independently.\n\nInternational reactions to the political situation in Republika Srpska are varied. The U.S. and EU have expressed strong opposition to secession, with a U.S. envoy labeling RS's proposals as \"secession by another name.\" The U.S. Embassy in Sarajevo has warned that disobeying the decisions of Bosnia's Constitutional Court, such as celebrating the banned January 9th holiday, may constitute a criminal offense. In contrast, Croatian Prime Minister Andrej Plenković has expressed support for Bosnia and Herzegovina's EU membership while voicing concern over secessionist rhetoric from RS, warning that delays in EU integration could allow Russia and China to increase their influence. Russia has appeared supportive of moves by RS, and a Russian military documentary film festival was scheduled to take place in Banja Luka in May 2025.\n\nHistorical and legal precedents provide context for a potential referendum. Bosnia's Constitutional Court has ruled on multiple occasions that celebrating Republika Srpska Day on January 9 is unconstitutional. Despite this, RS held a parade for the banned holiday in January 2025. Analysis of other independence movements shows varying timelines: the process for Catalonia's 2017 referendum took approximately 7-8 months from legislative groundwork to the announcement, while Scotland's 2014 referendum process took about 2 years. In contrast, Crimea's 2014 referendum, under Russian influence, was organized in about two weeks. The political structure of Bosnia and Herzegovina is based on the 1995 Dayton Agreement, which divided the country into two entities: the Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina and Republika Srpska.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "60 days remaining until July 1, 2025 (today is May 2, 2025)",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No - no official referendum date is announced",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Republika Srpska continues its political maneuvering and rhetorical escalation but stops short of officially scheduling a referendum. International pressure from the US and EU serves as a deterrent, and Dodik uses the referendum threat primarily as a negotiating tactic rather than following through. The 60-day window proves too short for finalizing such a momentous decision despite the legislative groundwork being laid.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Building on recent legislative actions (the draft constitution completing public consultation in mid-April and laws banning central authorities), RS leadership escalates by officially announcing a referendum date. This could be triggered by a crisis with the central government, emboldened by Russian support, or Dodik's domestic political calculations. The Crimea precedent demonstrates a referendum can be scheduled in as little as two weeks, making this timeline technically feasible.",
    "rationale": "The status quo strongly favors No. While Republika Srpska has been actively escalating through legislative means and rhetorical threats, actually announcing a referendum date represents a significant threshold to cross with serious international consequences. The research shows substantial US and EU opposition, with warnings of criminal consequences for defying the Constitutional Court. Historical precedent is mixed: most independence referendums (Scotland, Catalonia) took many months to years from groundwork to announcement, though Crimea's Russian-backed referendum was organized in two weeks. The current situation shows RS has laid considerable groundwork - the draft constitution finished public consultation in mid-April, laws have been passed to exclude central authorities, and leadership statements indicate willingness to pursue independence. However, 'willingness' and rhetorical threats differ from actually scheduling a referendum. Dodik has used secessionist rhetoric as a negotiating tool before. The 60-day timeframe is quite short. For me to update higher, I'd need to see concrete referendum preparations, weakening international opposition, or specific timeline announcements from RS leadership. For me to update lower, I'd need to see de-escalation, successful international pressure, or dialogue initiatives. The probability accounts for the volatile situation and active escalation while giving substantial weight to the status quo and the significant barriers to such an announcement.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nBefore July 1, 2025, will the government of Republika Srpska officially announce a date for an independence referendum?\n\nQuestion background:\nFair Observer: [Balkan Tinderbox: How Russia’s Moves Could Reignite Bosnia](https://www.fairobserver.com/politics/balkan-tinderbox-how-russias-moves-could-reignite-bosnia/)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if, before July 1, 2025, a referendum on the independence of Republika Srpska from Bosnia and Herzegovina is officially scheduled. If this does not occur before that date, this question resolves as **No**.\n\nFor purposes of this question, the referendum will be considered \"officially scheduled\" when it is announced by a person or entity with the authority to do so within Republika Srpska. Please note that broader legality, such as within Bosnia and Herzegovina, will be considered irrelevant for this question, so if the Bosnian government declared the referendum illegal, the question would still resolve as Yes.\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nAs of early May 2025, Republika Srpska (RS) has taken several legislative and political steps.
