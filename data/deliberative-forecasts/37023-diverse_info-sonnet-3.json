    "review": "Both forecasters provide valuable insights. Forecaster 2 introduces specific recent negative developments I hadn't detailed: Volkswagen surcharges, price increases from major retailers (Temu/Shein/Hermès), Moody's retail downgrade, and post-tariff equity selloffs. The seasonal gasoline price pattern (firming into late spring) is a structural headwind I overlooked. Forecaster 3 makes a crucial point about the 'fourth consecutive monthly decline' - I noted the extreme reading but underweighted the momentum aspect. The characterization of pessimism as 'pervasive and unanimous' suggests deeper entrenchment than a single shock. All three of us converge around 40-46%, recognizing both the extreme starting point (creating mean reversion potential) and substantial negative momentum. The specific recent price announcements are particularly important - these materialize tariff concerns into concrete consumer impacts, keeping the negative news cycle active into the May survey period.",
    "rationale": "After reviewing both analyses, I'm adjusting downward slightly. The key new information is the emphasis on sustained negative momentum (fourth consecutive decline) rather than a single bad reading, plus concrete recent negative catalysts (price hikes from major brands, Moody's downgrade, equity selloffs) that will be fresh during the May survey period. The seasonal gasoline price pressure adds another structural headwind. These factors suggest the negative environment is more entrenched than I initially weighted. However, I'm not moving much lower because: (1) we remain at near-historic lows where mean reversion is statistically likely, (2) the 50.8 threshold is extremely low - any small uptick clears it, (3) consumer sentiment remains inherently volatile, and (4) the index has limited downside from current levels. The balance of evidence suggests continued weakness is more probable, but the extreme starting point and low bar prevent this from being a high-confidence 'No' forecast. I'm moving from 42% to 40% to reflect the stronger negative momentum evidence while maintaining that a bounce remains plausible.",
