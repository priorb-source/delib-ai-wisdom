    "review": "Both forecasters rightly emphasize the tie-as-No rule and the razor-thin margin, which I had down-weighted. I find Forecaster 2’s point about cross-pollster Mexican numbers (76–82%) less probative for Morning Consult specifically, though the general honeymoon argument is fair. Forecaster 3’s citation of a negative Milei image poll (non-MC) is a useful signal of potential headwinds, even if house effects limit its direct translation to MC. I agree with both that Morning Consult tends to be sticky with 1–2 point week-to-week noise, making a 1-point edge fragile and increasing tie risk. Where I’m less convinced is the expectation of a Sheinbaum uptick; MC’s January-to-April drift was downward, so I see her near 60 as the base. Conversely, Milei’s macro narrative could help but is offset by volatility and political risk. Net, I buy a modest shift downward from my prior, but not below 50%, given the latest MC comparison still has Milei narrowly ahead.",
    "rationale": "Time horizon (~45 days) and MC’s weekly cadence imply limited room for large moves; week-to-week shifts are typically 1–2 points. The latest cited MC snapshot (Apr 30) had Milei 61 vs Sheinbaum 60, after earlier January levels of 65 vs 66. Both appear to have converged near ~60–61. The tie-as-No rule materially matters when the spread is 1 point. I’m not persuaded by cross-pollster Mexican highs as a basis for an MC rebound, but early-term stability around 60 for Sheinbaum is reasonable. For Milei, disinflation and reform headlines could maintain him near 60–61, but Argentine politics remain volatile and other polls hint at softer sentiment. Balancing: (1) small current edge for Milei, (2) high tie risk, (3) modest negative drift risk for Milei vs stable-to-flat Sheinbaum, I lower my estimate modestly. I’m moving from 58% to 53%. I would move up if MC prints in early/mid-June show Milei ≥2 points ahead; I would move down if we see a tie or Sheinbaum ≥ Milei in the next update(s), or headlines that clearly dent Milei’s standing.",
