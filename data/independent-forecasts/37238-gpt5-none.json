    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Approximately 4–6 months, resolving on the date of UFC 316 once the event occurs",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "UFC 316 is scheduled outside the U.S. (e.g., Abu Dhabi) or at a time that conflicts with a presidential trip/crisis, leading him to skip attending the venue entirely",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "UFC 316 is held in Las Vegas or Miami with a marquee card; Dana White publicly invites him and the schedule is clear, so he attends and is present on venue grounds",
    "rationale": "- Baseline and recent behavior: Trump has a visible, recurring pattern of attending UFC PPVs, often in Miami, Las Vegas, or New York, including very recently as sitting president (per the cited NYT report about a Miami UFC event on Apr 13, 2025). That shows attendance is feasible even with presidential security constraints.\n- Base rate: The UFC runs roughly a dozen numbered PPVs per year. Historically, Trump appears at a minority of them—approximately 1–3 per year in recent years—implying a per-event attendance probability well below 50% in the absence of specific location/card news.\n- Event-specific uncertainty: The date and location of UFC 316 were not provided. If 316 lands in a favored location (Vegas/Miami/NYC) and features a high-profile headliner, odds rise. If it’s abroad or in a logistically challenging city/date, odds fall sharply.\n- Status quo weighting: Most numbered UFC events in a year do not feature a presidential appearance. Without concrete signals (official schedule hints, Dana White teases, location confirmation), the default remains No.\n- Why not higher: Unknown location/date; 316 is not a milestone event; presidential schedule and security concerns can easily preclude attendance on any given weekend.\n- Why not lower: Strong relationship with Dana White, demonstrated willingness to attend as president, and a track record of multiple UFC appearances in recent years, especially at Vegas/Miami cards.\n- What would move me up: Confirmation that UFC 316 is in Las Vegas or Miami with a marquee main event; credible reports/teases of his planned attendance; a presidential schedule placing him nearby that weekend.\n- What would move me down: Announcement that UFC 316 is abroad or in a less likely city; a conflicting major domestic/foreign commitment (e.g., UNGA week, state visit, crisis) or security advisories.\n- Research assistant: No additional information provided beyond the NYT background link, so the forecast leans on base rates and recent attendance patterns.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill Donald Trump attend UFC 316?\n\nQuestion background:\nNew York Times: [Trump and Some of His Cabinet Members Attend U.F.C. Fight in Miami](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/13/us/politics/trump-ufc-fight-reyes.html)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if President Donald Trump is anywhere within the grounds of the venue where [UFC 316](https://www.ufc.com/event/ufc-316) takes place. Otherwise this resolves as **No**.\n\n\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nNo additional information available.\n\nToday is 2025-04-30.\n\nBefore answering you think:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n(e) You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
