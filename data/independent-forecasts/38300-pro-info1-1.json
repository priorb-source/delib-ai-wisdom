  "information": "Recent data for the US Industrial Production Index (INDPRO) shows accelerating year-over-year (YoY) growth through early 2025: -0.2% in January, +0.45% in February, +0.85% in March, and +1.49% in April. The April rebound was largely driven by a 1.2% increase in oil extraction and a 2.2% rise in oil processing. In contrast, civil non-energy processing industries have seen a persistent decline since the beginning of the year, averaging a 0.7% monthly fall between January and April.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "About two weeks, as the data for May 2025 is expected to be released around June 15, 2025.",
    "status_quo_outcome": "Yes. The most recent data for April 2025 showed accelerating positive year-over-year growth of +1.49%. A continuation of this trend would result in a 'Yes' outcome.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "A sharp, negative shock in May reverses the recent trend. This could be driven by a significant disruption or price drop in the energy sector, or a severe acceleration of the decline in civil non-energy processing industries, pulling the overall year-over-year growth figure below zero.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "The positive momentum from prior months continues into May. Strong performance in the energy sector, which has been the primary driver of recent growth, continues to outweigh the persistent weakness in other industrial areas, keeping the overall year-over-year growth above zero.",
    "rationale": "My forecast is primarily based on the strong positive momentum observed in the most recent data. The year-over-year growth for the US Industrial Production Index has been accelerating in early 2025, from -0.2% in January to +1.49% in April. This provides a significant buffer, meaning May would have to be an exceptionally weak month to pull the year-over-year figure into negative territory. This continuation of the recent trend forms the status quo outcome, which I weight heavily. \n\nThe primary source of this growth, as noted by my research assistant, is the energy sector, specifically oil extraction and processing. This sustained strength is the main pillar of the 'Yes' scenario. \n\nHowever, I am not forecasting a higher probability because this growth is not broad-based. The persistent decline in civil non-energy processing industries, averaging a 0.7% monthly fall from January to April, represents a significant vulnerability. The index's reliance on the volatile energy sector means my forecast is susceptible to sudden shifts in commodity prices or geopolitical events affecting production. A sharp drop in oil prices or a major production disruption in May could easily erase the recent gains. \n\nConversely, my forecast is not lower because economic data series like industrial production exhibit inertia. A complete reversal from +1.49% YoY growth to negative growth in a single month is a high bar and would require a substantial negative shock, which is a lower probability event than a continuation of the trend. \n\nI would increase my probability if leading indicators for May, such as the ISM Manufacturing PMI, were to show unexpected strength, or if weekly energy production data remained robust. I would decrease my probability if the PMI showed a sharp contraction or if there were reports of significant industrial disruptions or a collapse in energy prices during May.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill monthly US Industrial production have positive year-over-year growth for May 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nThe Real Economy Blog: [Industrial production index hits record high amid tariffs](https://realeconomy.rsmus.com/industrial-production-index-rises-to-record-amid-tariffs/)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if the monthly number displayed at FRED [Industrial Production: Total Index (INDPRO)](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/INDPRO#) for year-over-year growth is greater than 0.0 for May 2025, when checked by Metaculus on or after June 15, 2025.\n\nWhen accessing the data, ensure settings are Units: Percent Change from Year Ago, Seasonally Adjusted and Frequency: Monthly. For example, the number for April 2025 was 1.48803 as of May 27, 2025.\n\nSince the numbers presented by FRED are expected to be preliminary numbers from the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, please note that subsequent revisions to the number will not cause this question to re-resolve.\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nRecent data for the US Industrial Production Index (INDPRO) shows accelerating year-over-year (YoY) growth through early 2025: -0.2% in January, +0.45% in February, +0.85% in March, and +1.49% in April.

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
