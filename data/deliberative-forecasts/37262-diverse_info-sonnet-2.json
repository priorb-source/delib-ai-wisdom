    "review": "Forecaster 3 introduces critical new information I lacked: specific planned protests including a farmers' march targeting 10,000 participants and TMC rallies. This is highly relevant and pushes probability upward from my initial assessment. However, Forecaster 2 raises an excellent counterpoint I underweighted: the Global Protest Tracker's selectivity and reporting lag. The fact that April's violent protests (with 3 deaths) haven't yet appeared in GPT is a telling negative signal about the tracker's inclusion criteria and update frequency. Forecaster 2's emphasis on GPT as the key bottleneck rather than whether protests occur is more sophisticated than my initial analysis. Forecaster 3's 70% seems overconfident given GPT's selectivity, while Forecaster 2's 35% may underweight the concrete planned events mentioned. The truth likely lies between these positions.",
    "rationale": "Upon reflection, I should update upward from my initial 40% based on Forecaster 3's information about specific planned protests (farmers' march, TMC rallies). These aren't hypothetical scenarios but concrete organizing efforts that increase the probability of qualifying events occurring. However, Forecaster 2's insight about GPT's selective reporting is crucial and prevents me from updating too high. The April protests with fatalities not appearing in GPT demonstrates that meeting the size threshold doesn't guarantee inclusion. The resolution depends on THREE conditions: (1) a protest occurring, (2) reaching 10k+ participants, and (3) GPT documenting it. Condition 3 is the primary bottleneck. With specific planned events, I increase confidence in conditions 1-2, but GPT's demonstrated selectivity tempers optimism. The 2-month window amplifies GPT's update lag risk. Balancing the concrete planned events (pushing up) against GPT's reporting filter (pushing down), I update to slightly below 50-50 odds.",
