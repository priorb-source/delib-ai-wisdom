    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "25 days",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No. As of today, June 5, 2025, no official announcement has been made by the Uruguayan government regarding President Orsi's attendance. If no announcement is made by the July 1 deadline, the question resolves as No.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "The government of Uruguay, after internal deliberation, decides that presidential attendance is not in the country's best interest at this time, possibly to avoid sending a strong signal that might alienate Western partners like the US or EU. Alternatively, they may decide to send a lower-level representative (e.g., the Foreign Minister), which would not satisfy the resolution criteria. The deadline could also pass without any formal announcement due to administrative oversight or shifting domestic priorities.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "The Uruguayan Ministry of Foreign Affairs or the President's office issues a formal press release in the coming weeks confirming that President Yamandú Orsi has accepted President Lula's invitation and will travel to Rio de Janeiro to attend the BRICS summit in July. This would be framed as an opportunity to deepen ties with key economic partners and strengthen regional cooperation.",
    "rationale": "The primary driver for this forecast is the strong political alignment between Uruguay's President Yamandú Orsi of the left-wing Frente Amplio coalition and Brazil's President Lula. This shared political orientation makes accepting an invitation from a key regional ally the default and expected course of action. Accepting is a low-cost way to signal a foreign policy shift towards pragmatic engagement with non-traditional partners, consistent with Uruguay's long-term strategy of diversifying its international relationships. Furthermore, declining a direct invitation from Brazil, Uruguay's powerful neighbor and a crucial partner in Mercosur, would be a significant diplomatic slight with potential negative repercussions. The main argument against a 'Yes' resolution is the short timeframe; with only 25 days left, the lack of an announcement is notable and introduces uncertainty. It could signal hesitation or a decision to send a different representative. However, diplomatic announcements for summit attendance can often occur within this timeframe. Therefore, the fundamental political and diplomatic incentives strongly suggest an announcement of attendance is more likely than not. My forecast is not higher because the approaching deadline without confirmation is a non-trivial piece of evidence against. It could be that internal debate is ongoing or the trip is a lower priority. My forecast is not lower because the political and diplomatic costs of not announcing attendance are high, making it the less likely outcome.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill the government of Uruguay announce that its president, Yamandú Orsi, will attend the BRICS summit in July 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\n[Lula invites Mexico, Colombia, and Uruguay to BRICS Summit](https://en.mercopress.com/2025/03/04/lula-invites-mexico-colombia-and-uruguay-to-brics-summit#google_vignette) | [Uruguay’s participation at the BRICS summit still up in the air](https://www.plenglish.com/news/2025/03/02/uruguays-participation-at-the-brics-summit-still-up-in-the-air/)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if before July 1, 2025 the government of Uruguay, or anyone speaking on its behalf, issues any sort of public communication (written or oral) confirming its acceptance of the invitation for President Yamandú Orsi to attend in person the BRICS Summit scheduled to take place in Rio de Janeiro in July 2025.\n\nSince the summit will be held after this question resolves, actual attendance is not required, merely the announcement of plans to attend.\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nNo additional information available.\n\nToday is 2025-06-05.\n\nBefore answering you think:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n(e) You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
