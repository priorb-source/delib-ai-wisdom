    "review": "Both forecasters reinforced the key points: strong status quo/incentives, brittle “every day” requirement, and regulatory uncertainty centered on Nevada/CFTC. They added a useful emphasis on the compounding risk of a perfect 30‑day streak and the tiny tail risk of an MLB off-day (very unlikely in June). They also converged on the idea that an adverse Nevada ruling is more likely to lead to geoblocking than a nationwide halt. No new hard facts, but their framing makes me slightly less concerned that the Nevada case would trigger a broad pause, and slightly more attentive to the operational compounding risk (which I had already noted but perhaps underweighted).",
    "rationale": "I’m nudging up from 82% to 85% based on (1) reweighting the Nevada ruling risk toward a state‑scoped remedy rather than a national pause, given Kalshi’s federal oversight and incentives; and (2) accepting that the most material residual risk is operational brittleness across 30 straight days rather than a high-likelihood regulatory shutdown in June. My mental model: a small correlated regulatory-pause probability (~7–8%) plus a low daily operational miss probability (~0.3–0.5%) that compounds over 30 days yields roughly mid‑80s. If the first week of June completes without gaps and there’s no adverse ruling or CFTC action, I would drift this toward ~90. A TRO/injunction or Kalshi‑announced pause would move it sharply down.",
