  "information": "The U.S. Department of Agriculture’s Food Safety and Inspection Service (FSIS) has designated this a Class III recall. This classification is used when the use of or exposure to a violative product is not likely to cause adverse health consequences. No adverse health effects or illnesses have been reported in connection with the consumption of these products. Cargill stated the recall was issued 'out of an abundance of caution.'",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Approximately 7 weeks (resolves on July 1, 2025).",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No. The recall is currently listed as 'Active'. If this status does not change by the resolution date, the question resolves as No.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "The administrative and verification processes required by the USDA's Food Safety and Inspection Service (FSIS) to close the recall are not completed by the end of June. This could be due to standard bureaucratic timelines, delays in Cargill providing necessary documentation confirming the product's disposition, or FSIS staff workload, resulting in the recall status remaining 'Active' on July 1, 2025.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Cargill efficiently tracks, recovers, and confirms the disposition of all affected liquid egg products. They promptly submit all required documentation to the FSIS. Given the low-risk nature of the recall, the FSIS processes the closure paperwork without significant delay, and the recall status is updated to 'Closed' on the official website before July 1, 2025.",
    "rationale": "My forecast is heavily influenced by the recall's classification as Class III. This is the least severe category, used when there is no likely risk of adverse health consequences. The fact that no illnesses have been reported supports this and suggests a more straightforward, administrative closure process rather than a complex public health investigation. The recall was initiated on March 28, 2025, providing a timeframe of just over three months until the July 1 deadline. This is a substantial period for a low-risk recall's logistical and administrative tasks—namely, ensuring the product is accounted for and proper notifications have been made. My base rate assumption is that routine bureaucratic processes, even for low-risk events, can take time, but a 90+ day window is typically sufficient.\n\nMy probability is not higher because government administrative processes can have inherent, unpredictable delays, regardless of the urgency of the specific case. A delay in paperwork submission by Cargill or a backlog at the FSIS could easily push the closure date past the deadline. Therefore, a near-certainty forecast is inappropriate.\n\nMy probability is not lower because the 'Class III' designation is a very strong signal for a simple and relatively quick resolution. There are no complicating factors like reported illnesses or a widespread, difficult-to-trace consumer product. The status quo is 'Active', but the expected outcome for a recall is eventual closure, and the provided timeframe is ample for a case of this nature. \n\nI would increase my forecast if Cargill or the FSIS issued a statement confirming that all affected product had been recovered. I would decrease my forecast if similar recent Class III recalls have taken significantly longer than three months to close, suggesting systemic delays in the FSIS process.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill the USDA-posted recall by Cargill Kitchen Solutions of its liquid egg product for an unapproved substance issued March 28, 2025 be closed before July 1, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nABC News: [Liquid eggs recalled due to potential cleaning solution contamination](https://abcnews.go.com/GMA/Food/liquid-eggs-recalled-due-potential-cleaning-solution-contamination/story?id=120329600)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if the status of the recall posted by the U.S. Department of Agriculture’s Food Safety and Inspection Service (FSIS) is changed from Active to Closed on [this page](https://www.fsis.usda.gov/recalls-alerts/cargill-kitchen-solutions-recalls-liquid-egg-products-due-unapproved-substance) before July 1, 2025. If the recall is still shown as Active when the link is accessed by Metaculus on or after July 1, 2025, this question resolves as **No**.\n\n\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nThe U.S. Department of Agriculture’s Food Safety and Inspection Service (FSIS) has designated this a Class III recall. This classification is used when the use of or exposure to a violative product is not likely to cause adverse health consequences. No adverse health effects or illnesses have been reported in connection with the consumption of these products. Cargill stated the recall was issued 'out of an abundance of caution.'\n\nToday is 2025-05-07.\n\nBefore answering you think:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n(e) You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
