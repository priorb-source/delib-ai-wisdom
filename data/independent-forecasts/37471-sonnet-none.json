    "status_quo_outcome": "NO - the number stays below 550 thousand",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "The inventory level remains relatively stable or grows modestly from the February 2025 level of 500,000 units, ending May at around 500-530 thousand. This could occur if buyer demand remains steady enough to absorb new completions, if builders moderate their pace, or if the market has reached a natural ceiling given current economic conditions including elevated interest rates.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Inventory surges by 10%+ from February's 500,000 to exceed 550,000 by May. This would require a continuation or acceleration of the recent upward trend, with builders completing projects faster than buyers purchase them. Factors could include further weakening of buyer demand due to economic uncertainty, sustained high interest rates, or a seasonal spring surge in new listings that exceeds historical patterns.",
    "rationale": "The February 2025 baseline is 500,000 units, already at an 18-year high. To reach 550,000 by May requires a 10% increase in just 3 months, which would be quite rapid growth. While the background notes a tripling over 13 years (roughly 9% annually on average), such growth wasn't linear and a 10% quarterly jump would be exceptional.\n\nKey factors supporting the status quo (NO): (1) We're already at historic highs, suggesting potential resistance to further rapid increases; (2) A 50,000-unit increase in 3 months is substantial; (3) Markets typically don't jump dramatically without clear catalysts; (4) The lack of recent data between February and May means assuming continued rapid acceleration requires speculation.\n\nFactors that could push toward YES: (1) Seasonal patterns - spring/summer typically sees increased inventory; (2) The long-term upward trend shows momentum; (3) If high interest rates continue suppressing demand while builders complete projects, inventory could build faster.\n\nNo research assistant information contradicts these considerations. My forecast is not higher because the required 10% growth in one quarter at already-elevated levels seems unlikely absent clear evidence of acceleration. It's not lower because the documented upward trend and potential seasonal effects mean reaching 550k isn't impossible, just improbable given the short timeframe and status quo bias principles.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill the number of new single family homes for sale in the US exceed 550 thousand in May 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\n[The Kobeissi Letter](https://x.com/KobeissiLetter/status/1912142359577403619): \"BREAKING: The number of new single-family homes for sale has surged to 500,000 in February, the highest since November 2007.\n\nThe number of new homes on the market has more than TRIPLED over the last 13 years, from a low of 142,000.\n\nExcluding the 2006 housing bubble this is, by far, the largest supply of new homes in history.\"\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if the number of New One Family Homes for Sale in the United States reported for May 2025 is greater than 550 thousand, according to what is presented by [FRED](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/HNFSEPUSSA).\n\nEnsure units is set to \"Thousands of Units, Seasonally Adjusted\" and frequency is set to \"Monthly, End of Month\". Question resolves based on the number presented by FRED, and no other resolution source will be considered.\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nNo additional information available.\n\nToday is 2025-05-08.\n\nBefore answering you think:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n(e) You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
