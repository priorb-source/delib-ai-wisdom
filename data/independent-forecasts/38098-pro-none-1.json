    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Approximately 1 month.",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No. Ralph Norman remains a member of the U.S. House of Representatives and has not declared his candidacy for the U.S. Senate. This state of affairs is expected to continue.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Ralph Norman continues to represent his district in the House and concludes that challenging a well-established and well-funded incumbent like Lindsey Graham is too risky. He allows the July 1, 2025, deadline to pass without making any announcement regarding a Senate run, possibly preserving the option to decide at a later date beyond the scope of this question.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Sensing a moment of political vulnerability for Senator Graham and having secured sufficient financial backing and potential key endorsements (such as from Donald Trump), Ralph Norman decides to launch an early campaign to build momentum. He makes a formal declaration of his candidacy at a press event in South Carolina in June 2025.",
    "rationale": "My forecast heavily favors the status quo, which is that Ralph Norman will not have declared a Senate candidacy by the July 1, 2025 deadline. The primary driver for this assessment is the very short timeframe of approximately one month. Launching a primary challenge against a formidable incumbent like Lindsey Graham is a massive undertaking that typically requires months of public groundwork, fundraising, and organizational buildup, none of which appear to be at an advanced stage. The research assistant's report of 'No additional information' reinforces the lack of public momentum toward an imminent announcement. While Norman has expressed interest in the past (as noted in the 2023 Axios article), talk is much more common than action in politics. The base rate for successful primary challenges against incumbent senators is very low.\n\nMy probability is not lower than 15% because Norman is a member of the House Freedom Caucus, a group known for its willingness to mount primary challenges against the establishment. The political environment remains volatile, and a sudden event—such as a major misstep by Graham or a surprise high-profile endorsement for Norman—could precipitate a quick decision to run. \n\nMy probability is not higher than 15% because of the immense inertia of the status quo and the significant barriers to entry for such a race. Graham is a proven fundraiser and has weathered primary challenges before. The lack of any recent, escalating signals of a campaign launch suggests that if Norman does run, an announcement is more likely to come after July 1, 2025. For me to increase my forecast, I would need to see concrete evidence of campaign infrastructure being built, such as the formation of an exploratory committee, a major fundraising blitz, or multiple reports from credible sources confirming an impending announcement.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill Ralph Norman declare his candidacy for the US Senate race in South Carolina before July 1, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nAxios: [Sen. Lindsey Graham may face right-wing primary challenge in 2026](https://www.axios.com/2023/09/13/lindsey-graham-primary-challenge-ralph-norman)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if Will Ralph Norman declares his candidacy for the US Senate race in South Carolina before July 1, 2025. If no such announcement has been made before that date, the question resolves as **No**.\n\n\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nNo additional information available.\n\nToday is 2025-05-30.\n\nBefore answering you think:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n(e) You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
