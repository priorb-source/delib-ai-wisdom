    "review": "The other forecasters provide valuable specificity and structure. Key insights they raised: (1) Both explicitly confirmed Tanzania's current Level 2 status, providing concrete baseline information. (2) Forecaster 3's point about regional designations is particularly important - the State Department often addresses localized risks with regional warnings rather than upgrading entire countries, which actually reduces the probability of a country-wide Level 3. (3) Both identified specific threat vectors I hadn't fully weighted: the Cabo Delgado insurgency spillover from Mozambique and potential health emergencies. (4) Their forecasts cluster at 12-15%, slightly above my 8%, suggesting I may have been marginally too confident in the status quo. However, their own analysis supports the low-probability view: bureaucratic inertia, short timeframe, Tanzania's relative stability, and the regional designation option all point toward maintaining Level 2.",
    "rationale": "After reviewing the other forecasters' analyses, I'm making a modest upward adjustment. They've identified concrete threat vectors (Mozambique's Cabo Delgado spillover, health emergencies) that deserve more weight than I initially gave them. The background article's mention of 'increased crime and terrorism threats' also suggests documented concerns exist. However, the regional designation point actually reinforces a conservative forecast - even if conditions deteriorate in southern Tanzania, the State Department could maintain Level 2 overall while warning about specific regions. The core factors remain: 60 days is very short for major policy changes, travel advisory upgrades require substantial justification, bureaucratic inertia is strong, and there are no current indicators of imminent threats. The consensus range of 8-15% seems appropriate, with my updated forecast reflecting slightly higher weight on tail risks while maintaining that status quo is by far the most likely outcome.",
