    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "About 52 days (until July 1, 2025)",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No — the recall remains listed as Active on the FSIS page on/after July 1, 2025.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "The recall is expanded to additional lots or states, or effectiveness checks take longer than expected (e.g., difficulty verifying product recovery across distributors/retailers), leaving the FSIS status as Active past July 1.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Johnsonville completes recall effectiveness checks without expansion or new incidents; FSIS verifies product control/disposition and updates the recall status to Closed in June.",
    "rationale": "Baseline: Many FSIS recalls for foreign matter (often Class II) are closed within roughly 1–3 months once effectiveness checks and product disposition are verified. This recall was posted April 5, giving about 87 days until July 1; as of today (May 9), roughly 52 days remain, which is generally sufficient if there are no complications. Factors pushing toward Yes: moderate recall size (~22,000 lbs), a well-resourced firm likely to execute quickly, and the nature of foreign-matter recalls that often resolve in a couple of months. Factors pushing toward No: closures sometimes exceed 90 days due to wide distribution, slow retailer/distributor confirmations, or recall expansions if additional complaints emerge. I put extra weight on the status quo (Active) and the real possibility of administrative/verification delays or expansion, which keeps the probability below ~70%. No additional intel from the research assistant changes the base-rate view. I would raise the forecast if there’s evidence of rapid completion (e.g., no expansion by early June, FSIS updates indicating effective product recovery). I would lower it if FSIS posts an expansion, new injury reports, or signals of broader distribution that typically extend closure timelines.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill the USDA-posted recall by Johnsonville LLC of cheddar bratwurst for foreign matter contamination issued April 5, 2025 be closed before July 1, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nReal Simple: [Over 22,000 Pounds of a Popular Sausage Brand Recalled Due to Contamination](https://www.realsimple.com/sausage-recall-2025-11711268)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if the status of the recall posted by the U.S. Department of Agriculture’s Food Safety and Inspection Service (FSIS) is changed from Active to Closed on [this page](https://www.fsis.usda.gov/recalls-alerts/johnsonville-llc-recalls-cheddar-bratwurst-product-due-possible-foreign-matter) before July 1, 2025. If the recall is still shown as Active when the link is accessed by Metaculus on or after July 1, 2025, this question resolves as **No**.\n\n\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nNo additional information available.\n\nToday is 2025-05-09.\n\nBefore answering you think:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n(e) You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
