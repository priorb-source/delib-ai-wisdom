    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Approximately 1 month and 11 days (outcome determined on July 1, 2025).",
    "status_quo_outcome": "Yes. The CDC's current recommendation is 0.7 mg/L of fluoride. If nothing changes by the resolution date, the question resolves as Yes.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Following the HHS review announced in April 2025, political or public pressure accelerates the process. The CDC, as an interim measure or a final decision, either lowers the recommended level to below 0.7 mg/L or removes the specific numerical guidance from its website pending further study. This would result in a No resolution.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "The HHS review of fluoride guidance proceeds at a standard pace for a major public health policy reassessment. Such reviews are complex and lengthy, often taking many months or years. By July 1, 2025, the review is still ongoing, and the existing recommendation of 0.7 mg/L remains the official guidance on the CDC's website.",
    "rationale": "My forecast heavily favors the status quo due to institutional inertia and the very short timeframe. The current recommendation of 0.7 mg/L was established in 2015 after a multi-year review process. While the provided background indicates HHS initiated a new review in April 2025, it is highly improbable that such a review—involving scientific assessment, peer review, and bureaucratic approval for a major public health standard—would be completed and implemented in under three months. Governmental and scientific bodies operate on much longer timelines. The most likely scenario is that the review will still be in its early stages on July 1, 2025, leaving the current guidance unchanged.\n\nMy probability is not higher than 85% because the announcement of a review, especially one attracting media attention as implied by the fictional NPR article, introduces a non-trivial chance of a rapid, politically-driven change. An interim measure, such as removing the specific number and replacing it with 'Under Review' text (which would resolve as No), is a plausible, albeit unlikely, outcome within this timeframe.\n\nMy probability is not lower than 85% because the scientific consensus supporting community water fluoridation is strong and long-standing. Overturning decades of public health policy in a matter of weeks would be an extraordinary event, requiring a level of political intervention that is rare for this type of scientific guidance. The status quo remains the most probable outcome given the powerful forces of institutional procedure and timing.\n\nI would decrease my probability if there were official reports of an expedited review timeline or leaked drafts of new recommendations. I would increase my probability if HHS or CDC officials made public statements confirming the review process would be lengthy and that no changes were imminent.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill the CDC still recommend 0.7 mg/L fluoride as the optimal level in community water supplies on July 1, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nNPR: [HHS will review guidance on the addition of fluoride to drinking water](https://www.npr.org/2025/04/10/g-s1-59452/hhs-rfk-fluoride-drinking-water-epa)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if the CDC's [Community Water Fluoridation Recommendations](https://www.cdc.gov/fluoridation/about/community-water-fluoridation-recommendations.html) recommends greater than or equal to 0.7 mg/L as the concentration that maximizes fluoride's oral health benefits while minimizing potential harms. If a lesser amount is recommended or if there is no longer any recommendation at all, then the question resolves as **No**.\n\nIf the page is pulled offline with no replacement, this question also resolves as **No**.\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nNo additional information available.\n\nToday is 2025-05-20.\n\nBefore answering you think:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n(e) You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
