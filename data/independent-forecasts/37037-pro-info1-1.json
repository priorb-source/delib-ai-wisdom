  "information": "In early April 2025, the U.S. administration announced a new trade policy based on 'reciprocal tariffs,' effectively ending the African Growth and Opportunity Act (AGOA) which had allowed many African countries to export goods to the U.S. duty-free. The new policy applies tariffs to approximately 185 countries. The tariff rates are determined by a formula that involves dividing a country's bilateral trade deficit with the U.S. by the amount of U.S. imports from that country, and then dividing the result by two. This policy resulted in varying tariff rates, including 50% for Lesotho and Saint-Pierre and Miquelon, 49% for Cambodia, 46% for Vietnam, 34% for China, and 20% for the European Union. The new tariffs took effect on April 9, 2025, although the U.S. later announced a 90-day pause on introducing new tariffs for some countries, a move not extended to Lesotho.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Approximately 5 weeks. The resolution date is June 1, 2025, and today's date is April 23, 2025.",
    "status_quo_outcome": "Yes. The current US trade policy, which took effect on April 9, 2025, imposes a 50% tariff on goods from Lesotho. If nothing changes, this will be the tariff listed on June 1, 2025.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Following diplomatic efforts or negative media attention about the punitive effect on a small, developing nation, the US administration makes a rapid policy exception for Lesotho, either removing the tariff or reducing it below 50% before June 1, 2025.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "The US administration adheres to its new 'reciprocal tariffs' policy without making exceptions. Bureaucratic inertia and the administration's focus on larger trade issues mean the 50% tariff for Lesotho remains unchanged on the resolution date.",
    "rationale": "My forecast is heavily weighted towards the status quo. The research indicates a new, broad-based 'reciprocal tariffs' policy was recently implemented on April 9, 2025. The US administration has already explicitly signaled its intention to apply this tariff to Lesotho by not including it in a 90-day pause granted to some other countries. The timeframe for a policy reversal before June 1, 2025, is extremely short, especially for a country with limited diplomatic leverage like Lesotho. The probability is not higher than 90% because there is a small but non-zero chance of a policy reversal. A high-profile tariff on a small, developing nation can create negative press and political pressure, potentially leading to a swift exception being made as an 'easy fix' to a public relations problem. The probability is not lower because the administration has provided a strong signal by specifically excluding Lesotho from the tariff pause, indicating a firm stance. To update my forecast lower, I would need to see evidence of active, high-level diplomatic engagement or a public statement from the U.S. Trade Representative indicating a review of Lesotho's tariff rate. To update higher, I would look for statements from the administration reaffirming the universal application of the new policy.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill the US government's harmonized tarifff schedule list the tariff on Lesotho as 50% on June 1, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nAP: [How tiny Lesotho ended up with the highest US tariffs in the world](https://apnews.com/article/lesotho-us-trump-tariffs-b337efa47290e889aa076cc9ede7bc9d)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if the duty provided in the applicable subheading is + 50% for Lesotho at the American government's [harmonized tariff schedule](https://hts.usitc.gov/search?query=lesotho) when accessed by Metaculus on or after June 1, 2025.\n\nWhether the provision is listed as suspended will not affect resolution.\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nIn early April 2025, the U.S. administration announced a new trade policy based on 'reciprocal tariffs,' effectively ending the African Growth and Opportunity Act (AGOA) which had allowed many African countries to export goods to the U.S. duty-free.

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
