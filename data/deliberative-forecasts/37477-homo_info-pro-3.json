    "review": "My initial forecast was 10%, based on the assumption that a tariff story of this magnitude—a 10% blanket tariff on all trade partners—would have such profound and continuous economic and political impact that it would be impossible for it to be absent from the front pages of both the NYT and WSJ for even a single day in the 22-day window. Both other forecasters (Forecaster 2 and Forecaster 3) arrived at a 75% probability, the inverse of my position. Their reasoning exposed a critical flaw in my analysis: I focused on the overall salience of the story and failed to properly weigh the resolution criteria and the inherent volatility of the news cycle. Forecaster 2 correctly argued that the bar for a 'Yes' is very low, requiring only one day where other news is more pressing. Forecaster 3 provided a compelling statistical framework, framing the question as the probability of breaking an unbroken 23-day streak of front-page mentions. I found both arguments highly convincing. They highlighted that even the biggest stories can be temporarily displaced by breaking news, and the probability of such an event occurring at least once over three weeks is very high.",
    "rationale": "I am significantly updating my forecast upwards from 10% to 65%. The core reason for this change is the compelling arguments from the other forecasters, which convinced me that my initial assessment was flawed. I had underestimated the importance of two factors: the low threshold for a 'Yes' resolution (only one day of omission is needed) and the high volatility of the 24-hour news cycle. A major, non-trade-related event (e.g., a natural disaster, a different political crisis, a major Supreme Court decision) is highly likely to occur within a 22-day period and dominate the front pages of both papers, pushing the tariff story to the interior pages for at least one day. Forecaster 3's statistical model was particularly insightful. A 'No' vote requires a perfect, unbroken streak of mentions for 22 consecutive days, which is statistically improbable for almost any single news topic. While I believe the daily probability of a mention is very high, I now accept that it is not 100%. Adopting this statistical view, even a high daily probability of a mention on at least one paper (e.g., 95%) yields a high probability of a streak-breaking day over the resolution period (1 - 0.95^22 ≈ 68%). My updated forecast of 65% reflects this revised, statistically-informed perspective. I am not going all the way to 75% because I believe the described tariff policy is exceptionally unique in its breadth and impact, making it 'stickier' on the front page, especially for the WSJ, than a typical major story. However, my initial forecast was clearly wrong, and a substantial update is necessary.",
