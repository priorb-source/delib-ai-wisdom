    "review": "Both forecasters emphasize the same core facts I’m using: (1) the jump needed from 52.2 to >60 is unusually large, historically <3% frequency; (2) recent macro signals are mixed-to-negative (weak ADP, elevated inflation expectations, trade/tariff uncertainty, tighter consumer finances); and (3) the Conference Board’s outsized May gain provides some upside risk. Forecaster 3’s added framing that two consecutive months at 52.2 implies stabilization rather than an incipient rebound is a useful nuance that lowers the chance of an abrupt June surge absent a clear catalyst. I agree with their caution. One caveat I’d note: ADP is an imperfect predictor of the BLS jobs report, so I don’t overweight it. Still, in the absence of new upside catalysts (CPI, payrolls, gasoline prices), their arguments reinforce a low-probability ‘Yes’.",
    "rationale": "Baseline: Final May UMich sentiment at 52.2 implies a ≥7.9-point monthly rise is needed to clear 60. Such moves are rare; prelim-to-final revisions are usually small, so the prelim would likely also need to be at/near 60. Headwinds include weak private hiring signals, consumers’ expectations of rising unemployment, elevated (survey-based) inflation expectations, and tariff uncertainty. The two-month flat reading at 52.2 suggests stabilization rather than a rebound trend. Upside risks remain from the Conference Board’s jump and potential for a soft CPI/solid payrolls that could lift expectations, but that’s multiple things going right in a short window. Given peers’ arguments and lack of a clear imminent positive catalyst as of June 4, I trim slightly. I’d move up meaningfully only if: (a) May BLS payrolls are strong without wage re-acceleration, (b) May CPI is benign (particularly core), and (c) gasoline prices ease—ideally alongside a strong UMich preliminary reading (≥58). I’d move down if payrolls and CPI disappoint and/or the prelim prints ≤55.",
