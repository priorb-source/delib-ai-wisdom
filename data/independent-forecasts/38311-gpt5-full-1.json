  "information": "The White House has officially confirmed that President Donald Trump will attend the G7 summit in Canada from June 15-17, 2025. White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt stated that details of the visit would be announced shortly. Numerous media outlets reported the confirmation in late May 2025, and official G7 participant lists dated June 3 include Trump.\n\nThe 51st G7 Summit is scheduled to take place in Kananaskis, Alberta. Security measures are being implemented, including a controlled access zone around summit venues from June 10-18 and temporary airspace restrictions. In advance of the leaders' summit, U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent and Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell attended preparatory G7 meetings in Banff. Historically, sitting U.S. presidents have attended every in-person G7/G8 summit since its inception in 1975.\n\nAccording to reports from the Nikkei newspaper, the upcoming G7 summit may not produce a traditional final joint statement due to disagreements between the U.S. and other member nations. The summit may instead result in several separate documents on specific topics of cooperation, while excluding more contentious issues like global trade and relations with Russia from the formal agenda to avoid conflict. In preparation for the summit, German Chancellor Olaf Scholz is scheduled to meet with President Trump at the White House on June 5.",

    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Approximately 12 days (summit begins June 15, 2025)",
    "status_quo_outcome": "Yes",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "A late cancellation due to an acute health issue, a major domestic or international crisis requiring him to remain in Washington, a credible security threat specific to the venue, or unforeseen travel/aircraft issues that prevent arrival; alternatively, he travels to Canada but does not physically enter any leaders’ sessions or bilats, resulting in no in-person interaction with other heads of state.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Air Force One flies to Alberta around June 14–15; Trump motorcades to the secured Kananaskis venue and participates in leaders’ sessions and/or bilaterals, generating pool footage and photographs alongside other G7 leaders.",
    "rationale": "Baseline attendance is very likely. The White House has publicly confirmed President Trump’s participation, and official G7 materials dated June 3 list him as a participant. Canada has established a controlled access zone (June 10–18) and airspace restrictions, signaling fully active summit logistics. The finance track has already convened in Banff with U.S. participation, consistent with a normal run-up to a leaders’ summit. Historically, U.S. presidents attend G7/G8 summits; once publicly committed and with security measures in place, last-minute no-shows are rare.\n\nWhy not higher than 100? There remains small but real tail risk: sudden health issues for a 78-year-old president; an urgent domestic or foreign crisis; a serious, specific security threat; or an idiosyncratic last-minute change of plans. While Trump’s unpredictability marginally raises cancellation risk compared to a typical president, his past behavior still includes attending G7s (e.g., 2018) even amid disagreements, and current reporting suggests the summit will proceed even if it forgoes a joint communique.\n\nWhy not lower? Multiple converging signals—official White House confirmation, inclusion on participant lists, active security posture at the venue, and standard pre-summit ministerial activity—strongly favor attendance. Travel is short and straightforward, and there is no evident diplomatic boycott or scheduling conflict.\n\nWhat would move me up? Seeing the official public schedule with precise departure/arrival times, press pool guidance, and wheels-up of Air Force One; leaders’ bilateral schedules naming in-person meetings with Trump; photographic evidence of arrival in Alberta.\n\nWhat would move me down? Credible reports of an acute health issue, an emergent crisis necessitating his presence in Washington, elevated security threats to the venue, or authoritative reporting that the U.S. is trimming, postponing, or canceling the trip.",
