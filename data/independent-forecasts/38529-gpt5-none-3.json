    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "~15 days until the June 24, 2025 primary; likely called on election night to within 1 week after, depending on RCV tabulation and absentee counts.",
    "status_quo_outcome": "Cuomo narrowly wins the Democratic primary, being called the presumptive nominee after RCV tabulation.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Opposition to Cuomo consolidates under a progressive (e.g., Mamdani). Cuomo leads initial preferences but lacks second-choice support; RCV transfers from eliminated candidates flow overwhelmingly to the main alternative, who overtakes Cuomo in later rounds.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Cuomo maintains a first-round lead and secures enough second- and third-choice transfers from moderate and anti-DSA voters to stay ahead through final RCV rounds; credible outlets call him the presumptive nominee.",
    "rationale": "- Evidence: The provided headline indicates at least one recent poll with Cuomo still leading while Mamdani gains. With only ~2 weeks left, a narrowing but persistent lead confers a slight front-runner advantage.\n- Mechanics: NYC uses ranked-choice voting (RCV) in party primaries. Polarizing candidates with high name ID can win pluralities but lose late rounds if they have weak transfer appeal. Cuomo’s past controversies likely depress second-choice support, increasing downside risk versus a consolidated anti-Cuomo coalition.\n- Field/coalitions: Progressives often outperform their polling in low-turnout NYC Democratic primaries due to strong organization and GOTV in certain districts. If the progressive lane is consolidated, transfers could heavily favor the main challenger. Conversely, if moderates and outer-borough voters coalesce around Cuomo, his name recognition and union/establishment-friendly segments can carry him through.\n- Turnout and timing: With limited time left, massive reconfigurations are less likely, but late momentum and endorsements can still matter on the margins. RCV counting could delay the call, but that affects timing more than direction.\nWhy not higher: Cuomo’s liabilities (unfavorable ratings, potential low transfer share in RCV, energized progressive opposition) create a real path for a challenger, especially if anti-Cuomo votes consolidate.\nWhy not lower: He appears to be leading; name recognition, a moderate coalition, and pluralities in first-choice votes are meaningful advantages close to Election Day.\nKey updates to watch:\n- High-quality polls with RCV simulations: If they show Cuomo losing in final rounds, I would downgrade meaningfully (to ~40–45%). If they show him holding leads after transfers, I’d upgrade (to ~65–70%).\n- Endorsements/coalition moves: Major labor or community endorsements for Cuomo, or further fragmentation among progressives, would raise my estimate; consolidation around a single challenger would lower it.\n- Turnout indicators: Strong early vote/EDay indicators in progressive strongholds would push lower; strong outer-borough/moderate turnout would push higher.\n- Late-breaking scandals or legal developments affecting any candidate would move the needle accordingly.",

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
