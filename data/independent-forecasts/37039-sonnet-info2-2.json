  "information": "The Swiss government, including President Karin Keller-Sutter, expressed 'incomprehension' regarding the tariff calculation. Swiss officials stated that the country imposes a 0% tariff on US imports, and that Swiss companies have created 500,000 jobs in the US. Switzerland's trade surplus with the US was $38.5 billion in 2024. The Swiss watch industry was noted as being particularly affected, with share prices for major exporters like Richemont and Swatch falling after the announcement.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Approximately 38 days until June 1, 2025",
    "status_quo_outcome": "Yes - Based on the April 4, 2025 NYT article, Trump has announced a 31% tariff on Switzerland, so if this remains unchanged and is formally implemented in the harmonized tariff schedule, the question would resolve as Yes",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Switzerland successfully negotiates removal or modification of the tariff to a different percentage, or the Trump administration decides not to formally implement the announced 31% rate in the harmonized tariff schedule by June 1, or delays implementation beyond that date",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "The announced 31% tariff is formally codified in subheading 9903.01.60 of the harmonized tariff schedule and remains listed at that rate on June 1, 2025. This occurs even if the tariff is suspended pending negotiations, since the resolution criteria explicitly state that suspension status does not affect resolution",
    "rationale": "The NYT article from April 4, 2025 (20 days ago) indicates Trump has announced a 31% tariff on Switzerland, suggesting this is already public policy. The critical factor increasing the probability is that the resolution criteria explicitly state that suspended tariffs still count as Yes - meaning even if negotiations result in temporary suspension, the question resolves positively as long as the 31% rate remains listed. With only 38 days remaining, this is a relatively short window for complete removal or rate modification. Factors supporting a Yes outcome include: the Trump administration's apparent commitment to this tariff policy, the short timeframe limiting negotiation opportunities, and the fact that suspension (rather than removal) counts as Yes. Factors creating uncertainty include: Switzerland's strong objections and leverage (0% tariffs on US goods, 500,000 US jobs created by Swiss companies), the possibility that negotiations over the past 20 days have already yielded changes we're unaware of, and uncertainty about whether the tariff has been formally implemented in the harmonized tariff schedule yet versus just announced. The forecast is not higher because meaningful negotiation time remains and Switzerland has substantial economic leverage. It's not lower because the status quo appears to favor the tariff being implemented, suspended tariffs count as Yes, and 38 days is relatively short for complete policy reversal. I would update higher with evidence of formal implementation without suspension, or lower with news of successful Swiss negotiations or delays in implementation",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill the US government's harmonized tariff schedule list the tariff on Switzerland as 31% on June 1, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nNew York Times: [Swiss Indignant to Make the Top 10 of Trump’s Tariffs List](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/04/business/trump-tariffs-switzerland.html)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if the duty provided in the applicable subheading is + 31% for Switzerland at the American government's [harmonized tariff schedule](https://hts.usitc.gov/search?query=switzerland) when accessed by Metaculus on or after June 1, 2025.\n\nWhether the provision is listed as suspended will not affect resolution.\r\n\r\nPlease note that this question is asking whether the cell in the 'RATES OF DUTY' column '1, General' appearing alongside subheading 9903.01.60 on the Harmonized Tariff Schedule indicates an additional ad valorem duty rate of 31% for articles the product of Switzerland, regardless of any specificities noted in the 'Article Description' column.\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nThe Swiss government, including President Karin Keller-Sutter, expressed 'incomprehension' regarding the tariff calculation.

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
