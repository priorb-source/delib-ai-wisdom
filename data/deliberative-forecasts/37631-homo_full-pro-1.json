    "review": "The deliberation with my fellow forecasters has been productive, highlighting the key tensions in this forecast. All three of us identified the same core dynamic: a race between Tesla's precarious, high valuation and the substantial $309 billion market cap lead it holds over Walmart within a short six-week timeframe. Our differing probabilities (30%, 35%, and 45%) stem from the weight we assign to these competing factors. Forecaster 2 (45%) places significant weight on the high probability of a sharp correction in Tesla's stock, driven by deteriorating fundamentals and the binary risk of the Robotaxi launch. Conversely, Forecaster 3 (30%) places more emphasis on the difficulty of overcoming such a large gap in a short period, reinforced by the historical resilience of Tesla's narrative-driven valuation. My own forecast sits between these two.",
    "rationale": "After careful consideration of the other forecasters' analyses, I have decided to maintain my original forecast of 35%. My reasoning has been reinforced and refined by their perspectives. I find Forecaster 3's argument about the historical resilience of Tesla's stock narrative compelling; the market has frequently overlooked weak fundamentals in favor of long-term promises, and this prevents me from raising my probability towards the 45% proposed by Forecaster 2. The power of this narrative, especially leading into a major product announcement like the Robotaxi, could easily sustain the current valuation, making the large market cap gap insurmountable. However, I also agree with Forecaster 2's assessment that the current situation poses a concrete and severe risk to Tesla's valuation. The combination of its highest-tier 'Strong Sell' rating, declining automotive profitability, and an extremely high P/E ratio makes the stock incredibly vulnerable. The Robotaxi launch acts as a powerful, near-term catalyst that could force a market re-pricing. A ~29% drop needed for a crossover is well within the bounds of Tesla's historical volatility during periods of high uncertainty. Therefore, Forecaster 3's 30% feels too low as it may understate the immediate and potent risks. My forecast of 35% remains my best estimate, balancing the powerful but fragile Tesla narrative against the mounting, concrete fundamental headwinds and the high-stakes binary event on the immediate horizon.",
