    "review": "Both forecasters largely align with my view that the status quo favors a Yes. The key addition I found useful is the emphasis that removing or modifying 9903.01.48 would require a Presidential Proclamation and a published HTS revision—procedural steps that can move quickly once a deal is finalized. They also stress leverage dynamics: with collection suspended until July 9, there’s little incentive to remove the listing before June 1 unless a deal is concluded and the administration wants an immediate visible rollback. Forecaster 3’s lower probability (76%) rests primarily on the plausibility of a quick deal and the USITC’s capacity to update HTS rapidly, which I had considered but perhaps weighted slightly less. No new hard evidence contradicts the current listing or suggests imminent removal before June 1.",
    "rationale": "Baseline: The HTS already shows +17% for Israel, marked suspended, and the suspension runs beyond June 1. The resolution counts a suspended listing as Yes. Inertia and leverage both favor leaving the entry in place through June 1 absent a finalized agreement. To flip this to No requires: (1) a rapid bilateral deal in May, (2) a Presidential Proclamation or equivalent action to rescind/modify 9903.01.48, and (3) USITC updating the HTS before June 1. That pathway is plausible but requires multiple timely steps. The added point that USITC can update quickly trims the margin because even a late‑May agreement could remove the +17% listing in time. Countervailing considerations: with the duty collection already suspended, policymakers retain leverage at low cost by leaving the listing until closer to July 9; early removal is less likely unless both sides want an immediate public signal. On balance, I still see a strong Yes-leaning base case, with a modest downward adjustment to reflect the realistic, if not dominant, chance of an early deal plus swift procedural follow-through.",
