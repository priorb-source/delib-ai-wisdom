  "information": "According to multiple polls from early 2025, Reform UK's support has grown significantly. A YouGov poll in early February showed Reform UK taking the lead over Labour for the first time, with 25% of the vote compared to Labour's 24% and the Conservatives' 21%. It found that one in four Conservative voters from the July 2024 election would now vote for Reform. Later polls from late April by sources like YouGov and More in Common showed Reform UK and Labour tied at 25%, or Reform slightly ahead at 26%. Polling expert Sir John Curtice noted the unprecedented unpopularity of both Labour (24% average rating) and the Conservatives (22%), with Reform narrowly ahead at 25%. A poll by Find Out Now in late January also placed Reform UK in the lead with 26% of the vote, ahead of the Conservatives at 23% and Labour at 22%. By contrast, the Politico poll-of-polls, the resolution source for the question, was reported in one analysis as showing Reform UK at 14.1%, significantly behind Labour (33.7%) and the Conservatives (23.7%).",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "2 months",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No. The resolution source, Politico's poll-of-polls, currently shows Reform UK significantly behind both Labour and the Conservatives. For this status quo to hold, this gap would simply need to not close and reverse to the extent required by the deadline.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Reform UK's polling surge, seen in individual polls, plateaus or proves to be a temporary peak. The Politico poll-of-polls, which aggregates data and moves slowly, never shows Reform achieving the necessary lead. Labour and the Conservatives stabilize their support, preventing Reform from gaining the substantial ground required to lead by 4 points in the aggregate measure.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "A major political scandal or event significantly damages both the Labour government and the Conservative opposition simultaneously, causing a historic and rapid collapse in their support. This event accelerates the trend of voters moving to Reform UK, causing a sustained surge across nearly all polls. The shift is so dramatic and persistent that the slow-moving Politico poll-of-polls updates rapidly, reflecting a lead for Reform UK of 4 points or more before the July 1 deadline.",
    "rationale": "My forecast is primarily based on the large discrepancy between the resolution source and recent individual polls. The Politico poll-of-polls, the official metric for this question, shows Reform UK at 14.1%, trailing Labour (33.7%) and the Conservatives (23.7%) by a massive margin. Such aggregate polls have significant inertia; for Reform to gain roughly 15-20 points and establish a 4-point lead in just two months would require a political shift of unprecedented speed and magnitude. The status quo strongly favors a 'No' outcome.\n\nHowever, I am not forecasting a near-zero probability. The research assistant's report indicates a clear and powerful trend in Reform UK's favor across multiple individual polls, some of which place them in the lead. This signifies extreme voter volatility and deep dissatisfaction with the two main parties, creating fertile ground for a major political realignment. My forecast of 15% acknowledges this non-trivial potential for a rapid shift.\n\nMy forecast is not higher because the barrier to success is not just being the most popular party, but being so by a 4-point margin in a lagging indicator average. The historical stability of such averages suggests this is a very high bar to clear in two months. My forecast is not lower because ignoring the strong, consistent trend in recent individual polls would be a mistake; the conditions for a major upset are clearly present.\n\nI would increase my forecast if the Politico average begins to shift rapidly in Reform's favor within the next few weeks (e.g., gaining 5+ points). I would decrease it if individual polls show Reform's support has peaked or is declining, or if the Politico average remains largely static.",

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any).
