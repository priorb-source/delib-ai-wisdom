    "review": "Both forecasters make solid, status-quo–heavy arguments: short timeline, immense warning signatures for amphibious operations, and strong deterrents. I agree with their emphasis on the 2027 readiness narrative and that we’ve seen no credible mobilization indicators. Two points they raise that I weighed: (1) Forecaster 3’s reminder that only a US accusation is needed—even for a limited landing—does broaden the path to Yes. However, the resolution text still requires US use of language amounting to “invading Taiwan” via PLA ground forces on ROC-controlled territory; Washington often calibrates language carefully (especially for outlying islands) and might choose “attack,” “assault,” or “seizure” instead of “invasion.” (2) Forecaster 2’s reference to a large rise in 2024 PLA pressure likely reflects air/maritime coercion metrics, which don’t equate to imminent amphibious readiness. I’m less persuaded by Forecaster 3’s citation of CFR’s ‘moderately likely’ crisis for 2025 as it encompasses blockades/coercion short of landings and doesn’t map tightly to this question. Overall, their analyses reinforce a low single-digit probability, but the strict resolution phrasing and lack of invasion indicators keep me at the low end of that range.",
    "rationale": "- Time left: ~8 weeks. Large-scale amphibious operations require conspicuous, multi-domain preparations (force massing, requisition of civilian RO-RO ferries, logistics/blood stockpiles, cyber/space prep, leave cancellations) that would likely leak or be observable; none are publicly indicated.\n- Status quo: Coercion and gray-zone pressure dominate. PLA/CCG activity can be escalatory, but it’s a different pathway than putting PLA ground forces ashore.\n- Resolution hurdle: It’s not enough that China takes aggressive action; the US must publicly accuse China of “invading Taiwan” via PLA ground forces. For limited seizures of outlying islands (Kinmen/Matsu/Pratas), Washington may avoid the word “invasion” to preserve strategic flexibility, opting for “attack,” “assault,” or “occupation.” If PRC used the CCG or PAP rather than PLA Marines, that further complicates meeting the “ground military forces” condition.\n- Seasonal/operational factors: Approaching the more challenging summer weather window marginally reduces the near-term amphibious window.\n- Tail risks remain (escalation from an incident, miscalculation, black swans), but absent concrete invasion indicators, they don’t justify moving above low-single digits.\nGiven these, I retain a very low probability and do not update.",
