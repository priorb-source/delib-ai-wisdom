    "review": "Key additions from the other forecasters that I hadn’t incorporated: (1) Morning Consult’s late-May snapshot reportedly has Ishiba slightly ahead of Starmer (e.g., Starmer ~28% vs. Ishiba ~32%), reversing early May. That directly challenges my earlier status quo assumption. (2) The 7-day trailing average and the short time window reduce the odds of a rank flip by July 1, and ties resolve to No. (3) Near-term UK catalysts (e.g., June 11 fiscal plans/cuts) plausibly skew negative for Starmer, while Japan’s risks for Ishiba, though real (yen, scandal drag), may be more diffuse. I find the current ordering and mechanical points (smoothing, tie=No) particularly convincing. The UK event-risk narrative is reasonable but less certain. The evidence of a May reversal and the dampening effect of the 7-day average materially lower the probability of Starmer being ahead on July 1.",
    "rationale": "Update summary: I previously leaned Yes on the assumption that Ishiba’s approval was running below Starmer’s and would remain subdued post-scandal. Forecasters 2 and 3 present compelling evidence that, as of late May, Ishiba is modestly ahead on Morning Consult, and they rightly emphasize the 7-day averaging and tie=No mechanics. With ~1 month left, a clean flip is still plausible (both leaders appear in the high-20s/low-30s band where 2–4 point moves can occur), but the base case is now that the current ordering persists or ends in a tie, both of which resolve No. Scenario updates: - No outcome: The late-May ordering persists, aided by smoothing, and/or Starmer faces mild June headwinds (fiscal messaging, domestic criticism), keeping him in the high-20s/low-30s while Ishiba holds ~low-30s. A tie also resolves No. - Yes outcome: Renewed pressure on Ishiba (yen volatility, lingering finance scandal coverage) nudges him back toward high-20s while Starmer rebounds a few points on any positive macro/policy news or simple mean reversion from a late-May dip. Given the new information about current standings and the mechanical tilt against a flip within a month, I materially lower my estimate. I still keep it above the low-30s because (a) Ishiba’s downside remains salient (recent non-MC polling showed weak cabinet approval), (b) May demonstrated meaningful week-to-week movement, and (c) only a small net swing (e.g., +2–3 points for Starmer or −2–3 for Ishiba) could suffice to produce a narrow Starmer lead by the July 1 reading. Net effect: Down from 76% to 42%.",
