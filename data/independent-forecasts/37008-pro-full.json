  "information": "A state of emergency was declared in Samoa on March 31, 2025, due to a severe energy crisis. The declaration was scheduled to be in effect for 30 days, from April 1, 2025, through April 29, 2025.\n\nAccording to reports from Samoa NewsHub and the Samoa Observer, temporary generators were expected to be operational by the end of April, coinciding with the scheduled end of the state of emergency. However, the permanent solution to the power crisis is not anticipated to be in place until August 2025.\n\nAs of April 21, 2025, the Samoan government had not announced any plans to extend the state of emergency. The National Emergency Operation Centre's update on April 15 confirmed that emergency orders were valid until April 29. The crisis has had a significant economic impact, estimated at a 16% hit to the country's GDP.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "9 days",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No. The current state of emergency is officially scheduled to end on April 29, 2025, one day before the resolution date. If this timeline holds, there will be no state of emergency in effect.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "The temporary generators are installed and become operational by the end of April as planned. The Samoan government allows the current state of emergency declaration to expire on April 29, 2025, deeming the most critical phase of the power crisis to be managed.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "The installation or commissioning of the temporary generators faces unexpected delays or technical failures. Faced with the prospect of continued severe power outages, the Samoan government extends the state of emergency beyond April 29 to manage the ongoing crisis.",
    "rationale": "My forecast is based primarily on the official end date of the current state of emergency, which is April 29, 2025. The status quo is that the declaration will lapse, resulting in a 'No' outcome. This is strongly supported by reports that temporary generators, the short-term solution to the power crisis, are expected to be operational by the end of April, coinciding with the emergency declaration's expiration. As of April 21, the government has not indicated any plans for an extension. The probability is not lower than 15% because there is a non-trivial risk of delays or failures with the installation of the temporary generators. The underlying energy infrastructure issue will not be permanently resolved until August 2025, leaving the system vulnerable. A significant setback in the coming days could easily force the government's hand to extend the declaration. The probability is not higher because the current, publicly stated plan from the Samoan government aligns perfectly with a 'No' outcome. Deviating from this would require a new, negative development, which is possible but not the most likely scenario. I would increase my forecast if credible reports emerge of delays with the generator installation. Conversely, I would decrease it if the generators are confirmed to be online and stable before April 29.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill a state of emergency be in effect in Samoa on April 30, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\n[Samoan Prime Minister declares state of emergency over power cuts](https://www.stuff.co.nz/nz-news/360634988/samoan-prime-minister-declares-state-emergency-over-power-cuts)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if, according to [credible sources](https://www.metaculus.com/faq/#definitions) Samoa is in a state of emergency that has been declared by a governmental entity with the authority to make such a declaration.\n\nFor example, the state of emergency declaration [posted](https://www.facebook.com/samoagovt/posts/hon-prime-minister-of-samoa-press-statement-proclamation-of-emergency-energy-cri/1059050259591457/) by the government of Samoa on Facebook on March 31, 2025 would count.

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
