    "review": "Both forecasters rely primarily on base rates, which is sensible for a one‑month horizon. Forecaster 2’s May-specific frequency (~57%) lines up with my baseline. Forecaster 3 cites a higher general monthly win rate (60–65%), but that overstates May specifically. The reference to bear markets/tariffs from the background isn’t actionable—it’s a generic explainer, not evidence of current stress. Neither adds new catalysts beyond what I’d already considered (FOMC, CPI/PPI, earnings, PCE). Overall, their arguments support a modestly-above-coin-flip stance but don’t justify moving materially higher or lower.",
    "rationale": "I continue to anchor on May’s historical win rate in the mid-50s, tempered by event risk concentration (FOMC at the start of the month; CPI/PCE mid/late month). Upside supports include typical earnings beat rates and buybacks reopening post-blackout; downside risks stem from valuation sensitivity to any upside inflation surprise or hawkish Fed tone. The deliberation added no new information about current conditions to tilt the balance. Therefore, I’m keeping a modestly positive edge consistent with May-specific base rates and two‑sided macro risk.",
