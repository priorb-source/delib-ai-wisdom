    "review": "The other forecasters raise several important points. Forecaster 2 correctly identifies the March/June discrepancy in the question (though this doesn't materially affect the analysis since we're forecasting for June 2025 per the resolution criteria). More importantly, their base rate calculation (2% uniform baseline across 50 states, elevated for aviation-heavy states) provides a useful anchor. Forecaster 3's framing of Florida as one of 5-8 competitive states is methodologically similar to my approach. All three analyses converge on key points: (1) lack of historical baseline data is a critical limitation, (2) Florida has genuine structural advantages in aviation activity, (3) strong competition exists from California, Texas, and other states, (4) the tie-breaks-to-No rule is restrictive. The forecast range of 12-22% suggests reasonable disagreement about how much weight to give Florida's advantages versus the uncertainty from missing historical data. Reviewing my original 22% forecast, I may have been slightly overconfident in Florida's position without evidence it historically leads this category. California's larger total aviation market is a strong counterargument I didn't fully weight.",
    "rationale": "Upon reflection, I'm updating my forecast downward from 22% to 17%. The key reasons: (1) Without historical data showing Florida typically leads in pilot UFO sightings, I should be more cautious about elevating it significantly above other aviation-heavy states. (2) California almost certainly has higher total aviation volume than Florida, making it at least as strong a contender. (3) The base rate framing (50 states with strong structural variation) suggests that even a top-tier contender should be in the 12-20% range rather than exceeding 20%. (4) Monthly data introduces substantial randomness that could favor any competitive state. I remain above the lowest forecast (12%) because Florida's combination of military aviation, commercial hubs, year-round weather, and coastal geography makes it a legitimate top-tier contender. The 17% forecast represents Florida as one of approximately 5-6 highly competitive states with roughly equal chances, which seems appropriately calibrated given the available information.",
