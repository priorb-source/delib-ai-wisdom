    "review": "My initial forecast and that of Forecaster 2 were closely aligned, both focusing on historical patterns and data from financial aggregators, while noting the missing SEC filing as a point of concern. However, Forecaster 3 introduced a crucial piece of evidence that I had not considered: the SEC's 40-day rule regarding the notice of availability of proxy materials. This rule is not just a guideline; it's a hard procedural constraint. Forecaster 3's reasoning is extremely convincing because it elevates the missing DEF 14A filing from a mere anomaly to a near-dispositive indicator that the meeting cannot legally proceed on June 12. This regulatory requirement is a much stronger piece of evidence than the historical scheduling patterns and unconfirmed media reports that I previously relied upon.",
    "rationale": "I am drastically revising my forecast downwards based on Forecaster 3's argument. My initial 70% probability was based on the assumption that the June 12 date was the status quo and that the missing filing was simply a delay. I failed to appreciate the full regulatory implications of that delay.\n\nForecaster 3 correctly pointed out that under SEC rules (specifically the 'notice and access' model), companies must notify shareholders at least 40 calendar days before a meeting. As of May 27, only 16 days remain until June 12, meaning this deadline has been missed by several weeks. This makes holding the meeting on June 12 procedurally impossible under normal circumstances.\n\nThis single, hard fact outweighs all the soft, pattern-based evidence I previously used. The Bloomberg and Business Insider data are now likely to be outdated placeholders, and the conflicting Computershare date further confirms that the public information is unreliable. The absence of the DEF 14A filing is the most important piece of information, and its implication is now clear. I am lowering my forecast from 70% to 5%, aligning with Forecaster 3. The residual 5% accounts for the very slim possibility of a regulatory waiver, an error in our information about the filing status, or some other highly unusual exception.",
