  "information": "Libya's Economy and Trade Minister, Muhammed Huveyc, announced in May 2025 that the country aims to increase its trade volume with Turkey from $3.7 billion to $10 billion. To facilitate this, joint committees have been established to address issues such as the return of Turkish companies to projects in Libya and the resolution of bank guarantees. The two countries are also working towards eliminating taxes and establishing a free trade zone, with the stated goal of using Libya's strategic location to facilitate the transport of Turkish industrial products to the broader African market.\n\nAs of late April 2025, the African Continental Free Trade Area (AfCFTA) has achieved a 92% consensus on trade rules. Forty-nine of the 54 African countries have joined the agreement, with 23 having commenced implementation of the new trade rules. Supporting infrastructure includes the Pan-African Payment and Settlement System (PAPSS), which now connects over 20 central banks and 160 commercial banks, enabling easier payment for goods in local currencies. Additionally, Afreximbank is organizing specialized training programs to help African businesses understand the AfCFTA's commercial implications and regulatory landscape.\n\nImplementation of the AfCFTA faces several challenges. Six years after its inception, key decisions regarding tariff liberalization and rules of origin remain pending for a number of state parties. Some countries, including South Africa, have not yet submitted full tariff offers for sensitive goods, pending the finalization of rules of origin for key sectors such as automotive and textiles. The deadline for finalizing these rules is October 2025. The overall target for the removal of tariffs on 90% of goods has been moved back to 2034. Some analysts note that production-related challenges, like low industrial output and poor infrastructure, must be addressed before the full benefits of tariff removal can be realized.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "2 months",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No. Libya's political fragmentation, focus on a bilateral trade deal with Turkey, and the short timeframe make an extension of the current non-ratification status the most likely outcome.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "The Libyan government continues to prioritize the finalization of its free trade agreement with Turkey. The complex legislative and political processes required for AfCFTA ratification are not completed amidst ongoing domestic instability and the perception that the AfCFTA's own rules are not yet fully settled. The July 1, 2025 deadline passes without Libya depositing its instrument of ratification.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "A new push for national unity in Libya leads a key political faction to champion AfCFTA ratification as a powerful symbol of the country's stability and reintegration into the African continent. Seeing it as a way to enhance international legitimacy, they successfully fast-track the ratification process through the relevant legislative bodies in a surprise political move before the deadline.",
    "rationale": "My forecast is heavily weighted towards a 'No' outcome due to three main factors. First, the two-month timeframe is extremely short for any coutry to complete the ratification process for a major international treaty, which typically involves extensive legislative and bureaucratic procedures. Second, Libya continues to suffer from significant political fragmentation, making decisive and unified legislative action on such a complex issue highly challenging. Third, the provided intelligence from May 2025 indicates that Libya's immediate and primary trade policy focus is on deepening its bilateral relationship with Turkey, with the goal of establishing a free trade zone. This suggests that political capital and administrative resources are being directed away from the multilateral AfCFTA agenda. The fact that key AfCFTA rules of origin are not expected to be finalized until October 2025 further reduces the urgency for Libya to ratify by July. \n\nMy probability is not lower than 3% because unexpected political developments are always possible in a volatile environment like Libya. A faction could push for ratification as a symbolic act to gain international favor, even if the practical implementation is distant. \n\nMy probability is not higher because the combined obstacles of the short timeline, internal political division, and a clear alternative trade priority (Turkey) present a formidable barrier to ratification. For me to increase my forecast, I would need to see credible news of the ratification bill being formally submitted to a functioning Libyan legislature with broad political backing. Conversely, news of intensified internal conflict or a formal signing of the Turkish free trade agreement would lower my forecast further.",

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any).
