  "information": "In early April 2025, the U.S. administration announced a new trade policy based on 'reciprocal tariffs,' effectively ending the African Growth and Opportunity Act (AGOA) which had allowed many African countries to export goods to the U.S. duty-free. The new policy applies tariffs to approximately 185 countries. The tariff rates are determined by a formula that involves dividing a country's bilateral trade deficit with the U.S. by the amount of U.S. imports from that country, and then dividing the result by two. This policy resulted in varying tariff rates, including 50% for Lesotho and Saint-Pierre and Miquelon, 49% for Cambodia, 46% for Vietnam, 34% for China, and 20% for the European Union. The new tariffs took effect on April 9, 2025, although the U.S. later announced a 90-day pause on introducing new tariffs for some countries, a move not extended to Lesotho.\n\nThe U.S. imposed a 50% tariff on Lesotho due to a significant trade imbalance; in 2024, Lesotho exported approximately $237-240 million worth of goods to the U.S., while importing only about $2.8-3 million from the U.S. The tariff is expected to severely impact Lesotho's economy, particularly its textile and apparel industry, which employs around 40,000 workers and constitutes about 90% of the country's manufacturing employment and exports. In response to the tariff, the Lesotho government announced on April 3, 2025, that it was forming a high-level delegation to travel to Washington to negotiate with U.S. authorities and seek clarification on the tariff's rationale.\n\nThe imposition of new U.S. tariffs prompted various international reactions. The Southern African Development Community (SADC) began assessing the tariffs' impact on the region and planned a high-level summit for June. Within the SADC, Zimbabwe's decision to remove its own tariffs on American imports was criticized by some as undermining regional solidarity. The European Union announced it would delay its own trade countermeasures against the U.S. for 90 days to allow for negotiations. China responded by imposing its own retaliatory tariffs of 34% and filing a formal complaint with the World Trade Organization (WTO).",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Approximately 5-6 weeks (from April 23, 2025 to June 1, 2025)",
    "status_quo_outcome": "Yes - the 50% tariff on Lesotho remains in place",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Lesotho's diplomatic delegation successfully negotiates a tariff reduction or exemption with U.S. authorities, or the U.S. administration extends the 90-day tariff pause to Lesotho, or AGOA benefits are partially reinstated before June 1, resulting in a tariff rate other than 50%.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "The 50% tariff remains unchanged through June 1, 2025. Negotiations either fail to produce results in the limited timeframe, move too slowly through bureaucratic processes, or the U.S. administration maintains its position on reciprocal tariffs based on the trade imbalance formula.",
    "rationale": "The status quo strongly favors a Yes resolution. The 50% tariff was implemented on April 9, 2025, only two weeks ago, and is currently in effect. Critically, Lesotho was explicitly excluded from the 90-day pause that some countries received, suggesting it is not in the priority group for relief. With only 5-6 weeks remaining until the resolution date, there is limited time for substantive policy changes. Trade policy modifications typically require months, not weeks, even when there is political will. While Lesotho has formed a high-level delegation to negotiate, achieving a meaningful policy reversal in this timeframe would be unusual. The tariff is based on a mathematical formula tied to trade imbalances, providing policy justification that would need to be overcome. Factors that could push toward No include: the severe economic impact on Lesotho (40,000 jobs at risk), ongoing diplomatic efforts, and the small size of Lesotho's economy making exemptions politically costless for the U.S. However, the short timeframe, absence of any indication of U.S. willingness to make exceptions, and the administration's apparent commitment to its reciprocal tariff framework all support maintaining the status quo. For me to update significantly lower, I would need to see: explicit statements from U.S. officials indicating willingness to revise Lesotho's tariff, concrete progress in negotiations, or extension of the 90-day pause to Lesotho. For me to update higher, continued silence from U.S. officials or explicit rejection of Lesotho's appeals would increase confidence in the status quo.",

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any).
