    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "About 41 days (until July 1, 2025)",
    "status_quo_outcome": "Yes — Climate.gov remains online and reachable per IsItDownRightNow.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "The Climate.gov domain is decommissioned or its DNS/hosting is changed such that the site becomes unreachable for an extended period around early July; or a prolonged outage/cyber incident/SSL or DNS misconfiguration leaves the site inaccessible when Metaculus checks.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Climate.gov continues normal operations, possibly with content changes, but the domain resolves and returns a reachable response (including redirects) when checked on or after July 1, 2025.",
    "rationale": "- Baseline: As of May 7, 2025, IsItDownRightNow reported Climate.gov as UP. Government domains, especially longstanding ones like NOAA’s Climate.gov, rarely go fully offline; content may be altered or relocated, but domains typically remain live and often redirect if reorganized. The question resolves on or after July 1, which further reduces the risk from brief outages.\n- Political context: The National Security Archive reports removal of climate information across some government websites under the current administration. That raises nonzero risk of content removal or restructuring. However, complete domain takedowns are uncommon; during 2017–2021, many climate pages were altered/archived but primary domains generally stayed reachable. NOAA is a large, operational agency; outright removal of its climate portal within the next six weeks would be notable and likely preceded by public signals.\n- Technical risk: Short-window risks include certificate lapses, DNS changes, hosting migrations, or DDoS. NOAA sites are typically on robust infrastructure with automated cert renewal and CDN support, keeping outage probability low. Because resolution allows a check any time on or after July 1, transient issues are less likely to drive a No.\n- Why not higher: The cited report indicates active changes to climate content, so a deliberate depublication or domain-level redirect/misconfiguration can’t be ruled out. Also, single-source uptime checks can occasionally produce false negatives depending on network path at the time of check.\n- Why not lower: Status quo is stable, the site is currently up, and historical precedent suggests domain persistence even amid policy shifts. Only ~6 weeks remain, further limiting the window for drastic action.\n- What would update me upward: Evidence of active maintenance (new posts in June), explicit NOAA statements committing to Climate.gov’s continuity, or technical indicators of stable hosting/CDN and certificates renewed beyond July.\n- What would update me downward: Credible reporting or official notices about decommissioning/merging Climate.gov, observed multi-hour/days outages in June, DNS/WHOIS changes suggesting domain retirement, certificate problems close to July, or a major NOAA cyber incident.\n- Research assistant input: None beyond the current UP status; no conflicting information identified.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill NOAA's Climate.gov still be online on July 1, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nNational Security Archive: [Disappearing Data: Trump Administration Removing Climate Information from Government Websites](https://nsarchive.gwu.edu/briefing-book/climate-change-transparency-project-foia/2025-02-06/disappearing-data-trump)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if Climate.gov is online according to [Is It Down Right Now?](https://www.isitdownrightnow.com/climate.gov.html) when accessed by Metaculus on or after July 1, 2025.\n\nAs of May 7, 2025, the resolution source returns the message, \"Climate.gov is UP and reachable by us.\"\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nNo additional information available.\n\nToday is 2025-05-21.\n\nBefore answering you think:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n(e) You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
