  "information": "According to the US Census Bureau, the US trade deficit for goods reached a record $162 billion in March 2025, a 9.6% increase from February. This was driven by a surge in imports, which increased by $16.3 billion to $342.7 billion. This rise in imports was attributed to businesses stockpiling goods in anticipation of new tariffs. US exports of goods in March 2025 increased by $2.2 billion to $180.8 billion, a 1.2% increase from February and a 6.8% increase from March 2024.\n\nSweeping new tariffs were implemented by the US administration on April 2, 2025, which were followed by retaliatory measures from multiple countries. Subsequent shipping data showed that China-US bookings were down 45% year-over-year. Additionally, manufacturing PMI reports from the period indicated contracting activity in the sector.\n\nTotal US exports for February 2025 were reported at $278.5 billion. Historical data shows that between 79% and 93% of Aprils have seen a year-over-year gain in exports. The Atlanta Federal Reserve estimated that trade subtracted 3 percentage points from GDP in the first quarter of 2025.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Approximately 5-6 weeks. The Census Bureau typically releases monthly trade data about 5-6 weeks after month-end, so April 2025 data should be released in early to mid-June 2025.",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No - exports likely fall below the threshold due to tariff disruptions",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "The tariffs implemented on April 2, 2025, combined with retaliatory measures from trading partners, significantly disrupt export activity throughout most of April. The 45% year-over-year drop in China-US shipping bookings reflects a broader collapse in export demand. Manufacturing contraction reduces available goods for export. Total April 2025 exports fall to around $250-260 billion, below the $262.578 billion threshold.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Despite tariffs taking effect on April 2, substantial export activity for April was already contracted and in motion before the tariff announcement. Exporters rushed shipments before retaliatory measures fully materialized. Services exports, which are less affected by goods tariffs, remain robust at around $95-100 billion. Goods exports stay near March levels ($180-185 billion). Total April exports reach $265-270 billion, exceeding the threshold.",
    "rationale": "Historical baseline strongly favors growth: 79-93% of Aprils show year-over-year export increases. However, April 2025 faces unprecedented headwinds. The critical factor is that tariffs were implemented on April 2, affecting 28 of 30 days in the month. The research shows March 2025 goods exports were $180.8 billion, and February 2025 total exports were $278.5 billion, suggesting services contribute roughly $95-100 billion monthly. The threshold of $262.578 billion implies April 2024 total exports were at this level. Key negative indicators: (1) China-US shipping bookings down 45% year-over-year - this is catastrophic for a major trade partner; (2) Manufacturing PMI showing contraction; (3) Retaliatory tariffs from multiple countries; (4) Trade already subtracted 3 percentage points from Q1 GDP. The March surge in imports reflected front-loading before tariffs, but this doesn't help April exports. For Yes outcome, April would need approximately $180 billion in goods exports (matching March) plus $95 billion in services. The 45% China booking drop suggests goods exports could fall significantly below March levels, potentially to $160-170 billion. Even with stable services, this yields only $255-270 billion total. The probability is not lower because: services exports are more tariff-resistant; some April contracts were locked in pre-tariff; historical April strength. The probability is not higher because: the shipping data is devastating; tariffs hit early in April; retaliation was swift; manufacturing is contracting. I would revise upward if preliminary trade data or shipping indicators showed resilience in non-China trade, or if services export strength was confirmed. I would revise downward if additional data showed broader export collapse beyond China.",
