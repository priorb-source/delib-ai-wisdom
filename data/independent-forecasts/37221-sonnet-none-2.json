    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Approximately 1-2 weeks. The Eurostat flash estimate for April 2025 Eurozone inflation is typically released in late April or the first few days of May. Since today is April 28, 2025, the official data should be published very soon.",
    "status_quo_outcome": "Inflation at or below 2.2%. The background information indicates that eurozone inflation saw downward revisions in February 2025, suggesting a disinflationary trend. The European Central Bank targets 2% inflation, and recent patterns have shown inflation declining from 2022-2023 peaks. The status quo suggests inflation is likely hovering around the 2% target level.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "April 2025 inflation comes in at or below 2.2%, continuing the downward trend observed in recent months. This could be driven by moderating energy prices, weak consumer demand in the Eurozone, continued effects of ECB monetary tightening, favorable base effects, and stable supply chains. The disinflationary momentum continues as the economy adjusts to higher interest rates.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "April 2025 inflation exceeds 2.2% due to unexpected factors such as a spike in energy prices, stronger-than-expected wage growth feeding through to consumer prices, renewed supply chain disruptions, a weaker euro increasing import prices, or temporary seasonal effects. Monthly volatility in inflation readings could also push the rate just above the 2.2% threshold.",
    "rationale": "This is a very short-term forecast where the April data essentially already exists but has not yet been officially published. The key evidence points toward a lower probability of exceeding 2.2%: (1) The background information explicitly mentions 'downward revisions' to February inflation, indicating recent readings came in softer than expected, (2) The general trend in European inflation has been declining from peaks toward the ECB's 2% target, (3) The 2.2% threshold is only slightly above the target, suggesting we're asking about a relatively low bar. However, I'm not assigning an extremely low probability because: (1) Monthly inflation readings have inherent volatility and can surprise, (2) Energy prices can fluctuate significantly month-to-month, (3) The threshold is very specific and small variations matter, (4) Without access to preliminary April indicators or high-frequency data, there remains genuine uncertainty. For me to update higher, I would need evidence of: unexpected energy price spikes in April, stronger wage or services inflation data, or preliminary estimates suggesting inflation came in hot. For me to update lower, I would need: preliminary flash estimates showing inflation well below 2.2%, confirmation of further energy price declines, or economic data showing continued demand weakness in the Eurozone.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill the Euro Area Inflation Rate be above 2.2% for April 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nEuro News: [Euro falls as eurozone inflation sees downward revisions in February](https://www.euronews.com/business/2025/03/19/euro-falls-as-eurozone-inflation-sees-downward-revisions-in-february)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if the Eurozone inflation rate for April 2025 is above 2.2% on an annualized basis according to [Trading Economics](https://tradingeconomics.com/euro-area/inflation-cpi).\n\n\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nNo additional information available.\n\nToday is 2025-04-28.\n\nBefore answering you think:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n(e) You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
