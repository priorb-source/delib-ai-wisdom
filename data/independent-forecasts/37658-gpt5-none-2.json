    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "About 46 days (until July 1, 2025)",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No — the merger remains pending under regulatory review with no termination 8-K filed by July 1, 2025.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "CFIUS and other reviews continue or are extended; the parties amend/extend the outside date or simply await a decision. No SEC Form 8-K announcing termination or abandonment is filed before July 1.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "CFIUS signals a block (or the White House issues/telegraphs an adverse decision), leading one or both parties to terminate and file an 8-K; alternatively, an outside date hits in June and the parties choose not to extend and file an 8-K termination.",
    "rationale": "- Baseline/inertia: The most likely near-term path is continued review rather than a decisive termination within the next ~6 weeks. Complex cross‑border deals often extend timelines, especially when the main gate is CFIUS rather than antitrust. The status quo favors “no 8-K termination by July 1.”\n- Regulatory posture: Antitrust risks appear limited; the central risk is CFIUS/political. Although the deal has drawn unusually strong opposition (USW, bipartisan politicians, presidential statements in 2024), Japan is a close ally and mitigation (security, governance, supply commitments) is plausible. That makes an outright, near-term kill less likely than a protracted negotiation or extension.\n- Incentives/frictions: Shareholders approved; both sides have invested heavily. Break-up fees and reputational costs discourage walking away absent a clear regulatory block. If an outside date near June 2025 exists, parties commonly extend rather than terminate if they believe approval remains feasible.\n- Timing: To resolve “Yes,” we need an actual SEC Form 8-K termination before July 1. Even if the deal is in jeopardy, formal termination on that short fuse is less likely than continued review or an extension.\n- Why not higher: A definitive CFIUS block or presidential decision within the next 46 days is uncertain; absent that, parties have reason to wait or extend. The need for a formal 8-K termination by July 1 sets a high bar.\n- Why not lower: Political/worker opposition is unusually intense for a friendly-allied acquirer in a strategic industry. If CFIUS signals a negative recommendation or the outside date (potentially mid-to-late June depending on amendments) arrives without an extension, termination could happen quickly, triggering the required 8-K.\n- What would move me up: Credible reporting that CFIUS intends to recommend a block; White House statements foreshadowing prohibition; company filings hinting they won’t extend an imminent outside date; material adverse legal rulings or union-triggered roadblocks the parties deem unacceptable.\n- What would move me down: Indications of a CFIUS mitigation framework nearing agreement; formal extension of any outside date beyond July; supportive or neutral White House signals; new commitments with the union reducing political risk.\n- Research assistant summary: No new information provided; the forecast relies on known deal dynamics, typical regulatory timelines, and the short time window to July 1.\n",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill the US Steel/Nippon Steel merger collapse before July 1, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nWikipedia: [Proposed acquisition of U.S. Steel by Nippon Steel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proposed_acquisition_of_U.S._Steel_by_Nippon_Steel)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question will resolve as **Yes** if, before July 1, 2025, either U.S. Steel or Nippon Steel files an SEC Form 8-K announcing the merger agreement's termination or abandonment.\n\n\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nNo additional information available.\n\nToday is 2025-05-16.\n\nBefore answering you think:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n(e) You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
