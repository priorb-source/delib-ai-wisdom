    "review": "The other forecasters and I are in strong agreement, identifying the central conflict between Glastonbury's counter-cultural identity and the severe legal and political pressure stemming from the terrorism charge. We all arrived at forecasts in a narrow 35-40% range, indicating a clear consensus on the key factors. I found two points raised by the other forecasters particularly convincing. Forecaster 2's emphasis on Glastonbury's practical need to 'work closely with police and authorities' highlights a crucial operational reality that could override ideological commitments. Forecaster 3's insight that the charge provides the organizers with a 'strong, legally-grounded justification for cancellation' is also key; it gives them a defensible 'off-ramp' to cancel the performance without being seen as caving to political pressure over artistic expression. Both of these arguments reinforce and strengthen the case for a 'No' outcome.",
    "rationale": "My initial forecast was 35%. After reviewing the other analyses, I am lowering my forecast slightly. The reasoning provided by my colleagues, while aligning with my own, adds important nuance that strengthens the argument for cancellation. The practical necessity of maintaining a good working relationship with police and security services at an event of this scale, as highlighted by Forecaster 2, is a powerful constraint. Furthermore, the point made by Forecaster 3 that the terrorism charge provides Glastonbury a justifiable 'off-ramp' makes the decision to cancel much easier for them politically and reputationally. They can frame the cancellation as a response to a serious legal proceeding, rather than an act of censorship. These factors make it more probable that the organizers will choose the path of risk mitigation. While I continue to believe Glastonbury's commitment to defying pressure is a significant factor keeping the probability from being lower, these additional considerations persuade me that a cancellation is slightly more likely than I initially assessed. Therefore, I am decreasing my forecast by 5 percentage points.",
