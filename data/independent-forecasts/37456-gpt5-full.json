  "information": "On March 28, 2025, Cargill Kitchen Solutions recalled approximately 212,268 pounds of liquid egg products, including items under the Egg Beaters and Bob Evans brands. The recall was due to potential contamination with sodium hypochlorite, a cleaning solution. The affected products were produced on March 12 and 13, 2025, have 'use by' dates in August 2025 and March 2026, and bear the establishment number 'G1804' on the carton. The products were shipped to distributors in Ohio and Texas and for foodservice use in at least six other states, with potential for nationwide distribution.\n\nThe U.S. Department of Agriculture’s Food Safety and Inspection Service (FSIS) has designated this a Class III recall. This classification is used when the use of or exposure to a violative product is not likely to cause adverse health consequences. No adverse health effects or illnesses have been reported in connection with the consumption of these products. Cargill stated the recall was issued 'out of an abundance of caution.'\n\nHistorical data on FSIS recalls shows that resolution times vary based on classification and complexity. Class I (high-risk) recalls typically close in 2-4 months. Class III recalls often close within 1-3 months, with a median time of approximately 90 days. However, recalls that span multiple states, involve large product volumes, or are distributed through institutional foodservice channels frequently take longer to resolve. The extended shelf life of some of the recalled products, until March 2026, is another factor that can complicate and lengthen the verification process.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "About 55 days (until July 1, 2025)",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No — the FSIS page still shows the recall as Active on/after July 1, 2025.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Effectiveness checks and product disposition take longer than expected due to multi-state distribution, foodservice channels, and long shelf-life lots (into 2026). FSIS keeps the case Active into July, possibly due to an administrative lag or a recall expansion/update.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Cargill completes retrieval and effectiveness checks quickly; FSIS verifies that product is out of commerce and posts the case as Closed in mid-to-late June 2025, with no expansions or adverse events.",
    "rationale": "Baseline: This is an FSIS Class III recall (low risk) posted Mar 28, 2025, ~212k lbs of liquid eggs (Egg Beaters, Bob Evans), produced Mar 12–13, shipped to distributors in OH/TX and to foodservice in at least six other states, potentially wider. No illnesses; unapproved substance (sodium hypochlorite). Class III recalls often close in 1–3 months with a median around ~90 days per the research assistant. The question asks if it will be Closed before Jul 1 (~95 days post-announcement). That’s right around the historical median.\nPush toward Yes: Class III, no reported illnesses, a capable firm (Cargill) that likely can execute effectiveness checks and documentation rapidly. Many Class III recalls do close in ~2–3 months. If there’s no expansion and FSIS processing is routine, a mid-to-late June closure is plausible.\nPush toward No: Distribution through foodservice channels in multiple states increases verification complexity. The reported long shelf lives (some lots into Mar 2026) can extend retrieval/verification timelines. FSIS sometimes posts closures later due to administrative lags even after company actions are substantially complete. Any scope expansion or update would push closure past July.\nStatus quo weighting: Today (May 7) the recall remains Active, and the world often changes slower than we hope. With ~55 days left, closure would need to occur close to the historical median. Given the added complexity (multi-state, foodservice, long shelf life), I tilt slightly below 50% despite the low-risk classification and strong company.\nWhy not higher: The long shelf life and multi-state foodservice distribution create tail risk for slower close; administrative timing can also delay the status change past July.\nWhy not lower: It’s a Class III with no illnesses; many such recalls close within the 90-day window, and a large, experienced firm increases execution speed.\nUpdates that would raise my forecast: Evidence of rapid, high-rate product accounting/recovery; FSIS weekly updates indicating effectiveness checks nearing completion; no expansions by early June.\nUpdates that would lower my forecast: Any recall expansion, additional distribution states identified, or FSIS updates indicating ongoing effectiveness checks into late June; reports of lingering product in commerce or administrative delays.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill the USDA-posted recall by Cargill Kitchen Solutions of its liquid egg product for an unapproved substance issued March 28, 2025 be closed before July 1, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nABC News: [Liquid eggs recalled due to potential cleaning solution contamination](https://abcnews.go.com/GMA/Food/liquid-eggs-recalled-due-potential-cleaning-solution-contamination/story?id=120329600)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if the status of the recall posted by the U.S. Department of Agriculture’s Food Safety and Inspection Service (FSIS) is changed from Active to Closed on [this page](https://www.fsis.usda.gov/recalls-alerts/cargill-kitchen-solutions-recalls-liquid-egg-products-due-unapproved-substance) before July 1, 2025. If the recall is still shown as Active when the link is accessed by Metaculus on or after July 1, 2025, this question resolves as **No**.\n\n\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nOn March 28, 2025, Cargill Kitchen Solutions recalled approximately 212,268 pounds of liquid egg products, including items under the Egg Beaters and Bob Evans brands.

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
