    "review": "Both forecasters provide well-reasoned analyses that largely align with my own assessment. Forecaster 3 introduces valuable new information I hadn't explicitly considered: Reform UK's 23-25% national polling, a Telegraph MRP showing regional strength, and John Curtice's observation about geographic concentration potentially improving seat efficiency. Forecaster 2 importantly highlights candidate vetting issues and emphasizes the historical base rate of UKIP/Brexit Party failures to win council control despite national prominence. All three of us converge on 2-3%, suggesting strong agreement on fundamentals. However, I find Forecaster 3's point about Labour being the likely main beneficiary of Conservative decline particularly compelling - this suggests the primary dynamic is Conservative-to-Labour swing, not Conservative-to-Reform, which makes Reform's already difficult path even harder. The 23-25% national polling and full slate are meaningful positives for Reform, but they don't overcome the fundamental structural barriers: zero starting seats, 10-day timeframe, FPTP inefficiency for new parties, lack of local infrastructure, and the clear historical precedent that insurgent parties fail to win council control even at peak national support.",
    "rationale": "After reviewing both analyses, I remain convinced that 2% is the appropriate forecast. While Forecaster 3's additional information about Reform UK's 23-25% national polling and full candidate slate represents marginally positive news, these factors are insufficient to overcome the extraordinary structural barriers. The core challenge remains unchanged: Reform UK must win at least 33 seats from a starting position of zero in just 10 days through a FPTP system that heavily penalizes new parties without concentrated support and local organization. Forecaster 3's observation that Labour, not Reform, is favored to be the largest party is crucial - it indicates the main electoral dynamic is Conservative-to-Labour swing, relegating Reform to potentially splitting the anti-incumbent vote rather than consolidating it. The historical base rate cited by Forecaster 2 is dispositive: UKIP at its peak, despite strong national polling and full slates, never won control of a county council. Recent by-election evidence shows Reform gaining vote share but achieving poor seat conversion. The combination of incumbency advantage, FPTP inefficiency, lack of local infrastructure, candidate vetting issues, and only 10 days remaining makes a Reform UK plurality virtually impossible. The 2-3% range properly captures tail-risk scenarios (major scandal, unprecedented voter realignment) while acknowledging the overwhelming probability of a No outcome.",
