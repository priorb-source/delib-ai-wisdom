    "review": "All three forecasters independently arrived at exactly 30%, which is remarkable and suggests we're calibrating to similar base rates despite the critical information gap. The other forecasters reinforced key constraints I identified: the short timeframe (46 days remaining), the aggressive implementation pace required (22-24 objectives/month), and the fundamental uncertainty about current baseline data. Forecaster 2's explicit scenarios for updating (increase if current count >100, decrease if <50) helpfully quantifies how current data would shift our estimates. Both forecasters emphasized procedural requirements, legal challenges, and bureaucratic processes - all valid constraints on rapid implementation. However, none of us provided fundamentally new information that dramatically changes the calculus. The convergence at 30% could represent either genuine calibration to base rates or potential anchoring.",
    "rationale": "The unanimous 30% forecast reflects appropriate uncertainty given missing baseline data. The critical unknown is the current count of Done objectives. Simple math shows: if currently at 110, reaching 120 is very likely; if at 40, it's very unlikely. Without this data, we're estimating the probability distribution of where the tracker currently stands. Key factors supporting 30%: (1) 5.5 months for policy implementation is relatively short, even for an aggressive administration; (2) Keep_Track's reputation for thorough documentation suggests rigorous 'Done' criteria; (3) Many meaningful policy changes require procedural steps that take months; (4) Legal challenges can block or delay implementation. Factors that could justify higher: some objectives may be simple executive actions already completed; the administration may prioritize Project 2025 specifically; 120 might represent a modest fraction of total objectives. Given the reinforcement of these constraints by other forecasters and no new decisive information, I maintain my forecast. The tight convergence at 30% suggests this reasonably captures our collective uncertainty.",
