    "review": "My initial forecast was overly cautious, focusing on global headwinds without considering key domestic and high-frequency data. Forecaster 2's analysis was convincing in highlighting the acceleration of year-over-year growth from January to April, which provides a significant buffer and momentum. This detail strengthens the case for inertia more than my initial analysis did. Forecaster 3 provided the most critical new evidence: positive ISM and S&P Global manufacturing PMIs for May 2025. This is direct, timely data for the month in question. Their argument that these immediate activity indicators should be weighted more heavily than broader, forward-looking negative signals like the LEI for a one-month forecast is highly persuasive and directly addresses the core of the question.",
    "rationale": "I am significantly increasing my forecast based on the new evidence presented, particularly the positive May PMI data from Forecaster 3. My initial 65% forecast was based on the April data point and general global risks, but it lacked specific, timely evidence for May. The fact that manufacturing PMIs — a reliable leading indicator for industrial production — were in expansionary territory for May provides a strong signal that the largest component of the index was growing. This, combined with the accelerating positive momentum and a significant +1.49% year-over-year buffer from April as highlighted by Forecaster 2, makes a drop into negative territory highly unlikely in a single month. The countervailing factors, such as the drop in the LEI and the narrow base of growth, are valid concerns but are more likely to impact the trend in subsequent months rather than cause a sharp reversal in May. I am therefore updating my forecast from 65% to 78%, reflecting a much higher confidence in a 'Yes' outcome due to the direct, positive evidence for May's economic activity.",
