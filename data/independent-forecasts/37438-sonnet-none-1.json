    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Approximately 57 days from May 5, 2025 to July 1, 2025",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No - ChargePoint continues operations without filing for bankruptcy",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "ChargePoint manages its cash position through June 30, 2025, potentially through cost-cutting measures, securing additional financing, debt restructuring, or continuing normal operations. The company maintains sufficient liquidity to meet its obligations and avoids triggering any covenants that would force a bankruptcy filing.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "ChargePoint faces an acute liquidity crisis within the next two months due to inability to raise capital, breach of debt covenants, or unexpected cash burn. The company determines that bankruptcy protection is the best option to restructure obligations and files under Chapter 11 or Chapter 7 before July 1, 2025.",
    "rationale": "The status quo strongly favors a No outcome. ChargePoint just reported Q4 and full fiscal year 2025 results, suggesting normal corporate operations continue. With only 57 days until the resolution date, a bankruptcy filing would require an extremely rapid deterioration in financial condition. Base rate considerations are critical here: the vast majority of publicly-traded companies do not file for bankruptcy in any given two-month period. While ChargePoint operates in the challenging EV charging infrastructure sector which has faced headwinds, companies typically show clear warning signs before bankruptcy (missed debt payments, going concern warnings, exchange delisting notices, credit downgrades) well before filing. The absence of such signals in the available information, combined with recent financial reporting, suggests operations are continuing. My forecast is not higher because: (1) ChargePoint is in a capital-intensive industry with known cash burn issues, (2) the EV charging sector has seen consolidation and company failures, and (3) without access to the detailed financial results, I cannot rule out severe distress. My forecast is not lower because: (1) the extremely short timeframe makes rapid collapse unlikely, (2) recent financial reporting suggests ongoing operations, and (3) no specific distress signals are mentioned. I would update higher if: ChargePoint announced going concern warnings, missed debt payments, or received exchange delisting notices. I would update lower if: they announced new financing, showed improving cash flows, or provided positive guidance through mid-2025.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill ChargePoint file for bankruptcy before July 1, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\n[ChargePoint Reports Fourth Quarter and Full Fiscal Year 2025 Financial Results](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1777393/000177739325000009/chpt8-kerfy2025q4exx991.htm)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question will resolve as **Yes** if ChargePoint Holdings, Inc., files any petition for bankruptcy protection in the United States, under any chapter of the United States Bankruptcy Code, before July 1, 2025. The question will resolves on the filing of such a petition, not on whether any bankruptcy protection is granted by a court. If no such petition is filed by that date, this question will resolve as **No**.\n\n\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nNo additional information available.\n\nToday is 2025-05-05.\n\nBefore answering you think:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n(e) You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
