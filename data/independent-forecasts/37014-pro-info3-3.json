  "information": "The election uses a first-past-the-post voting system. Political analyst John Curtice has stated that Reform UK's support is too thinly spread to translate effectively into winning individual seats. For comparison, the peak performance for UKIP in a Kent County Council election was winning 17 seats.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Approximately 2 weeks",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No. The Conservative Party would comfortably remain the largest party on Kent County Council, and Reform UK would win few, if any, seats.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Reform UK's nationwide popularity does not translate into a plurality of seats in Kent. Their support is too thinly spread across the county's divisions to overcome the first-past-the-post electoral system. The Conservative Party retains enough of its vote share to remain the largest party, while Reform wins a number of seats comparable to UKIP's peak performance of 17, but not enough to be the largest party.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "A collapse of the Conservative vote in Kent leads to a direct and concentrated swing to Reform UK. The party's campaign successfully targets specific divisions, allowing them to overcome the inefficiencies of their vote distribution under the first-past-the-post system. This results in a political earthquake, with Reform UK winning a plurality of seats and taking control of the council.",
    "rationale": "My forecast is based on the significant structural barriers facing Reform UK, despite favorable polling. The status quo is a large Conservative majority (61 of 81 seats), a very high bar for a new party to overcome. The primary reason for my low probability is the first-past-the-post voting system. As noted by political analyst John Curtice, this system punishes parties whose support is evenly distributed rather than geographically concentrated. For Reform to win the most seats, they would need not just high overall support, but for that support to be efficiently clustered in a large number of individual divisions. The historical precedent for a right-wing populist party, UKIP, saw them peak at just 17 seats in a Kent County Council election, which would be insufficient to become the largest party. The Electoral Calculus poll predicting a Reform victory is a significant piece of counter-evidence, but predictive models of local elections are subject to large margins of error, especially when forecasting such a dramatic and unprecedented swing. My forecast is not lower than 15% because the national political environment is highly volatile, and the poll, combined with Reform's high national standing, indicates a non-trivial possibility of a major political realignment that cannot be entirely dismissed. Kent has historically been fertile ground for populist movements. My forecast is not higher because the structural and historical evidence against such an outcome is very strong and outweighs a single poll's projection. I would increase my forecast if I saw more granular, division-level polling showing concentrated Reform support or a wave of local Conservative councillor defections. I would decrease it if polling suggested the Conservative vote was solidifying closer to the election.",
