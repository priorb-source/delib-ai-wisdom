  "information": "Muqtada al-Sadr has a history of reversing decisions to boycott elections. He previously reversed boycotts in 2014 and 2021. The 2021 reversal occurred in mid-August, approximately two months before the election. Despite his current boycott, al-Sadr has urged his followers to update their voter registration records. Some political sources have discussed the possibility of al-Sadr participating indirectly through an independent list to maintain influence, a strategy he has used in the past. In June 2022, after his party won 73 seats in the 2021 election, he ordered his entire parliamentary bloc to resign.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Less than 2 months.",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No. Muqtada al-Sadr's bloc is officially boycotting the election and he has reaffirmed this stance.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Muqtada al-Sadr maintains his boycott, calculating that he can exert more pressure and influence from outside the formal political system. He either makes no announcement or explicitly reaffirms his non-participation before the July 1, 2025 deadline, believing the political conditions are not right for his return.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "In a move consistent with his past political strategy, al-Sadr makes a dramatic, last-minute reversal of his decision. He announces before July 1, 2025, that his party will contest the elections, framing the decision as a response to popular demand or a necessity to combat corruption and reform the state.",
    "rationale": "My forecast places significant weight on Muqtada al-Sadr's established pattern of political behavior over his current stated position. While the status quo is a boycott, which he dramatically initiated by withdrawing his entire parliamentary bloc in 2022, the evidence suggests a reversal is more likely than not. The most influential piece of information is al-Sadr's history of reversing election boycotts, as seen in both 2014 and 2021. The 2021 reversal, which occurred just two months before the election, provides a strong precedent for a last-minute change of heart within the current timeframe before the July 1, 2025 deadline. Furthermore, his recent call for followers to update their voter registration is a concrete action that strongly signals he is preparing his base for participation. This act is inconsistent with a genuine, long-term boycott. My forecast is not higher because the 2022 withdrawal from parliament was an unprecedented step, indicating a potentially deeper disillusionment with the system than in the past. There is also a non-trivial chance he intends to participate but will deliberately miss the July 1 deadline for his announcement to maximize political leverage, which would cause this question to resolve as 'No'. My forecast is not lower because the combination of historical precedent and the costly signal of voter registration preparation makes a reversal the most probable scenario. A prolonged absence from parliament risks ceding significant ground to his Shi'a rivals in the Coordination Framework, an outcome he is likely motivated to avoid. I would increase my forecast if credible reports emerge of Sadrists negotiating electoral alliances, and I would decrease it if al-Sadr makes a new, unequivocal statement recommitting to the boycott.",

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower.
