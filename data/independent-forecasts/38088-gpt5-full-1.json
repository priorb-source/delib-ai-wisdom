  "information": "As of April 30, 2025, the 250th-ranked person on the Bloomberg Billionaires Index was Giancarlo Devasini of Italy. As of May 29, 2025, the position was occupied by Vladimir Potanin of Russia.\n\nAnalysis of the Bloomberg Billionaires Index indicates several distribution patterns. U.S. representation is strongest in the top tiers but diminishes at lower rankings. In the 200-300 range, approximately 62% of positions are occupied by non-U.S. billionaires. Over the past year, overall U.S. representation in the top 500 has reportedly declined from 40% to around 35%. Some analyses suggest a seasonal variability, with U.S. billionaires showing stronger representation in the fourth quarter and weaker representation in the first and second quarters.\n\nIn late May 2025, several economic developments were reported. The US Consumer Confidence Index rebounded to a four-year high in May after falling to a five-year low the previous month, an improvement attributed to the temporary suspension of tariffs. US stock indexes, including the S&P 500 and Nasdaq, rose in anticipation of major tech earnings reports. The EU was given until July 9 to reach a trade deal with the US, a delay that experts considered a positive market signal. A prior 90-day delay in raising import tariffs led to a record $304 billion increase in the combined wealth of the world's richest people, according to the Bloomberg Billionaire Index.",

    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "About 33 days (until July 1, 2025)",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No — as of May 29, 2025, the 250th spot is held by Vladimir Potanin (Russia)",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "The 250th rank remains occupied by a non-U.S. billionaire through normal day-to-day fluctuations, consistent with the 200–300 band being majority non-U.S.; modest market moves, commodity price support, or FX effects keep a non-U.S. name at #250 on July 1.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "U.S. equities and/or USD strength outpace the rest of the world into late June, or a U.S. mid-tier billionaire’s marked-to-market holdings rise relative to peers; on July 1 the #250 slot is a U.S. name due to incremental wealth gains or list rebalancing.",
    "rationale": "Base rate: In the 200–300 range, roughly 62% of slots are non-U.S., implying about a 38% chance that any given position (including #250) is U.S. This aligns with recent snapshots: on Apr 30 #250 was Italian (Devasini) and on May 29 it’s Russian (Potanin). The research assistant also notes U.S. representation in the top 500 has declined from ~40% to ~35% over the past year, reinforcing a tilt away from U.S. at this depth of the list.\n\nTime horizon and volatility: There’s about a month to go, and the #250 position can change frequently with markets, FX, and private valuation updates. However, absent a strong, sustained U.S.-specific tailwind, the distributional base rate should dominate. Even with positive U.S. market sentiment into late May, mid-tier U.S. names around #250 are a minority.\n\nWhy not higher: (1) The immediate status quo is non-U.S. at #250. (2) The 200–300 tranche is majority non-U.S. (~62%). (3) Reported trend of declining U.S. share in the top 500 suggests headwinds to a U.S. median by mid-2025. Together these argue for a probability below 50%.\n\nWhy not lower: (1) The base rate still leaves a substantial ~38% U.S. share in this band. (2) Single-day resolution introduces noise; a modest U.S. outperformance or USD strength could tip #250 to a U.S. name on July 1. (3) Equity-driven fortunes (common among U.S. billionaires) can move quickly near such cutoffs.\n\nKey update triggers:\n- Upward (toward Yes): Sustained outperformance of U.S. equities vs. non-U.S. through late June; USD appreciation vs. major currencies; notable gains among mid-cap U.S. public names tied to billionaires near the cutoff; Bloomberg methodology or valuation updates favoring U.S. private holdings.\n- Downward (toward No): Outperformance of commodities or non-U.S. markets (benefiting resource/EM tycoons); USD weakness; additional evidence that U.S. share in ranks 200–300 is shrinking; multiple consecutive snapshots with clearly non-U.S. holders clustered around #245–255.\n\nSummary of assistant’s input used: Recent occupants at #250 were non-U.S. (Italy, then Russia); the 200–300 band is ~62% non-U.S.; U.S. share of the top 500 has declined year over year; recent market sentiment has improved but may not be sufficient to offset base rates over a one-month window.\n\nTaking the base rate (~38%) and modestly balancing recent market optimism against the declining U.S. share and current non-U.S. status, I forecast a probability close to the base rate.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill the median person on Bloomberg's Billionaires Index be from the United States on July 1, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nOn April 30, 2025, the 250th-ranked name on the list was Giancarlo Devasini of Italy\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if the person ranked 250th on the Bloomberg Billionaires Index (available at [this link](https://www.bloomberg.com/billionaires/)) is listed as being from the United States, when accessed by Metaculus Admins on or after July 1, 2025. It resolves as **No** if the 250th-ranked person is from any other country.\n\nFor purposes of this question, the \"median\" from the question's title is defined as the 250th ranked person on the Bloomberg Billionaires Index, no matter how many are on the list.\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nAs of April 30, 2025, the 250th-ranked person on the Bloomberg Billionaires Index was Giancarlo Devasini of Italy.

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
