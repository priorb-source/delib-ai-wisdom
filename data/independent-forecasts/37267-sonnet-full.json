  "information": "Ethiopia's travel advisory from the US State Department is currently 'Level 3 – Reconsider Travel'. This was confirmed by multiple news reports from early May 2025 and a review on April 30, 2025, which did not place Ethiopia on the list of 21 countries with a 'Level 4' advisory. The State Department last downgraded Ethiopia from Level 4 to Level 3 in early 2023. While the nationwide advisory is Level 3, specific regions within Ethiopia, including Tigray and parts of Amhara, Oromia, Gambella, and Benishangul-Gumuz, carry a Level 4 warning due to localized conflicts.\n\nThe US State Department advisory system has four tiers: Level 1 (Exercise Normal Precautions), Level 2 (Exercise Increased Caution), Level 3 (Reconsider Travel), and Level 4 (Do Not Travel). As of early May 2025, 21 countries were under a Level 4 advisory for reasons including terrorism, civil unrest, war, and health emergencies. Historically, out of the 25–35 countries typically at Level 3, only 2–4 are upgraded to Level 4 in a given year. Upgrades from Level 3 to Level 4 often follow clear catalysts such as coups, invasions, airport closures, hostage incidents involving foreigners, or the ordered departure of non-essential U.S. embassy staff.\n\nOn May 1, 2025, the U.S. announced sanctions related to renewed violence in the Tigray and Amhara regions. Ethiopia has neighboring countries, specifically Sudan and South Sudan, that are already under a Level 4 advisory. As of early May 2025, there have been no reports of a new nationwide offensive, a coup attempt, or a mass-casualty event involving foreigners since the sanctions were announced.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Approximately 2 months (from May 2, 2025 to July 1, 2025)",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No - Ethiopia maintains its current Level 3 advisory status",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Ethiopia maintains its Level 3 advisory through July 1, 2025. The regional conflicts in Tigray and Amhara remain localized with existing regional Level 4 warnings in place. No major nationwide incidents occur, and the security situation remains stable enough that the State Department sees no need to upgrade the nationwide advisory. The US embassy continues normal operations.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "A major security incident triggers an upgrade to Level 4, such as: expansion of regional conflicts to Addis Ababa or other major cities creating nationwide instability; a coup attempt or severe political upheaval; mass casualty events involving foreign nationals; closure of the international airport or major evacuation events; or ordered departure of non-essential US embassy personnel. Such catalysts would prompt the State Department to upgrade Ethiopia to Level 4.",
    "rationale": "The base rate strongly favors maintaining Level 3 status. Historically, only 2-4 countries out of 25-35 Level 3 countries are upgraded to Level 4 annually (roughly 7-13% per year, or 1-2% over two months). Most critically, the State Department just conducted a review on April 30, 2025—only two days ago—and explicitly maintained Ethiopia at Level 3. This recent affirmation is a very strong signal that current conditions, including the ongoing regional conflicts and recent sanctions, are not deemed severe enough for a Level 4 designation. The State Department's decision to downgrade Ethiopia from Level 4 to Level 3 in early 2023 suggests a trajectory of improvement, not deterioration. Regional conflicts in Tigray, Amhara, Oromia, Gambella, and Benishangul-Gumuz already have specific Level 4 warnings, meaning travelers are already being told not to travel to these areas. This regional approach allows the State Department to calibrate warnings precisely without needing to upgrade the entire country. However, there are concerning factors: the May 1, 2025 sanctions announcement indicates renewed violence, suggesting conditions may be deteriorating. Ethiopia has neighbors (Sudan, South Sudan) under Level 4 advisories, showing regional instability. The country has been at Level 4 before, so such an upgrade is not unprecedented. For my forecast to move higher, I would need to see: clear signs of conflict spreading to Addis Ababa or major cities; reports of ordered departure for US embassy staff; airport closures or major evacuation events; or incidents specifically targeting foreigners. For my forecast to move lower, I would need confirmation of de-escalation in conflict zones or further explicit State Department statements affirming Level 3 status. Given the very recent review maintaining Level 3, the low historical base rate of upgrades, and the absence of major catalysts, but acknowledging some elevated regional tensions, I assess a 12% probability.",
