    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Approximately 40 days until July 1, 2025",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Databricks continues with its current strategy of delaying its IPO, as indicated by the CEO's recent statement that 'it's dumb to IPO this year'. The company does not file an S-1 form or make any IPO announcement on its website through June 30, 2025, waiting for more favorable market conditions or achieving additional internal milestones.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Databricks experiences a sudden shift in strategic priorities or market conditions that make an IPO attractive in the near term. This could be driven by competitive pressures, unexpected acquisition interest requiring a defensive IPO, improved market conditions for tech IPOs, or pressure from investors. The company files an S-1 or announces IPO plans on their website before July 1, 2025.",
    "rationale": "The timeframe is extremely short at only 40 days. The CEO's recent public statement that 'it's dumb to IPO this year' is a strong signal against an IPO in 2025, and we're already in late May. IPO processes typically require months of preparation, including financial audits, S-1 drafting, roadshows, and regulatory reviews. While companies sometimes prepare S-1 filings confidentially, the CEO's public stance makes it highly unlikely they would announce within this narrow window. The status quo strongly favors No given: (1) explicit CEO opposition to 2025 IPO, (2) insufficient time for typical IPO preparation if not already underway, and (3) no research assistant information suggesting contrary evidence. My forecast is not lower because there remains a small possibility of: unexpected strategic developments, the CEO's statement being tactical misdirection, or confidential preparations already underway. My forecast is not higher because the CEO statement is recent and explicit, the timeframe is very short, and there's no positive evidence suggesting an imminent IPO. I would revise upward with evidence of S-1 preparation, major market improvements, or insider reports of imminent announcement. I would revise downward with additional statements ruling out 2025 IPO or announcement of alternative financing.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nBefore July 1, 2025, will Databricks announce that it is planning an IPO?\n\nQuestion background:\nTechCrunch: ['It's dumb to IPO this year': Databricks CEO explains why he's waiting to go public](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/dumb-ipo-databricks-ceo-explains-064957000.html)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question will resolve as **Yes** if Databricks, Inc., announces before July 1, 2025, that it is planning an initial public offering. In order to streamline the resolution of this question, there are two resolution sources for the IPO announcement: 1) Databricks filing an [SEC Form S-1](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/sec-form-s-1.asp) or 2) An announcement at the [news](https://www.databricks.com/blog) section of its website. If there is no such announcement before that date, this question resolves as **No**.\n\n\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nNo additional information available.\n\nToday is 2025-05-22.\n\nBefore answering you think:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n(e) You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
