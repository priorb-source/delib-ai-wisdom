  "information": "On May 2, 2025, President Trump signed an executive order to stop all federal funding for National Public Radio (NPR) and the Public Broadcasting Service (PBS). The order directs the Corporation for Public Broadcasting (CPB) Board of Directors and all executive departments and agencies to cease federal financial support. The order requires the CPB Board to ensure its licensees and permittees do not use Federal funds for NPR and PBS. The White House stated the action was taken because the networks allegedly spread 'radical propaganda.' As of May 16, 2025, the Project 2025 Tracker still listed the objective as 'in progress.'\n\nThe Corporation for Public Broadcasting (CPB) has filed a lawsuit challenging the executive order, asserting that it is a private nonprofit corporation independent of federal executive control and not subject to the President's authority. The CPB's funding is allocated by Congress two years in advance; it has received $535 million for the current fiscal year, which provides funding through September 30, 2027. Following the executive order, the CPB notified affiliated stations that funding could be halted but simultaneously announced its legal challenge.\n\nThe executive action has prompted debate in Congress. Some Republican senators, including Lisa Murkowski of Alaska, have expressed support for public media, citing the importance of local programming and emergency alerts in rural communities. Federal funding is considered crucial for many local stations, with some receiving up to 25% of their annual revenues from the federal government. According to their respective CEOs, about 15% of the public network's budget comes from public funds for PBS, while NPR receives less than 5% of its budget from the CPB.",

    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "~45 days (until July 1, 2025)",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "The tracker maintainers keep the item at “in progress” because litigation and appropriations constraints mean funding has not in fact stopped. CPB continues distributing previously appropriated funds, courts enjoin or cloud the EO, and there’s no congressional rescission by July 1. The sheet remains non-complete when Metaculus checks on/after July 1.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "The maintainers decide the May 2 EO (possibly paired with OMB/agency directives or visible CPB compliance) effectively stops funding for NPR/PBS and update the cell to “complete” before July 1. Alternatively, a rapid legislative or administrative action clearly halts CPB-related flows to NPR/PBS, prompting a “complete” update.",
    "rationale": "- What we know: On May 2, 2025, an EO directed an end to federal funding for NPR/PBS. As of May 16, the Project 2025 Tracker still shows the objective as “in progress.” CPB has sued, asserting independence and citing multi-year appropriations ($535m allocated; funding through FY27). Some GOP senators support public media. NPR/PBS budgets rely partly—but not wholly—on public funds.\n- Why the base case is No: The tracker did not flip to “complete” after the EO, suggesting the maintainers’ bar is higher than a contested directive. With appropriations locked in and litigation pending, actual cessation of funding is unlikely by July 1. Congress is unlikely to enact rescissions on this timeline. Given the world changes slowly, the status quo (“in progress”) likely persists through the deadline.\n- Why not higher: Legal and budgetary realities (appropriations law, CPB’s structure) and ongoing court challenges make a decisive, credible “funding stopped” moment before July 1 improbable. The maintainers’ behavior—leaving it “in progress” two weeks post-EO—implies caution about declaring completion.\n- Why not lower: The resolution depends on the spreadsheet’s labeling, not objective ground truth. If maintainers judge the EO plus subsequent agency guidance as sufficient to count as “stop funding,” they could mark it complete even amid court disputes. A strong, public implementation step (e.g., OMB memo halting grants; CPB board direction that effectively cuts flows) could push them to “complete.”\n- What would move me up: Clear, verifiable actions that materially halt funds (CPB compliance announcements; agencies cutting off NPR/PBS-related grants) or the tracker updating similar items to “complete” on the basis of contested EOs. Rapid congressional action would also raise odds.\n- What would move me down: Court injunctions blocking the EO, CPB affirming uninterrupted distributions, or tracker commentary indicating they require realized impacts (not just directives) to mark completion.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill the Project 2025 Tracker spreadsheet have the objective of stopping funding for NPR and PBS marked as complete before July 1, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nAt the time of this question, the objective was marked as \"in progress.\" The 2025 Tracker is a project of the Keep_Track subreddit and is explained [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/Keep_Track/comments/1ii7tbr/project_2025_tracker_is_now_live/).\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below.

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower.
