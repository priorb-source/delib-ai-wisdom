  "information": "Under Ukrainian law, specifically Article 19 of the Law “On the Legal Regime of Martial Law,” scheduling or holding national elections is forbidden while martial law is in effect. On May 15, 2025, the Verkhovna Rada (Ukraine's parliament) voted to prolong martial law and general mobilization until at least August 6, 2025. The parliamentary rules of procedure also stipulate that once martial law is lifted, the date for the next presidential election must be set no less than 90 days in advance.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "46 days (until July 1, 2025)",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No - no announcement will be made",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Martial law remains in effect through July 1, 2025, as it was just extended until August 6, 2025. Ukrainian law prohibits scheduling elections during martial law, so no announcement can legally be made. The ongoing war with Russia continues, providing no basis for lifting martial law early.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Ukraine experiences an unexpected breakthrough in the war (major ceasefire or peace agreement) leading to rapid lifting of martial law before July 1, OR the Verkhovna Rada passes emergency legislation allowing election announcements during martial law due to extraordinary political circumstances, OR an exceptional legal mechanism is invoked to bypass normal restrictions.",
    "rationale": "The status quo strongly favors No. Just yesterday (May 15, 2025), the Verkhovna Rada extended martial law until August 6, 2025 - more than a month past the July 1 resolution date. Ukrainian law explicitly prohibits scheduling elections during martial law, and even requires a 90-day advance notice period after martial law is lifted. With martial law extended beyond the resolution date and the war ongoing, there is no realistic path for an announcement in the next 46 days under normal circumstances. For a Yes outcome, Ukraine would need either: (1) an unexpected end to the war and rapid lifting of martial law, which contradicts yesterday's extension and current conflict dynamics, or (2) emergency changes to election law, which would be constitutionally complex and politically contentious during wartime. The research assistant's information confirms the legal barriers are substantial and recently reinforced. My forecast is not lower (not 0-1%) because black swan events are possible - unexpected peace breakthroughs, constitutional crises, or extraordinary political developments could theoretically occur. My forecast is not higher because the status quo just got strongly reinforced yesterday with the martial law extension, and all institutional momentum points toward maintaining the current legal framework. I would update higher only with concrete evidence of imminent peace talks or emergency legislative action to change election laws.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill Ukraine announce a presidential election before July 1, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\n[Next Ukrainian presidential election](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Next_Ukrainian_presidential_election)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if, before July 1, 2025, a specific date on which a presidential election will be held is officially announced by the government of Ukraine or any of its agencies that have the authority to do so. If no such announcement occurs before that date, this question resolves as No.\n\nThe election does not have to be held before July 1, 2025; this question resolves based on an announcement.\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nUnder Ukrainian law, specifically Article 19 of the Law “On the Legal Regime of Martial Law,” scheduling or holding national elections is forbidden while martial law is in effect. On May 15, 2025, the Verkhovna Rada (Ukraine's parliament) voted to prolong martial law and general mobilization until at least August 6, 2025. The parliamentary rules of procedure also stipulate that once martial law is lifted, the date for the next presidential election must be set no less than 90 days in advance.\n\nToday is 2025-05-16.\n\nBefore answering you think:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n(e) You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
