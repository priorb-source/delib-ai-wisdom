    "review": "Both forecasters add useful caution. They emphasize base-rate timing (mid-year tax laws are less common than year-end Finance Acts), potential June Sallah recess compressing the calendar, and that “enacted” is required (not guidance)—all are valid constraints I didn’t fully price. They also flag labor/fiscal pushback on the broader package and the risk of bill-splitting or deferral, which could slow progress. On the other hand, neither fully incorporates reports (per the RA) that the House has already passed the bill—a material positive if accurate—nor the administration’s clear July 1 implementation target that implies prioritization. I find their overall caution convincing enough to trim my estimate, but I still weight executive priority and the possibility of a narrow/decoupled VAT fix that could move quickly, keeping odds above even.",
    "rationale": "Key considerations unchanged: executive backing (Oyedele’s committee, housing affordability framing), APC majorities, and a plausible legislative path in 8 weeks if prioritized. However, I’m updating down modestly for: (1) compressed calendar (possible Sallah recess, harmonization time, transmission and assent); (2) broader package contentiousness (labor/governor/fiscal concerns) that could slow or prompt amendments; (3) some uncertainty about the exact stage—while the RA cites House passage, other coverage suggests it may still be in process, and if the Senate makes changes, harmonization could push into late June. Countervailing positives remain: (a) if House passage is confirmed, only Senate and assent remain; (b) leadership could strip out the VAT exemption into a smaller amendment to deliver a quick housing win; (c) Tinubu can assent rapidly once transmitted. On balance, I reduce my forecast from 61% to 55% to reflect time and process risks while keeping a slight edge to Yes given executive priority and at least partial legislative momentum.",
