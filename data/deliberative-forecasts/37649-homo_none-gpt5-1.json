    "review": "Both peers emphasize selection effects and short time remaining: if Chad were on track, we’d likely see precursors (ETA label, local partner chatter, shipments) by mid-May. They also stress commercial prioritization—small, logistically challenging markets can lag despite licensing—and Starlink’s tendency to batch updates. None of this is new evidence, but it sharpens the downside risk I underweighted. I agree with their tilt toward No absent fresh signals, though I keep a bit more weight on a late-Q2 batch flip.",
    "rationale": "We’re ~46 days from the cutoff and ~6 months post-license (Nov 2024 → mid-May 2025). Base-rate windows for Africa often see availability 3–9 months after licensing, but variability is high. The key update is the selection effect: not being live by mid-May modestly lowers the near-term hazard, especially given likely needs for type approval, customs, tax arrangements, and distribution. Chad’s small market size and governance risks can push it down the queue even with ISL minimizing technical constraints. Starlink does sometimes flip several countries at once late in a quarter, so a June activation remains plausible. Balancing these, I move down from a slight-Yes stance to a slight-No: the lack of visible rollout signals and short window outweigh the licensing tailwind, but not by a large margin.",
