  "information": "The push for expanded voter citizenship verification in Florida aligns with a broader national trend. The U.S. House of Representatives passed the Safeguard American Voter Eligibility (SAVE) Act, which would require proof of citizenship for voter registration nationwide, though it is unlikely to pass the Senate. Separately, President Donald Trump signed an executive order to impose stricter verification requirements. Other states have also advanced similar legislation; Wyoming passed a law requiring proof of citizenship to vote that is set to become effective on July 1, and a bill in Tennessee to create a citizenship verification portal for election workers has advanced in its state house.",

    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "About 56 days (until July 1, 2025)",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Bills proposing proof-of-citizenship requirements (e.g., HB 831 or any companion) do not pass both chambers before adjournment, or they die in messages/committee; no special session is called; consequently, no enactment occurs before July 1, 2025.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "The Legislature passes HB 831 or substantially similar language before or during any special session, and the governor signs it (or it becomes law without his signature) before July 1, 2025. This could include a law that requires documentary proof for first-time registrants or for voters flagged by database checks—any subset of voters being required to provide proof would satisfy the criterion.",
    "rationale": "- Timing and process: Florida’s regular session typically adjourns in early May. As of May 6, time is very short for new legislation unless the bill already cleared both chambers or a special session is called. If a bill has already passed, enactment before July 1 would be very likely, given the governor’s alignment with the policy. If not, the window narrows substantially, because special sessions on election law are uncommon. Florida bills presented to the governor can become law without his signature if no action is taken within the prescribed period, so passage by the Legislature prior to this date is the key bottleneck.\n- Political environment: Florida is a GOP trifecta with a record of enacting election policy changes, and national GOP priorities currently emphasize proof-of-citizenship. The Tallahassee Democrat (Apr 2) reported active consideration of such measures, citing HB 831 as an example that would count for this question. These factors increase the odds relative to a neutral state.\n- Legal/operational friction: Requiring voters to provide documentary proof of citizenship runs into known federal constraints (NVRA/Inter Tribal Council precedent) at least for federal voter registration, and can invite litigation. That legal risk can make leadership more cautious or push them toward database-based verification that does not require voters to provide documents. For this question, only laws that require voters to provide proof count; purely administrative/database checks do not. That constraint lowers the probability.\n- Status quo base rate: Most proposed election changes do not become law in any given session, and the session calendar strongly favors the status quo from this date forward unless passage has already occurred.\n- Research assistant summary and impact: The RA notes national momentum (House passage of the SAVE Act, a presidential EO, Wyoming’s new law, and Tennessee action). This signals political salience and reduces the probability of zero, but these are not determinative for Florida’s legislative outcome before July 1 and do not overcome the session calendar constraint.\nWhy not higher: Compressed timeline post-regular session, potential legal/political caution about documentary proof requirements, and the possibility that Florida leaders prefer verification mechanisms that don’t require voters to furnish documents (which wouldn’t resolve this market as Yes).\nWhy not lower: Strong GOP control, gubernatorial alignment, and an identified Florida bill (HB 831) that appears tailored to the requirement specified by the question. If it already passed by sine die, enactment is probable.\nWhat would move me up: Confirmation that HB 831 or a companion passed both chambers; reports that the governor intends to sign imminently; a call for a special session that includes this item; any enacted omnibus elections bill with proof-of-citizenship language.\nWhat would move me down: Confirmation that the bill(s) died at adjournment; leadership statements ruling out a special session on elections; evidence that any passed elections bill uses only database checks without requiring voters to provide proof.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nBefore July 1, 2025, will Florida enact legislation expanding its verification requirements of a voter's citizenship?\n\nQuestion background:\nTallahassee Democrat: [Florida may require proof of citizenship to vote under new legislation echoing Trump](https://www.tallahassee.com/story/news/local/state/2025/04/02/got-id-proof-of-citizenship-may-soon-be-needed-to-vote-in-florida/82756919007/)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if, before July 1, 2025, the state of Florida enacts legislation requiring voters to provide proof of US citizenship beyond the requirements at the time of this question, according to [credible sources](https://www.metaculus.com/faq/#definitions).\n\nAny subset of voters being required to provide such proof would count (for example if it only applied to first-time voter registrants or creating a new requirement for mail-in voters). An example of a bill that would count is [HB 831](https://www.flsenate.gov/Session/Bill/2025/831). This question resolves upon enactment; therefore other questions such as when the legislation takes effect or whether it survives court challenges and is implemented is immaterial to this question's resolution.\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nThe push for expanded voter citizenship verification in Florida aligns with a broader national trend. The U.S. House of Representatives passed the Safeguard American Voter Eligibility (SAVE) Act, which would require proof of citizenship for voter registration nationwide, though it is unlikely to pass the Senate.

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
