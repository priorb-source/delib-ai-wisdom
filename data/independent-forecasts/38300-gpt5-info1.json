  "information": "Recent data for the US Industrial Production Index (INDPRO) shows accelerating year-over-year (YoY) growth through early 2025: -0.2% in January, +0.45% in February, +0.85% in March, and +1.49% in April. The April rebound was largely driven by a 1.2% increase in oil extraction and a 2.2% rise in oil processing. In contrast, civil non-energy processing industries have seen a persistent decline since the beginning of the year, averaging a 0.7% monthly fall between January and April.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "About 13 days (Metaculus checks on or after 2025-06-15)",
    "status_quo_outcome": "Yes — April 2025 YoY was +1.49%, and absent an unusually large negative May shock and/or unfavorable base effects, May should remain > 0.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "A sharp May 2025 MoM drop (e.g., −1% to −2%) concentrated in manufacturing, mining, and/or utilities, coinciding with a relatively strong May 2024 base, pulls YoY below 0. Examples: refinery maintenance cuts output unexpectedly; a notable pullback in oil/gas extraction; auto output and aircraft production slump; widespread factory slowdowns.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Energy/mining strength persists (extraction steady, refineries ramp into driving season), utilities hold near trend, and manufacturing stabilizes or edges up. With April already +1.49% YoY and press reports of record-high index levels, even a flat-to-modestly negative MoM in May likely keeps YoY positive.",
    "rationale": "Evidence and trend: The research assistant notes YoY improving from −0.2% (Jan) to +1.49% (Apr), with April’s rebound aided by energy (oil extraction and processing). That trajectory, plus the referenced commentary that the index is at or near record highs, implies the level of INDPRO is above its May 2024 level unless May 2025 suffers an unusually large drop.\n\nBase effects and required swing: Moving from +1.49% YoY in April to <0% in May would require a deterioration of roughly 1.5+ percentage points in the YoY rate. That would typically need both (a) a relatively high May 2024 base versus April 2024 and (b) a sizable May 2025 MoM decline. Given usual INDPRO volatility, that combination is possible but not the base case.\n\nWhy not higher: Risks include ongoing weakness in non-energy manufacturing (assistant cites ~0.7% average monthly declines Jan–Apr), potential refinery maintenance or energy pullbacks, possible auto/aircraft production dips, and the chance that May 2024 was relatively strong, tightening the YoY comparison.\n\nWhy not lower: Momentum has been positive into April, energy tends to support output into late spring, and the bar to flip YoY from +1.5% to negative in a single month is high.\n\nUpdate triggers:\n- Upward: Strong early reads (ISM production above 50, robust refinery utilization and crude runs, solid electricity generation, stable or rising auto assemblies).\n- Downward: Evidence of broad May manufacturing contraction, significant energy/mining output declines, or unusually strong May 2024 base signals combined with weak May activity.\n\nOverall, the status quo and recent trend favor a positive YoY for May 2025.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill monthly US Industrial production have positive year-over-year growth for May 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nThe Real Economy Blog: [Industrial production index hits record high amid tariffs](https://realeconomy.rsmus.com/industrial-production-index-rises-to-record-amid-tariffs/)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if the monthly number displayed at FRED [Industrial Production: Total Index (INDPRO)](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/INDPRO#) for year-over-year growth is greater than 0.0 for May 2025, when checked by Metaculus on or after June 15, 2025.\n\nWhen accessing the data, ensure settings are Units: Percent Change from Year Ago, Seasonally Adjusted and Frequency: Monthly. For example, the number for April 2025 was 1.48803 as of May 27, 2025.\n\nSince the numbers presented by FRED are expected to be preliminary numbers from the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, please note that subsequent revisions to the number will not cause this question to re-resolve.\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nRecent data for the US Industrial Production Index (INDPRO) shows accelerating year-over-year (YoY) growth through early 2025: -0.2% in January, +0.45% in February, +0.85% in March, and +1.49% in April.

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
