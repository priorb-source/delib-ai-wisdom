    "review": "The other forecasters and I are in strong agreement, with forecasts of 35%, 36%, and my initial 35%. Our core reasoning is identical: we are weighing the recall's simple characteristics (small scope, perishable product) against the historical median closure time for USDA recalls. Forecaster 2 introduced two useful points strengthening the 'No' case: small firms can be slow with paperwork, and FSIS posting can lag behind the actual closure decision. Forecaster 3 raised an excellent and novel point strengthening the 'Yes' case: the company discovered the issue internally, which often correlates with a more competent and proactive response that could speed up the resolution process. Both analyses were very convincing and highlighted specific mechanisms that I had grouped under general 'bureaucratic' considerations.",
    "rationale": "My initial forecast was 35%. After reviewing the other analyses, I am making a slight upward adjustment. The key new piece of information was Forecaster 3's point that LPK1 discovered the issue internally. This is a significant detail I overlooked. It suggests the company is likely more organized and cooperative than the average firm in a recall situation, which could accelerate the submission and approval of corrective action plans. This specific, positive factor for this case slightly mitigates the strong general evidence of a ~120-day median closure time. While Forecaster 2's points about potential delays are valid, the self-reporting aspect feels more diagnostic for this particular recall. The core tension remains: the 97-day window for closure is faster than the median, and with only 23 days left, the status quo is a strong anchor. However, the evidence of a proactive company increases the chance that this will be a straightforward, faster-than-average case. I am therefore moving my forecast up slightly to reflect this increased probability, from 35% to 38%.",
