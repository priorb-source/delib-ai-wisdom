    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Likely within 1–2 weeks (Trading Economics usually posts monthly debt figures with ~4–5 weeks lag; March 2025 should appear by late April to early May 2025).",
    "status_quo_outcome": "Yes",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Trading Economics’ series definition changes (e.g., switches to a narrow measure that excludes large components of debt) or a data error/revision posts an unusually low figure; or TE lags and shows an outdated March value below threshold due to a methodological quirk.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "The usual TE series (mirroring MinFin’s public debt data) shows Ukraine’s government debt continuing around multi‑trillion UAH levels, with March 2025 at or above ~UAH 5 trillion, easily clearing the 1.90 trillion threshold.",
    "rationale": "Baseline levels make this an easy over. Ukraine’s public debt in UAH terms surged during 2022–2024 due to large external financing needs and Hryvnia depreciation. By late 2023, press and official updates indicated state (and state‑guaranteed) debt exceeding UAH 5 trillion; 2024 saw continued increases alongside EU/IMF support and market issuance. The threshold here (≥1.90 trillion UAH) is far below recent levels. Even if Trading Economics uses a narrower central‑government measure, that was already above 1.9 trillion UAH back in 2021–early 2022 and has since risen. Currency appreciation or month‑to‑month fluctuations cannot plausibly cut reported debt from roughly 4–6 trillion UAH to below 1.9 trillion UAH. Key residual risks are definitional: TE could be tracking a subset of debt or change metadata; or a misprint/revision could temporarily show an anomalously low number. I give extra weight to the status quo (debt well above threshold) since macro stocks change gradually and financing flows in early 2025 (e.g., EU Ukraine Facility tranches) push debt up, not down. Research assistant provided no additional info. I am not higher than this because I allow for small tail risk of TE series definition/availability issues. I am not lower because all macro signals and recent history strongly support debt far above 1.9T. I would update upward if I confirmed TE’s March 2025 value is already posted and ≥1.9T, or that TE’s series maps exactly to MinFin’s public debt total. I would update downward if I saw TE’s “Government Debt” series historically sat near 1.5–1.8T UAH (implying a much narrower definition) or evidence of a major methodology change.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill Ukraine's government debt be at least 1.90 trillion UAH in March 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\n[Ukraine is one step away from stagflation. And here's why](https://en.iz.ru/en/1868046/2025-04-10/ukraine-one-step-away-stagflation-and-heres-why)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if Ukraine's government debt is greater than or equal to 1.90 billion UAH Thousand (in other words, 1.90 trillion Ukrainian hryvnia for the month of March 2025, according to the number presented by [Trading Economics](https://tradingeconomics.com/ukraine/government-debt). Under 1.90 billion UAH Thousand resolves as **No**.\n\n\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nNo additional information available.\n\nToday is 2025-04-22.\n\nBefore answering you think:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n(e) You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
