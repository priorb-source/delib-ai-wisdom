    "review": "Both forecasters raise important points I initially underweighted. Forecaster 2's emphasis on geographic proximity is particularly compelling - Newark is legitimately close to Trump's Bedminster property and NYC residence, making this a fundamentally different logistical proposition than traveling to Miami or Las Vegas. This 'low-effort, high-reward' framing has merit. Forecaster 3's methodological approach of starting from base rates is sound and their 36% forecast balances multiple considerations reasonably.\n\nHowever, I find Forecaster 2's 65% probability too optimistic. It essentially claims attendance is more likely than not, which seems to require stronger evidence than we currently have - no public schedule indication, no reporting of plans, and the significant recency concern remains. The research assistant explicitly noted Trump 'rarely attends two UFC events in such close succession,' and we're looking at less than two months between appearances. While geographic proximity lowers the barrier, does it truly override this established pattern?\n\nForecaster 3's analysis is more balanced but still somewhat optimistic for my taste. The recency factor combined with the base rate of non-attendance (Trump doesn't attend most UFC events even with the Dana White relationship) should carry significant weight. The absence of any advance signals - no schedule listing, no security coordination reports, no hints from White or UFC reporters - also suggests the default should be non-attendance.",
    "rationale": "After reviewing both analyses, I'm updating my forecast upward but remaining on the more conservative end. The geographic proximity argument is genuinely persuasive - Newark to Bedminster is a short trip that dramatically reduces the logistical burden compared to most UFC venues. This is a material factor I initially underweighted.\n\nHowever, several factors prevent me from updating higher: (1) The recency pattern remains a strong counter-signal. Trump attended UFC 314 just 54 days before UFC 316 would occur. His previous pattern showed ~5 months between events. Breaking this pattern without clear precedent is noteworthy. (2) Base rate considerations - Trump attends select high-profile UFC cards, not most events. Without advance signals (schedule listings, credible reporting, security preparations), the default remains non-attendance. (3) Presidential schedule constraints and security requirements mean that even 'easy' trips require significant planning and coordination. The absence of any public indicators suggests this hasn't been prioritized.\n\nThe geographic proximity gives me reason to move from 22% to approximately 30%, acknowledging that a Newark event presents a uniquely low barrier. But I remain skeptical that this overcomes the recency concern and the general base rate of non-attendance without clearer advance signals.",
