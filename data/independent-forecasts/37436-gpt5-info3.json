  "information": "On May 5, 2025, Israel's security cabinet reportedly approved a plan to intensify military operations in the Gaza Strip. This follows a period of renewed violence since a ceasefire broke down in mid-March 2025. The UN has described Gaza as one of the most dangerous places in the world for humanitarian workers, with its personnel and facilities at risk from military activity. The UN's Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) has stated that humanitarian efforts are severely hindered by severe restrictions on movement within the territory. The International Red Cross also noted that the deteriorating security situation is hindering the work of its staff and partners.",

    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "About 57 days (until July 1, 2025)",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No (the latest OCHA impact snapshot as of Apr 30, 2025 reports 295 UN staff fatalities, below 300)",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "OCHA posts no further impact snapshots before July 1, 2025, so the April 30 figure (295) remains the most recent; or OCHA continues updates but UN staff fatalities increase by fewer than 5 through the end-June snapshot.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "At least 5 additional UN staff deaths in Gaza are recorded by OCHA and appear in the May 31 or June 30 impact snapshot, pushing the reported total to 300 or higher by the last snapshot before July 1, 2025.",
    "rationale": "Baseline: The April 30, 2025 OCHA impact snapshot lists 295 UN staff fatalities. If nothing else changes and no newer snapshot is posted, this would resolve to No. OCHA has been issuing monthly snapshots, so it is likely (though not guaranteed) there will be May 31 and June 30 updates before July 1. Only five additional reported fatalities are needed to reach the threshold. \n\nTrend and risk environment: The conflict has produced a steady accumulation of UN staff deaths (largely UNRWA local staff). Even if the monthly pace has slowed compared to late 2023, five additional fatalities over roughly two months is plausible. The research assistant notes Israel’s security cabinet approved intensifying operations on May 5, and both the UN and ICRC describe Gaza as extremely dangerous for humanitarian workers with restricted movement. An intensified campaign, including in densely populated areas with UN facilities, reasonably elevates the hazard rate for UN staff.\n\nWhy not higher: \n- The status-quo resolution today is No (295), and good practice gives weight to that. \n- The recent increment may be low; if UN operations are further curtailed or staff relocate away from the most dangerous areas, additional fatalities could be few. \n- OCHA could pause or alter reporting; if no new snapshot is posted before July 1, the question resolves to the current 295. \n- Reporting and verification lags could delay inclusion of recent fatalities into the snapshot.\n\nWhy not lower: \n- Only five additional deaths are needed. \n- The security outlook is worsening per the assistant’s note; escalated operations historically correlate with upticks in aid-worker casualties. \n- Two expected monthly snapshots (end-May and end-June) give multiple opportunities for the count to cross 300.\n\nKey update signals: \n- Upward: Confirmed UN statements about additional staff deaths; major operations (e.g., in Rafah) or strikes on/near UN facilities; OCHA posting regular end-May and end-June snapshots. \n- Downward: Ceasefire or sustained de-escalation; mass evacuation/suspension of UN field activities; clear indication OCHA will not post further snapshots before July 1 or changes methodology to a narrower count.\n\nNetting these factors, I put more than even odds on reaching 300+ by the final pre–July 1 snapshot, but not overwhelmingly so given the status-quo anchor and posting/verification risks.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill 300 or more UN staff be reported to be killed in Gaza according to UN's OCHA in its final impact snapshot before July 1, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nSee accompanying Humanitarian update [here](https://www.ochaopt.org/content/humanitarian-situation-update-284-gaza-strip).\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if the number of reported UN staff killed in Gaza is greater than or equal to 300 according to the most recent impact snapshot for the Gaza Strip posted [here](https://www.ochaopt.org/publications) by the United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs as of July 1, 2025. For example, a snapshot dated April 30, 2025, [reports](https://www.ochaopt.org/content/reported-impact-snapshot-gaza-strip-30-april-2025) 295 UN staff fatalities.\n\nIf OCHA stops posting new updates, this resolves as the most recent number, which as of the time of this question would be the impact snapshot posted on April 30, 2025.\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nOn May 5, 2025, Israel's security cabinet reportedly approved a plan to intensify military operations in the Gaza Strip.

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
