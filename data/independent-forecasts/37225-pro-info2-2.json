  "information": "Positive economic factors for the incumbent VHP government include a reduction in inflation from 60% to 10%, compliance with an IMF program, and the signing of a Final Investment Decision with TotalEnergies for the Granmorgu oil field. The government also instituted a 15% salary increase for government employees and pensioners in 2024, with an additional 5% in January 2025. Conversely, negative factors include high public dissatisfaction, with 56% of the public dissatisfied with the current government and 66% believing the country is worse off than five years prior. The country faces persistent poverty and a $4 billion national debt. One report cited President Santokhi's approval rating at approximately 3%.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Less than one month. The election is scheduled for May 25, 2025.",
    "status_quo_outcome": "The Progressive Reform Party (VHP) currently holds a plurality of seats (20 out of 51) won in the 2020 election. The status quo is for them to win the most seats again, which would resolve the question as 'Yes'.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Widespread public dissatisfaction with the incumbent government's handling of the economy, persistent poverty, and high national debt translates into a significant loss of support for the VHP. Voters shift their allegiance to opposition parties, primarily the National Democratic Party (NDP), which capitalizes on the anti-incumbent sentiment to emerge with the most seats.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Voters are persuaded by the government's recent economic achievements, such as a sharp reduction in inflation and the prospect of future wealth from a major oil deal with TotalEnergies. Recent salary increases for civil servants and pensioners successfully shore up a key part of their base. Distaste for the controversial leadership of the main opposition NDP causes swing voters to stick with the VHP as the lesser of two evils, allowing it to retain a plurality of seats, even with a reduced share of the vote.",
    "rationale": "My forecast is based on a conflict between strong negative public sentiment and positive, yet perhaps not widely felt, economic indicators. The status quo is a VHP plurality, but the data from my research assistant points strongly toward a change. The government's approval ratings are exceptionally low (President Santokhi's at ~3%), and a large majority of the population (66%) feels the country is worse off. Such profound dissatisfaction is a powerful driver for electoral defeat.\n\nHowever, the government has a compelling counter-narrative. It has successfully reduced inflation from 60% to 10%, secured an IMF program, and finalized a major oil investment that promises future prosperity. Furthermore, it has strategically increased salaries for government employees and pensioners immediately before the election. These are tangible achievements the VHP can campaign on. The main opposition, the NDP, is also led by the controversial former president Dési Bouterse, which may make voters hesitant to return to his party despite their unhappiness with the current administration.\n\nMy forecast of 35% is below 50% because the public dissatisfaction numbers are too stark to ignore and represent the most likely driver of the election's outcome. It is difficult for an incumbent to win with such low approval. My forecast is not lower because the positive economic news, the promise of oil revenue, the recent salary hikes, and the controversial nature of the main opposition are all significant factors that give the VHP a plausible path to retaining a plurality. The opposition is not guaranteed to coalesce perfectly, and the VHP could win the most seats with a relatively low percentage of the total vote.\n\nI would increase my forecast if new polling showed a significant uptick in government approval or if a major scandal weakened the opposition. I would decrease it if the opposition showed signs of forming a unified pre-election coalition or if a new economic crisis emerged.",

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
