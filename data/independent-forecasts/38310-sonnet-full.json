  "information": "Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney formally invited Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy to the G7 summit scheduled for June 15-17, 2025, in Kananaskis, Alberta. The invitation was extended in March 2025. On May 27, 2025, Zelenskyy confirmed his intention to go, stating to Ukrainian journalists, \"G7: I was invited by the Canadian Prime Minister Carney. And I will be.\" Canadian security planning documents list Zelenskyy among the expected attendees, prompting preparations including a no-fly-zone over the area.\n\nBetween 2022 and 2024, Volodymyr Zelenskyy participated in three G7 summits: he attended the 2023 summit in Hiroshima, Japan, in person, and attended the 2022 summit in Elmau, Germany, and the 2024 summit in Apulia, Italy, virtually. Throughout the war, he has made numerous international trips, including visits to Washington, Paris, and Davos. On June 2, 2025, he arrived in Vilnius, Lithuania, to attend the Bucharest Nine summit ahead of the NATO summit scheduled for June 24-25 in The Hague.\n\nA key topic of discussion related to the G7 summit is the potential for new sanctions against Russia. US Senators Lindsey Graham and Richard Blumenthal have advocated for a new package of sanctions to be coordinated with European allies before the summit. However, according to news reports citing EU diplomats, it is unlikely that the European Union will have a new sanctions package ready by mid-June. President Zelenskyy has publicly called for increased pressure on Russia and for joint sanctions to be agreed upon at the G7 level.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "12-14 days. The G7 Summit is scheduled for June 15-17, 2025, and today is June 3, 2025.",
    "status_quo_outcome": "Yes - Zelenskyy attends the summit in person. He has been formally invited, publicly confirmed his attendance stating 'I will be,' and Canadian security planning documents list him as an expected attendee.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "A sudden military crisis in Ukraine escalates, requiring Zelenskyy's immediate presence in Kyiv. Alternatively, security threats specific to his travel emerge, or an unexpected diplomatic incident complicates his ability to leave Ukraine. Health or travel logistics issues could also prevent attendance.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Zelenskyy proceeds with his planned attendance as publicly confirmed. He travels from his current international trip (currently in Lithuania as of June 2) to Kananaskis, Alberta, arriving for the June 15-17 summit. Security arrangements function as planned, and no urgent crises prevent his departure from Ukraine or the broader region.",
    "rationale": "The evidence strongly favors Zelenskyy's attendance. He has explicitly and publicly committed to attending, stating on May 27, 'G7: I was invited by the Canadian Prime Minister Carney. And I will be.' This clear public commitment reduces ambiguity. Canadian security planning actively includes him as an expected attendee, indicating serious preparations for his arrival. Zelenskyy has demonstrated both willingness and ability to travel internationally during the war, including attending the 2023 G7 summit in Hiroshima in person and making numerous trips to Washington, Paris, and Davos. His current presence in Lithuania for the Bucharest Nine summit (as of June 2) shows he is actively traveling internationally just two weeks before the G7. The summit is strategically important for Ukraine, with discussions on new sanctions against Russia being a key topic, giving Zelenskyy strong incentive to attend. However, I'm not forecasting above 85% because: (1) 12-14 days remains sufficient time for unexpected developments in an active war zone; (2) Zelenskyy attended two recent G7 summits virtually (2022 and 2024), showing in-person attendance isn't automatic; (3) security risks and military contingencies are real ongoing concerns. I'm not forecasting lower because his explicit public commitment, combined with active host-country planning and his current international travel, creates strong momentum toward attendance. To update higher, I would need evidence of actual departure for Canada or continued stability through the next week. To update lower, I would need signs of military escalation, security warnings, or any indication of complications with his travel plans.",
