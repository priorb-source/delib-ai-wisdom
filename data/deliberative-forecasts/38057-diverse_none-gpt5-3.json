    "review": "- Forecaster 2: I agree with the two-factor approach and the general ranges. Their note that early markets favored Merab in their first scheduled meeting is a useful signal I hadn’t explicitly incorporated; that slightly bolsters Merab’s conditional win probability. Their 80% fight-occurs estimate is close to my prior.\n- Forecaster 3: The key new claim is that Merab won the first fight decisively at UFC 306 and became champion. If true, that would materially increase P(Merab wins | fight occurs) and likely the chance the rematch is booked. However, I can’t verify this here, and the research assistant had no confirmation. I weight this claim cautiously. The “2” label on ESPN does suggest a prior bout, but it doesn’t establish who won or how.\n- Overall: F2’s market-based cue nudges Merab’s conditional edge up slightly; F3’s unverified claim I treat as possible but not decisive. I modestly increase the fight-occurs probability given we’re relatively close to UFC 316 and ESPN is listing it as “2.”",
    "rationale": "I keep the conjunction framing: P(Yes) = P(fight occurs as Dvalishvili vs O’Malley at UFC 316) × P(Merab wins | fight occurs).\n\n- Fight-occurs probability: I move from ~0.78 to ~0.84. We’re likely within 6–8 weeks of UFC 316, and an ESPN “2” listing suggests a real booking rather than a speculative matchup, reducing cancellation/opponent-change risk, though not eliminating it.\n- Conditional win probability: I keep a slight stylistic lean to Merab due to pace and chain wrestling over five rounds, but respect O’Malley’s KO upside and potential adjustments. Incorporating F2’s point about prior market lean toward Merab, I set P(Merab wins | fight occurs) ≈ 0.58 (from 0.58 previously; essentially unchanged pending verified evidence of the UFC 306 result).\n\nCalculation: 0.84 × 0.58 ≈ 0.49 → 49%.\n\nWhat would move me up: Verified news that UFC 316 is officially announced with both fighters healthy and through camp milestones; weigh-ins made; credible reports or footage showing O’Malley still struggling with elite chain wrestling; confirmation that Merab clearly won the first fight.\nWhat would move me down: Injury/withdrawal hints; opponent shuffle; market movement making O’Malley a clear favorite; evidence of O’Malley’s materially improved takedown defense/scrambling.\n",
