    "review": "Forecaster 2 rightly emphasizes lumpy timing and the absence of advance public signals, but I think they overweight that factor. Many Artemis signings have been same‑day announcements coordinated with State/NASA, so a lack of pre‑leaks isn’t a strong negative. Their reference to ILRS competition is fair context but only modestly constraining given the large remaining pool of plausible, non‑ILRS, US‑aligned candidates. Their 32% seems below what a recent‑trend base rate implies.\n\nForecaster 3 correctly highlights momentum and catalytic events, though I’m not convinced the Humans to the Moon & Mars Summit specifically drives a June signing. The stronger June venues are COPUOS (mid‑June, Vienna) and the Paris Air Show (late June), both historically conducive to space diplomacy announcements. Without named, credible near‑term candidates, 70% looks a bit high.\n",
    "rationale": "Recent cadence supports a moderate prior: 5 signings across the last 6 months (Dec–May) implies roughly 0.8–0.9/month, giving ~55–60% for at least one in a given month. June has unusually good venues—COPUOS (June 11–20) and the Paris Air Show (June 16–22)—and NASA’s May 22 guidance that more signings are expected in the “coming weeks and months” nudges the timing risk toward June/July. The pool of plausible signers remains substantial (e.g., Portugal, Ireland, Hungary, Turkey, Vietnam, Indonesia, Philippines, Egypt, Kenya, Ethiopia, etc.), and many past signings were announced with minimal lead time, so the current lack of public teasers is not very diagnostic.\n\nCountervailing considerations: execution can slip for domestic approvals or scheduling, and the May 15 Norway signing could push the next ceremony into July. Netting these, I’m slightly above my prior base‑rate estimate.\n\nChange: Up modestly from 55% to 58%, reflecting June’s event catalysts and the NASA near‑term signal, while still accounting for slippage risk and lack of country‑specific rumors.\n",
