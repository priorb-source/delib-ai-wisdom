    "review": "The deliberation reveals a strong and unanimous consensus among all three forecasters. My initial analysis and those of the other two experts are almost identical, identifying the ongoing civil war as the single, overwhelming factor precluding ratification. The other forecasters did not raise evidence or arguments I had not considered; rather, we all arrived at the same conclusion for the same reasons: the complete paralysis of Sudan's state functions and the impossibly short timeline. I found their reasoning to be highly convincing as it mirrored my own. They did articulate some specific, yet still highly improbable, 'black swan' scenarios for a 'Yes' outcome, such as one faction attempting a symbolic ratification for legitimacy or a sudden military collapse leading to a unilateral decision by the victor. While these are useful thought exercises that fall within a 1% probability, they do not provide a reason to update the forecast, as their likelihood within the next month is vanishingly small.",
    "rationale": "My initial forecast of 1% remains unchanged. The deliberation with my fellow forecasters has reinforced my confidence in this assessment. All three of us agree that the primary driver is the devastating civil war that has been ongoing since April 2023. This conflict has effectively dismantled the central government and legislative bodies necessary to carry out the formal process of ratifying an international treaty like AfCFTA. The status quo is one of intense conflict and institutional collapse, making ratification impossible. The deadline of July 1, 2025, is less than one month away, leaving no plausible timeframe for the required political and security transformations—namely, a durable ceasefire, the formation of a unified and recognized government, and that government prioritizing and completing this specific legislative act. The consensus in our reasoning confirms that there are no major counterarguments or overlooked factors. My forecast remains at 1% to account for unpredictable, black swan events, but the confidence in a 'No' outcome is extremely high.",
