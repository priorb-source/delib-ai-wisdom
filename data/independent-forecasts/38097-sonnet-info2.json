  "information": "The political climate in Côte d'Ivoire is marked by the disqualification of several opposition figures ahead of the October 2025 election. In April 2025, Tidjane Thiam, leader of the main opposition party PDCI-RDA, was disqualified after a court ruled he did not meet eligibility conditions due to his prior dual French-Ivorian nationality, despite having renounced his French citizenship. This and other exclusions have led to protests and accusations of electoral manipulation. Reports also mention that other political figures like Charles Blé Goudé and Guillaume Soro have been excluded from the electoral process due to judicial convictions. In response to the political tensions, various groups, including religious leaders and the UN, have called for peaceful dialogue.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "32 days until July 1, 2025",
    "status_quo_outcome": "None of the five named candidates have been reported as disqualified yet, so the status quo is that they remain eligible to run",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "All five candidates (Gnangbo Kacou, Laurent Gbagbo, Pascal Affi N'Guessan, Jean-Louis Billon, and Simone Gbagbo) successfully maintain their eligibility through July 1, 2025. The wave of disqualifications that affected Tidjane Thiam and others has already passed, and the electoral list stabilizes without further major removals of these specific candidates",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "At least one of the five named candidates is disqualified in the next 32 days. Given the pattern of disqualifications and the controversial nature of figures like Laurent Gbagbo (former president) and Simone Gbagbo, authorities find legal grounds to remove one or more from eligibility, such as citizenship issues, criminal convictions, or administrative technicalities similar to those used against Thiam",
    "rationale": "The research assistant's report shows a clear pattern of opposition disqualifications in Côte d'Ivoire, with Tidjane Thiam removed in April 2025 over dual nationality issues, and others like Charles Blé Goudé and Guillaume Soro excluded due to judicial convictions. This demonstrates the government's willingness to use administrative and legal mechanisms to exclude opposition figures. However, critically, none of the five specific candidates named in the question have been mentioned as disqualified yet, despite the report being current as of May 30, 2025. With only 32 days remaining until the July 1 deadline and the October election approaching, the electoral list is likely in late stages of finalization. Laurent and Simone Gbagbo are particularly high-profile figures who would have been obvious targets if authorities intended to disqualify them. The fact they haven't been disqualified yet suggests they may have cleared the main eligibility hurdles. The status quo heavily favors no additional disqualifications of these specific five candidates in the remaining time. However, I cannot rule out the possibility entirely given the demonstrated pattern of removals and political tensions. My forecast is not higher because the major wave of disqualifications appears to have already occurred, and we're late in the process. It's not lower because the political environment remains volatile and precedent exists for such actions. I would update upward if reports emerge of legal challenges against any of the five candidates, and downward if we pass mid-June without any such developments",
