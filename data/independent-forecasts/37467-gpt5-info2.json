  "information": "As of March 2025, Beyond Meat had $116 million in cash on hand. The company's liabilities included $1.15 billion in convertible bonds maturing in 2027, which were reported to be trading at 17 cents on the dollar. On May 7, 2025, the company announced it had secured a new $100 million senior secured financing facility. The loan has an initial term of 4.75 years with an interest rate of 12% until February 2030, payable in kind, meaning interest is added to the loan's principal instead of being paid in cash during this period.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "About 54 days (until July 1, 2025)",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No — no bankruptcy filing before July 1, 2025.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Beyond Meat uses its ~$116M cash (as of March 2025) plus availability under the new $100M senior secured PIK facility to manage working capital, satisfies or waives any near-term covenants, stabilizes vendor terms, and continues operations through at least the end of June without a court filing. No near-term maturities force action (the large 2027 converts remain outstanding but are not immediately payable).",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "A sudden liquidity shock before July 1 forces an expedited Chapter 11: for example, a breach of a minimum-liquidity or borrowing-base covenant under the new facility that accelerates the loan; suppliers tighten trade credit or demand cash-in-advance causing a cash crunch; an operational surprise (e.g., recall, sharp sales miss) or adverse legal event drives rapid cash burn; or the new financing proves unavailable or too restricted to bridge near-term needs, prompting a prepack/pre-arranged filing.",
    "rationale": "I put extra weight on the status quo because near-term corporate states tend to persist absent a catalyst. Over the next ~8 weeks, the newly announced $100M senior secured facility with PIK interest (no cash interest until 2030) materially reduces immediate cash-outflow pressure. Combined with ~$116M cash as of March 2025 and no imminent debt maturities (the large converts mature in 2027 and reportedly carry minimal/zero cash coupon), the default pressure before July 1 appears limited. \n\nSignals of distress remain elevated (the $1.15B converts trading around 17 cents on the dollar indicate substantial medium-term default risk), and the company continues to burn cash (loss from operations of ~$38M in the most recent quarter). That said, the window is short, and the fresh facility suggests at least one sophisticated lender believes the company can bridge the near term or is positioning ahead of any later restructuring. PIK interest and a 4.75-year term further imply the financing is designed to conserve cash now. \n\nWhy not higher: There is no hard maturity or coupon cliff before July 1, and the company just added a sizable, cash-sparing facility. With only ~54 days left, the base case is continuity. \n\nWhy not lower: The capital structure is clearly distressed (17¢ bonds), implying high probability of eventual restructuring. Covenants on the new senior secured facility could include minimum liquidity or borrowing-base tests; a breach in May/June could force a filing. Vendor tightening or a negative surprise in Q1 results could accelerate cash burn. \n\nWhat would push me higher: Disclosure of tight or breached covenants, auditor/warning language that triggers vendor pullback, reports of advisor mandates geared toward a near-term prepack, inability to draw the new facility, or severe Q1/Q2 operating deterioration leading to a stated need for court protection. \n\nWhat would push me lower: Confirmation the facility has ample undrawn availability with loose covenants, improving sales/margins and slower burn in Q1, stabilized vendor terms, and explicit management guidance indicating sufficient liquidity well past July 1.\n\nSummary of assistant-provided info affecting this forecast: cash ~$116M (Mar 2025); $1.15B of 2027 converts at ~17¢; new $100M senior secured facility (4.75-year term) at 12% PIK until Feb 2030. These support a low, but non-trivial, probability of a filing before July 1.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill Beyond Meat file for bankruptcy before July 1, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nBeyond Meat has had several years of losses and in the most recent quarter it [posted](https://investors.beyondmeat.com/news-releases/news-release-details/beyond-meatr-reports-fourth-quarter-and-full-year-2024-financial) a loss from operations of almost $38 million.\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question will resolve as **Yes** if Beyond Meat, Inc., files any petition for bankruptcy protection in the United States, under any chapter of the United States Bankruptcy Code, before July 1, 2025. The question will resolves on the filing of such a petition, not on whether any bankruptcy protection is granted by a court. If no such petition is filed by that date, this question will resolve as **No**.\n\n\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nAs of March 2025, Beyond Meat had $116 million in cash on hand.

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
