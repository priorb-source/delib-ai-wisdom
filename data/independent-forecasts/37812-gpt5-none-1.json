    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "About 41 days (until July 1, 2025)",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No — Beirut’s current/spring schedule likely sits near but slightly below the >51 threshold; absent changes, I expect the July listing to be around the high 40s to low 50s.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Cross‑border tensions persist or tick up, prompting some European/Gulf carriers to pare schedules or delay seasonal adds; a handful of routes (e.g., secondary French/German/Med cities or Saudi services) don’t materialize or are suspended, leaving BEY with ~40–50 listed destinations on flightsfrom.com.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Security stays roughly stable into early July and summer seasonality kicks in: MEA plus regional/Gulf/European carriers operate their full summer programs (extra French cities, added leisure points around the Med, fuller Iraq/Gulf slate). flightsfrom.com shows ~53–60 nonstop destinations from BEY on/after July 1.",
    "rationale": "- Definition: Metaculus will check flightsfrom.com/BEY on/after July 1, 2025; count must be >51 nonstop destinations. flightsfrom reflects filed, active schedules at that time (seasonal adds matter; short‑notice suspensions also matter). \n- Baseline picture: BEY historically supported a broad network (pre‑2019 >60). Post‑crisis and amid ongoing Israel–Hezbollah tensions, service persists but with volatility. Core VFR/worker flows (Gulf, Jordan, Egypt, Iraq) and MEA’s European trunk routes remain, but discretionary tourism routes are sensitive to risk and insurance constraints. \n- Summer effect: July is peak season; MEA typically layers in extra France/Med capacity and some secondary European points. That nudges the count upward versus shoulder months. \n- Headwinds: News flow in 2024–2025 highlights weak tourism and security jitters; carriers may be conservative with secondary European cities and Saudi services. Any late‑June flare‑up could trigger temporary suspensions that drop the tally below the threshold on the check date. \n- Tailwinds: Even with soft tourism, diaspora/VFR demand supports a wide regional web (Iraq, Gulf, Egypt, Jordan, Turkey, Cyprus, Greece). Summer seasonal adds could push the count over 51 if security is steady. \n- Why not higher: Material near‑term downside risk from security and insurance; a handful of marginal seasonal routes make the difference between ~49 and ~54. A single Gulf or European carrier pausing service could flip the outcome to No. \n- Why not lower: July seasonality, MEA’s resilient regional/EU core, and strong Iraq/Gulf connectivity make a collapse to well below 50 unlikely without a sharp escalation. \n- Updates that would move me up: Confirmed summer schedules on flightsfrom.com in mid‑June already show ≥51; announcements of seasonal French/Med routes, Saudi resumptions, or new Gulf/Iraq points; signs of de‑escalation and normal insurance/risk premiums. \n- Updates that would move me down: NOTAMs/airspace restrictions, visible carrier suspensions (e.g., Emirates, Saudia/flynas, European legacies), or clear escalation on the Lebanon–Israel front in late June. \n- Research assistant note: No additional info provided; forecast relies on structural route patterns, seasonality, and current regional risk context.",

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
