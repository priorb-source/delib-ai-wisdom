    "review": "The other two forecasters and I are in strong agreement on the fundamental drivers of this question. We all correctly identified the extremely short timeline (less than two months), the lack of any political or legislative groundwork, and the current government's strategic focus on autonomy within Canada (via the Sovereignty Act) rather than outright separation. The points raised by my colleagues that I found most convincing, and which I hadn't explicitly weighted, were the consistently low polling numbers for Alberta independence and the massive political risk this creates for the government. Calling a referendum they are likely to lose would be a politically disastrous gamble. This argument significantly strengthens the case for the status quo and makes the 'Yes' scenario even more of a remote tail risk.",
    "rationale": "I am lowering my forecast from 2% to 1%. The deliberation with my fellow forecasters reinforced my initial reasoning but also sharpened my assessment of the political calculus involved. While my original forecast accounted for Premier Smith's unpredictability, the other analysts' emphasis on the unfavorable polling for independence was a crucial point. It highlights that an announcement would not just be a bold strategic move, but a high-risk gamble with a significant probability of failure and severe political consequences. This makes the barrier for action even higher. A 'Yes' outcome would now require not just a major federal-provincial crisis, but one so profound that the Premier would be willing to initiate a referendum she is very likely to lose. This elevates the 'Yes' scenario from merely improbable to a true 'black swan' event. Therefore, adjusting my forecast down to 1% better reflects the immense political inertia and risk aversion that stands in the way of such a monumental announcement on this compressed timeline.",
