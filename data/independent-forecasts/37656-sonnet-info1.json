  "information": "On May 2, 2025, President Trump signed an executive order to stop all federal funding for National Public Radio (NPR) and the Public Broadcasting Service (PBS). The order directs the Corporation for Public Broadcasting (CPB) Board of Directors and all executive departments and agencies to cease federal financial support. The order requires the CPB Board to ensure its licensees and permittees do not use Federal funds for NPR and PBS. The White House stated the action was taken because the networks allegedly spread 'radical propaganda.' As of May 16, 2025, the Project 2025 Tracker still listed the objective as 'in progress.'",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Approximately 45 days until July 1, 2025",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No - the objective remains marked as 'in progress'",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "The Project 2025 Tracker maintainers continue to list the objective as 'in progress' through July 1, either because they are waiting for evidence of actual funding cessation beyond the executive order, are monitoring for legal challenges or implementation details, or simply do not update the tracker before the deadline.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "The tracker maintainers verify that the May 2 executive order has effectively stopped federal funding for NPR and PBS, and they update the spreadsheet to mark this objective as 'complete' sometime between now and June 30, 2025.",
    "rationale": "The critical evidence is that President Trump signed an executive order on May 2, 2025 to cease all federal funding for NPR and PBS - which directly addresses the Project 2025 objective. However, two weeks have passed since the signing, and the tracker still shows 'in progress' as of today (May 16). This delay is meaningful. If the executive order itself were sufficient for completion, the tracker likely would have been updated already. The maintainers appear to be waiting for something more - perhaps evidence of actual implementation, bureaucratic follow-through, or confirmation that funding has genuinely ceased rather than just been ordered to cease. There could also be legal challenges or administrative delays in executing the order. That said, we still have approximately 45 days until the deadline, which provides substantial time for the maintainers to verify implementation and update the status. The executive order is a strong signal that substantive action has been taken. My forecast is not higher (70-80%) because the lack of update after two weeks suggests the maintainers have a higher bar than just signing an executive order - they may need to see actual budget impacts or completed administrative actions. My forecast is not lower (40-50%) because we do have concrete executive action and ample time remaining for verification and updating. I would update higher if I saw reports of actual funding being cut or the tracker being updated to reflect progress. I would update lower if legal challenges emerged or if we got closer to July 1 without any tracker updates.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill the Project 2025 Tracker spreadsheet have the objective of stopping funding for NPR and PBS marked as complete before July 1, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nAt the time of this question, the objective was marked as \"in progress.\" The 2025 Tracker is a project of the Keep_Track subreddit and is explained [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/Keep_Track/comments/1ii7tbr/project_2025_tracker_is_now_live/).\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if the Project 2025 objective to \"stop funding for NPR and PBS\" is marked as complete according to [this spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1QGG6wNHna-1tt91yXNkOauAJJ7snobFjfEnmxlmzhl4/edit?gid=0#gid=0) before July 1, 2025. If it is anything other than complete (such as \"in progress\") when accessed by Metaculus on or after July 1, 2025, then the question resolves as **No**.\n\n\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nOn May 2, 2025, President Trump signed an executive order to stop all federal funding for National Public Radio (NPR) and the Public Broadcasting Service (PBS). The order directs the Corporation for Public Broadcasting (CPB) Board of Directors and all executive departments and agencies to cease federal financial support.

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
