  "information": "The University of Michigan's final Index of Consumer Sentiment (ICS) for May 2025 was 52.2, the same as the final reading for April. This followed a decline from 64.7 in February and 57.0 in March, marking a nearly 30% drop since January. The index's components also declined in April, with the Current Economic Conditions Index falling to 59.8 and the Economic Expectations Index dropping to 47.3. Consumers' short-term (one-year) inflation expectations reported in the survey rose to 6.5% in April, the highest since November 1981, while long-term inflation expectations increased to 4.4%. Historically, from 2010 to 2019, index increases of 8 points or more in a single month occurred less than 3% of the time.\n\nAccording to ADP data, U.S. private-sector hiring slowed significantly in May 2025, with only 37,000 jobs added, the slowest pace in over two years. Job losses were noted in business services, manufacturing, and education. A separate University of Michigan survey shows consumers expect unemployment to climb. Data on consumer behavior shows personal spending rose by 0.2% last month, while the savings rate increased to 4.9% in March, the highest level in nearly a year. Following the end of the pandemic-era payment pause on student loans, delinquencies jumped from 1% to 7.74%. In contrast to the University of Michigan's findings, the Conference Board's consumer confidence index rose to 98 in May from 85.7 in the prior month.\n\nThe ongoing trade war with China is a frequently cited source of uncertainty for American consumers, with the U.S. having doubled steel tariffs. Federal Reserve governor Christopher Waller has outlined a potential path to interest rate cuts later in the year, but noted that considerable uncertainty remains around the level of tariffs. Waller also largely dismissed the high inflation expectations recorded in the University of Michigan survey, stating a preference for market-based measures and professional forecasts.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Approximately 23 days until June 27, 2025, when the final Friday report for June 2025 is expected to be published",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No - the index remains below 60.0. The May 2025 reading was 52.2, unchanged from April, continuing a downward trend from 64.7 in February",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Consumer sentiment remains depressed through June due to ongoing concerns about the trade war with China, weak labor market data showing only 37,000 jobs added in May, elevated inflation expectations at 6.5% (highest since November 1981), and rising unemployment expectations. The index stays near its current level of 52.2 or continues declining",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "A significant positive catalyst emerges in the next three weeks - such as major tariff relief announcements, a strong jobs report reversing the recent weakness, Fed clearly signaling imminent rate cuts, or inflation data showing meaningful moderation. This drives consumer sentiment to jump by at least 7.9 points from 52.2 to above 60.0",
    "rationale": "The status quo strongly favors a No outcome. The index would need to increase by at least 7.9 points in a single month, from 52.2 to above 60.0. Historical data shows that increases of 8 points or more occurred less than 3% of the time from 2010-2019, indicating such jumps are rare. The recent trend is negative - the index fell from 64.7 in February to 57.0 in March, then flatlined at 52.2 in both April and May. Current economic fundamentals remain challenging: private-sector hiring slowed dramatically to 37,000 jobs in May (the slowest in over two years), consumers expect unemployment to climb, student loan delinquencies surged from 1% to 7.74%, and short-term inflation expectations are at their highest level since November 1981. The ongoing trade war creates persistent uncertainty. While the Conference Board's confidence index did rise in May and there's discussion of potential Fed rate cuts, these haven't yet translated to improvement in the Michigan sentiment measure. The flatness of the April and May readings at 52.2 suggests stabilization rather than recovery. For the probability to be higher, I would need to see: evidence of an imminent positive catalyst, historical precedent for rapid rebounds from these levels, or leading indicators suggesting improvement. For it to be lower, the less-than-3% historical frequency of large jumps alone would justify it, but I'm allowing some premium for unexpected positive developments given we're early in June and uncertainty remains high",
