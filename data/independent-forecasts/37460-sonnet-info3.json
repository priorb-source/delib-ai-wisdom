  "information": "Turkey's high inflation rate was reported at approximately 48.6% in early 2025. In the legal sphere, an indictment was prepared for 14 youths arrested during the Saraçhane protests, with their first hearing scheduled for May 30, 2025. Separately, the trial for manager Ayşe Barım, related to her alleged role in the 2013 Gezi Park protests, is scheduled for July 7, 2025. Amnesty International's 2024-25 report highlighted what it described as human rights violations in Turkey, including restrictions on peaceful protests and the prosecution of journalists and opposition figures. The organization also condemned the arrests made ahead of the May 1st protests and called for the lifting of the ban on demonstrations in Taksim Square.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Approximately 55 days, from May 7, 2025 to July 1, 2025",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No - the question criteria have not yet been satisfied, and if current conditions continue without a major catalyzing event, there likely won't be a protest meeting the 10,000+ participant threshold that gets reported by the Global Protest Tracker",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Turkey continues to effectively suppress large-scale demonstrations through the existing ban on Taksim Square protests and preemptive arrests. While smaller protests may occur around economic grievances or the upcoming trial hearings (May 30 for Saraçhane protesters), they remain below 10,000 participants or don't get captured by the Global Protest Tracker's reporting criteria",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Economic frustrations from the 48.6% inflation rate reach a tipping point, or the May 30 trial hearing for the Saraçhane protesters becomes a catalyzing event that mobilizes 10,000+ people. The protest is significant enough to be documented by the Carnegie Endowment's Global Protest Tracker despite Turkey's restrictive environment",
    "rationale": "The key factors influencing this forecast are: (1) Turkey's severe economic crisis with 48.6% inflation creating genuine grievances, (2) recent protest activity including Saraçhane and May 1st events showing some mobilization capacity, (3) upcoming trial hearings on May 30 that could serve as flashpoints, and (4) Turkey's history of large-scale protests as evidenced by the 2013 Gezi Park protests. However, several factors work against a Yes outcome: the government has maintained effective restrictions on protests including bans in symbolic locations like Taksim Square, recent protests appear to have been relatively small or suppressed with preemptive arrests documented, and there's no clear immediate catalyst visible for a 10,000+ person protest. The 10,000 participant threshold is substantial and difficult to reach in Turkey's current restrictive environment. The Global Protest Tracker's reporting is another consideration - while it's comprehensive, there could be timing lags or coverage gaps. The ~55 day timeframe provides some opportunity for conditions to change, but isn't particularly long. I would update higher if there were reports of growing protest momentum, major new catalyzing events, or signs of weakening government control. I would update lower if the May 30 hearing passes without major demonstrations or if there's evidence of increased crackdowns preventing mobilization",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill the Global Protest Tracker report any protests in Turkey (Türkiye) with 10,000+ participants, before July 1, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nWikipedia: [2025 Turkish protests](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2025_Turkish_protests)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if the [Global Protest Tracker](https://carnegieendowment.org/features/global-protest-tracker?lang=en) reports a protest in Turkey (Türkiye) with 10,000 or more participants with a start date after the launch of this question and before July 1, 2025.\n\nPlease note that the Global Protest Tracker uses the name Türkiye in its database.\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nTurkey's high inflation rate was reported at approximately 48.6% in early 2025.

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
