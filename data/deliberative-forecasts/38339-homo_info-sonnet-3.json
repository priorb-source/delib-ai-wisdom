    "review": "Forecaster 3 provides crucial new information that significantly updates my understanding: as recently as May 2, 2025 (just one month ago), bilateral talks were focused on price and capacity renegotiation rather than cancellation. This is highly probative evidence that the actual negotiation track differs from Borissov's public rhetoric. If parties were still pursuing modification rather than termination in early May, this strongly suggests cancellation is not imminent. Forecaster 2's analysis aligns closely with my original reasoning about financial distress versus institutional inertia, but doesn't incorporate this May 2025 evidence. Both forecasters correctly emphasize the short timeframe constraint and the complex legal/diplomatic barriers to rapid cancellation. The key tension is between real financial crisis (€2 billion debt, payment stoppage, bankruptcy risk) and structural factors favoring renegotiation over termination (Turkey's opposition, debt settlement requirements, ongoing talks showing modification path).",
    "rationale": "I am updating downward from 25% to 16% based primarily on Forecaster 3's evidence about May 2025 negotiations focusing on renegotiation rather than cancellation. This is a strong signal that despite public rhetoric and financial distress, the actual policy track is toward modification. With only 25 days remaining and no recent evidence of negotiation breakdown, dramatic policy reversal to formal cancellation announcement is unlikely. However, I'm not going as low as Forecaster 3's 12% because: (1) the financial crisis is severe and genuine (€2 billion debt, payments stopped nearly a year ago), which could still precipitate forced action; (2) the resolution criteria are permissive, allowing unilateral announcement even if disputed; (3) 25 days, while short, is not zero time. The confluence of ongoing renegotiation talks, short timeframe, no announcement yet, and complex international agreement processes all point toward status quo (No outcome) being highly likely, but the severe financial distress and political pressures prevent going below 15%.",
