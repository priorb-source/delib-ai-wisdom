    "review": "All three forecasters correctly identify the central tension: John Morgan's history of public flirtation followed by non-candidacy versus his serious current preparations for a potential run. We all agree on the importance of the status quo (he is not a candidate) and the lack of concrete, imminent signals like staff hires or a scheduled announcement. Forecaster 2 introduced a highly salient point I had not adequately considered: the political calendar. A pre-July 4th announcement is strategically suboptimal, as campaigns often launch after the holiday to maximize public attention. This provides a strong, rational reason for Morgan to delay an announcement past the resolution date, even if he decides to run. Forecaster 3 provided a critical piece of information about lawyers preparing party-formation paperwork, which is a stronger signal of intent than I had initially assumed. However, as that forecaster rightly notes, the complexity of this process could itself be a source of delay. Both analyses were convincing and added valuable new dimensions to the forecast.",
    "rationale": "After reviewing the other forecasts, I am lowering my probability from 25% to 20%. The core of my initial reasoning remains: Morgan's past behavior of considering and then declining to run is the strongest predictive factor. The deliberation has strengthened this view. Forecaster 2's argument about the political calendar is the primary driver of my update. The disincentive to launch a major campaign in the days immediately preceding the July 4th holiday is a significant structural reason for a serious candidate to wait. This makes an announcement *before* July 1 less likely, independent of Morgan's ultimate decision about running in the 2026 election. Forecaster 3's point about lawyers preparing party-formation paperwork increases my belief that Morgan is more serious this time than in the past. However, it does not necessarily translate to a short-term announcement. In fact, it introduces a potential bureaucratic delay. Given the combination of his history, the short timeline, the lack of immediate pre-campaign signals, and the newly considered disincentive of a pre-holiday announcement, I believe the probability of a 'Yes' resolution is lower than I initially estimated.",
