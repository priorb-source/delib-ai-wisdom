  "information": "According to reports from May 2025, Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum has achieved a 76% approval rating, making her the best-evaluated president since the 1994-2000 term. In specific areas, 63.4% of respondents positively evaluated her management of poverty reduction, and her administration's policies have been linked to a 24.9% reduction in homicides. However, on transparency and anti-corruption, 57.4% of respondents had a negative perception. Her administration has announced a $298 billion investment plan. Some polls cited her approval rating as high as 82%.\n\nA survey in Argentina conducted between April 28 and 30, 2025, by D'Alessio IROL/Berensztein indicated growing wear on Javier Milei's government. The survey showed his positive image has decreased to 44%, while his negative image has increased to 52%, for a net differential of -8%. 52% of respondents believe the economic situation is worse than the previous year. The evaluation of his government is divided, with 50% rating it as good and 48% as bad. Security Minister Patricia Bullrich has the highest positive image in the cabinet at 47%, as insecurity is the main social concern for 72% of respondents.\n\nAn international survey by Morning Consult conducted between January 21 and 27, 2025, placed Claudia Sheinbaum's approval rating at 66% and Javier Milei's at 65%. A later report from April 30, 2025, citing Morning Consult data, showed Milei's approval at 61% and Sheinbaum's at 60%. In the January survey, Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi had the highest approval rating at 75%.",

    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "About 1.5 months (≈45 days) until June 28, 2025",
    "status_quo_outcome": "Yes (Milei currently leads 61% vs. Sheinbaum 60% per Morning Consult)",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Sheinbaum’s Morning Consult approval holds at ~60–63% while Milei drifts to ~58–60%, or they tie (ties resolve No). Drivers: continued economic pain in Argentina and/or political friction lowers Milei; Sheinbaum’s honeymoon remains strong amid stable macro and security narratives.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Milei maintains or slightly widens a narrow edge (e.g., 60–62%) while Sheinbaum remains ~59–61% or dips slightly. Drivers: perceived progress on Milei’s reforms or inflation deceleration; no major negative shocks in Argentina; mild ebb in Sheinbaum’s early-term bounce on transparency/anti-corruption perceptions.",
    "rationale": "- Anchor/status quo: As of late April, Morning Consult had Milei 61% and Sheinbaum 60%. If nothing changed, this would resolve Yes. However, the edge is just 1 point and within typical sampling noise for the tracker.\n- Trends and base rates: Morning Consult’s weekly shifts are usually modest (±1–3 pp). Small leads often flip. Ties resolve No, which mechanically tilts the forecast toward No vs. a simple 50/50 on the current 1-point lead.\n- Sheinbaum: RA notes very strong domestic approval (often 70%+; even 76–82% in some polls). Morning Consult was lower (66% in Jan, 60% by Apr), suggesting MC uses a stricter baseline, but directionally she remains popular and early in her term. Barring a scandal or sudden deterioration in security/economy, a level around 60–63% by late June seems plausible.\n- Milei: RA cites late-April domestic polling showing net negative image (44% positive / 52% negative). Morning Consult still had him high at 61% in late April, which is notably above many domestic estimates. That suggests MC systematically rates him relatively well, but the direction of travel from Jan to Apr was down (65% to 61%). With ongoing austerity and mixed public sentiment, a further mild drift down by June is a live risk.\n- Synthesis: The most relevant evidence is the MC head-to-head levels (61 vs. 60) and their recent trend: both slightly down from January. Given: (1) tie counts as No; (2) Milei’s domestic headwinds; (3) Sheinbaum’s early-term popularity and supportive domestic polling backdrop, I place modest weight on a flip or tie by late June.\n- Why not higher than 43% for Yes? The tie-as-No rule, Milei’s slight downward momentum, and Sheinbaum’s robust domestic standing make a Milei lead less than even odds.\n- Why not lower than 43%? Status quo has Milei up; Morning Consult has historically rated Milei comparatively high versus some domestic polls. It would not take much (or any) improvement for him to remain narrowly ahead.\n- Updates that would move me up: Clear MC trend showing Milei stabilizing or rising in June; major legislative/economic win in Argentina (e.g., tangible disinflation plus a reforms victory) without offsetting social unrest; a dip in Sheinbaum’s MC rating tied to a scandal or security shock.\n- Updates that would move me down: Continued MC erosion for Milei over several weekly reads; negative Argentina economic headlines or protests; stable or rising Sheinbaum MC readings supported by positive economic/security data in Mexico.",
