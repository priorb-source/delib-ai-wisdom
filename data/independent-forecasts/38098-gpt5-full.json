  "information": "Incumbent Republican Senator Lindsey Graham, in office since 2003, has commenced his 2026 re-election campaign. He has secured endorsements from prominent party figures, including former President Donald Trump, Governor Henry McMaster, and Senator Tim Scott. On the Democratic side, Dr. Annie Andrews, a pediatrician who ran for a House seat in 2022, announced on May 29, 2025, that she would be a candidate in the 2026 Senate race.\n\nAccording to news reports from February and March 2025, U.S. Representative Ralph Norman is \"seriously considering\" a run for Governor of South Carolina in 2026, when the incumbent will be term-limited. Several outlets, including The State, Roll Call, and Politico, have noted that Norman's office has denied any plans for a Senate run. Norman has officially filed for his own House re-election.\n\nAs of late May 2025, there was no publicly available evidence of preparatory activities for a Senate campaign by Ralph Norman. Reports indicated an absence of actions typically preceding a major campaign launch, such as filings with the Federal Election Commission (FEC) for a statement of candidacy, the formation of an exploratory committee, significant staff hires, or major donor activity. The official filing period for the 2026 South Carolina primary does not open until the spring of 2026.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "About 1 month (until June 30, 2025)",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Norman continues with his House re-election path and explores a 2026 governor run; his office maintains denials about a Senate bid; no announcement is made before July 1, 2025.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "A sudden strategic pivot leads Norman to publicly announce a 2026 Senate primary challenge to Lindsey Graham before July 1, 2025—perhaps triggered by new polling, donor pressure, or an unforeseen vulnerability for Graham.",
    "rationale": "- Baseline: The default is No. There’s only about a month left, and Norman’s office has explicitly denied Senate plans while signaling interest in the 2026 governor’s race. He has filed for House re-election, and there are no visible Senate-campaign preparations (no FEC statement of candidacy, exploratory committee, notable staff hires, or donor activity). Those signals align with staying put for now, especially given no filing deadline pressure for the 2026 primary until spring 2026.\n- Countervailing factors are weak: While it’s possible to announce without prior FEC filings and politicians do pivot, such a move would likely follow visible trial balloons or reporting; we’ve seen the opposite (denials). Graham is already endorsed by Trump, Gov. McMaster, and Sen. Tim Scott, raising the political cost of an early challenge. Nothing in late May 2025 suggests a catalytic event pushing Norman to declare in June.\n- Why not higher: Short time window, explicit denials, no prep activity, conflicting reported ambition (governor), and strong establishment support for Graham all make a June Senate announcement unlikely.\n- Why not lower: Politicians can change course quickly; an announcement doesn’t require much paperwork upfront, and a single high-profile development (e.g., new polling, donor coalition, Graham vulnerability) could trigger a rapid decision.\n- What would move me up: Credible reporting that Norman is forming an exploratory committee or Senate team, fundraising for a Senate run, major donor/ally signals encouraging a challenge, or indications of Graham weakness/retirement rumors. What would move me down: Continued explicit denials, active steps toward a governor run, or new endorsements further consolidating Graham’s position.\n- Research assistant highlights supporting this view: Norman is reportedly eyeing the governorship, has denied Senate plans, has filed for House re-election, and shows no Senate-campaign groundwork. Graham has consolidated key endorsements. The 2026 filing window is far off, reducing any urgency to declare now.",
