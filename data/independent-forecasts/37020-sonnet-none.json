    "status_quo_outcome": "Post Malone is nominated in 4 categories, indicating significant industry recognition of his crossover into country music. The status quo is that he's already been acknowledged as a legitimate contender.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Post Malone loses all 4 categories to more traditional country artists or stronger competitors in each respective category. ACM voters may favor established country artists over a crossover artist, particularly if there's sentiment that he's too much of an outsider to the genre despite his recent country success.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Post Malone wins at least one of his 4 nominated categories. With multiple nominations, he has several opportunities to win. His crossover appeal and commercial success in country music could work in his favor, and voters may recognize his contribution to expanding the country music audience.",
    "rationale": "With 4 nominations, Post Malone has multiple chances to win, which significantly increases his probability compared to having just one nomination. Even if the probability of winning any single category is modest (say 25-35%), the cumulative probability of winning at least one award is considerably higher. Historically, artists with multiple nominations at major awards shows tend to win at least one award more often than not. Post Malone's crossover success has been commercially significant, and the ACM Awards have historically recognized crossover artists who bring attention to the genre. However, there are countervailing factors: his relative newcomer status to country music could work against him if voters prefer more established country artists, and we don't know the strength of competition in his specific categories. The forecast is not higher because of uncertainty about his specific categories, the competition he faces, and potential voter preference for traditional country artists. It's not lower because 4 nominations is a substantial achievement that suggests strong industry support, and the mathematical probability of winning at least one out of four is inherently favorable. I would update higher if I learned he's nominated in less competitive categories or has strong momentum. I would update lower if his categories include dominant favorites or if there's evidence of industry pushback against crossover artists.",

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
