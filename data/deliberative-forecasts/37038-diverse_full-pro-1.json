    "review": "All three forecasters are in strong agreement, with forecasts clustered between 82% and 87%. We all identify the same core logic: the current Harmonized Tariff Schedule (HTS) already lists a '+17%' tariff for Israel, and per the resolution criteria, its 'suspended' status is irrelevant, meaning the status quo resolves as 'Yes'. We also agree that the short timeframe (~5 weeks until June 1) makes a full resolution of trade negotiations followed by the necessary bureaucratic action to remove the tariff from the HTS unlikely. The other forecasters raised a few points that refined my thinking. Forecaster 3 correctly contextualized this specific action within the administration's broader protectionist trade policy, which strengthens the argument that the US will be reluctant to give up leverage prematurely. Forecaster 2 raised an excellent point I hadn't fully considered: even if a preliminary agreement is reached, a likely outcome could be an extension of the suspension period rather than an immediate removal of the tariff from the HTS, a scenario which would still resolve as 'Yes'. Both analyses reinforce the high probability of a 'Yes' outcome.",
    "rationale": "My original forecast was 85%. The deliberation with my peers has reinforced my confidence in a 'Yes' outcome. Their analyses did not present any significant counterarguments I had overlooked; instead, they provided additional support for my initial reasoning. Specifically, Forecaster 2's plausible scenario of a suspension extension, rather than a full removal of the tariff listing, provides an additional pathway to a 'Yes' resolution. This makes the narrow path to a 'No'—requiring a finalized deal and a rapid, complete update to the HTS before June 1—seem even less likely. The arguments from Forecaster 3 about the broader trade environment and the specific procedural hurdles for removal further solidify this view. While the possibility of a swift political resolution driven by the close US-Israel relationship remains, these additional considerations persuade me to slightly reduce the weight I give to that outcome. Therefore, I am increasing my forecast to better reflect this strengthened conviction.",
