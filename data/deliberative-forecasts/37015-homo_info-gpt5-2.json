    "review": "Forecaster 2 adds two potentially material constraints I hadn’t explicitly weighed: (a) PPP’s April 15 primary registration window reportedly closed with leadership signaling Han wouldn’t be included, and (b) an asserted need to resign by around May 4 to be eligible. If accurate, both raise the cost of a near-term jump and lower pre–May 5 announcement odds. I agree the acting-president norm and 2017 precedent further bias toward No. My one caveat: the legal need to resign by May 4 is doing heavy lifting; even if resignation is required before registration, it’s not strictly required before an announcement. But the political norm likely pressures a resignation very near any announcement, which still depresses the probability. Forecaster 3’s emphasis that formal registration typically occurs only weeks before election day is persuasive in the opposite direction: there’s no hard necessity to announce by May 5 to remain viable, which again lowers the near-term announcement probability. I also find Forecaster 3’s point about Han’s noncommittal stance and lack of visible campaign infrastructure credible near-term headwinds. Together, these inputs nudge me downward from my prior.\n",
    "rationale": "I previously put nontrivial weight on elite drafting pressure within the PPP, keeping the door open to a quick pivot. The added considerations—closed PPP primary intake, leadership signaling exclusion, and the likely need to pair any announcement with a rapid resignation from the acting presidency—raise the hurdle for action in the next 13 days. Forecaster 3’s point that there’s no procedural need to announce before May 5 to preserve viability further reduces the incentive to move now. Against that, the ‘announcement-only’ resolution criterion keeps a tail: if PPP elites decide to ‘break glass’ after April 24, Han could announce first and sort mechanics later. Netting these, I lower my estimate moderately. I would move back up if credible reports emerge of PPP initiating an emergency draft/waiver process, Han scheduling a major political address, staff/campaign build-out, or concrete resignation planning. I would move further down on a Han denial, PPP consolidation around another figure, or NEC/party guidance foreclosing a timely path.\n",
