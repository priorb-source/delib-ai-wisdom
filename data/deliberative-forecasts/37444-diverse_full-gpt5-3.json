    "review": "Both forecasters largely reinforce the low-probability status quo. They emphasize the fresh May 2 denial from Secretary Rubio, cabinet-level opposition, the May 5 reporting on moving toward tougher measures, Europe’s lack of interest, the pipeline’s physical/financial issues, and the compressed timeline. I didn’t see materially new facts beyond highlighting the recency of the denial and the practical irrelevance of delisting given EU opposition—points I had already incorporated. Forecaster 2’s 2% leans more toward near-impossibility; Forecaster 3’s 7% mirrors my prior view, citing Trump’s unpredictability and the earlier Politico report as the residual tail risk. I find their logic sound; the central case is clearly No. Where I diverge from 2% is that a rapid, symbolic delisting tied to a diplomatic gambit or a surprise directive is not impossible under this administration. However, absent any fresh, credible indications of a sanctions-relief package or Ukraine settlement framework, I’m persuaded to shade down slightly from my prior number.",
    "rationale": "The dominant signals point to sanctions remaining through July 1: explicit, recent denial by the Secretary of State; cabinet opposition; reports of consideration of expanded sanctions/500% tariffs; and no allied appetite to revive the pipeline. Nord Stream 2 AG’s legal/banking problems and the damaged pipeline reduce the practical upside of delisting while leaving the political cost high. The time window (~55 days) is tight for a high-profile reversal. A technical delisting via dissolution also looks unlikely before July 1 given the Swiss moratorium and ongoing settlements. Residual upside risk persists via a sudden Ukraine deal or a White House decision to use a symbolic concession, but there is no corroborating public signal. Netting these, I lower modestly to reflect the weight of recent denials and the short fuse, while keeping a small tail for unpredictability and fast OFAC action if ordered.",
