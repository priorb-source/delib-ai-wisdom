    "review": "The other forecasters raise several important points that warrant careful consideration. Forecaster 3's observation about the complete absence of referendum logistics preparation (no committees formed, no polling station planning, no ballot design) is particularly significant and something I underweighted. If RS leadership were genuinely planning to announce a referendum date within 60 days, we would expect to see concrete organizational steps, not just legislative groundwork and rhetoric. Additionally, Forecaster 3's emphasis on Dodik's historical pattern of using secessionist threats as political leverage without follow-through is a valid pattern recognition argument that I touched on but didn't emphasize enough. Forecaster 2's analysis aligns closely with mine but perhaps gives slightly too much weight to the momentum of recent actions. However, I find Forecaster 3's 18% potentially too pessimistic given the very concrete recent steps (constitutional draft completion in April, laws banning central authorities actually passed, not just proposed). The gap between my original 28% and Forecaster 3's 18% suggests I may have overweighted the significance of recent escalation while underweighting the lack of actual referendum preparation signals and historical behavioral patterns.",
    "rationale": "Upon reflection, I'm updating my forecast downward but not as far as Forecaster 3. The key factors influencing my revision: (1) Absence of logistical preparation is a stronger negative signal than I initially weighted - announcing a referendum date without any visible organizational groundwork would be unusual even in rushed scenarios; (2) Dodik's historical pattern of threats-as-leverage deserves more weight; (3) The 60-day timeframe is extremely tight for moving from no visible preparation to formal announcement. However, I'm not going as low as 18% because: (1) The April 2025 constitutional draft completion and passed laws are concrete recent actions, not just rhetoric; (2) The January 9 parade demonstrated willingness to take defiant actions; (3) The question asks only about announcing a date, not holding a referendum - they could announce a date for late 2025 or 2026; (4) Two months is short enough that rapid movement remains plausible if a trigger event occurs. Balancing these factors, I'm settling on 23%, giving more weight to the lack of preparation signals while still acknowledging the genuine escalation in recent months.",
