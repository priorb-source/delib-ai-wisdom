    "review": "My initial forecast of 35% was fundamentally flawed due to a lack of critical information that the other two forecasters provided. Both Forecaster 2 and 3 highlighted the existence of a UN conference in June specifically designed to encourage recognitions of Palestine. This is an 'action-forcing event' that I had not considered, which transforms the dynamic from general momentum into a targeted, time-bound initiative. My original reasoning treated June as just another month, whereas this new information reveals it as the specific focal point for a major diplomatic push. Furthermore, Forecaster 3 introduced a crucial piece of specific intelligence: a report that Malta is planning a June 20th announcement. This provides a very concrete and plausible path to a 'Yes' resolution. I found both forecasters' reasoning highly convincing because it was grounded in specific, near-term events, a much stronger basis for a forecast than my more general assessment of diplomatic trends. Their analyses correctly identified that this coordinated, public push by multiple nations makes the status quo much less likely to hold.",
    "rationale": "I am significantly updating my forecast from 35% to 85%. The primary reason for this major revision is the new evidence presented by my colleagues regarding the UN conference scheduled for June 17-20, co-chaired by France, whose explicit goal is to secure new recognitions of Palestine. This fact alone makes a 'Yes' resolution in June far more likely than my initial assessment. My original forecast was based on the idea that diplomatic momentum existed but could materialize at any time; the conference provides a specific and powerful catalyst within the resolution window. The intelligence cited by Forecaster 3, that Malta is specifically preparing a June 20th announcement, further solidifies the case for a 'Yes' outcome. While this is from a single report, it indicates that discussions are at a very advanced stage for at least one country. The threshold for resolution is low—only one country needs to act—and the evidence now points to a mature, coordinated plan involving several nations aiming for a June announcement. Therefore, a 'Yes' outcome has moved from being plausible to being the very likely base case. I am setting my forecast at 85%, not higher, to account for the remaining uncertainty. Intense diplomatic pressure from the US or Israel, or the failure to meet unspecified political conditions (as mentioned by Forecaster 3 regarding Macron), could still cause a last-minute delay that pushes an announcement beyond the June 30th deadline.",
