    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Approximately 5-6 weeks. June 2025 begins in about one week (on June 1, 2025), and the outcome will be determined when Metaculus accesses the NUFORC website on or after July 1, 2025.",
    "status_quo_outcome": "The question resolves as No, with June 2025 seeing 400 or fewer UFO reports to NUFORC, representing typical or slightly below-average monthly reporting levels.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "June 2025 experiences normal reporting patterns with no major UFO-related news events or viral incidents sparking increased public interest. The month sees typical seasonal variation, resulting in 400 or fewer reports being submitted to NUFORC by the time the data is checked in early July.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "June 2025 sees elevated reporting activity with more than 400 reports. This could occur due to summer weather encouraging more outdoor activities and sky-watching, a major UAP-related news event or documentary release spurring public interest, viral social media discussion of sightings, or simply normal statistical variation placing June on the higher end of the monthly distribution.",
    "rationale": "This forecast faces significant uncertainty due to the lack of specific recent monthly reporting data from NUFORC. The historical average of 180,000 reports over 50 years suggests roughly 300 reports per month, but this is almost certainly skewed by lower reporting rates in earlier decades before widespread internet access.\n\nKey factors favoring a Yes outcome: (1) June is a summer month in the Northern Hemisphere when more people are outdoors and potentially observing the sky, which could increase sighting reports; (2) Recent years have likely seen elevated baseline reporting due to increased public interest in UAP topics following government disclosures and media coverage; (3) The threshold of 400 reports appears calibrated to be a meaningful but not extreme bar.\n\nKey factors favoring a No outcome: (1) The status quo principle suggests typical patterns will continue absent specific catalysts; (2) Most months should cluster around average values rather than extremes; (3) Without evidence of unusual events planned for June 2025, baseline reporting is most likely.\n\nMy forecast is not higher because there's no specific evidence pointing to June 2025 being unusual, and the status quo of typical monthly patterns should be weighted heavily. My forecast is not lower because there's genuine uncertainty about what constitutes 'typical' for recent NUFORC monthly reports, and June's summer timing could provide a modest boost to reporting.\n\nTo update higher, I would need: evidence that recent monthly averages consistently exceed 400, or information about major UAP events scheduled for May-June 2025. To update lower, I would need: data showing recent monthly reports typically fall well below 400, or evidence that June historically sees reduced reporting.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill the number of UFO sightings reported by the National UFO Reporting Center exceed 400 for June 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nAccording to the [National UFO Reporting Center](https://nuforc.org/about-us/): \"The National UFO Reporting Center was founded in 1974 by noted UFO investigator Robert J. Gribble. The Center’s primary function over the past five decades has been to receive, record, and to the greatest degree possible, corroborate and document reports from individuals who have been witness to unusual, possibly UFO-related events. Throughout its history, the Center has processed over 180,000 reports, and has distributed its information to thousands of individuals.\"\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if The National UFO Reporting Center posts greater than 400 UFO/UAP sighting reports at [this link](https://nuforc.org/ndx/?id=event) for the month of June 2025, as displayed when accessed by Metaculus on or after July 1, 2025.\n\n\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nNo additional information available.\n\nToday is 2025-05-23.\n\nBefore answering you think:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n(e) You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
