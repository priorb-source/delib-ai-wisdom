  "information": "The name 'Gulf of Mexico' has been established for centuries, dating back to the 16th century. The body of water is bordered by the United States, Mexico, and Cuba and is considered international waters under the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea. A previous proposal to rename it the 'Gulf of America' in 2012 was not approved. The website in question, WorldAtlas.com, is a Canadian-based company. While its main North America map currently displays 'Gulf of Mexico', the title of its specific article on the gulf reads: 'Gulf Of Mexico (Gulf of America)'.",

    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "54 days (from May 8, 2025 to July 1, 2025)",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No - WorldAtlas.com continues to display 'Gulf of Mexico' on its North America page",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "WorldAtlas.com maintains its current naming convention, displaying 'Gulf of Mexico' on the North America page as it has for years, while potentially keeping the article title's parenthetical reference to 'Gulf of America' as informational context",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "WorldAtlas.com makes an editorial decision to update its North America page to display 'Gulf of America' either as the primary name or alongside 'Gulf of Mexico', potentially in response to diplomatic developments, geopolitical pressures, or internal editorial policy changes",
    "rationale": "The status quo heavily favors No. The Gulf of Mexico name has been established since the 16th century and is internationally recognized. A 2012 proposal to rename it was rejected. With only 54 days remaining, there is no evidence of any recent official movement, diplomatic initiative, or geopolitical pressure that would prompt this change. While the article title includes '(Gulf of America)' parenthetically, this is distinct from changing the primary North America page map - websites routinely include alternative names for informational purposes without altering their primary geographic representations. WorldAtlas.com is a Canadian company not bound by US government decisions, but they typically follow established international geographic naming conventions for credibility. The probability is not zero because: (1) the parenthetical inclusion suggests editorial awareness of the alternative name, (2) it's a private entity that could theoretically make unilateral changes, and (3) the short timeframe means unpredictable developments could occur. However, absent any catalyst, editorial announcement, or broader naming change movement, the baseline expectation is strongly for the status quo to persist. I would update higher if there were evidence of diplomatic agreements, official US-Mexico negotiations about the name, or statements from WorldAtlas about planned changes. I would update lower if WorldAtlas explicitly confirmed maintaining current naming or if the July 1 deadline drew closer with no signs of change.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill WorldAtlas.com display the body of water northwest of the Caribbean Sea as the Gulf of America before July 1, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nWorld Atlas article: [Gulf Of Mexico (Gulf of America)](https://www.worldatlas.com/gulfs/gulf-of-mexico.html)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if, before July 1, 2025, the World Atlas website at its [North America](https://www.worldatlas.com/webimage/countrys/na.htm) page displays the body of water west of Florida, south of Louisiana and north of the Yucatán Peninsula as the Gulf of America. (At the time of this question, the name displayed is the Gulf of Mexico.)\n\nIn case both names are used, for example \"Gulf of America formerly known as Gulf of Mexico,\" this question resolves as Yes. Note that verification will be from Metaculus admins accessing the webpage from the United States and that therefore resolution will be based on how the page appears when accessed from that location.\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nThe name 'Gulf of Mexico' has been established for centuries, dating back to the 16th century. The body of water is bordered by the United States, Mexico, and Cuba and is considered international waters under the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea. A previous proposal to rename it the 'Gulf of America' in 2012 was not approved. The website in question, WorldAtlas.com, is a Canadian-based company. While its main North America map currently displays 'Gulf of Mexico', the title of its specific article on the gulf reads: 'Gulf Of Mexico (Gulf of America)'.\n\nToday is 2025-05-08.\n\nBefore answering you think:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n(e) You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
