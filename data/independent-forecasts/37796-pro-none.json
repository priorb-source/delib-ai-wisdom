    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "The FATF Plenary is scheduled for June 2025. The outcome will be known when the FATF publishes its decisions, likely in the last week of June 2025, approximately one month from now.",
    "status_quo_outcome": "The list of 'Jurisdictions under Increased Monitoring' remains unchanged, with no countries added or removed.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Following the June 2025 Plenary, the FATF determines that none of the 25 jurisdictions currently on the grey list have made sufficient and sustained progress to warrant removal. Simultaneously, the ongoing review cycles do not result in any new jurisdictions being added to the list. This would mirror the rare outcome of the June 2024 Plenary.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "The FATF announces that at least one jurisdiction has substantially completed its action plan and is removed from the grey list. For example, a country like Kenya or Vietnam, having been on the list for some time, might demonstrate sufficient progress. Alternatively, or in addition, the FATF could add a new jurisdiction whose recent mutual evaluation revealed significant AML/CFT deficiencies that it has not committed to resolving.",
    "rationale": "The primary driver for this high-confidence forecast is the strong historical precedent. FATF Plenaries, which occur three times a year, almost always result in changes to the grey list. Looking at the seven most recent plenaries dating back to February 2023, six have resulted in at least one country being added or removed. The process is inherently dynamic.\n\nWith 25 jurisdictions currently under increased monitoring, there is a large pool of candidates for removal. These countries are under significant international pressure to implement their FATF action plans, and it is statistically probable that at least one will have made sufficient progress to be delisted. Concurrently, the FATF's mutual evaluation process is continuous, meaning there is also a constant possibility of new countries that are found to have strategic deficiencies being added to the list.\n\nMy forecast is not higher than 92% because a static outcome, while rare, is not impossible. The June 2024 Plenary resulted in no changes to the grey list, demonstrating that if no country meets the high bar for removal and no new countries are ready for listing, the status quo can hold. Geopolitical considerations can also sometimes slow down the decision-making process.\n\nMy forecast is not lower because the 'No' outcome requires two conditions to be met simultaneously: zero removals from a pool of 25, and zero additions from the ongoing global reviews. The high base rate of change at plenaries suggests the probability of this combined event is very low.\n\nI would increase my forecast closer to 99% upon credible reports that a specific country's on-site visit was successful. I would decrease it if the FATF presidency released a statement ahead of the plenary indicating that the focus would be on strategic initiatives rather than country-specific processes, or if global events caused a significant disruption to the FATF's normal operations.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill any jurisdictions be added to or removed from the FATF \"grey list\" following the FATF Plenary meeting in June 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nAML Intelligence (February 2025) [UPDATE: Philippines removed from FATF ‘grey list’ as Laos, Nepal added to watchlist](https://www.amlintelligence.com/2025/02/breaking-fatf-grey-list-update-laos-and-nepal-added-the-philippines-removed/)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if following its June 2025 plenary, the Financial Action Task Force (FATF) has made any changes to its \"Jurisdictions under Increased Monitoring\" list, which at the time of this question consists of Algeria, Angola, Bulgaria, Burkina Faso, Cameroon, Côte d'Ivoire, Croatia, the Democratic Republic of Congo, Haiti, Kenya, the Lao People's Democratic Republic, Lebanon, Mali, Monaco, Mozambique, Namibia, Nepal, Nigeria, South Africa, South Sudan, Syria, Tanzania, Venezuela, Vietnam, and Yemen. Resolves according to the [official list](https://www.fatf-gafi.org/en/countries/black-and-grey-lists.html).\n\nThe question may resolve according to [credible sources](https://www.metaculus.com/help/faq/#definitions) in case the website is unavailable or not timely updated.\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nNo additional information available.\n\nToday is 2025-05-19.\n\nBefore answering you think:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n(e) You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
