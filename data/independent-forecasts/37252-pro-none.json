    "no_outcome_scenario": "The political crisis following the martial law declaration de-escalates, leading to smaller protests below the 10,000 participant threshold. Alternatively, a large protest occurs, but the Global Protest Tracker does not update its database to include it before the July 1, 2025 resolution date.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Sustained public anger and political mobilization in response to the December 2024 martial law declaration lead to at least one large-scale demonstration involving 10,000 or more people. The event is captured and reported by the Global Protest Tracker within the specified timeframe.",
    "rationale": "My forecast is based primarily on the provided context indicating a surge in anti-government protests in South Korea following a martial law declaration in late 2024. This event represents a profound political crisis, which historically has been a strong driver of large-scale public mobilization in the country. The status quo is a highly volatile environment where large protests are already occurring, making it likely this trend will continue in the short term. The two-month window until resolution is relatively short, but the political momentum appears strong enough to generate at least one event meeting the size criteria. South Korea has a robust history of civil society engagement and large-scale demonstrations during political turmoil, such as the 2016-2017 'candlelight protests'. My research assistant provided no additional information, so my analysis relies on this background. My probability is not higher because protest movements can have peaks and lulls, and a two-month period of relative calm is possible as political actors might pursue other avenues like legal or parliamentary challenges. There is also a slight risk of a reporting lag by the Global Protest Tracker. My probability is not lower because the catalyst event—an attempted declaration of martial law—is exceptionally severe and would likely create sustained public outrage that does not dissipate quickly. For me to lower my forecast, I would need to see evidence of significant de-escalation, such as a formal political accord or the resignation of key government figures. Conversely, I would raise it if major opposition groups explicitly called for new mass rallies.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill the Global Protest Tracker report any protests in South Korea with 10,000+ participants, before July 1, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nACLED December 2024: [South Korea: Anti-government protests surge following martial law declaration](https://acleddata.com/2025/01/15/asia-pacific-overview-january-2025/#keytrends6)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if the [Global Protest Tracker](https://carnegieendowment.org/features/global-protest-tracker?lang=en) reports a protest in South Korea with 10,000 or more participants with a start date after the launch of this question and before July 1, 2025.\n\n\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nNo additional information available.\n\nToday is 2025-05-01.\n\nBefore answering you think:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n(e) You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
