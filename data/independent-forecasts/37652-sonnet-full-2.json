  "information": "Following his election win on April 28, 2025, Prime Minister Mark Carney presented a new, smaller cabinet of 29 ministers, down from 39 in the previous administration. Key figures such as François-Philippe Champagne (Finance) and Dominic LeBlanc (US Trade) were retained. Carney's government announced it would not table a full federal budget before the summer, opting for a fall economic statement instead. The new administration's immediate promises include a tax cut and the elimination of all inter-provincial trade barriers by July 1. Carney signed a symbolic decree to lower the first taxable income bracket from 15% to 14%, a measure requiring parliamentary approval. The Liberal party's platform includes additional spending that projects the national deficit for 2025-26 to be $62.3 billion Canadian dollars, an increase from the $42.2 billion forecast in December.\n\nThe relationship with the United States under President Donald Trump was a central theme of the recent Canadian election. Trump had made public remarks about absorbing Canada into the U.S. and imposed tariffs on Canadian goods. In response, Prime Minister Carney stated his government would 'relentlessly' protect Canadian sovereignty and work to define a new economic and security relationship with Washington. After the election, Carney met with Trump but did not secure a removal of the U.S. tariffs. Carney has stated he will maintain Canadian tariffs on U.S. products as long as American tariffs remain in place. The new Canadian cabinet has been explicitly tasked with focusing on Canada-U.S. relations and resolving trade disputes.\n\nPolling data from the period leading up to the April 28, 2025, snap election showed a significant shift in public opinion. After trailing by more than 20 points at the start of the year, the Liberal party under Mark Carney experienced a major comeback. A March 23 Ipsos poll reported Carney's approval rating at 48% with 30% disapproval, while Conservative leader Pierre Poilievre had 35% approval and 52% disapproval. Some outlets cited the same poll as showing Carney with a 71% approval rating. An Abacus Data poll from March 24 found the Conservatives with a national lead of 39% to 36% over the Liberals, but found Carney was the preferred choice for Prime Minister over Poilievre, 38% to 34%. The same poll reported that 77% of Canadians held a negative view of U.S. President Donald Trump.",

    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Approximately 6.5 weeks until July 1, 2025",
    "status_quo_outcome": "Yes - Carney maintains higher approval than Trump",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "The trade war with the US causes economic pain that rapidly erodes Carney's honeymoon period. Rising unemployment or business closures due to tariffs lead to voter dissatisfaction. Meanwhile, Trump experiences a rally-around-the-flag moment from a domestic or international event, boosting his approval to match or exceed Carney's declining numbers.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Carney continues his honeymoon period as a newly elected PM, benefiting from his strong stance on Canadian sovereignty and popular domestic policies like tax cuts. His approval remains in the mid-to-high 50s while Trump's approval stays in the low-to-mid 40s, consistent with his historical range. The strong anti-Trump sentiment in Canada (77% negative view) reinforces Carney's position.",
    "rationale": "Carney became PM on April 28, 2025, making July 1 only about 2 months into his term - well within typical honeymoon periods for new leaders. Pre-election polling in March showed him at 48% approval, and new PMs typically receive a boost upon taking office. His immediate policy initiatives (tax cuts, eliminating trade barriers by July 1) are popular measures likely to maintain support. The research shows 77% of Canadians hold negative views of Trump, which should help Carney's relative standing. Trump's approval ratings historically range between 40-45% in Morning Consult tracking, and there's no indication of major events that would dramatically shift this. However, I'm not forecasting higher than 65% because: (1) the trade dispute could create economic headwinds that damage Carney's approval faster than expected; (2) the projected $62.3B deficit could become a political liability; (3) uncertainty about whether Morning Consult's specific methodology will align with general polling trends; (4) Trump could experience an unexpected approval boost. I'm not lower because the honeymoon effect is well-documented, Carney's initial positioning is strong, and the structural anti-Trump sentiment in Canada provides a baseline advantage. I would update higher if: early June polling shows Carney maintaining 55%+ approval while Trump remains below 45%. I would update lower if: trade war effects accelerate economic pain, or if Carney's deficit projections become a major controversy by mid-June.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney have a higher approval rating than US President Donald Trump on July 1, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nResolution source updates monthly.
