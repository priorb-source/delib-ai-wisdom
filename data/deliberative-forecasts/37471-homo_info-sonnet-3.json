    "review": "Forecaster 2 provides crucial new information: March 2025 inventory was 503,000, representing only 3,000 units growth from February (0.6% monthly). This means we need 47,000 units growth over just two remaining months to exceed 550,000 - requiring 4.7% monthly growth, nearly 8x the current pace. This dramatically changes the analysis. Forecaster 3 raises an excellent point I overlooked: May is peak spring/summer buying season when sales absorption typically increases, which works AGAINST inventory buildup, not for it. This seasonal factor is critical and substantially undermines the case for reaching 550k. Both forecasters correctly note that only 2 months remain (I miscalculated thinking 3 months), making the required acceleration even more dramatic. However, Forecaster 2's 8% may be slightly too pessimistic given the strong multi-year trend and pipeline effects, while Forecaster 3's 38% doesn't fully incorporate the seasonal absorption argument they themselves raised.",
    "rationale": "After reviewing the other forecasters' analyses, I need to significantly revise downward. The critical factors are: (1) Only 2 months remain, not 3 as I initially calculated. (2) March showed only 0.6% monthly growth (3,000 units), while we need 4.7% monthly growth - an 8x acceleration. (3) Most importantly, May falls in peak home-buying season when sales absorption typically rises, working directly against inventory accumulation. This seasonal factor strongly suggests inventory will be absorbed rather than build. (4) The recent deceleration signals (starts down 14.2%, permits down 2%, builder confidence at 42) indicate the market is cooling, not accelerating. While pipeline completions and weak demand could still drive some inventory growth, requiring an 8x acceleration in growth rate during peak absorption season makes this scenario quite unlikely. The combination of timing, seasonal factors, and current decelerating trend all point to a much lower probability than my initial 40%.",
