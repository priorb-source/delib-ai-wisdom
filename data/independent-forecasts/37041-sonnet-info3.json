  "information": "Several countries near the outbreak zones have implemented preventive measures. Panama has activated health protocols, although it has not reported a human case since 1974 and has vaccination coverage of over 95% in high-risk areas. Ecuador has also activated protocols and is conducting preventive vaccination campaigns. Costa Rica has made the yellow fever vaccine mandatory for travelers arriving from 43 countries, including many in South America, as of March 11, 2025, due to the presence of the Aedes aegypti mosquito vector in the country.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "38 days (from April 24, 2025 to June 1, 2025)",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No - Currently, no North American countries have CDC yellow fever travel advisories. North American countries have historically not had endemic yellow fever transmission for decades.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "The yellow fever outbreak remains contained to South American countries. Preventive measures in Central American nations (vaccination campaigns, vector control, health protocols) prove effective. No sustained local transmission occurs in North American countries. The CDC does not issue travel health notices for any North American destinations.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Yellow fever spreads northward from South America into Central America. Local transmission is confirmed in one or more countries like Panama, Costa Rica, or other Central American nations where the Aedes aegypti vector is present. The CDC issues a travel health notice warning travelers about the risk when visiting these countries before June 1, 2025.",
    "rationale": "The status quo strongly favors a No outcome. Panama hasn't reported a human yellow fever case since 1974 and maintains >95% vaccination coverage in high-risk areas. No current cases have been reported in North American countries despite the March 31 PAHO alert. The 38-day timeframe is relatively short for an outbreak to emerge, be detected, investigated, and result in a CDC travel advisory. Countries are implementing strong preventive measures including vaccination campaigns, health protocols, and travel restrictions. However, I'm not forecasting lower because: (1) There is an active yellow fever outbreak in the Americas prompting PAHO alerts, (2) The Aedes aegypti vector is confirmed present in Central American countries like Costa Rica, creating biological conditions for transmission, (3) Costa Rica's mandate for yellow fever vaccination from 43 countries suggests real concern about introduction risk, (4) 38 days is technically enough time for an outbreak to develop if conditions align. I'm not forecasting higher because of the strong status quo - decades without cases, robust preventive infrastructure, and no current reports of transmission. I would update higher if cases were reported in any North American country or if the South American outbreak showed signs of rapid northward spread. I would update lower if we reach mid-May without any cases reported.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill any North American country be listed as having a CDC yellow fever travel advisory on June 1, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\n[PAHO issues new epidemiological alert amid rising yellow fever cases in the Americas](https://www.paho.org/en/news/31-3-2025-paho-issues-new-epidemiological-alert-amid-rising-yellow-fever-cases-americas)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if a country in North America is listed as having a travel advisory by the Centers for Disease Control at its [Travel Health Notices](https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/travel/notices) page when checked by Metaculus on or after June 1, 2025.\n\n\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nSeveral countries near the outbreak zones have implemented preventive measures. Panama has activated health protocols, although it has not reported a human case since 1974 and has vaccination coverage of over 95% in high-risk areas. Ecuador has also activated protocols and is conducting preventive vaccination campaigns. Costa Rica has made the yellow fever vaccine mandatory for travelers arriving from 43 countries, including many in South America, as of March 11, 2025, due to the presence of the Aedes aegypti mosquito vector in the country.\n\nToday is 2025-04-24.\n\nBefore answering you think:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n(e) You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
