    "review": "My initial forecast of 35% was based on President Trump's established opposition to the Diversity Visa program and his high volume of executive actions on immigration. Forecaster 2 (28%) made a solid point by emphasizing the strong negative evidence: despite dozens of immigration-related actions since January 2025, none have mentioned the program, suggesting it is not a top-tier priority. However, Forecaster 3's analysis (14%) was the most impactful, raising two critical points I had underestimated. First, the resolution criterion requires the *exact phrase* \"Diversity Visa.\" Forecaster 3 rightly points out that official government language often uses the more formal \"Diversity Immigrant Visa Program,\" and Trump's colloquial preference is \"visa lottery.\" This introduces a significant filter; an action targeting the program might be issued but fail to meet the specific wording requirement. Second, Forecaster 3 noted that a natural trigger for such an action—the release of the 2026 lottery results in early May—has already passed without incident. This missed opportunity weakens the case for an imminent, politically-timed action.",
    "rationale": "After reviewing my peers' analyses, I am substantially lowering my forecast. My initial assessment did not sufficiently weigh the friction introduced by the question's strict resolution criteria. The argument from Forecaster 3 that a presidential action is likely to use the formal term \"Diversity Immigrant Visa Program\" or the colloquial \"visa lottery\" rather than the exact required phrase \"Diversity Visa\" is highly convincing. This single detail significantly lowers the probability of a 'Yes' resolution, even if the administration takes action against the program. Furthermore, the points raised by both other forecasters about the strong pattern of non-mention so far (despite high activity on immigration) and the passing of a key trigger event in early May, persuade me that the odds of such a specific action occurring in the short remaining timeframe are lower than I first thought. While President Trump's focus on immigration and willingness to use executive orders remain high, the combination of a crowded policy agenda, a legislative path already in motion (the SAFE Act), and the specific wording constraint leads me to a more pessimistic conclusion. I am reducing my forecast from 35% to 18%, reflecting these new considerations.",
