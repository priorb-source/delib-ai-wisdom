    "review": "Forecaster 2 provides critical new information: the second estimate showed -0.2%, an upward revision of 0.1 pp from the advance estimate. This is crucial data I didn't have. However, Forecaster 2 appears to make a calculation error, stating we need 0.3 pp additional revision when we actually need just over 0.2 pp to exceed 0.0%. Their 25% forecast seems overly pessimistic given the upward momentum and the small remaining gap. Forecaster 3 provides valuable historical context with the 35-40% sign-change rate for advance estimates between -0.5% and 0%, and their 38% forecast aligns well with this base rate. However, Forecaster 3 doesn't fully incorporate the second estimate information that shows we're now at -0.2% with upward momentum, not -0.3%. Both forecasters raise valid concerns about the fact that two consecutive negative estimates suggest genuine weakness rather than pure measurement error.",
    "rationale": "After reviewing the other analyses, I'm updating my forecast downward but remaining more optimistic than my peers. The key insight is that the second estimate at -0.2% (up from -0.3%) demonstrates clear upward revision momentum while placing us very close to the zero threshold. The required additional revision is only 0.2+ percentage points, which is well below the typical 0.5 pp absolute revision magnitude between advance and third estimates. Forecaster 3's historical data showing 35-40% sign changes for readings in this range provides a useful anchor. However, I weight the upward momentum more heavily than my peers. The consistent upward revision pattern suggests measurement issues may have initially understated Q1 growth. Against this, I must acknowledge that two consecutive negative estimates indicate real economic weakness, not just statistical noise. Third estimate revisions are also typically smaller than advance-to-second revisions, tempering optimism. On balance, I'm moderating my initial 47% to 42%, recognizing the consecutive negative readings while still seeing the upward trend and proximity to zero as meaningfully bullish factors that justify a forecast above the historical base rate.",
