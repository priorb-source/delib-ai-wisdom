    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Approximately 6-7 weeks until July 1, 2025",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No - Currently, Texas does not have a comprehensive ban on THC sales, so if no new legislation is enacted, the question resolves as No",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "The Texas legislature either fails to pass a comprehensive THC ban bill, or passes a bill but the governor does not sign it into law before July 1, 2025. Alternatively, any passed legislation might only constitute a partial ban (such as age restrictions) which would not satisfy the resolution criteria",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "The Texas legislature successfully passes a bill that fully prohibits the sale of THC within the state, and Governor Abbott signs it into law before July 1, 2025. This would require rapid movement through both chambers and executive approval within the next 6-7 weeks",
    "rationale": "The critical constraint here is the extremely short timeframe - only about 6-7 weeks remain until the July 1 deadline. The Texas Legislature operates on a biennial schedule, meeting in regular session during odd-numbered years for 140 days starting in January. If we're in mid-May 2025, we're likely in the final weeks of the 2025 regular session, which would end in late May or early June. While the Beaumont Enterprise article title suggests active legislative consideration of a THC ban this session, enacting a comprehensive statewide ban on THC sales in such a compressed timeframe faces significant hurdles. The legislative process requires committee approval, passage through both chambers, reconciliation of any differences, and gubernatorial signature - typically a process taking months. Good forecasting practice demands heavy weighting toward the status quo, especially over short time horizons. The status quo is clearly 'No ban.' For this to resolve as Yes, legislation would need to be already quite advanced through the process. However, given uncertainty about the bill's current status, complete failure to enact is not certain. What would increase my probability: concrete evidence that a bill has already passed one or both chambers, indication of emergency or fast-track status, or strong bipartisan support. What would decrease it: evidence the legislative session will end before July 1, reports of the bill being stalled or defeated, or finding that no specific bill has been formally introduced. The short timeframe combined with status quo bias suggests a low probability, though not negligible given apparent active consideration",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill the state of Texas ban THC before July 1, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nBeaumont Enterprise: [Will THC see its final death blow in Texas this session?](https://www.beaumontenterprise.com/news/article/texas-senate-bill-aims-ban-thc-activists-call-20279801.php)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if before July 1, 2025, Texas enacts a law prohibiting the sale of THC. If no new prohibitions on the sale of THC become law in Texas before that date, this question resolves as No.\n\nFor it to count, a law must fully prohibit the sale of THC within the state. This question resolves upon a ban being signed into law, rather than when it is implemented. An enacted law being later overturned will not cause the question to re-resolve. Partial bans (for example laws prohibiting the sale of THC to persons under 21 years of age) will not count. This question pertains to the sale of THC within the state, not to the purchase of it by individuals.\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nNo additional information available.\n\nToday is 2025-05-14.\n\nBefore answering you think:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n(e) You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
