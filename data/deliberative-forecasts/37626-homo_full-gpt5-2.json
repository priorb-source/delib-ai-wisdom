    "review": "Both forecasters emphasize two points I agree with: (1) bananas’ status as a loss-leader that retailers price very sticky, and (2) the April BLS print (due imminently) is the pivotal near-term signal. They also frame the alleged 10% tariff as unconfirmed and, even if real, subject to lagged/partial retail pass-through—reasonable given FTAs with key Latin American suppliers and grocer pricing practices. I also find their focus on how little movement is needed to cross $0.6300 persuasive; a few mills could flip the outcome. None of their arguments materially contradict my base case, but they do push me to weight the threshold tightness and tariff-risk tail a bit more, tempering my earlier slight edge for Yes.",
    "rationale": "Base case remains that the series is very stable and currently below the threshold (Jan 0.621, Mar 0.625). Retailer stickiness and improved volumes point toward modest changes, which favors under $0.6300. However, with Mar at 0.625, only ~0.005 is needed to flip to No, and typical month-to-month moves of a few mills are common. Dole’s commentary on higher fruit/shipping costs and the possibility (still unconfirmed) of a broad import tariff effective in April introduce upside risk. Even if pass-through is partial by May, the bar to reach 0.630 is low.\nNet: I still lean Yes, but with slightly less confidence than my prior estimate. I will update materially after the April print: ≥0.630 would push me toward No; ≤~0.627 would raise my confidence in Yes.",
