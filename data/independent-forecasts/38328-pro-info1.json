  "information": "A lobbying scandal involving Huawei has led to a probe by Belgian prosecutors. On June 5, 2025, EPP MEP Fulvio Martusciello was arrested in connection with the investigation. Authorities have also requested that the parliamentary immunity be lifted for at least four other MEPs. The Parliament's Committee on Legal Affairs was expected to vote on these immunity waivers in mid-June, with the full plenary potentially confirming the decision during its session from June 16-19. Citing the precedent set during the 'Qatargate' scandal, major political groups like the EPP, S&D, and Renew have signaled zero-tolerance positions on corruption.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "25 days",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No MEPs resign within the specified timeframe, as resignations are generally rare events.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "The MEPs implicated in the Huawei scandal, including the one arrested, maintain their innocence and refuse to resign. Their political groups decide to await the outcome of the legal proceedings, and the process of lifting parliamentary immunity is delayed or does not immediately result in a resignation before the July 1 deadline.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Following the arrest of MEP Fulvio Martusciello and the mid-June vote to lift the immunity of other implicated MEPs, the political pressure from their party and the public becomes overwhelming. At least one of the MEPs announces their resignation to focus on their legal defense and mitigate the reputational damage to their political group and the Parliament.",
    "rationale": "My forecast is primarily driven by the severity of the Huawei lobbying scandal, which has already led to the arrest of one MEP, Fulvio Martusciello, and requests for immunity waivers for four others. This is a significant deviation from the status quo, where MEP resignations are infrequent. The precedent set by the 'Qatargate' scandal is crucial; it demonstrated that major political groups like the EPP, S&D, and Renew are willing to enforce a 'zero-tolerance' policy to protect the institution's integrity, often resulting in swift suspensions or pressure to resign. The upcoming vote on immunity waivers in the June 16-19 plenary session will be a critical inflection point, likely maximizing the political pressure on the implicated individuals. A resignation serves as a clear, decisive action for a political group to distance itself from a damaging scandal. The probability is not higher because the timeframe is very short (less than a month), and legal and parliamentary procedures can be slow. An MEP might choose to fight the allegations while remaining in office, and their party could, despite public statements, delay taking decisive action. The probability is not lower because an arrest of a sitting MEP is an extraordinary event that demands a strong political response. The 'Qatargate' playbook suggests that the pressure for a resignation will be immense and immediate following the formal lifting of immunity. I would increase my forecast if a major political group formally calls for an MEP's resignation. I would decrease it if the immunity waiver votes are postponed beyond the end of June.",
