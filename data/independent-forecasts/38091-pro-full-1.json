  "information": "In the first five months of 2025, three countries signed the Artemis Accords: Finland (January 23), Bangladesh (April 8), and Norway (May 15), bringing the total number of signatories to 55. This follows the signings of Panama and Austria in December 2024. In a statement on May 22, 2025, acting NASA Administrator Janet Petro said that NASA anticipates additional countries will sign the accords in the coming weeks and months.\n\nThe United Arab Emirates hosted an international Artemis Accords workshop in Abu Dhabi on May 21-22, 2025. Representatives from over 30 of the 55 signatory countries attended to discuss the implementation of the Accords' principles, including transparency, data sharing, and sustainability in space. In addition, the 2025 Humans to the Moon & Mars Summit (H2M2) was held in Washington, D.C., on May 28-29, bringing together leaders from government, industry, and international space agencies to discuss the future of human space exploration.\n\nAs of late May 2025, there have been no public announcements of a specific country planning to sign the Artemis Accords during the month of June. In a parallel development in international space exploration, China and Russia have announced a joint plan to build a nuclear reactor on the Moon by 2035 to power their International Lunar Research Station (ILRS). The ILRS project is positioned as a rival to the US-led Artemis program and has secured partnerships with 17 countries.",

    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Approximately one month. The outcome will be known on July 1, 2025.",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No country will sign the Artemis Accords in June 2025.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "June 2025 concludes without any new signatories. Diplomatic processes with potential candidate countries continue, but no signing ceremony is scheduled or completed within the specified one-month window.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "A country finalizes its internal approvals and diplomatic arrangements, leading to an official signing ceremony of the Artemis Accords after May 30, 2025, and before July 1, 2025.",
    "rationale": "My forecast is based primarily on the recent and consistent rate of new signatories, which suggests a high likelihood of another country joining in the near term. There have been five new signatories in the last six months (December 2024 - May 2025), an average of 0.83 per month. This strong trend alone makes a signing in any given month, such as June, a very plausible event. This quantitative evidence is supported by qualitative information: a statement on May 22, 2025, from acting NASA Administrator Janet Petro anticipating more signatories in the 'coming weeks and months.' The term 'weeks' is a key indicator for an event in the near future. Furthermore, recent high-profile events like the UAE workshop and the H2M2 Summit have maintained diplomatic momentum. The primary reason my forecast is not higher is the absence of any public announcements or even strong rumors about a specific country planning to sign in June. Such diplomatic events are often announced in advance, and the lack of a named candidate introduces significant uncertainty about the precise timing. The forecast is not lower because ignoring the clear trend and the explicit statement from NASA's leadership would be a mistake. To bet against a signing in June would be to bet that this established momentum will suddenly halt for this specific 30-day period. I would increase my forecast if any reliable source names a country targeting a June signing. I would decrease it if mid-June passes with no news, or if a relevant official suggests a longer timeline.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill a country sign the Artemis Accords in June 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nThe most recent signatory was Bangladesh, on April 8, 2025 and [Norway](https://www.state.gov/united-states-welcomes-norways-signing-of-the-artemis-accords/) on May 15, 2025. There are 55 signatories at the time of this question: Angola, Argentina, Armenia, Australia, Austria, Bahrain, Bangladesh, Belgium, Brazil, Bulgaria, Canada, Chile, Colombia, the Republic of Cyprus, Czech Republic, Denmark, Dominican Republic, Ecuador, Estonia, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Iceland, India, Israel, Italy, Japan, Liechtenstein, Lithuania, Luxembourg, Mexico, Netherlands, New Zealand, Nigeria, Norway, Panama, Peru, Poland, the Republic of Korea, Romania, Rwanda, Saudi Arabia, Singapore, Slovakia, Slovenia, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, Thailand, Ukraine, the United Arab Emirates, the United Kingdom, the United States, and Uruguay.

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
