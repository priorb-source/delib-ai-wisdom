    "review": "Both forecasters emphasize persistent headwinds (elevated inflation expectations, tariff uncertainty, soft ISM, cautious spending) and the short time window, which supports a below-54 outcome. They add little new data beyond what I considered, but they do make a clear case that resolving these drivers within June is unlikely. I think they slightly overstate the size of the rebound needed—1.8 points is well within typical month-to-month volatility—and underweight the potential for upside catalysts (CPI/FOMC, equity moves, gas prices) and the sharp rebound in the Conference Board index. Still, their arguments marginally strengthen the base-case tilt toward <54.\n",
    "rationale": "Baseline: May final at 52.2 is already below the 54 threshold, and sentiment has trended down since February. Structural negatives (inflation expectations, trade/tariff uncertainty) likely persist into mid-June. With roughly three weeks to the final print, the most probable path is that preliminary June lands near low-50s and the final remains below 54. Counterpoints: the threshold is close; typical monthly swings of a few points mean a move above 54 is plausible, and the Conference Board’s big rebound plus potential benign CPI/FOMC outcomes could lift sentiment. Given peers’ emphasis on persistent headwinds and limited time for a turnaround, I nudge my probability up modestly, but keep it short of the low-70s to reflect the proximity to the threshold and plausible upside catalysts.\n",
