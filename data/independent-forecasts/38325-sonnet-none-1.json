    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Approximately 3 weeks. The third estimate for Q1 2025 GDP is typically released about 90 days after quarter-end (March 31, 2025), which would place it around late June 2025.",
    "status_quo_outcome": "NO - The advance estimate showed real GDP contracted at an annual rate of 0.3%. If revisions maintain negative or zero growth, the outcome would be No.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "The third estimate confirms or shows further downward revisions to Q1 2025 GDP, keeping the annualized growth rate at or below 0.0%. This could occur if more complete data on consumer spending, business investment, inventories, or net exports validates or worsens the initial contraction reading.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "The third estimate is revised upward by more than 0.3 percentage points, showing positive growth. This could happen if initial data underestimated consumer spending, business investment improved more than preliminary figures suggested, or inventory changes and net exports were more favorable than first measured.",
    "rationale": "The advance estimate of -0.3% is remarkably close to the zero threshold, placing this question in a zone of high uncertainty. Historical patterns show that revisions between advance and third GDP estimates typically range from 0.5 to 1.5 percentage points in absolute terms, with no systematic directional bias. This means a swing from -0.3% to positive territory requires only a modest upward revision of 0.4 percentage points or more.\n\nKey factors supporting higher probability: (1) The article notes the advance estimate was 'lower than expected,' suggesting market expectations were for positive growth, which could indicate the initial data captured transitory weakness; (2) The extremely narrow margin means normal data refinement could easily change the sign; (3) Later estimates incorporate more complete source data that can reveal strength missed in preliminary reports.\n\nKey factors supporting lower probability: (1) Status quo bias - good forecasters weight the initial reading heavily since the world changes slowly; (2) The advance estimate represents BEA's best assessment with available data; (3) Revisions can go either direction with roughly equal probability historically.\n\nMy forecast is not higher because I must respect that the advance estimate, while preliminary, represents expert analysis of real economic activity, and negative readings typically indicate genuine economic weakness. My forecast is not lower because the margin is so thin that it falls within the normal range of measurement uncertainty and data revisions.\n\nTo update higher: Evidence that specific components (consumer spending, business investment) were underestimated in initial reports, or that the second estimate showed meaningful upward revision. To update lower: The second estimate confirms or deepens the contraction, or analysis reveals broad-based weakness across GDP components.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill the third estimate of Q1 2025 annualized real GDP growth show an increase?\n\nQuestion background:\nAdvisor Perspectives: [Q1 GDP Advance Estimate: Real GDP at -0.3%, Lower Than Expected](https://www.advisorperspectives.com/dshort/updates/2025/04/30/gdp-gross-domestic-product-q1-2025-advance-estimate)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if the Bureau of Economic Analysis' Gross Domestic Product, 1st Quarter 2025 (Third Estimate) release shows that real gross domestic product (GDP) increased at an annual rate greater than 0.0%.

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
