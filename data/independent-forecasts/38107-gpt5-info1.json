  "information": "Former FBI Director James Comey is under investigation by the Department of Homeland Security and the Secret Service after posting a photo on Instagram showing seashells arranged to spell '86 47'. The number '86' can be slang for 'kill' or 'remove,' and Donald Trump is the 47th president. Following the post, Comey was interviewed by the Secret Service but was not arrested. He later deleted the post, stating, 'I didn't realize that some people associate these numbers with violence. I oppose all forms of violence, so I deleted the post.' Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem confirmed the investigation.",

    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "About 31 days (through June 30, 2025)",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "The Secret Service/DHS inquiry concludes or remains open without charges; no other law-enforcement encounters occur, and Comey avoids further provocative posts or events. July 1 arrives with no custodial detention reported by credible outlets.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Authorities decide there’s probable cause for a threat against the president (e.g., 18 U.S.C. § 871) and arrest or accept a custodial surrender/booking before July 1; or Comey is arrested for an unrelated matter (e.g., protest-related offense, contempt, or a routine local charge) anywhere in the world.",
    "rationale": "Baseline: Arrests of prominent ex-officials for ambiguous social-media content are rare, and the legal standard for a criminal threat generally requires a true threat/intent, which the available facts don’t clearly support. The reported sequence so far—interview by the Secret Service, deletion of the post, explicit disavowal of violent intent, and no immediate detention—points toward inquiry without arrest. Time window is short (~1 month). Broader base rate for any arrest of a high-profile, legally savvy figure in a month is extremely low.\nEvidence from the assistant: Secret Service interviewed Comey about an Instagram photo spelling “86 47”; he deleted it and said he opposes violence; there has been no arrest to date. This supports a low base likelihood.\nWhy not higher: To arrest within 31 days, authorities would need rapid development of probable cause or choose an aggressive posture despite the disavowal. That seems unlikely given public scrutiny and the weakness of the evidence for a true threat. Also, no other active investigations of Comey are publicly known that might trigger a quick arrest.\nWhy not lower: The threshold is any arrest, anywhere, for any reason. Political dynamics could create pressure for action; a sealed complaint or quick arrest on a threats theory, or an unrelated custodial incident, though unlikely, is not impossible.\nWhat would move me up: Credible reporting of a criminal referral, grand jury activity targeting Comey, a search/raid, a filed complaint/indictment, or further posts/statements by Comey interpreted as threatening. Also, signals of a broader crackdown (e.g., comparable arrests of other figures for similar speech) would raise risk. What would move me down: Public indications that the inquiry is closed or that the Secret Service found no threat; continued quiet with no new developments by mid-June.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill James Comey be arrested before July 1, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\n[Secret Service Is Asking Comey About a Photo of Seashells Spelling ‘86 47’](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/16/us/politics/secret-service-comey-social-media-trump.html)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if former FBI director James Comey is arrested before July 1, 2025, according to [credible sources](https://www.metaculus.com/faq/#definitions).\n\nIn order to streamline this question's resolution, please note that an arrest anywhere in the world, for any reason, will resolve this question as Yes. For purposes of this question, we define \"arrest\" using the definition [posted at Nolo](https://www.nolo.com/legal-encyclopedia/justifies-arrest-probable-cause.html): \"An arrest requires taking someone into custody, against that person's will, in order to prosecute or interrogate. It involves a physical application of force, or submission to an officer's show of force. In sum, the arrestee must not be free to leave. Whether the act by the police is termed an arrest under state law is not relevant. When deciding whether someone has been arrested, courts apply the 'reasonable man' standard. This means asking whether a reasonable person, in the shoes of the defendant, would have concluded that he or she was not free to leave.\"\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nFormer FBI Director James Comey is under investigation by the Department of Homeland Security and the Secret Service after posting a photo on Instagram showing seashells arranged to spell '86 47'.

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
