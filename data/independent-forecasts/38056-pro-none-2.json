    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "The event date for UFC 316 is not yet officially announced, but these events typically occur monthly. Assuming a date in late 2025 or early 2026, there are several months until the outcome is known.",
    "status_quo_outcome": "The fight proceeds as scheduled. Given Azamat Murzakanov's undefeated record and proven power against Johnny Walker's documented inconsistency and defensive vulnerabilities, the status quo trajectory favors a Murzakanov victory, resulting in a 'No' outcome.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Azamat Murzakanov successfully closes the significant distance gap, withstands Walker's early offense, and secures a knockout victory by exploiting Walker's defensive openings. Alternatively, the fight is canceled for any reason (e.g., injury), which per the resolution criteria, would also result in a 'No' outcome.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Johnny Walker implements a disciplined game plan, effectively using his massive 8-inch height and 11-inch reach advantage to keep Murzakanov on the outside with kicks and long-range strikes, ultimately securing a knockout or TKO victory.",
    "rationale": "This forecast is based on an analysis of the fighters' styles, physical attributes, and career trajectories, while also factoring in structural elements like fight cancellation rates. \n\nAzamat Murzakanov brings a formidable undefeated record (13-0) and demonstrated knockout power into this fight. He is a durable and powerful fighter who consistently finds a way to win. This creates a strong case for the 'No' outcome. Furthermore, the resolution criteria state that a fight cancellation for any reason resolves the question as 'No'. Fight cancellations due to injury or other issues are common, and for a fight scheduled months away, a conservative estimate of a 15-20% cancellation probability adds significant weight to the 'No' side.\n\nHowever, Johnny Walker presents a unique challenge that Murzakanov has not faced. Walker possesses extraordinary physical advantages with a massive height and reach superiority. When fighting with discipline, he can control the distance and presents a threat of a sudden, explosive finish against anyone. This potential for Walker to dominate the fight's geography is the primary driver for the 'Yes' scenario.\n\nMy probability of 44% is derived from these competing factors. It is not lower because Walker's physical advantages are too significant to ignore; if he can avoid Murzakanov's power, his path to victory is clear. Murzakanov has never fought someone with this kind of reach. It is not higher because of Walker's proven vulnerabilities—specifically his questionable chin and defensive lapses—which play directly into Murzakanov's strengths as a power puncher. The significant chance of a fight cancellation, which a 'Yes' outcome cannot survive, also caps the forecast's ceiling. \n\nI would increase my forecast if reports indicated Walker was in an exceptionally disciplined camp focused on a safe, range-based strategy. I would decrease it upon any news of a Walker injury or if early betting lines opened with Murzakanov as a heavy favorite, suggesting market confidence in his ability to overcome the reach disadvantage.",

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
