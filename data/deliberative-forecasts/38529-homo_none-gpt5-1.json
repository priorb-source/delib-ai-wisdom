    "review": "Both analyses reinforce the same core structure I used: late leader advantage vs. RCV vulnerability for a polarizing frontrunner. New/useful emphases: (1) potential inheritance of the 2021 moderate/outer-borough coalition if Adams is not in the race; (2) progressives’ organizational edge and tendency to punch above polling in low-turnout NYC primaries; (3) the value of RCV-specific polling/simulations and second-choice strength; (4) turnout/early-vote indicators by geography as a late signal; and (5) the importance of union/borough-machine endorsements. I find these points largely convincing and consistent with priors. The caveat is that we still lack fresh, high-quality polling and concrete endorsement/field-shape data; the Adams contingency is scenario-dependent. Net, their arguments modestly strengthen the “leader holds” case without removing the RCV-transfer risk signaled by narrowing polls.",
    "rationale": "With ~2 weeks left, Cuomo’s high name recognition and a likely fragmented non-left field give him a slight edge, especially if undecideds and lower-information voters break toward the best-known option. However, RCV dynamics plus Cuomo’s high negatives create real downside: if anti-Cuomo voters coordinate and transfers consolidate to a single progressive (Mamdani), a first-round lead can evaporate. The headline suggests Mamdani momentum, increasing that risk. Forecasters’ added arguments about progressive GOTV outperformance and the salience of second-choice appeal keep me from moving higher, but their emphasis on outer-borough/moderate coalitions and late-breaking undecideds nudges me slightly upward. Without new polling or endorsement shocks, I’m making only a small update toward the consensus while keeping significant weight on RCV vulnerability.",
