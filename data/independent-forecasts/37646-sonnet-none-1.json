    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Approximately 47 days, from May 15, 2025 to July 1, 2025",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No - Somalia is not currently listed as 'Available' on the Starlink availability map",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Despite the license announcement, Starlink fails to complete the commercial rollout in time due to regulatory finalizations, infrastructure challenges in Somalia, security concerns, payment processing setup delays, or simply not prioritizing the website update before the July 1 deadline",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Following the license announcement, SpaceX moves quickly to finalize regulatory requirements, establishes necessary ground infrastructure or partnerships, completes commercial arrangements, and updates the Starlink availability map to show Somalia as 'Available' within the 1.5 month window",
    "rationale": "The key positive signal is that Musk has already announced the Starlink license for Somalia, indicating clear intent to launch service. However, 47 days is a relatively tight timeframe for completing all necessary steps from license to public availability listing. Historically, there's often a gap between license announcements and actual service availability, as companies must finalize regulatory paperwork, establish local partnerships, set up payment infrastructure, and potentially install ground stations. Somalia presents additional challenges given its political instability and security concerns, though Starlink has successfully launched in other difficult markets. The lack of additional information from research suggests no concrete evidence of imminent rollout beyond the license announcement. Status quo bias favors 'No' since the map doesn't currently show availability and organizational/regulatory inertia typically slows deployment. However, the probability isn't lower because: (1) the license announcement demonstrates real progress, (2) SpaceX has occasionally surprised with rapid rollouts, and (3) a website update is technically simple once approvals are secured. The forecast would increase with news of ground station installations, distribution partnerships, or beta testing, and would decrease with reports of regulatory delays or security issues affecting operations in Somalia.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill Starlink's website show Somalia as a country with Starlink availability before July 1, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\n[Musk announces Starlink license for Somalia](https://www.spacedaily.com/reports/Musk_announces_Starlink_license_for_Somalia_999.html)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if, before July 1, 2025, the [Starlink Availability Map](https://www.starlink.com/us/map) has anywhere in Somalia listed as \"Available.\"\n\n\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nNo additional information available.\n\nToday is 2025-05-15.\n\nBefore answering you think:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n(e) You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
