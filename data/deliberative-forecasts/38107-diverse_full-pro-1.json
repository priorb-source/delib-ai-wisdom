    "review": "The analyses from all three forecasters show a strong consensus on the core drivers of this question. We all agree that the status quo outcome is 'No' due to significant First Amendment hurdles (specifically the subjective intent standard from Counterman v. Colorado), the extremely low historical base rate for arresting a former FBI Director, and the very short 32-day timeframe. We also all agree that the primary, albeit small, chance of a 'Yes' resolution stems from political pressure from the current administration. Forecaster 2's reasoning closely mirrored my own. Forecaster 3, however, introduced a nuanced point I hadn't fully weighted: that James Comey as an individual has a very low personal base rate for an incidental, unrelated arrest (like a DUI or protest), which was a wildcard I had factored in. This argument is convincing and effectively lowers the probability of one of the few paths to a 'Yes' outcome.",
    "rationale": "My initial forecast was 4%, which was identical to Forecaster 2's. We both felt the significant legal and historical barriers were dominant, but that the intense political climate created a small but non-trivial risk. After reviewing the other analyses, I am lowering my forecast. Forecaster 3's argument that Comey himself is an unlikely candidate for an unrelated, incidental arrest was particularly persuasive. This reduces the probability of a 'Yes' resolution through a pathway unrelated to the current investigation. While the risk of a politically motivated arrest on the social media post remains, the combination of high legal hurdles, institutional friction, and the extremely short timeline makes this an incredibly remote possibility. The Secret Service has already interviewed Comey without making an arrest, suggesting they did not find immediate probable cause. Moving from an interview to a federal arrest warrant in one month on a constitutionally fraught case is a very high bar. Therefore, I am updating my forecast downward from 4% to 3% to reflect a slightly lower probability for the 'any arrest' wildcard, while still acknowledging the tail risk of an unprecedented, politically-driven action.",
