  "information": "Direct air travel between Iraqi Kurdistan and Europe has expanded in 2025. In February, Aegean Airlines launched a direct route between Athens and Erbil, initially operating two flights per week. The new route brought the total number of countries with direct air links to Iraqi Kurdistan to 21. Following this, Athens International Airport's summer 2025 expansion plan includes new flights to Erbil operated by easyJet. Separately, German airline Eurowings has added Erbil to its summer flight plan from Cologne/Bonn airport, along with other new destinations such as Funchal and Bastia.\n\nErbil International Airport has undertaken developments to enhance its operational capabilities. The airport has commenced preliminary tests for night flights after receiving clearance for night landings, as part of a strategic plan to improve air communication systems and safety. In January 2025, a committee from the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) visited the airport to conduct an inspection for its inclusion in the official list of international airports. This inclusion is expected to facilitate an increase in the number of international flights. The airport's operational capacity was also demonstrated during the Hajj season, with the Iraqi Ministry of Transportation successfully operating numerous pilgrim flights from Erbil and other Iraqi airports.\n\nBroader regional aviation activity and international interest in the area have seen recent developments. Dubai-based carrier flydubai announced the resumption of direct daily flights to Damascus, Syria, starting from June 1, 2025, after a 12-year suspension. This move is part of a wider effort to enhance regional connectivity. In a different development indicating tourism interest, British travel company Wild Frontiers is offering a 15-day tour of Iraq, which includes visits to historical sites such as the citadel of Erbil, despite official UK government warnings against travel to the country.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "About 38 days (until July 1, 2025)",
    "status_quo_outcome": "Yes — current schedules and recent additions suggest Erbil is likely already in the low-to-mid 30s direct destinations; if nothing changes, flightsfrom.com should list >31.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "A security or regulatory shock leads several carriers to suspend routes (e.g., Turkish or Gulf services paused, or European launches delayed/cancelled), bringing the listed destinations on flightsfrom.com down to 31 or fewer by July 1.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Summer seasonal routes plus newly announced services (e.g., Aegean ATH–EBL; Eurowings CGN–EBL; additional Turkish leisure routes) are active by July 1, pushing the flightsfrom.com count comfortably above 31.",
    "rationale": "Baseline: Erbil typically has broad connectivity to Turkey, the Gulf, Levant/Egypt, domestic Iraqi cities, the Caucasus, and select European hubs. In recent years it has hovered around the low-30s (and often higher) destinations, with summer schedules adding leisure routes. The research assistant notes two concrete 2025 expansions: Aegean’s Athens–Erbil (launched Feb 2025) and Eurowings adding Cologne/Bonn for summer 2025. These, combined with usual summer adds (e.g., Antalya/Izmir and other seasonal Turkish leisure points), make a >31 outcome more likely by July 1. Airport-side improvements (night operations testing, ICAO inspection) signal strengthening operations, though they may not directly affect the July 1 count. Risk factors keeping the probability below certainty: flightsfrom.com only counts scheduled (not ad-hoc Hajj charters); any late-notice security incidents or regional airspace disruptions could cause suspensions; some announced European routes might slip or be pulled if demand underperforms; and flightsfrom’s listing can lag if schedules are thin (e.g., less-than-weekly operations). Why not higher: The region is exposed to episodic disruptions; even a small cluster of suspensions could push the count to ≤31 right around the resolution date. Why not lower: Clear evidence of incremental route growth into summer 2025, strong diaspora and VFR demand to Turkey/Gulf/Europe, and typical seasonal tailwinds. What would move me up: Confirmed schedules on flightsfrom.com or airline GDSs showing ≥34 active destinations by mid-June; additional Turkish leisure or Caucasus routes loaded; confirmation that CGN and ATH operate regularly by early June. What would move me down: News of temporary airport closures, NOTAM restrictions, or multi-route suspensions; delays/cancellations of the new European routes; evidence that some expected seasonal routes won’t operate weekly by July 1.",
