    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "About 30 days (until June 28, 2025)",
    "status_quo_outcome": "As of late April 2025, roughly 14 million Floridians were in drought; absent change, that implies a borderline Yes.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Florida’s rainy season becomes established in early-to-mid June with frequent sea-breeze storms and perhaps one or two tropical disturbances. US Drought Monitor downgrades large areas from D1+ to D0/no drought by the June 24 analysis (published June 26), dropping the statewide population-in-drought below 14.0 million.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "The onset of the rainy season is delayed or spotty, with continued subnormal precipitation through mid-to-late June. Key population centers (South Florida, Tampa Bay, Orlando corridor, Jacksonville) remain in D1+; the June 26 USDM release still tallies ≥14.0 million Floridians in drought.",
    "rationale": "- Baseline and seasonality: Florida’s drought typically peaks late dry season (spring) and improves rapidly once the wet season begins (usually late May in South Florida and early June northward). The USA Today report pegs about 14 million in drought in late April, but climatology favors substantial relief by late June. The US Drought Monitor also tends to reflect Florida improvements quickly when frequent convective rains and tropical moisture return.\n- Threshold math: Florida’s population is roughly 23 million; 14.0 million implies drought covering ~60%+ of residents. By late June, achieving that much coverage is historically uncommon unless the rainy season is notably delayed or suppressed. Even partial normalization in South Florida alone can push the tally below 14 million because Miami-Dade–Broward–Palm Beach comprise ~6+ million people.\n- Historical analogs: In many recent years with significant spring drought (e.g., 2017, 2020, 2024), widespread June rains/tropical disturbances materially reduced or erased drought footprints by late June. While prolonged spring droughts can persist (e.g., some La Niña years), the modal outcome is improvement into late June.\n- Evidence available: Beyond the April 28 article, I don’t have week-by-week USDM counts for May. However, the strong seasonal tendency for improvement between early June and late June supports weighting toward No.\n- Why not higher: The combination of climatological onset of the rainy season, the size of the threshold (≥60% of population), and USDM’s responsiveness make ≥14.0 million by June 28 less likely.\n- Why not lower: Spring 2025 drought was widespread and included some extreme (D3) pockets. If the wet season onset is delayed or uneven, or if synoptic patterns suppress convection, a ≥14 million tally could persist into late June. The weekly nature of USDM means one poor week can keep the figure elevated through the June 26 release.\n- Update signals:\n  • Upward (toward Yes): CPC outlooks showing below-normal precipitation for Florida into mid/late June; continued wildfire activity; minimal convective coverage; weekly USDM updates through mid-June still ≥14m.\n  • Downward (toward No): Early/widespread onset of daily storms; any tropical disturbance bringing multi-inch rains; USDM in early-to-mid June dropping below ~12–13m, signaling momentum toward further improvement by late June.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill Florida have 14.0 million or more residents living in drought on June 28, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nUSA Today: [14 million Florida residents are under drought conditions, some extreme: What to know](https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2025/04/28/florida-drought-conditions-what-to-know/83328368007/)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if Drought Monitor at [this link](https://www.drought.gov/states/florida) lists greater than or equal to 14.0 million Florida residents in areas of drought, when the link is accessed by Metaculus on or after June 28, 2025. If the number is below that, this question resolves as **No**.\n\nThe question will resolve as soon as the page is accessed by Metaculus Admins on the resolution date. However, if there are issues accessing the page, then resolution will wait up until the end of the tournament's scoring at which point if Metaculus has still not been able to access the resolution source, this question will be **annulled**.\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nNo additional information available.\n\nToday is 2025-05-29.\n\nBefore answering you think:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n(e) You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
