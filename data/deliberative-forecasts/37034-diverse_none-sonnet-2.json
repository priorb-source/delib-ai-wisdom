    "review": "Both Forecasters 2 and 3 provide strong, well-reasoned analyses that identify a critical gap in my initial forecast: the current baseline estimate. They both estimate the current rig count at approximately 605 or low-to-mid 600s, which means a decline of 22+ rigs (about 4+ rigs/week) would be needed to cross below 583 in just 5 weeks. This is a much more specific and quantitative approach than I initially took.\n\nTheir key insight is that this required rate of decline is faster than recent trends showing remarkable stability with small weekly changes. They correctly emphasize that supportive oil prices provide a floor for drilling activity, making rapid declines unlikely in such a short timeframe. This mathematical framing - calculating the specific required rate of decline and comparing it to historical patterns - is more rigorous than my qualitative assessment of 'downward momentum.'\n\nHowever, I do think they may be slightly underweighting some factors: (1) the uncertainty in their baseline estimate - if the current count is actually 590-595 rather than 605, the probability shifts meaningfully higher; (2) the significance of three consecutive weeks of decline, which while possibly small in magnitude, does suggest directional momentum; and (3) persistently weak natural gas prices that could accelerate gas rig declines beyond recent trends.",
    "rationale": "After reviewing both forecasters' analyses, I recognize my initial 60% forecast was too high. They've made compelling arguments about the mathematical requirements and structural stability that I underweighted.\n\nThe core issue is: if the current count is truly around 605 (a reasonable estimate given recent patterns), achieving a decline to below 583 requires approximately 4+ rigs/week of reduction over 5 weeks. This is faster than the typical gradual decline observed in recent months, where weekly changes are often in the single digits. With oil prices providing support and no clear catalyst for acceleration, the modal outcome is the count remaining above 583.\n\nHowever, I don't want to anchor entirely to their 24-25% range because:\n\n1. **Baseline uncertainty**: Their 605 estimate is educated but uncertain. If the actual current count is 590-595, the required decline becomes much more achievable with continuation of existing trends.\n\n2. **Momentum matters**: Three consecutive weeks of decline, even if small, suggests directional pressure that could persist or accelerate.\n\n3. **Gas market weakness**: Persistently weak natural gas prices create ongoing downward pressure that could drive faster-than-historical declines in gas-directed rigs.\n\n4. **Time horizon allows for cumulative effects**: Five weeks, while short, is enough for 20-25 rig declines if conditions deteriorate modestly.\n\nBalancing these factors, I'm updating significantly downward from 60% but not as low as 24-25%. A probability of 35% better reflects the combination of: baseline uncertainty making the threshold more achievable than 605 suggests, existing downward momentum, gas market weakness, while still acknowledging that supportive oil prices and typical stability patterns favor remaining above 583.",
