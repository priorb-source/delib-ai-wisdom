    "review": "My initial analysis focused heavily on the resolution window's timing immediately following the European Parliament elections, arguing this created a high-probability environment for resignations due to MEPs taking up national government posts. The other two forecasters based their analyses primarily on an annualized base rate of resignations, moderately adjusted for the specific scandal mentioned. Forecaster 2 and 3 made convincing arguments that I had not fully appreciated: (1) political processes, whether appointments to new governments or fallout from scandals, are often slow, and the resulting resignation announcements could easily fall outside the narrow 21-day resolution window; and (2) scandal-induced resignations are frequently not immediate. These are excellent points that temper my initial confidence. However, I find a significant flaw in their reasoning: they treat this post-election period as a generic slice of time, applying an average base rate. Resignations are not uniformly distributed throughout the year, and the weeks following a major election represent a peak period for political and career-related turnover. By ignoring this crucial context, I believe their forecasts of 40-45% are too low.",
    "rationale": "I am lowering my forecast from 65% to 55%. The deliberation with my peers was valuable. I was convinced by their arguments regarding the narrowness of the 21-day window and the often-slow pace of political negotiations and scandal investigations. My initial forecast likely did not adequately discount for the possibility that an event triggered within this window (like an offer of a cabinet position) might not result in a formal resignation announcement until after the July 1 deadline. This warrants a downward adjustment. However, I am keeping my forecast above 50% and significantly higher than the other forecasters because I maintain that their core methodology is flawed. Applying an average annual base rate to the unique, high-turnover period immediately following a pan-European election is an error. The probability of an MEP resigning to take another political office is substantially higher in this specific window than in a random three-week period. While the scandal adds some noise, the post-election reshuffle period is the dominant factor. My updated 55% forecast balances my belief in the heightened probability during this period with the valid constraints on timing raised by the other forecasters.",
