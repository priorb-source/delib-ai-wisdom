  "information": "According to the National Institute of Statistics and Geography (Inegi), Mexico's unemployment rate reached a historic low of 2.2% in March 2025. This was a decrease from 2.3% in March 2024 and 2.5% in February 2025. The total number of unemployed individuals was 1.4 million. The economically active population (PEA) was reported at 61.1 million, with a participation rate of 59.3%. In contrast, the informal labor sector accounted for 54.4% of the workforce, and the number of underemployed individuals—those needing to work more hours—rose to 3.9 million, representing 6.6% of the employed population.\n\nThe International Monetary Fund (IMF) projects a 0.3% economic contraction for Mexico in 2025, citing the effects of tariffs imposed by the United States on key Mexican products. The IMF also predicts Mexico's unemployment rate will increase from 2.8% to 3.8% during 2025. Separately, the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) forecasts Mexico's economy will grow by 1.3% in 2025 and 0.6% in 2026, though these projections are conditional on the tariff situation. The U.S. has imposed tariffs of 25% on key Mexican products like autos, steel, and plastics.\n\nMexican President Claudia Sheinbaum has publicly rejected the International Monetary Fund's (IMF) prediction of a 0.3% economic contraction in Mexico for 2025. She stated that the economic models of the Ministry of Finance contradict the IMF's projection and that the government has a strategic plan, known as 'Plan México', to reactivate and strengthen the national economy. As part of this strategy, the president has called on commercial banks to reduce interest rates to promote economic growth.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Days to weeks - We are at April 29, 2025, and April 2025 unemployment data from Mexico is typically released in early May by Inegi. The resolution is imminent.",
    "status_quo_outcome": "Yes - the unemployment rate remains under 3%. The March 2025 rate was 2.2%, a historic low, and monthly unemployment rates typically don't fluctuate dramatically in short periods.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "The unemployment rate jumps to 3.0% or higher in April. This would require an unusually large one-month increase from 2.2% to at least 3.0%, potentially triggered by immediate and severe impacts from US tariffs on manufacturing employment, or an unexpected economic shock hitting the labor market in April.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "The unemployment rate remains at or near March's 2.2% level. The labor market maintains its resilience, and while tariff impacts may be building, they haven't yet translated into sufficient job losses to push unemployment above 3% by April. Seasonal patterns and the government's Plan México stabilization efforts keep unemployment low.",
    "rationale": "This forecast has an exceptionally short time horizon - we're forecasting April data while standing at April 29, 2025. The outcome has already occurred but hasn't been reported yet. The most recent data point (March 2025: 2.2%) provides a very strong anchor. Unemployment rates exhibit considerable month-to-month stability - a jump from 2.2% to 3.0%+ in a single month would require a major shock and would be historically unusual for Mexico. While the IMF projects unemployment rising from 2.8% to 3.8% during 2025, this is a full-year forecast. Tariff impacts on employment typically materialize over quarters, not weeks. The auto, steel, and plastics sectors affected by US tariffs are significant, but immediate layoffs in April are unlikely given employment contracts, severance requirements, and firms' tendency to delay difficult decisions. Mexico's recent trend has been positive (2.5% in Feb → 2.2% in March), suggesting underlying labor market strength. The 54.4% informal sector actually provides a buffer, as workers can shift between formal and informal employment without appearing in unemployment statistics. My forecast isn't higher (closer to certainty) because: (1) the tariffs are real and could trigger faster-than-expected responses, (2) there could be seasonal factors I'm not accounting for, (3) the IMF's dire predictions suggest genuine economic headwinds. My forecast isn't lower because: (1) one month is too short for major structural changes, (2) the status quo is very strong at 2.2%, (3) monthly unemployment data is sticky, (4) no reports suggest mass April layoffs. I would update upward if I learned about: major April layoffs in key sectors, preliminary data suggesting stability, or Mexican government early indicators showing resilience. I would update downward if I saw: reports of emergency layoffs, plant closures in April, or statements from Mexican officials acknowledging sharp deterioration.",
