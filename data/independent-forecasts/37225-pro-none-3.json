    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "About one month. The election is scheduled for May 25, 2025.",
    "status_quo_outcome": "Yes. The Progressive Reform Party (VHP) won a plurality of seats in the 2020 election and is the leading party in the current governing coalition. The status quo would be a continuation of this plurality.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Severe public backlash against the VHP-led government's IMF-backed austerity measures leads to a significant loss of support. Voters shift to opposition parties, primarily the General Liberation and Development Party (ABOP) or a faction of the National Democratic Party (NDP) that manages to rally support despite its leadership crisis. The vote fragments, and another party, likely ABOP, narrowly wins a plurality of seats.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "The VHP successfully campaigns as the only party offering stability and a path out of the economic crisis inherited from the previous administration. The main opposition party, the NDP, remains in disarray following the conviction and flight of its leader, Dési Bouterse, leading to a collapse of its electoral support. Despite discontent over austerity, voters see the VHP as the most credible governing option, allowing it to retain a plurality of seats.",
    "rationale": "My forecast is primarily based on the profound weakness of the traditional main opposition, the National Democratic Party (NDP). The VHP is the incumbent party that won a plurality of 20 seats (out of 51) in 2020, establishing the current status quo. The most significant political development since then has been the conviction and subsequent fugitive status of NDP leader Dési Bouterse in late 2023. This has thrown the NDP into a state of crisis, decapitating its leadership and severely damaging its ability to mount a cohesive and effective national campaign. While the VHP-led government under President Chan Santokhi faces significant public discontent due to unpopular but necessary austerity measures, the lack of a strong, unified opposition provides them with a substantial electoral advantage. Voters who are unhappy with the VHP may not see a viable alternative in the chaotic NDP or smaller, less established parties.\n\nMy probability is not higher because the economic hardship caused by the government's policies is real and represents a potent catalyst for a protest vote. A sufficiently angered electorate could abandon the VHP for other parties in the ruling coalition, like Ronnie Brunswijk's ABOP, or even a faction of the NDP, potentially allowing another party to eke out a plurality with a relatively small share of the vote. The Surinamese political landscape is fragmented, and public sentiment on economic issues is a major uncertainty.\n\nMy probability is not lower because the disarray of the NDP, historically the VHP's main challenger, cannot be overstated. It is exceptionally difficult for a party to win an election when its long-time, charismatic leader is a convicted murderer on the run. This creates a high floor for the VHP's chances, as they are likely to be perceived as the most stable and credible choice by a significant portion of the electorate, even by those who are not enthusiastic about their performance.\n\nI would increase my forecast if credible polling showed a durable, wide lead for the VHP or if the NDP showed signs of further public fracturing. I would decrease my forecast if polling indicated a surge for another party (like ABOP), or if large-scale, sustained protests against the government's economic policies were to occur just before the election.",
