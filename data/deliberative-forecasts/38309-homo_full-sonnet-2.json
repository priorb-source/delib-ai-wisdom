    "review": "The other forecasters and I are in strong agreement on the fundamentals: Jay Jones has substantial structural advantages (fundraising, endorsements, experience) but faces genuine uncertainty due to lack of polling data. The key difference is calibration - they forecast 73% and 75% while I initially forecast 82%. Their caution is well-founded: the absence of direct voter preference data is indeed a significant limitation, and we're making inferences from predictive factors rather than measuring actual voter intent. Primary elections are volatile, and prosecutorial credentials could resonate more than I initially weighted. However, I believe their forecasts may be slightly overcautious. When a candidate has this combination of advantages - nearly 2-to-1 fundraising, $1.4M cash on hand for final operations, establishment backing from two former governors, and statewide campaign experience - historical patterns suggest win rates well above 73-75%. The structural alignment is strong and unidirectional. That said, their emphasis on polling uncertainty is valid and warrants some moderation of my initial confidence.",
    "rationale": "Upon reflection, my initial 82% forecast remains largely justified by the strength of Jones's advantages, but the other forecasters correctly highlight that without polling data, some additional caution is warranted. The $400,000+ cash advantage in the final two weeks is substantial for advertising and turnout. Endorsements from McAuliffe, Northam, and Scott represent significant Democratic establishment weight in Virginia. The 2021 campaign experience provides name recognition that first-time statewide candidates lack. However, the complete absence of polling data does create more uncertainty than I initially weighted. While structural factors are highly predictive, they're not deterministic. I'm adjusting down slightly to 78% to account for this polling gap while maintaining that the preponderance of evidence strongly favors Jones. This reflects high confidence in his advantages while acknowledging legitimate uncertainty about how voters will actually respond.",
