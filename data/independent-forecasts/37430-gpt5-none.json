    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "About 8 weeks (until July 1, 2025)",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "The Tax Reforms Bill remains in committee or only passes one chamber before the Sallah/June recess; harmonization or presidential assent slips into July or later. Alternatively, the measure is folded into a broader year-end Finance Act rather than advanced immediately.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Leadership of the National Assembly prioritizes the Tax Reforms Bill, fast-tracks committee work and floor votes in both chambers by early-to-mid June, and President Tinubu quickly assents so the law is enacted before July 1.",
    "rationale": "- Where things stand: As of April 25, 2025, reporting indicates a Tax Reforms Bill under consideration that would exempt real estate transactions from VAT. There is no evidence yet of passage by either chamber or presidential assent. My research assistant had no additional updates, suggesting we are still in the proposal/consideration phase.\n- Time pressure: There are roughly 8 weeks left. Nigeria’s legislative process requires passage by both chambers, harmonization (if needed), and presidential assent. The National Assembly often takes a Sallah recess in June, compressing the calendar further.\n- Status quo weighting: If nothing changes, the default is No—most bills do not move from introduction to full enactment in under two months, especially if bundled into a broader tax package that may invite stakeholder input and negotiation.\n- Reasons it could still happen (why not lower): The administration has been active on fiscal reforms, and the measure is politically attractive as a pro-housing affordability step with potentially limited near-term revenue impact. Executive-priority bills can be fast-tracked, and the Assembly has precedent for moving such items quickly.\n- Reasons it might slip (why not higher): The bill may contain broader or sensitive provisions that slow the package; committee review and harmonization take time; any pushback from revenue stakeholders (FIRS, states concerned about FAAC allocations) could delay; and the Assembly’s June schedule may be uneven due to holidays/recess. Even late-June passage could miss the deadline if assent/gazettal comes after July 1.\n- What would move me up: Clear signs of acceleration—committee reports scheduled imminently, leadership signaling fast-track treatment, one chamber passing the bill in May, concurrent consideration in the other chamber, or credible reports that presidential assent will follow immediately upon passage.\n- What would move me down: Reports of deferral to a year-end Finance Act, extended stakeholder consultations, opposition from key fiscal actors, or announcements of recess without the bill clearing second readings/committee in both chambers.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill Nigeria enact legislation exempting real estate transactions from VAT before July 1, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\n[FG: Tax reform bill to exempt real estate transactions from VAT, boost housing affordability in Nigeria](https://nairametrics.com/2025/04/25/fg-tax-reform-bill-to-exempt-real-estate-transactions-from-vat-boost-housing-affordability-in-nigeria/)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if, before July 1, 2025, the government of Nigeria enacts legislation exempting real estate transactions from the Value Added Tax (VAT) according to [credible sources](https://www.metaculus.com/help/faq/#definitions).\n\nFor example, the current iteration of the Tax Reforms Bill that is [being considered](https://brtnews.ng/tax-reforms-bill-to-exempt-real-estate-transactions-from-vat/) by the National Assembly, if it should be enacted, would count for purposes of this question.\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nNo additional information available.\n\nToday is 2025-05-05.\n\nBefore answering you think:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n(e) You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
