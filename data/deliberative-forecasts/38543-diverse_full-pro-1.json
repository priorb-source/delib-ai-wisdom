    "review": "My initial forecast was 5%. The other two forecasters (8% and 12%) are in the same low-probability range, and we all agree on the primary factors: the extremely short timeline, President Trump's packed travel schedule, and the profound lack of visible logistical preparations for a visit. These are all strong indicators for a 'No' outcome.\n\nThe other analysts introduced several points that I found valuable. Forecaster 2 clearly delineated the two possible travel windows (June 19-23 and June 26-30), sharpening the focus on the timeline constraints. Forecaster 3 raised two particularly insightful arguments: 1) The possibility of a brief 'stopover' visit, which lowers the logistical bar compared to a full state visit and makes a 'Yes' outcome slightly more plausible. 2) A counter-argument that the July 9th tariff deadline actually incentivizes a meeting in *early July*, not necessarily *late June*, which would resolve this question as 'No'.\n\nI find the reasoning of the other forecasters convincing. They correctly emphasize that President Trump's unconventional style and the political urgency of the trade deal create a non-trivial tail risk of a surprise visit. The 'stopover' scenario is the most plausible path to a 'Yes' outcome. However, Forecaster 3's point about the deadline pushing the meeting into early July is a strong counter-weight. Synthesizing these new considerations leads me to slightly increase my forecast.",
    "rationale": "My reasoning remains anchored on the overwhelming logistical obstacles to a presidential visit to China on such short notice. The lack of any public reports on advance security and diplomatic preparations is the single strongest piece of evidence against a visit occurring in the next 15 days. President Trump's confirmed schedule with the G7 and NATO summits further compresses the already narrow window of opportunity. \n\nHowever, I am increasing my forecast slightly based on the deliberation. The arguments for a visit, while facing long odds, are significant. There is a mutual invitation, a stated agreement to meet, and a strong political incentive for Trump to secure a photo-op for the newly announced trade framework before tariffs could potentially snap back. The other analysts convinced me to give more weight to the possibility of an unconventional, short-notice 'stopover' visit, which would be less logistically burdensome than a formal state visit and would fit Trump's diplomatic style. This 'stopover' scenario represents the most credible, albeit unlikely, path to a 'Yes' resolution.\n\nSimultaneously, I am not raising my forecast higher because the tariff deadline is July 9th, not July 1st. This reduces the immediate urgency, making an early July meeting a viable alternative that falls outside the resolution period. Balancing the increased plausibility of a 'stopover' against the reduced urgency of a pre-July 1st meeting, I am making a small upward adjustment to account for the tail risk of a surprise diplomatic event.",
