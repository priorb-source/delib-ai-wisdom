  "information": "In Ohio, Republican lawmakers introduced Senate Bill 153 (SB 153), which would create new requirements for citizen-led ballot initiatives. The bill would compel paid signature gatherers to wear visible badges, list employers on petitions, and maintain detailed records. The bill's definition of 'paid' circulators is considered broad, and it requires petition signers to be registered voters on the exact day they sign. As of early May 2025, this bill had not completed the legislative process. In February 2025, a provision requiring Ohioans to prove citizenship to register to vote at the Bureau of Motor Vehicles was removed from the state's transportation budget by Republicans. Instead, BMV employees will be prohibited from offering registration forms to individuals identified as non-citizens. This change was prompted by a report from Secretary of State Frank LaRose indicating that non-citizens were accidentally registering to vote, partly due to language barriers.\n\nThe Ohio legislature has Republican supermajorities in both the Senate (26-7) and the House (67-32). Senators Theresa Gavarone and Andrew Brenner are key sponsors pushing for stricter election laws. In early 2023, Governor Mike DeWine signed HB 458, a voter ID law. However, Governor DeWine has also expressed some hesitation regarding the current proof-of-citizenship proposals. Organizations such as the ACLU are actively opposing the new legislation. The Ohio General Assembly has session days scheduled through late June 2025, ahead of the July 1, 2025 resolution deadline.\n\nThere is a national trend of Republican-led efforts to enact proof-of-citizenship voting requirements. At the federal level, the U.S. House of Representatives passed the Safeguard American Voter Eligibility (SAVE) Act, which would require proof of citizenship for voter registration. Several states have pursued similar legislation. Wyoming passed a law requiring proof of citizenship to vote, which will take effect on July 1, 2025. In Iowa, a state audit found 277 noncitizens were registered to vote or had voted in the 2024 election. In Tennessee, a bill to create a portal for election workers to verify voter citizenship has advanced in the state House. In Michigan, a proposed constitutional amendment that would have required proof of citizenship for voter registration failed to pass.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Less than 2 months, with the deadline being July 1, 2025 and today being May 5, 2025 - approximately 57 days remaining.",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No - the legislation is not enacted before July 1, 2025. Senate Bill 153 has not completed the legislative process as of early May 2025, and proof-of-citizenship provisions were removed from other legislation in February 2025.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "SB 153 faces procedural delays, lacks sufficient momentum despite Republican majorities, or gets bogged down in committee discussions. Governor DeWine's expressed hesitation influences legislative behavior. Opposition from the ACLU and other groups successfully stalls progress. With less than two months remaining and the bill not yet passed by both chambers, time runs out before identical versions can be agreed upon and enacted.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Republican sponsors Gavarone and Brenner successfully leverage their supermajorities in both chambers (26-7 Senate, 67-32 House) to fast-track SB 153 or similar legislation. The national momentum on citizenship verification and recent examples from other states like Wyoming provide political cover. Both chambers pass and agree on identical bills in the remaining session days through late June, achieving enactment before the July 1 deadline.",
    "rationale": "The structural factors favor passage: Ohio has commanding Republican supermajorities that could overcome opposition, dedicated sponsors pushing the legislation, session days scheduled through late June providing sufficient time, and national momentum on citizenship verification requirements. However, several critical factors argue against enactment within the timeframe. Most importantly, as of early May 2025, SB 153 has not completed the legislative process despite months of opportunity. The February 2025 removal of citizenship verification provisions from the transportation budget is particularly telling - even with Republican control, the party chose to strip rather than advance these requirements, suggesting internal divisions or strategic concerns. Governor DeWine's expressed hesitation, while not dispositive since enactment occurs after both houses agree, may influence legislative behavior and timeline. The tight timeframe of less than 57 days for both chambers to pass and agree on identical legislation when the bill hasn't completed its journey is challenging. Good forecasting heavily weights status quo outcomes, and the status quo here is clear: the legislation has not passed. For my forecast to move higher, I would need evidence that SB 153 has advanced significantly through the legislative process, cleared key committees, or been scheduled for floor votes. For it to move lower, I would need clear statements from leadership that the bill is dead for the session or evidence of insufficient support even within Republican caucuses. Given the balance between structural possibility and temporal/political obstacles, I estimate a 30% probability.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nBefore July 1, 2025, will Ohio enact legislation expanding its verification requirements of a voter's citizenship?\n\nQuestion background:\nThe Ohio Senate: [Gavarone, Brenner Introduce Bill to Require Proof of Citizenship to Vote](https://ohiosenate.gov/members/theresa-gavarone/news/gavarone-brenner-introduce-bill-to-require-proof-of-citizenship-to-vote)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if, before July 1, 2025, the state of Ohio enacts legislation requiring voters to provide proof of US citizenship beyond the requirements at the time of this question, according to [credible sources](https://www.metaculus.com/faq/#definitions).\n\nAny subset of voters being required to provide such proof would count (for example if it only applied to first-time voter registrants or creating a new requirement for mail-in voters). An example of a bill that would count is [Senate Bill 153](https://www.legislature.ohio.gov/legislation/136/sb153). This question resolves upon enactment; therefore other questions such as when the legislation takes effect or whether it survives court challenges and is implemented is immaterial to this question's resolution. Please note that under Ohio law, a bill is considered enacted \"after both houses have passed and agreed on identical bills.\" ([Source](https://www.lsc.ohio.gov/assets/organizations/legislative-service-commission/files/chapter-5-enacting-legislation-10021971.pdf))\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nIn Ohio, Republican lawmakers introduced Senate Bill 153 (SB 153), which would create new requirements for citizen-led ballot initiatives.
