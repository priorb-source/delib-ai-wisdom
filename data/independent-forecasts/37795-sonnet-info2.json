  "information": "The Rockies' 7-36 record through their first 43 games marked one of the worst starts in Major League Baseball's modern era. The team was on pace to finish the season with a 26-136 record, which would surpass the record for most losses in a season set by the 2024 Chicago White Sox (121 losses). Notable losses included a 21-0 defeat to the San Diego Padres, part of a three-game stretch where they allowed 55 runs, the most by any MLB team in a similar span since 1950. This followed seasons with 103 losses in 2023 and 101 in 2024. Pre-season PECOTA projections had forecast a .343 winning percentage for the Rockies in 2025.",

    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "27 days (from May 19, 2025 to June 15, 2025)",
    "status_quo_outcome": "Yes - the Rockies continue to have the worst record in MLB",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Another MLB team experiences an even more catastrophic collapse than the Rockies' current .163 pace, or the Rockies go on an unexpected winning streak that lifts them above at least one other struggling team by June 15",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "The Rockies continue their historically poor performance at or near their current .163 winning percentage pace, maintaining the worst record in baseball as no other team falls to such depths",
    "rationale": "The Rockies' 7-36 record (.163 winning percentage) through 43 games represents one of the worst starts in modern MLB history. At this pace, they're projected for 26-136, which would eclipse the 2024 White Sox's record of 121 losses. By June 15, the Rockies will have played approximately 67-68 games (about 25 more games from today). At their current trajectory, they'd be around 11-57 by then, still maintaining a historically terrible winning percentage around .160-.165. Key factors supporting a Yes outcome: (1) The .163 pace is so poor that it's extremely difficult for another team to be worse, (2) structural problems persist (poor roster construction, consistent 100+ loss seasons in 2023-2024), (3) even pre-season PECOTA projected only .343, showing fundamental team weakness, (4) their recent performance metrics (21-0 loss, 55 runs allowed in 3 games) indicate systemic failure rather than temporary variance. Why not higher: There's inherent variability in baseball, another team could theoretically collapse harder, and we're only 1/3 through the season by June 15. Why not lower: The Rockies' performance is so historically bad that having another team worse would itself be a significant outlier event. The status quo strongly favors them remaining the worst team. I would revise upward if data showed no other team within 20 games of their loss total, or downward if another team started losing at a similar catastrophic rate.",

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
