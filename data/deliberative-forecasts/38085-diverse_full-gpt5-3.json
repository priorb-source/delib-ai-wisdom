    "review": "Both forecasters weigh the high starting point and short horizon against the onset of the rainy/hurricane season. I agree with the core logic and their emphasis on the risk from an early tropical system. However, one key quantitative nuance is underplayed: the current margin is only ~500k people. If 14.5M corresponds to ~73.9% of FL’s population, the threshold (14.0M) implies ~71.3%—a drop of only ~2.6 percentage points. That’s materially smaller than I implicitly assumed earlier and makes a No outcome more attainable via ordinary June rainfall, not just a tropical cyclone. Forecaster 2 calls the 500k buffer “resilient,” but in percentage terms it’s modest; Forecaster 3 similarly leans on persistence but doesn’t quantify how small a decline is needed. I find their general reasoning sound on drought persistence and the short time window, but I’m less convinced that the buffer is robust once framed as a ~2–3 pp move, which USDM sometimes shows week-to-week during a seasonal regime shift.",
    "rationale": "Update from my prior view: I previously overweighted the required swing (I implicitly treated the threshold as a ~12 pp move). Correcting that, only ~2.6 pp needs to come out of D1–D4 coverage to resolve No. Given that coverage has already fallen from ~84% in late April to ~73.9% by May 29 (~10 pp improvement in about a month), an additional ~2–3 pp reduction by the June 26 USDM (which will likely be the value visible on/after June 28) is quite plausible even without a named storm, via the typical June sea-breeze/wet-season pattern and occasional tropical waves. \n\nCountervailing factors: The drought is relatively deep (multi-month deficits, severe impacts in the Everglades), and NOAA’s spring outlook called for persistence through June in South Florida. USDM uses multi-timescale indicators (e.g., SPI), so improvements can lag rainfall, especially where long-term deficits dominate. That argues against a rapid, statewide downgrade out of D1, and supports a Yes outcome remaining slightly more likely.\n\nNet: The small buffer plus the seasonal shift pulls my forecast down from 78%. I still lean Yes on persistence/depth and because a statewide, coordinated improvement sufficient to push below 14.0M is not a lock. But this is closer to a coin flip than I initially assessed.",
