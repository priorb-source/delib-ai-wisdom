    "rationale": "- Timing: There are only ~3.5 weeks left. Most potential gubernatorial candidates do not face a hard strategic need to announce by July 1 for a 2026 race, especially a wealthy self-funder like Morgan who can ramp quickly. That favors the status quo (No). \n- Evidence of interest: The May 15 Politico piece that he has a campaign blueprint indicates real consideration and some pre-launch work. This meaningfully raises the chance of a near-term announcement versus a cold start. \n- Morgan’s history: He has previously flirted with high-profile runs (e.g., for Florida governor in the past) and then declined. That history tempers the probability that he pulls the trigger on a short timeline. \n- Incentives: Announcing before July 1 could help capture Q2 fundraising optics, but as a potential self-funder this is less binding. He might prefer to continue testing the waters, watching the Republican field formation, and gauging Democratic reactions before committing. \n- Net: The combination of limited time, lack of a compelling near-term deadline, and his past pattern keeps the base case at No. The Politico report and his capacity to move fast keep the probability meaningfully above negligible. \n- Why not higher: No evident must-announce-by-July dynamic; past hesitation; ample time later in 2025 to enter a 2026 race. \n- Why not lower: Concrete reporting that he’s laying groundwork; his ability to self-fund and make rapid decisions; potential desire to freeze the field or capitalize on current attention. \n- What would move me up: Credible reports of staff hires, vendor contracts, domain launches, event venue bookings, FEC/Florida filings tied to a specific launch date, or Morgan publicly signaling an imminent decision window of ‘days.’ \n- What would move me down: Signals he’s punting the decision to late summer/fall, equivocal statements about business or family priorities, or reporting that key Democratic stakeholders are coalescing around another candidate, reducing his near-term incentive to launch.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill John Morgan announce his candidacy for Florida governor before July 1, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nPolitico: [John Morgan lays out campaign blueprint for possible Florida governor run](https://www.politico.com/news/2025/05/15/john-morgan-florida-governor-run-00351005)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if John Morgan announces his candidacy for governor of Florida before July 1, 2025. If no such announcement has been made before that date, the question resolves as **No**.\n\n\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nNo additional information available.\n\nToday is 2025-06-06.\n\nBefore answering you think:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n(e) You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
