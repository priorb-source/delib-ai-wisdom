    "review": "All three forecasters are in strong agreement, placing the probability of a visit very low due to the extreme time constraints and logistical hurdles. We all correctly identify that a presidential visit to China is a massive undertaking that cannot be arranged in the two weeks remaining. Forecaster 2, at 5%, acknowledges the logistical barriers but seems to overweight the 'political will' and 'Trump's unconventional nature'. Forecaster 3, at 2%, introduces two excellent points I hadn't fully considered: (1) The recent 'framework agreement' actually *reduces* the urgency for an immediate presidential visit, and (2) the key tariff deadline is July 8, after this question's resolution date, further diminishing any time pressure. These arguments are highly convincing and strengthen the case for a 'No' outcome.",
    "rationale": "I am maintaining my forecast of 1%. The deliberation with the other forecasters has strengthened my confidence in this low probability. Forecaster 3's analysis was particularly compelling, adding two specific arguments against a near-term visit that I had not explicitly considered. The existence of a 'framework agreement' means the diplomatic heavy lifting is done, reducing the need for the presidents to meet urgently. Furthermore, the key tariff deadline being on July 8—after the July 1 resolution date—removes the most obvious forcing function for a rushed summit. These points, combined with my original reasoning about the immense logistical and security preparations required, the lack of any public reporting on such preparations, and President Trump's already-packed European travel schedule (G7 and NATO summits), make a visit within the next 15 days extraordinarily unlikely. I am not increasing my forecast to align with the others because their arguments for a higher probability (2-5%) rely on the 'Trump factor'—his unpredictability. While I acknowledge this as the primary source of uncertainty, I believe a 1% probability adequately captures this small chance of a highly unconventional, surprise event. The practical barriers remain overwhelming.",
