    "review": "Both forecasters provided excellent, well-reasoned analyses that add significant texture to the problem. Forecaster 2 introduced specific, timely negative news items I hadn't explicitly weighed, such as recent tariff escalations, specific company price increases, and the associated equity market selloff. This provides concrete evidence of fresh headwinds that consumers would be seeing in early May. Forecaster 3 compellingly framed the issue as being driven by 'structural' problems rather than temporary shocks, citing record-high inflation expectations and rising unemployment expectations within the survey itself, along with falling Leading Economic Indicators. This argument powerfully counters the simple 'mean reversion' thesis. I found both sets of reasoning very convincing because they grounded their arguments in specific, recent data and events that directly influence the components of the sentiment index. Their analyses collectively strengthen the case that the negative momentum is still very active and has deep roots, making a spontaneous rebound less likely.",
    "rationale": "After reviewing the other experts' analyses, I am lowering my forecast. My initial assessment correctly identified the core tension between strong negative momentum and the high probability of a bounce from a near-record low. However, my peers brought to light compelling new evidence that strengthens the case for continued weakness. Specifically, Forecaster 2's mention of recent tariff escalations and specific price hike announcements, and Forecaster 3's focus on the structural nature of the problem, evidenced by record-high inflation expectations and declining LEI, are persuasive. These factors suggest the downward pressure on sentiment is not just a trailing indicator but is being actively reinforced by current events and worsening fundamentals. This makes a simple mean-reversion bounce less probable without a clear positive catalyst, which is not currently visible. The bar for a 'Yes' outcome remains very low (any value >50.8), which keeps the probability from being lower. However, the new evidence makes it more likely that sentiment will either stagnate at this historically low level or decline further. I am therefore decreasing my forecast from 40% to 35% to reflect a greater weight on the potent and timely negative drivers identified by the other forecasters.",
