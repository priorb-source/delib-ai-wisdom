    "review": "The other forecasters and I share a strong consensus, with all forecasts falling between 10% and 20%. We all agree that the primary drivers for a low probability are the extremely short timeline (just over one month), the strong status quo (O'Rourke is not a candidate), and the lack of any public signals of an impending campaign launch. Forecaster 2's reasoning was particularly convincing in highlighting the strategic *disadvantage* of an announcement now, which would start a grueling 16+ month campaign. Forecaster 3 added a valuable point about potential 'donor fatigue' and 'voter skepticism' following O'Rourke's previous losses, which would logically necessitate a longer, more cautious period of gauging support before launching—a process unlikely to conclude before July 1. I found their arguments well-reasoned and supportive of my initial analysis.",
    "rationale": "My initial forecast was 15%. After reviewing the other analyses, I am lowering my forecast slightly. The other forecasters did not introduce any new evidence for a 'Yes' outcome, but they did reinforce and add detail to the arguments for 'No'. Specifically, Forecaster 2's point about the strategic downside of a very long campaign and Forecaster 3's point about donor fatigue underscore that a hasty announcement before July 1st is not just unlikely, but also strategically unwise for O'Rourke. These factors strengthen the case that if he does run, he will take more time to plan a launch for later in 2025 or early 2026. While an unconventional surprise announcement is always possible with a candidate like O'Rourke, the combined weight of these strategic considerations leads me to believe my initial 15% was slightly too high. I am therefore adjusting my forecast downward by 3 points to 12%.",
