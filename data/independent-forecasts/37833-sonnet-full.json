  "information": "The relationship between Elon Musk and Donald Trump has recently shown signs of strain. After investing heavily in Trump's 2024 campaign, Musk was appointed co-director of the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE). However, disagreements arose over Musk's proposals for drastic government spending cuts and his support for policies like H-1B visas, which conflicted with Trump's agenda. In May 2025, Musk announced he would reduce his political involvement and spending to focus on his businesses, leading to a mutually agreed-upon withdrawal from his role in DOGE. Correspondingly, analyses show that Trump has not mentioned Musk on his Truth Social account in over a month, a significant decrease from his previous frequency.\n\nThe Trump administration's current immigration policy focus is on a new 'Gold Card' visa plan designed to attract foreign investors with at least $5 million in funds. The plan, which is not yet passed by Congress, would grant permanent residence and work rights. Elon Musk confirmed on the social media platform X that the government is conducting a 'silent test' of the application website. The proposal has sparked debate on whether it will replace or supplement the existing EB-5 investment visa program. Separately, the administration opened the registration period for the H-1B visa program, which both Trump and Musk have supported, for the 2026 fiscal year in March 2025.\n\nRecent activity shows a shift in the priorities and communication styles of both Elon Musk and Donald Trump. An analysis of Musk's posts on X revealed that his content has shifted away from U.S. government and politics, with only 19% of his posts in May being on these topics compared to 51% in February. He is now posting more about his business ventures, including space travel, electric vehicles, and AI. Meanwhile, Donald Trump primarily uses Truth Social for his communications, with reports noting that posts from his account on X are rare.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Approximately 40 days until July 1, 2025, when the resolution criteria will be checked",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No - neither Trump nor Musk has tweeted the exact phrase 'diversity visa' and current trends suggest this will continue",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Trump continues primarily using Truth Social for communications and rarely posts on X. Musk continues his shift away from political topics, focusing on his business ventures (SpaceX, Tesla, AI). The diversity visa lottery program remains outside the main immigration policy debates, with administration focus staying on the Gold Card visa and H-1B programs. Neither finds reason to use the specific phrase 'diversity visa' in the remaining 40 days.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "A controversy erupts around the diversity visa lottery program - perhaps a high-profile case, a policy proposal to eliminate it, or media attention on the program. This draws Trump's attention and he posts about it on X (rare but possible), or Musk engages with the topic given his interest in immigration policy and his connection to accounts discussing it. One of them uses the exact phrase 'diversity visa' in their post.",
    "rationale": "Several key factors shape this forecast. First, Trump's X activity has dramatically declined - he primarily uses Truth Social now, making any X post from him relatively rare. This is a major drag on probability. Second, Musk has significantly reduced his political engagement, with only 19% of May posts on US politics compared to 51% in February, as he focuses on business ventures. The strained Trump-Musk relationship also reduces coordination or mutual amplification. However, immigration remains a core Trump issue and the diversity visa lottery is controversial among some conservatives. The recent tweet from an account Musk follows could potentially spark engagement. The phrase must be exact - 'diversity visa' not variations like 'diversity lottery' - which adds specificity requirements. Current administration focus is on Gold Card and H-1B visas, not the diversity lottery, suggesting it's not a priority topic. With 40 days remaining, there's enough time for news cycles to shift, but the structural factors (Trump's platform preference, Musk's reduced political posting) are significant headwinds. For the probability to be higher, I'd need evidence of either figure actively posting about immigration on X or the diversity visa becoming a major policy flashpoint. For it to be lower, we'd need even stronger evidence that both have completely abandoned X for extended periods.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill Donald Trump or Elon Musk tweet (X post) about the Diversity Visa before April 1, 2025\n\nQuestion background:\n[Federal judge’s order leaves many visa lottery winners out of luck](https://www.siliconvalley.com/2020/10/01/judges-order-leaves-many-visa-lottery-winners-out-of-luck/) | Recent tweet [here](https://x.com/fentasyl/status/1894451029934039492) from a Twitter/X account followed by Elon Musk.\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if, before July 1, 2025 either Donald Trump or Elon Musk tweet using the exact words \"diversity visa\" as shown through [this search](https://x.com/search?f=top&q=%22diversity%20visa%22%20(from%3Arealdonaldtrump%20OR%20from%3Aelonmusk)&src=typed_query) on Twitter/X, which will be checked by Metaculus on or after July 1, 2025. If a tweet (now renamed to X post) containing the phrase is seen by a Metaculus Admin at that time, this question resolves as **Yes**. If not, it resolves as **No**.\n\n\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nThe relationship between Elon Musk and Donald Trump has recently shown signs of strain.

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any).
