    "review": "Both forecasters introduced concrete, specific information I hadn’t incorporated: an April 2 announcement, a Chapter 99 entry (9903.01.48) with +17% for Israel effective April 9, and a 90-day suspension window extending to July 9. Forecaster 2 asserts the HTS site already displays “+17% for Israel” (marked suspended), which directly matches the resolution criterion that explicitly ignores suspension status. They also correctly note that USITC typically leaves such entries visible until a formal action removes or amends them. Forecaster 3 adds reasonable caution about how the HTS presents additional duties at the subheading level, but this concern is largely alleviated by F2’s claim that the +17% is already visible as an additional duty for Israel. The key residual risk is a policy reversal and prompt HTS update before June 1. Overall, their arguments are persuasive and materially update the baseline toward Yes.",
    "rationale": "My initial forecast assumed no Israel-specific 17% duty existed in the HTS and that creating one before June 1 was unlikely. The new information indicates the +17% for Israel is already codified (9903.01.48), posted on the HTS site, and suspended through July 9. Given the question resolves based on whether the +17% appears on the HTS on or after June 1 regardless of suspension, the status quo now favors Yes. The main route to No is an early diplomatic/political reversal with a presidential proclamation and rapid USITC update removing or altering the listing before June 1. I also retain a small probability that the site’s presentation could change in a way that no longer shows “+17% for Israel” at applicable subheadings, but this seems unlikely if it is already displayed. Weighing these, I see roughly a 15–20% chance of removal/modification before June 1 plus a small presentation risk, leading me to substantially raise my forecast.",
