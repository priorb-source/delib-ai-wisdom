    "review": "Forecaster 2 adds a plausible but unverified angle: that UFC 315 could align with International Fight Week in Las Vegas, which would raise attendance odds. However, the numbering/calendar alignment is uncertain, so I’m wary of giving that much weight without confirmation. Forecaster 3’s analysis closely matches my base-rate framing and key drivers (location, schedule/security, and public signaling). Neither forecaster provides concrete info on the location/date of UFC 315 or credible hints from Dana White/Trump’s team, so the main update is simply a reminder to condition strongly on venue and pre-event signaling once available.",
    "rationale": "My prior view emphasized a per-event base rate in the 15–30% range, with significant uplift if the card is in Las Vegas/Miami/NYC-NJ and if there are pre-event signals. The other forecasts largely agree on that structure. The main new argument (possible IFW/Vegas for 315) is speculative at this point; without confirmation of date/location or signaling, I don’t see a reason to move materially. If 315 is later confirmed for Las Vegas (especially IFW) and we get the usual Dana White/travel-schedule hints, I would shift toward the mid-30s or higher; conversely, an overseas/Canada placement or a clear scheduling conflict would push me down to single digits. Given current uncertainty and no fresh signals, I’m holding near my initial estimate.",
