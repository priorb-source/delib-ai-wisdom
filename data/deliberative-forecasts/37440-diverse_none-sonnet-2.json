    "review": "Both forecasters provide thoughtful analyses that converge on similar conclusions. Forecaster 2 and I share the same 30% forecast, while Forecaster 2 offers 20%. All three of us identify legislative timing as the dominant constraint. Forecaster 3 raises an important consideration I underweighted: legal vulnerabilities under the National Voter Registration Act (NVRA). The experiences of Arizona and Kansas attempting similar documentary proof requirements and facing federal preemption challenges is highly relevant. This adds another layer of difficulty beyond just timing. However, I note that the question resolves on enactment, not implementation or survival of legal challenges, which somewhat mitigates this concern. Forecaster 3 also makes a valuable distinction about voter-facing documentary requirements versus backend administrative checks - the question specifically requires voters to provide proof, which narrows the path to Yes. The implementation complexity argument is compelling; dual systems for federal versus state ballots would be operationally challenging, potentially causing such provisions to be stripped during legislative negotiations even in a favorable political environment.",
    "rationale": "After reviewing both analyses, I'm maintaining my 30% forecast. The legislative timing remains the critical constraint - with the regular session likely concluded as of May 6, enactment would require either a bill already passed and awaiting signature (which would likely be public knowledge by now) or a special session before July 1. The legal concerns raised about NVRA preemption are valid additional obstacles, but since the question resolves on enactment rather than implementation or legal survival, Florida could still enact such legislation despite legal risks. The political will in Florida is demonstrably strong for election-related legislation, and the question allows for any subset of voters to be covered, which provides flexibility for narrower tailoring. The absence of information is itself informative - a major citizenship verification bill passing would generate national headlines. The convergence of forecasts between 20-30% reflects reasonable uncertainty about whether a bill passed in the final days of the session or whether a special session might occur. I'm not updating down to 20% because the political alignment and flexibility in the resolution criteria (any subset of voters) maintain a non-trivial probability, but I acknowledge the legal and implementation complexities strengthen the case for the status quo outcome.",
