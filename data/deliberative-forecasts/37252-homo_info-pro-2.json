    "review": "The deliberation was highly valuable. Forecaster 2 introduced a critical piece of new information I had not explicitly considered: a snap presidential election is scheduled for June 3, 2025. This significantly strengthens the case for a 'Yes' outcome by providing a powerful, specific catalyst for mass mobilization within the forecast period. I find their reasoning that such events spur protests convincing, though I believe their final probability of 80% is somewhat too low given this new evidence. Forecaster 3's analysis aligns closely with my initial reasoning, particularly their points about the capacity of established protest organizers (like KCTU) and the relatively low 10,000-participant threshold in the South Korean context. Their forecast of 85% is very reasonable. Overall, the other forecasters' arguments reinforce my initial high confidence, particularly the confirmation of a snap election.",
    "rationale": "I am maintaining my forecast of 90%. My initial reasoning was based on the already high frequency of protests exceeding 10,000 participants in the first four months of 2025, driven by the ongoing political crisis. The deliberation has reinforced this confidence. The confirmation of a snap presidential election on June 3rd, brought to my attention by Forecaster 2, adds a second, independent, and very powerful driver for large-scale demonstrations. The period immediately before and after such a contentious election is a peak time for political rallies by all sides. Furthermore, as noted in my initial analysis and by Forecaster 3, the May 1st Labor Day rally, which falls within the forecast period, was estimated by police to have up to 13,000 attendees, meaning the question may have already resolved 'Yes' pending confirmation by the Global Protest Tracker. The combination of a strong pre-existing trend of mass protest and the massive new catalyst of a snap election makes the absence of a qualifying protest highly improbable. I am not increasing my forecast above 90% to reserve a 10% probability for downside risks, namely a potential reporting lag or omission by the specific resolving source, or the small chance of a uniquely decisive and peaceful election that rapidly de-escalates political tensions.",
