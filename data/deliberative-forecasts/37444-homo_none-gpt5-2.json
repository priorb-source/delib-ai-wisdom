  "forecast": {
    "review": "Both forecasters largely mirror my reasoning but add two useful refinements: (1) the key distinction that waivers or general licenses would not satisfy the resolution—only a formal OFAC delisting would—which makes a Yes outcome less likely even if some sanctions relief occurs; and (2) congressional dynamics, including potential deterrence or reversal, which raise the perceived cost of choosing delisting specifically. They also emphasize allied coordination and the limited policy payoff of delisting NS2 AG versus other, lower‑profile relief tools. I find these points persuasive and they nudge me down from my prior.",
    "rationale": "Roughly eight weeks remain, and the default is that SDN listings persist absent a clear, public decision to delist. The April 23 report of an internal debate creates a non‑trivial chance, but delisting Nord Stream 2 AG is highly symbolic with little immediate economic benefit, making it an unattractive early move relative to alternatives (licenses, enforcement posture shifts, other energy measures). Importantly for this question, those alternatives would not remove NS2 AG from the SDN List and thus would not resolve Yes. Interagency alignment, allied consultations, and potential congressional resistance further reduce the likelihood of executing a delisting on this short timeline. Given these considerations, I’m revising down from 22% to reflect that even if some sanctions relief advances, the specific action that resolves this question (formal delisting from OFAC’s SDN List) is less likely by July 1.",
