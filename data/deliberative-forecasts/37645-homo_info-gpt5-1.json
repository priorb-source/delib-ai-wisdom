    "review": "- New info/arguments from others:\n  - Forecaster 2 cites Vučić saying on May 14 that a decision on forming a new government vs. elections will come “within ten days.” That’s a useful, timely signal that real optionality exists in late May.\n  - F2 also claims an election date could be announced now for an autumn vote; I believe that likely conflicts with Serbia’s 45–60 day legal window between calling elections and election day, which historically constrains the timing.\n  - Forecaster 3 asserts a new government won a confidence vote in mid-April 2025, which, if true, would sharply reduce the chance of a pre–July 1 announcement. This directly contradicts F2’s framing and recent signals; without corroboration, I give this claim low weight.\n- Convincing elements:\n  - Both F2 and F3 correctly emphasize the President’s discretion and Serbia’s history of snap polls, versus the baseline of governing with an existing majority and partner reluctance (e.g., Dačić) to early elections.\n  - F2’s fresh timing signal from Vučić is persuasive in keeping the probability materially above very low single digits.\n- Less convincing elements:\n  - F2’s suggestion that authorities can announce now for a September election likely misstates legal constraints; that removes a key pathway to a pre–July 1 announcement if the ruling bloc prefers an autumn election.\n  - F3’s mid-April confidence vote claim is likely incorrect given the subsequent May 14 statements about an imminent decision on whether to go to elections or form a government.\n- Net effect: The contradictory data points mostly cancel; the legal constraint (45–60 days) and summer-election aversion keep the baseline tilted to No, while Vučić’s “within ten days” keeps a non-trivial Yes path alive.",
    "rationale": "- Time left: ~46 days until July 1. Under the typical 45–60 day window between calling elections and election day, a pre–July 1 announcement would imply late June to late August elections—heightening the ‘summer election’ downside if the government prefers September/October.\n- Baseline: The ruling bloc retains a majority and can likely install a new cabinet; coalition partners signal no need for early elections; protests appear to be waning. That favors No.\n- Paths to Yes: Vučić decides within days to dissolve and call elections, aiming for late July/August despite turnout/logistics, or perceives strategic advantage (opposition fragmentation, internal polling). Escalating protests or a coalition rift would also raise odds.\n- Update vs. prior (32%):\n  - Upward pressure: Vučić’s “within ten days” comment indicates genuine optionality in late May.\n  - Downward pressure: Reassessing the legal timing constraint and summer-aversion reduces plausible incentives to announce before July 1 if the preferred election timing is early autumn. Coalition partners’ stability messaging also weighs against a fast call.\n- Net: These forces roughly offset, but I shade slightly down given the legal/timing constraint’s importance. If a PM-designate is named and cabinet formation proceeds in late May, odds drop further. Conversely, if credible reports emerge of a decision to seek snap polls, odds rise quickly.\n- What would move me up: Reporting of a coalition split, mass protest resurgence, or leaks that Vučić has decided for snap polls; failure to nominate a PM alongside rhetoric about renewing legitimacy.\n- What would move me down: Naming/confirming a PM-designate soon; explicit statements ruling out summer elections; quieting protests through late May/June.",
