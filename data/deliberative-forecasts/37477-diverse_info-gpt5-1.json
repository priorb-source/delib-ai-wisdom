    "review": "Forecaster 2 adds useful context: a sweeping tariff policy (minimum benchmark tariff via EO on Apr 2) implies continuing first-order and second-order A1 coverage. That strengthens the case that mentions will persist. Forecaster 3’s central point—that only one clean day is needed—is true, but their probability math is wrong. If each paper mentions tariffs 95% of days, the chance both omit on a given day is 0.05×0.05=0.25%, so over ~19 remaining WSJ publication days the chance of at least one simultaneous omission is about 1−(0.9975)^19≈4.7%, not ~89%. They also effectively assume independence; in reality, A1 agendas are positively correlated, further lowering the simultaneous-omission probability. Overall, F2’s reasoning is more convincing; F3’s conclusion is undermined by the math error.",
    "rationale": "Reassessing my prior 40%: I overweighted a neutral Beta-Binomial framing without firmly establishing the historical base rate and I didn’t fully account for cross-paper correlation and the permissive criterion (“tariff(s)” can appear anywhere on A1). Given: - Remaining window: ~22 calendar days, but ~19 relevant WSJ print days (no Sundays). - High ongoing salience (new tariff regime with cascading impacts) and frequent A1 treatment, especially at WSJ. - Positive correlation between NYT and WSJ in covering the same dominant macro story on A1. Under plausible per-paper daily mention probabilities of 90–95%, the independent per-day chance that both omit is 0.25%–1%; with positive correlation, effective probability is likely at the low end of that range. Across ~19 trials, a reasonable band for “at least one simultaneous omission” is roughly 5–20%. The possibility of a major overshadowing event (e.g., crisis, court ruling, disaster) keeps the tail from collapsing to near-zero, and Saturdays could be slightly friendlier to omission. However, given tariff coverage momentum and the anywhere-on-A1 rule, I now think my prior 40% was too high. I’m updating down to 20%, centered within the 10–25% range, reflecting both the short fuse and the sustained A1 relevance of tariffs while preserving some mass for a one-day overshadowing shock.",
