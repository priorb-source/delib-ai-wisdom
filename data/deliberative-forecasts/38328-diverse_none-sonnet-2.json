    "review": "Forecaster 2 raises a critical point I completely missed: the resolution window (June 10-30) immediately follows the European Parliament elections on June 9, 2025. This is NOT a random 21-day period but rather the peak period for post-election political transitions, government formations, and cabinet appointments across 27 EU member states. This dramatically increases the likelihood of MEP resignations due to career moves to national governments or other EU institutions. This is far more significant than the Huawei scandal as a driver of resignations.\n\nForecaster 3 provides solid base-rate analysis but appears to underweight the post-election timing effect that Forecaster 2 correctly emphasizes.\n\nBoth forecasters correctly note 720 MEPs (not 705 as I stated - my figure was outdated). With this larger membership and the post-election context, the probability of at least one resignation announcement in this specific window is substantially higher than I initially assessed.",
    "rationale": "My original forecast of 40% was based primarily on base rates and the scandal factor, but I failed to recognize the critical election timing. The June 9 elections create a natural inflection point where political reshuffling peaks across Europe. MEPs being appointed to national cabinet positions, EU Commission roles, or other political posts is MOST likely to occur in the immediate post-election period.\n\nWith 720 MEPs from 27 different national political systems all undergoing potential transitions simultaneously, the probability that zero resignations are announced during this 21-day window seems low. The only limiting factors are: (1) the specific 21-day window is still relatively short - some announcements may come slightly before June 10 or after June 30, and (2) some government formations take longer than three weeks.\n\nHowever, the post-election context is so significant that it should dominate my forecast. I'm updating upward substantially to 60%, aligning more closely with Forecaster 2's reasoning while remaining slightly more conservative to account for the possibility that many transitions may be announced outside this exact window.",
