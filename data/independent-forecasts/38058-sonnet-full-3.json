  "information": "U.S. President Donald Trump has postponed the implementation of a 50% tariff on goods from the European Union, moving the deadline from June 1 to July 9, 2025. The delay came after a request from European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen, who stated more time was needed for negotiations. U.S. officials have expressed frustration with the EU's cautious approach and lack of specific proposals in the trade talks. A key U.S. demand for a new trade agreement is a commitment from the EU to impose tariffs on Chinese industrial goods, which has not yet been agreed to.\n\nDomestically, U.S. tariff policy has drawn media commentary. The New York Post's editorial board warned of 'tariff burnout' among President Trump's supporters due to inconsistent implementation. The Wall Street Journal's editorial board has also criticized the tariffs, suggesting they would primarily benefit lobbyists and could be used by politicians to leverage campaign contributions. Internationally, Vietnam is reportedly fast-tracking a $1.5 billion Trump golf resort, a move linked to efforts to secure a new trade agreement with the U.S. and avoid potential tariffs as a 90-day pause on trade levies approaches its end.\n\nThe discussions around U.S. tariff policy have had observable economic effects. President Trump's announcement to delay the EU tariffs led to a positive shift in market sentiment and a surge in U.S. stock futures. In early April 2025, after the signing of an executive order for a 10% 'minimum benchmark tariff', there were reports of U.S. consumers stockpiling goods in anticipation of price increases. According to an estimate by the Tax Foundation, the proposed tariffs could cost U.S. households an additional $830 in 2025, reduce the nation's GDP by 0.4%, and result in the loss of 350,000 jobs.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Approximately 35 days remaining in the resolution window (May 26 to June 30, 2025)",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No - tariffs continue appearing on front pages",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Tariffs remain sufficiently newsworthy due to ongoing trade negotiations (particularly with the EU ahead of the July 9 deadline), Trump administration policy developments, and economic impact stories, such that at least one of the two papers features the word 'tariff' or 'tariffs' on their front page every single day through June 30, 2025.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "A major breaking news event (international crisis, natural disaster, domestic political bombshell, Supreme Court ruling, etc.) dominates the news cycle for at least one day, or tariff negotiations enter a quiet period with no new developments, causing both The New York Times and Wall Street Journal to omit 'tariff' or 'tariffs' from their front pages on the same day between now and June 30.",
    "rationale": "The key insight is that this question only requires tariffs to disappear from both front pages for a single day out of approximately 35 remaining days in the resolution window. Currently, tariffs are highly salient: Trump recently postponed EU tariffs to July 9 (just after the resolution window), Vietnam is negotiating trade deals, and various economic impact stories are circulating. The research assistant notes 'tariff burnout' among some supporters and critical editorials, but this doesn't necessarily mean the topic will disappear from news coverage. For a YES outcome, I need to estimate the daily probability that neither paper mentions tariffs, then consider this over 35 days. Given current high salience and multiple ongoing policy developments (EU negotiations deadline approaching, 90-day pause ending), I estimate each paper individually has roughly a 3-5% chance of not featuring tariffs on any given day. Since the papers' editorial decisions are somewhat correlated (both respond to the same news environment), the probability both skip tariffs on the same day is perhaps 0.2-0.5% per day. Over 35 days, this compounds to roughly 7-15% overall probability. However, the possibility of a major breaking news event that could push tariffs off both front pages simultaneously increases this somewhat. Weekend editions might also have different coverage priorities. My forecast is not higher because tariffs remain the dominant economic policy story with active developments expected through June. My forecast is not lower because 35 days provides multiple opportunities, and news cycles can be unpredictable. I would update higher if: tariff negotiations entered a clear lull, major competing news stories emerged, or if we observed several days where one paper didn't mention tariffs. I would update lower if: new tariff announcements were scheduled, negotiations intensified, or if both papers maintained daily coverage through early June.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill the word \"tariff\" disappear from the front pages of The New York Times and Wall Street Journal before July 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nWhether reading the newspaper or social media or watching the news, it is highly likely you are going to see something about tariffs - mainly due to US President Donald Trump's [renewed love](https://www.france24.com/en/live-news/20250401-tariff-man-trump-s-long-history-with-trade-wars) for this somewhat antiquated form of taxation.\r\n\r\nThe New York Times and the Wall Street Journal are two of the largest print newspapers in the US.
