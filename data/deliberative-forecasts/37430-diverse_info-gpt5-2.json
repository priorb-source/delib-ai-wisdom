    "review": "Forecaster 2 raises a useful risk I underweighted: omnibus-bill drag from unrelated controversies (e.g., TUC objections on other provisions) that could slow the whole package. However, they seem to miss that the House has already passed the bill, so their threshold for “higher” (at least one chamber passed) is already met; that makes 30% feel too low. Their point about a compressed calendar is valid.\n\nForecaster 3 captures the strong executive push and the political salience of the VAT exemption and lands near my initial view. They don’t explicitly factor the constitutional 30‑day assent window as a timing risk, which I view as material if Senate passage comes late June. Still, their momentum argument is persuasive given House passage and administration backing.\n\nNet: F2 adds downside risk from omnibus friction; F3 reinforces upside from alignment and stated July 1 implementation target. I find neither sufficient to move me far, but I’ll shade slightly down for process/timing risk.",
    "rationale": "Key facts unchanged: House passage is done; Senate passage and presidential assent remain. The administration publicly targeted July 1 implementation, implying intent to finish before then, and Tinubu can assent quickly. But timing is tight: Senate committee work, potential harmonization if versions differ, a likely Sallah recess in June, and the 30‑day presidential assent window all create slippage risk. The omnibus nature increases the chance that unrelated disputes delay the whole bill.\n\nGiven these cross‑currents, I trim my prior 58% to 55%: still slightly more likely than not due to executive priority and existing momentum, but acknowledging the nontrivial probability that process delays push enactment past July 1.\n\nWhat would move me up: Senate fast‑tracks second/third readings in May with minimal amendments; signals of pre‑coordination to avoid conference; Presidency indicates immediate assent upon transmission. What would move me down: reports of Senate referral back to committee, significant amendments requiring harmonization, crowded June agenda/recess, or hints that implementation will slip beyond July 1.",
