  "information": "The Ohio legislature has Republican supermajorities in both the Senate (26-7) and the House (67-32). Senators Theresa Gavarone and Andrew Brenner are key sponsors pushing for stricter election laws. In early 2023, Governor Mike DeWine signed HB 458, a voter ID law. However, Governor DeWine has also expressed some hesitation regarding the current proof-of-citizenship proposals. Organizations such as the ACLU are actively opposing the new legislation. The Ohio General Assembly has session days scheduled through late June 2025, ahead of the July 1, 2025 resolution deadline.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Less than 2 months.",
    "status_quo_outcome": "Ohio's existing voter verification laws remain unchanged, and no new proof-of-citizenship requirement is enacted by the deadline.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Despite Republican supermajorities in the legislature, the bill fails to pass both chambers before the July 1, 2025 deadline. The short legislative calendar, competing priorities, or procedural delays prevent the bill from reaching a final floor vote in time.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Spurred by key sponsors, the Republican leadership in the Ohio General Assembly prioritizes the legislation and uses its supermajority power to fast-track the bill through committee and floor votes in both the House and Senate during the final weeks of the legislative session in June 2025.",
    "rationale": "My forecast is anchored by the status quo, as most legislative proposals fail to become law. The primary factor against this bill's enactment is the extremely short timeline, with less than two months until the resolution date. Legislative processes are often slow, and even with a willing majority, bills can get stalled by competing priorities or procedural hurdles. However, several factors strongly support a 'Yes' outcome, preventing a lower probability. The Ohio legislature has deep Republican supermajorities in both chambers (67-32 in the House, 26-7 in the Senate), giving them the power to pass legislation with ease if they make it a priority. The question's resolution criteria are critical: 'enactment' is defined as passage by both houses, meaning a potential veto from Governor DeWine, who has expressed hesitation, is irrelevant to the outcome. This significantly lowers the barrier to success. The recent passage of a voter ID law (HB 458) also demonstrates a recent precedent for tightening election laws. My forecast is not higher because the tight deadline remains the most significant obstacle; legislative inertia is powerful. My forecast is not lower because the combination of a legislative supermajority and the removal of the gubernatorial veto as a barrier makes this a very plausible outcome if the leadership decides to act. I would increase my forecast if legislative leaders publicly declared this bill a priority or if it successfully passed out of committee in either chamber. I would decrease it if no significant action is taken by early June 2025.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nBefore July 1, 2025, will Ohio enact legislation expanding its verification requirements of a voter's citizenship?\n\nQuestion background:\nThe Ohio Senate: [Gavarone, Brenner Introduce Bill to Require Proof of Citizenship to Vote](https://ohiosenate.gov/members/theresa-gavarone/news/gavarone-brenner-introduce-bill-to-require-proof-of-citizenship-to-vote)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if, before July 1, 2025, the state of Ohio enacts legislation requiring voters to provide proof of US citizenship beyond the requirements at the time of this question, according to [credible sources](https://www.metaculus.com/faq/#definitions).\n\nAny subset of voters being required to provide such proof would count (for example if it only applied to first-time voter registrants or creating a new requirement for mail-in voters). An example of a bill that would count is [Senate Bill 153](https://www.legislature.ohio.gov/legislation/136/sb153). This question resolves upon enactment; therefore other questions such as when the legislation takes effect or whether it survives court challenges and is implemented is immaterial to this question's resolution. Please note that under Ohio law, a bill is considered enacted \"after both houses have passed and agreed on identical bills.\" ([Source](https://www.lsc.ohio.gov/assets/organizations/legislative-service-commission/files/chapter-5-enacting-legislation-10021971.pdf))\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nThe Ohio legislature has Republican supermajorities in both the Senate (26-7) and the House (67-32).

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
