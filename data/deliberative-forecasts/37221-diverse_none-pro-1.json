    "review": "My initial forecast of 40% was aligned with Forecaster 2, focusing on the broader disinflationary trend driven by ECB policy. We both saw the 2.2% threshold as a toss-up given recent stickiness and volatility. However, Forecaster 3 introduced a crucial piece of evidence I had completely overlooked: the Easter timing effect. In 2025, Easter fell in April, whereas in 2024 it fell in March. This is a very strong and convincing argument, as it's a known seasonal factor that typically boosts services inflation (travel, hospitality) in the month it occurs. Given that services inflation has been the stickiest component, this calendar effect provides a specific, compelling reason to expect an upside surprise in the April 2025 data relative to the underlying trend. Forecaster 3's point that inflation has been stabilizing in the 'mid-2s' rather than continuing a sharp decline also seems more accurate for the immediate short term, making a drop below 2.2% a more significant event than I had initially assumed.",
    "rationale": "I am substantially revising my forecast upwards based on the deliberation. My initial analysis was too focused on the medium-term disinflationary narrative and failed to account for a critical short-term, month-specific factor. The Easter timing effect, as highlighted by Forecaster 3, is a material event that will almost certainly put upward pressure on the April year-on-year services inflation rate. This single factor significantly outweighs the more general momentum of disinflation for this specific monthly reading. It provides a concrete mechanism for why the inflation rate is more likely to print above the 2.2% threshold than below it. Therefore, I am changing my view from a slight lean towards 'No' to a confident 'Yes'. I am increasing my probability from 40% to 75%, reflecting the high conviction that this calendar effect will be the decisive factor for the April data release.",
