    "review": "Both forecasters emphasize the short window to July 1 and Sadr’s sustained post-2022 boycott as the baseline, with an allowance for his unpredictability. I agree with that framing. Forecaster 2’s stress on the reputational cost of a quick reversal and the lack of clear catalysts aligns with my prior. Forecaster 3 leans a bit higher (22%) in part by treating the Iraqi President’s earlier plea as evidence of ongoing negotiations; I’m less persuaded that this remains informative months later without fresh signals. Neither added concrete indications of a near-term pivot, and both accept that Sadr tends to time reversals closer to elections—another reason a pre–July 1 announcement is less likely even if eventual participation happens.",
    "rationale": "The base case remains a continued boycott through July 1, given: (1) Sadr’s consistent stance since 2022 (including sitting out the 2023 provincial elections), (2) the political cost of another rapid U-turn absent a face-saving trigger, and (3) his pattern of late, tactical shifts closer to voting day (as in 2021), which reduces the odds of an early (pre–July 1) announcement if elections are set for later in 2025. The resolution only requires an announcement of participation by his movement under any label, which Sadr could do quickly, but there are no current signs—no credible reports of negotiations yielding concessions, reopening of political offices, or visible coordination with the election authorities. Conditional on eventual participation, it’s still more plausible he waits past July 1 to maximize leverage. I therefore trim slightly downward from my initial estimate to reflect the short horizon and lack of fresh signals. I would move up on credible Iraqi media indicating Sadrist preparations (candidate vetting, office activation) or concrete political deals; I’d move down on new categorical boycott statements or procedural milestones passing with continued Sadrist inactivity.",
