    "review": "All three forecasts converge remarkably at 2-3%, suggesting strong agreement on the fundamental dynamics. Forecaster 2 provides valuable political context about Premier Smith's 'sovereignty within a united Canada' strategy and notes that polling consistently shows independence as a minority position, reinforcing why a referendum would be a high-risk gamble. Forecaster 3 offers excellent specificity about what preparatory signals would typically precede such an announcement (cabinet orders, legislative preparation, public consultations) and notes their complete absence. Their point about the 'announce now, vote later' path is valid but doesn't significantly change the calculus since this was already implicit in evaluating the question. Both forecasters correctly emphasize that the short timeframe makes this extremely unlikely, and both note the lack of information from the research assistant as significant. The specific triggers Forecaster 3 identifies for updating (credible cabinet reporting, explicit ministerial commitments, major Ottawa-Alberta clashes) align with my thinking. No forecaster has introduced new evidence or arguments that substantially challenge the core assessment. The convergence itself is informative - it suggests we're all capturing the same fundamental reality: this outcome would require an unprecedented political shock in an extremely short window.",
    "rationale": "After reviewing both analyses, I maintain my assessment. The key factors remain: (1) Only 55 days until resolution with zero evidence of preparation; (2) The current government strategy explicitly focuses on autonomy within Canada rather than separation; (3) Minority polling support makes this politically costly; (4) The base rate of such dramatic constitutional actions is extremely low; (5) No signals whatsoever of imminent action. The convergence at 2-3% across all forecasters strengthens confidence that this range appropriately captures the tiny but non-zero possibility of a political surprise. I considered moving to 3% given Forecaster 3's slightly higher confidence, but the complete absence of any preparatory indicators - no legislative groundwork, no public consultation, no cabinet signals, no credible media reporting - combined with the established political strategy, keeps me at the lower end. The only scenario for Yes involves an unprecedented political shock triggering a snap announcement, which remains theoretically possible but practically implausible given all available evidence.",
