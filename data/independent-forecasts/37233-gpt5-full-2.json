  "information": "In a January 2025 address to the diplomatic corps, President Alassane Ouattara stated he was in 'perfect health and ready to continue serving my country', but clarified that he had 'not yet made a decision' regarding a candidacy in the October 2025 presidential election. He noted that his party, the RHDP, has at least a dozen potential candidates. Previously, in 2020, Ouattara had announced his intention to step down but reversed this decision to run for a third term after the sudden death of his designated successor.\n\nPresident Ouattara's party, the RHDP, has referred to him as its 'natural candidate' and has been calling for him to run since 2024. In late December 2024, Minister of State Anne Désirée Ouloto announced Ouattara would be the candidate. Similarly, in early January 2025, Minister of Transport Amadou KONÉ stated that Ouattara 'will be the candidate of the RHDP in October 2025.' In late April 2025, a supporter group, the Jeunesse pour la Renaissance du Grand Nord (JRGN), held a press conference publicly calling on Ouattara to run.\n\nSeveral key opposition figures face eligibility challenges ahead of the 2025 election. In late April 2025, a court ruled that potential challenger Tidjane Thiam, leader of the PDCI party, was ineligible to run for president due to his French nationality. Former President Laurent Gbagbo was excluded from electoral lists in 2023 following a conviction for embezzlement. Another political figure, Guillaume Soro, remains in exile and is ineligible due to a 2021 conviction; in April 2025, a trial began for his former aide-de-camp for an alleged coup attempt against Ouattara.",

    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "About 33 days (until June 1, 2025)",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No declaration by June 1, 2025; any candidacy (if it happens) is announced later in the summer.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Ouattara keeps ambiguity to preserve flexibility and party cohesion, allowing RHDP’s internal processes to run into June/July (e.g., a later congress or formal designation), or he ultimately designates another candidate instead of himself.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "RHDP convenes a May congress/rally and formally designates Ouattara, with him explicitly accepting; or Ouattara makes a direct public statement or official address in May declaring his candidacy, reported by major outlets.",
    "rationale": "- Evidence to date: In January 2025, Ouattara said he had not yet decided, despite stressing good health. Multiple senior RHDP figures (e.g., Anne Désirée Ouloto in Dec 2024; Amadou Koné in Jan 2025) publicly asserted he will be the candidate, and the party calls him its “natural candidate.” However, as of April 29, there’s no explicit declaration by Ouattara himself, and the resolution criteria have not been met.\n- Political context: Key opposition figures face obstacles (Tidjane Thiam ruled ineligible due to French nationality; Laurent Gbagbo excluded from lists; Guillaume Soro in exile and ineligible). A weakened opposition reduces the urgency for an early declaration and arguably increases the incentive to wait.\n- Timing precedent/incentives: In 2020, Ouattara declared relatively late (August) following the sudden death of his successor. With an October 2025 election, a May declaration would be on the early side for him and unnecessary politically given incumbency and a fragmented opposition. Keeping options open also mitigates age/health risk management for an 83-year-old incumbent.\n- Paths to “Yes”: A scheduled RHDP congress in May with a formal acclamation and explicit acceptance by Ouattara would likely trigger a declaration before June 1. Clear press guidance from the presidency signaling an imminent announcement would also raise odds.\n- Why not higher: No formal schedule for a May party congress is publicly noted; Ouattara himself has maintained ambiguity; historical behavior and strategic incentives point to later timing. With only ~1 month left, the hazard of a declaration in May seems modest.\n- Why not lower: Strong elite signaling within RHDP that he will run; desire to consolidate the party and start fundraising/campaigning could prompt a May move; external factors (e.g., final opposition disqualifications) could trigger a swift, choreographed announcement.\n- What would move me up: Confirmed RHDP congress/primary event set for May; credible leaks that Ouattara will announce imminently; an official party communiqué naming him and his explicit acceptance.\n- What would move me down: Reports that RHDP will decide its candidate at a congress after June 1; renewed statements from Ouattara deferring a decision to mid/late summer; indications he is grooming/endorsing another candidate without committing himself.",
