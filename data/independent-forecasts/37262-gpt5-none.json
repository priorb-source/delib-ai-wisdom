    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "About 60 days (until July 1, 2025)",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "No India protest of 10,000+ starts after the question launch and before July 1, or such events occur but are either not added to the Global Protest Tracker, are tagged with fewer than 10,000 participants/unknown size, or have start dates outside the qualifying window.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "A large-scale protest (e.g., farmer mobilizations, communal-policy protests, nationwide strikes, or major city marches) begins after the launch date and before July 1, draws 10,000+ participants, and is added to the Global Protest Tracker with a 10,000+ size tag and a qualifying start date.",
    "rationale": "- Interpretation: I take the operative criterion to be that the Carnegie Global Protest Tracker contains an India entry with a start date after launch and before July 1, 2025, with size 10,000+. The Reuters piece (Apr 14, 2025) suggests elevated protest risk, but it predates what is likely the launch window, and the prompt states the criteria have not yet been satisfied.\n- Base rates and cadence: India frequently sees large protests, but the Global Protest Tracker is selective and often records only the most salient events (and sometimes tags size as unknown). Historically, India might register on the tracker a handful of times per year, implying roughly a low single-digit probability per week. Over a ~2‑month window, that suggests something like 20–35% before considering current conditions.\n- Current context: Recent violent protests around a Muslim land law in eastern India indicate a combustible environment that could spawn further large gatherings in the near term. Other plausible triggers include farmer mobilizations, unemployment/exam-related protests, or communal/policy changes. These raise the odds versus a quiet baseline.\n- Constraints lowering odds: The event must (a) start after the launch, (b) be at least 10,000 in size as coded by the tracker, and (c) be deemed notable enough to be added. Even if large events occur, the tracker could mark size as unknown or delay/skip inclusion. These gating factors argue for a probability well below 50%.\n- Why not higher: Short window (~60 days), tracker selectivity, and the size-tag requirement. Some large protests may not be coded as 10,000+ or may not be added at all.\n- Why not lower: India’s high protest propensity and fresh indications of unrest elevate near-term risk. It only takes one sizable, media-salient event to satisfy the criterion.\n- Updates: I would increase the forecast if there are credible reports of planned mass mobilizations (e.g., farmer unions announcing nationwide marches), if new large protests break out with “tens of thousands” language, or if the tracker shows recent, prompt additions for India. I would decrease the forecast if May remains quiet or if added India entries are tagged as <10,000 or unknown.\n- Research assistant summary: No additional information was available; thus, the forecast leans on base rates, recent Reuters reporting, and tracker behavior patterns.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill the Global Protest Tracker report any protests in India with 10,000+ participants, before July 1, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nReuters: [Three dead as protests against Muslim land law turn violent in eastern India](https://www.reuters.com/world/india/three-dead-protests-against-muslim-land-law-turn-violent-eastern-india-2025-04-14/)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if the [Global Protest Tracker](https://carnegieendowment.org/features/global-protest-tracker?lang=en) reports a protest in India with 10,000 or more participants with a start date after the launch of this question and before July 1, 2025.\n\nA protest with at least 10,000 participants that is active at the launch of this question does not count for resolution.\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nNo additional information available.\n\nToday is 2025-05-02.\n\nBefore answering you think:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n(e) You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
