  "information": "As of late May 2025, Kneecap remains officially listed on the Glastonbury 2025 lineup for the West Holts stage, and festival organizers have not issued any public statement regarding the controversies or the recent charge. Several venues and European festivals, including the Eden Project, Plymouth Pavilions, and Germany's Hurricane and Southside festivals, have cancelled Kneecap's scheduled appearances. However, other events have proceeded; London's Wide Awake Festival confirmed the band would still perform on May 24, and the band played a surprise gig in London on May 22, the day after the terrorism charge was made public.",

    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "About 5 weeks (until the June 25–29, 2025 festival window)",
    "status_quo_outcome": "Yes — they are currently listed on the official Glastonbury 2025 lineup (West Holts) and no organiser statement indicates removal.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Glastonbury drops Kneecap due to political pressure, licensing/police concerns, or bail conditions; or the band withdraws amid a cascade of cancellations and risk assessments.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Organisers hold firm despite controversy and allow the set to proceed; even if a member faces restrictions, remaining members perform under the Kneecap name.",
    "rationale": "I put meaningful weight on the status quo: as of May 23, Kneecap remains on Glastonbury’s official lineup and organisers have issued no contrary statement. Glastonbury has a track record of tolerating controversy, especially on stages like West Holts, and typically resists external political pressure. That said, the band faces unusual headwinds: several venues and festivals (Eden Project, Plymouth Pavilions, Germany’s Hurricane and Southside) have cancelled, and there are intensified calls to remove them following a terrorism-related charge reported this week. Offsetting that, some events have proceeded (Wide Awake confirmed May 24; a surprise London gig occurred May 22 after the charge), which suggests there is not a blanket prohibition or immediate legal constraint preventing performances. Netting these factors: Glastonbury’s ethos and current listing argue for Yes; the wave of cancellations, potential licensing/policing pressure, and legal uncertainty raise the probability of a late drop. I therefore lean Yes but with substantial risk. Why not higher? Multiple recent cancellations, national-level scrutiny, and the possibility of police/licensing or bail restrictions could trigger removal. Why not lower? The lineup remains unchanged, organisers silent, and recent performances indicate the band can still appear at UK events; Glastonbury, in particular, tends to defend booked acts. Up/Downside triggers: Up if Glastonbury publicly reaffirms the booking or if legal/policing developments ease (e.g., no restrictive bail conditions) and cancellations elsewhere slow. Down if Mendip licensing/police pressure becomes public, more major UK festivals drop them, bail conditions emerge that limit appearances, or Glastonbury signals reconsideration.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill Kneecap perform at Glastonbury 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\n[Kneecap](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kneecap_\\(band\\)) are an Irish band who have significantly risen in popularity since their formation in 2017.&#x20;\n\nThe band is a trio consisting of: \"Mo Chara\" (Liam Óg Ó hAnnaidh), \"Móglaí Bap\" (Naoise Ó Caireallain), and \"DJ Próvaí\" (J. J. Ó Dochartaigh) whose songs consist of rap in a mixture of Irish Gaelic and English giving them a unique style.\n\nNamed after a [torture technique](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kneecapping) made infamous by the Irish Republican Army, the group are no stranger to controversies. Whilst most have been minor - complaints about profanity, drug use, violence in their songs, music videos and concerts, and promotion of Irish Republicanism - the band have come under a large amount of controversy resulting in cancelled performances which initially stemmed from a Coachcella performance where the band, \"described Israel's military action in Gaza as a US-funded genocide\".&#x20;\n\nOn top of this, [two reports were made](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/cly5r4gg7l6o) to the UK Metropolitan police:\n\n> \\[...] the band allegedly call for the death of Conservative MPs. Another seems to show a band member shouting \"up Hamas, up Hezbollah\". Both groups are banned in the UK and it is a crime to express support for them.\n\n> \\[...]\n\n> They claimed that footage where they appeared to say \"the only good Tory is a dead Tory\" had been \"taken out of all context\", and apologised for the hurt caused to the families of murdered MPs Jo Cox and Sir David Amess.\n\nThe band are [due](https://www.glastonburyfestivals.co.uk/line-up/) to play at Glastonbury 2025 - the UK's largest and most prestigious music festival - however there have been [calls](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/politics/2025/04/30/kneecap-should-be-banned-full-stop-after-dead-tories-video/) for the band to be removed from the lineup.\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question will resolve as **Yes** if Kneecap officially performs at Glastonbury 2025, scheduled for June 25 to June 29, 2025.\n\n* If Glastonbury 2025 does not take place before September 1, 2025 this question will be **annulled**.\n* Officially perform is defined as a planned performance as allowed by the festival organisers.\n* Any official performance is considered sufficient for this question. If, for example, one band member is banned from the festival, the question will still resolve as **Yes** if the other member(s) perform under the name Kneecap.\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nAs of late May 2025, Kneecap remains officially listed on the Glastonbury 2025 lineup for the West Holts stage, and festival organizers have not issued any public statement regarding the controversies or the recent charge. Several venues and European festivals, including the Eden Project, Plymouth Pavilions, and Germany's Hurricane and Southside festivals, have cancelled Kneecap's scheduled appearances. However, other events have proceeded; London's Wide Awake Festival confirmed the band would still perform on May 24, and the band played a surprise gig in London on May 22, the day after the terrorism charge was made public.\n\nToday is 2025-05-23.\n\nBefore answering you think:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n(e) You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
