    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Approximately one month. The outcome will be determined by the closing value on May 30, 2025.",
    "status_quo_outcome": "The market continues its long-term upward trend, punctuated by normal short-term volatility. Absent any major economic or geopolitical shocks, this historical positive drift would likely result in a small gain for the month, favoring a 'Yes' outcome.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Worse-than-expected inflation data for April is released in May, causing concerns about a more hawkish Federal Reserve. This, combined with weak forward guidance from a few major technology firms, triggers a risk-off sentiment among investors, leading the index to close the month lower.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Key economic data released in May, such as the jobs report and CPI, suggest a 'soft landing' scenario with moderating inflation and resilient growth. This boosts investor confidence and leads to a broad market rally, with the S&P 500 closing higher for the month.",
    "rationale": "Forecasting the stock market's direction over a single month is inherently difficult due to high levels of volatility and randomness. In the absence of specific market intelligence, the most prudent approach is to rely on historical base rates. Historically, the S&P 500 has a positive bias; since 1950, the month of May has been positive for the index approximately 57% of the time. My forecast is anchored to this historical probability. The research assistant provided no additional information, so I am not factoring in any current market sentiment, momentum, or specific upcoming catalysts. My probability is not higher than 56% because a one-month period is easily swayed by unpredictable news events, such as a negative inflation surprise or a geopolitical flare-up, which could push the market down. My probability is not lower than 50% because betting against the market's long-term positive drift is not the default position without specific negative catalysts on the horizon. I would raise my forecast with evidence of strong economic momentum and dovish central bank policy. I would lower my forecast given signs of weakening economic data, hawkish Fed commentary, or poor corporate earnings guidance.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill the S&P 500 index go up in May 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nNY Times: [What Is a Bear Market? Are We in One?](https://www.nytimes.com/article/bear-market-stocks-tariffs.html)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question will resolve as Yes if the closing value of the S&P 500 Index on the final trading day of May 2025 is higher than that of the final trading day of April 2025.\n\nThe \"close\" values shown on the [history page of Yahoo finance](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/%5EGSPC/history?p=%5EGSPC) will be used.\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nNo additional information available.\n\nToday is 2025-04-29.\n\nBefore answering you think:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n(e) You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
