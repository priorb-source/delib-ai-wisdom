  "information": "The National Bank of Ukraine (NBU) has maintained its key interest rate at 15.5% in an effort to control inflation. The NBU revised its year-end 2025 inflation forecast to 8.7% and its 2025 GDP growth forecast down to 3.1%. NBU statements indicate an expectation that inflation will peak in the second quarter of 2025 and subsequently decline during the summer, partly due to an anticipated increase in crop yields, which is projected to lower food inflation. The bank has identified ongoing risks including the war, infrastructure damage, and labor shortages.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Approximately 1-2 weeks. Since today is April 22, 2025, and we need April 2025 inflation data, the official statistics should be published by early-to-mid May 2025.",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No - inflation remains below 15%",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Ukraine's April 2025 inflation comes in at 12-14%, representing an elevated but controlled peak consistent with the NBU's monetary policies and their forecast of 8.7% year-end inflation. The central bank's 15.5% interest rate and anticipated summer crop yields keep inflation from reaching 15%.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "The cumulative effects of war, infrastructure damage, labor shortages, and supply chain disruptions push April inflation to 15% or above, representing the Q2 peak that the NBU anticipated. The stagflation concerns mentioned in April 10 reporting materialize with high inflation coinciding with weak GDP growth.",
    "rationale": "The NBU has forecast year-end 2025 inflation at 8.7% while explicitly stating they expect inflation to peak in Q2 2025 (which includes April) before declining in summer. This creates a tension: if year-end inflation is projected at 8.7%, the Q2 peak could reasonably be several percentage points higher (perhaps 12-14%) before the anticipated decline. However, reaching 15% would be quite elevated relative to this forecast. The NBU is actively managing inflation with a 15.5% key rate, suggesting they believe they can maintain control. The April 10 article about Ukraine being 'one step away from stagflation' indicates elevated concerns, but doesn't necessarily confirm 15%+ inflation. Professional central bank forecasts typically incorporate major known risks, including war impacts. Since we're already late in April (April 22), the actual inflation figure is essentially determined - we're just waiting for publication. The status quo suggests controlled but elevated inflation below 15%, though the Q2 peak expectation creates real uncertainty. I'm not forecasting higher because the NBU's professional forecasts and active monetary policy suggest reasonable control. I'm not forecasting lower because the NBU explicitly expects a Q2 peak, wars create significant inflation volatility, and recent reporting suggests serious stagflation concerns. I would update higher with any leaked data or official statements suggesting April inflation near/above 15%. I would update lower with any preliminary indications that April inflation is well-controlled in the 10-12% range.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill Ukraine's inflation rate increase to at least 15.0% for April 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\n[Ukraine is one step away from stagflation. And here's why](https://en.iz.ru/en/1868046/2025-04-10/ukraine-one-step-away-stagflation-and-heres-why)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if Ukraine's annualized inflation rate is greater than or equal to 15.0% for the month of April 2025, according to the number presented by [Trading Economics](https://tradingeconomics.com/ukraine/inflation-cpi). Under 15.0% resolves as **No**.\n\n\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nThe National Bank of Ukraine (NBU) has maintained its key interest rate at 15.5% in an effort to control inflation.

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
