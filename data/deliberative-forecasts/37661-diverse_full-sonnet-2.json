    "review": "Both forecasters raise compelling points that challenge my initial assessment. Forecaster 2 emphasizes the concrete momentum from licenses, completed trial, and high-level political support, arguing these outweigh speculative risks. Forecaster 3 provides a balanced middle ground, acknowledging both the positive signals and realistic bureaucratic hurdles. Both note that the technical path is clear (no gateway needed), which I mentioned but may have underweighted. Forecaster 2's observation that the U.S. investigation is unlikely to materially impact operations within 45 days is persuasive - Bangladesh has already granted licenses independent of U.S. political dynamics. However, I find Forecaster 2's 75% potentially overoptimistic given the tight timeline and pending tariff approval. Forecaster 3's 65% seems more calibrated to the genuine uncertainties remaining. My initial 42% appears too pessimistic - I overweighted the 'status quo is No' framing when significant momentum exists, and I may have been too concerned about the slipped May target (only 2 weeks so far) relative to the remaining 45-day window.",
    "rationale": "Upon reflection, I undervalued several factors: (1) The licenses being granted on April 30 represents clearing the main regulatory hurdle, not just a first step. (2) The completed trial in April demonstrates operational readiness, not just intent. (3) High-level political support from Muhammad Yunus and swift BTRC action suggest genuine fast-track treatment. (4) The technical capability to serve Bangladesh with existing satellites removes a common bottleneck. However, genuine concerns remain: the tariff plan still requires BTRC review and approval, commercial setup (payments, taxes, distribution) can encounter unexpected delays, and 45 days provides minimal buffer if any friction occurs. The missed May target, while only a 2-week slip so far, does indicate some friction in the process. I'm updating upward to reflect that the concrete progress and political momentum make success more likely than not, but staying below Forecaster 2's 75% because the tariff approval timeline remains uncertain and the window for execution is genuinely tight. A forecast around 58% balances the significant positive indicators with realistic acknowledgment of remaining execution risk.",
