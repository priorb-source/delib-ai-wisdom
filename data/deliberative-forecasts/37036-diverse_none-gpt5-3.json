    "review": "Forecaster 2 leans heavily on the idea that a public exploration implies a near-term announcement and even suggests an exploratory committee was formed. The linked reporting only says he is exploring, not that a formal exploratory committee exists, so that weakens the inference of imminence. For a 2026 race, the need to capitalize on April media buzz is not especially strong, and many challengers delay formal announcements into late summer/fall. Forecaster 3’s emphasis on status quo inertia, the typical length of exploratory phases, and the lack of further signals is more consistent with base-rate timing. I agree with the upside they note (a meaningful signal of intent and adequate time remaining) but still see the short window as a constraint absent concrete signs of a rollout.",
    "rationale": "We have roughly five and a half weeks left and no follow-on indicators since the April 3 story (no dated event, staff hires, FEC filing, or heightened comms). For a 2026 race—especially if he runs as an independent again—the strategic urgency to announce before June 1 is limited. Osborn’s recent statewide run and name ID do raise the plausibility of an early declaration, but without corroborating signs, the base-rate expectation is that exploration could last months. My prior view already incorporated these dynamics; Forecaster 2’s argument relies on an assumption (formal exploratory committee) not in evidence, while Forecaster 3’s framing aligns with mine. I’m holding at the low-40s. I would move up materially on concrete launch signals (scheduled announcement, FEC Statement of Candidacy, senior staff/consultants, or coordinated endorsements). I would move down if we get to mid-May with continued silence or any public cooling of interest.",
