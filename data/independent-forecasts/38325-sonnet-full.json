  "information": "The advance estimate for Q1 2025 annualized real GDP growth was -0.3%. The second estimate, released on May 29, 2025, was an upward revision to -0.2%. Key factors driving the contraction in the first quarter included a significant increase in imports, which subtracted 4.90 percentage points from GDP, and a reduction in government spending, which subtracted 0.12 percentage points. These negative factors were partially offset by positive contributions from investment (+3.98 percentage points) and consumer spending (+0.80 percentage points).\n\nHistorical analyses of BEA data by the St. Louis Fed show that revisions which change the sign of GDP growth from negative to positive are uncommon, happening in less than 20% of such cases. Another analysis covering the period from 1996 to 2024 indicates that when an advance estimate is between -0.5% and 0%, the third estimate turns positive in roughly 35-40% of instances. The typical absolute revision from the second to the third estimate is about 0.1 to 0.2 percentage points, while the absolute average revision from the advance to the third estimate is larger, at approximately 0.5 percentage points.\n\nThe third estimate for Q1 2025 GDP incorporates more comprehensive source data than was available for previous estimates. This includes complete data for March on international trade in goods and services, construction spending, and manufacturers' and trade inventories. The third estimate will also incorporate updated data on federal and state government spending, as well as the results of annual benchmark revisions to trade and services data which can affect the final figures.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Approximately 3-4 weeks. The third estimate for Q1 2025 GDP is typically released about one month after the second estimate, which was released on May 29, 2025. This suggests a release date around late June 2025.",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No. The current second estimate shows Q1 2025 real GDP growth at -0.2%, which is below the 0.0% threshold required for a Yes outcome.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "The third estimate incorporates comprehensive source data but revisions are modest or slightly negative, keeping GDP growth at or below 0.0%. The more complete data on trade, inventories, and government spending either confirms the negative growth picture or shows only minor improvements insufficient to overcome the -0.2% starting point.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "The third estimate's more comprehensive data reveals stronger-than-initially-measured economic activity, particularly in areas like consumer spending, investment, or smaller trade deficits. An upward revision of at least 0.2+ percentage points pushes the annualized growth rate above 0.0%, turning the quarter technically positive.",
    "rationale": "The current second estimate stands at -0.2%, representing a 0.1 percentage point upward revision from the -0.3% advance estimate. For a Yes outcome, we need an additional upward revision of more than 0.2 percentage points.\n\nKey factors supporting a higher probability:\n1. Proximity to threshold: At -0.2%, we're very close to zero, requiring only a modest additional revision\n2. Positive momentum: The trend from advance to second estimate was upward\n3. Historical precedent: When advance estimates fall between -0.5% and 0%, approximately 35-40% turn positive by the third estimate\n4. Revision magnitude: The absolute average revision from advance to third estimate is approximately 0.5 percentage points, which would be more than sufficient\n\nKey factors limiting the probability:\n1. Sign changes are uncommon: Historical analysis shows that revisions changing GDP growth from negative to positive occur in less than 20% of cases\n2. Typical second-to-third revisions: These are usually only 0.1 to 0.2 percentage points - we need at least 0.2+ points\n3. Status quo bias: The current reading is negative, and absent strong evidence, this is likely to persist\n4. Fundamental weakness: Q1 showed significant headwinds from imports (-4.90pp) and reduced government spending\n\nThe forecast is not higher because: Most historical evidence suggests sign changes are rare, and we need a revision larger than typical second-to-third estimate revisions. The comprehensive data for the third estimate could just as easily confirm the weakness as reveal hidden strength.\n\nThe forecast is not lower because: We're extremely close to the threshold, have already seen positive momentum in revisions, and fall within a historical range where 35-40% of similar cases turned positive.\n\nI would revise upward if: Early indicators suggest the trade deficit narrowed more than initially reported, or if there were positive surprises in construction spending or inventory data. I would revise downward if: Preliminary March data showed continued weakness or if government spending cuts were deeper than initially estimated.",

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any).
