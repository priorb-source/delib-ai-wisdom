    "review": "Forecaster 2’s analysis is solid on the main risks: executive-branch deference in immigration/national-security contexts and the realistic possibility that higher courts could stay any district-court relief. They also correctly note the unprecedented nature of a full SEVP revocation for a major university and that DHS might prefer to litigate rather than reverse. I think they may slightly over-weight the chance of a rapid appellate unwind within this short time window; building, briefing, and securing a stay through the First Circuit and then the Supreme Court by July 1 is possible but not trivial.\n\nForecaster 3 introduces a major new claim: a TRO was granted on May 23 with a PI hearing set for May 29. If true, that materially increases the probability because the status quo would be active certification pending further order, and courts often preserve the last peaceable status quo when third-party harms are massive. However, I can’t independently verify that TRO; Forecaster 2 didn’t mention it, and our prior summary didn’t include it. I therefore treat it as plausible but unconfirmed. Even if a TRO exists, 78% seems a bit high given the nontrivial risk of PI denial or a higher-court stay, especially if DHS reframes its action on stronger procedural/national-security grounds.\n\nNet: F2’s caution about appellate stays is important; F3’s status-quo framing (if a TRO exists) rightly pushes the probability up. I weight both: there’s meaningful upside from potential (or existing) interim relief, but also meaningful downside from deference and stay risk.",
    "rationale": "Baseline on May 28: Harvard’s SEVP certification was revoked May 22. Paths to Yes by July 1 are (1) judicial relief that keeps certification effective (TRO/PI/ injunction pending appeal) or (2) DHS administrative stay/reinstatement. Paths to No are (a) no injunctive relief, (b) a PI/TRO is denied or expires, or (c) higher courts stay any district-court order before July 1.\n\nKey considerations:\n- Irreparable harm and equities strongly favor interim relief: thousands of students’ status and educational disruption. Courts often act quickly to preserve the status quo in such circumstances. This alone pushes the probability above 50%.\n- Executive deference and stay risk: DHS can recast its action as within regulatory discretion with national-security or compliance grounds, and the government has had success obtaining emergency stays in immigration-adjacent cases. That limits how high the probability can be.\n- Time horizon: With about a month to July 1, the government would need to win a sequence of steps (defeat/avoid PI or obtain a stay) for a No outcome. That’s feasible but not assured, especially if a TRO/PI is already in place. The short window tilts toward at least temporary maintenance of certification.\n- Administrative reversal seems less likely given the political posture, so the judicial path is the main one.\n\nUpdate vs. my prior: I initially put 60% based on likelihood of a TRO/PI. Considering F2’s emphasis on higher-court stay risk keeps me from moving much higher. F3’s claim of an already-issued TRO, while unverified, modestly increases my belief that some form of relief is or will be in place soon. Net effect: small upward adjustment.\n",
