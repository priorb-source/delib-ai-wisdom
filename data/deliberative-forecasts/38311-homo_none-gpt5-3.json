    "review": "Both forecasters echo the same core evidence (White House confirmation, high historical base rate, short/low‑risk trip to Canada) and identify similar tail risks (health, domestic/international crises, security, schedule/format changes). The one addition I hadn’t explicitly weighted is the signaling value of the first G7 of a term, which modestly increases the incentive to attend. Their move-up/down triggers match mine. No contradictory evidence surfaced.",
    "rationale": "Status quo strongly favors attendance: official confirmation is public; U.S. presidents almost always attend G7s; Trump himself attended prior G7s even amid tensions; and Canada’s proximity reduces logistical and operational risks. The threshold for resolution is minimal (any in-person appearance during the June summit). With only weeks to go, many logistics are likely locked. Residual risks remain nonzero—Trump’s unpredictability, potential acute crises, health, or a last‑minute decision to send a surrogate—but these look like small tails over the short horizon. Incorporating the added point about the first G7 of a term slightly raises my confidence from my prior. I’d move higher still upon firm schedule releases or pool reports indicating travel is underway; I’d move lower only on credible health/crisis reporting or official surrogate/postponement signals.",
