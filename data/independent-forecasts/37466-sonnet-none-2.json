    "no_outcome_scenario": "WorldAtlas.com maintains its current naming of 'Gulf of Mexico' on the North America page, treating the U.S. government's renaming as a political designation that does not reflect international geographic naming conventions or consensus among cartographers and international bodies.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "WorldAtlas.com updates its North America page to display 'Gulf of America' either as the primary name or alongside 'Gulf of Mexico' (e.g., 'Gulf of America (formerly Gulf of Mexico)'), choosing to acknowledge the U.S. federal government's naming decision from January 2025.",
    "rationale": "This question relates to President Trump's January 2025 executive order renaming the Gulf of Mexico to 'Gulf of America' on federal maps. With only 54 days until resolution, the status quo strongly favors No. Key factors: (1) WorldAtlas is a commercial website, not bound by U.S. government naming conventions; (2) International geographic names are typically determined by international consensus, not unilateral decisions; (3) Four months have passed since the executive order without the North America page changing; (4) The renaming was controversial and lacks international recognition. The article title 'Gulf Of Mexico (Gulf of America)' suggests awareness but this is on the specific article page, not the North America map page being evaluated. If WorldAtlas intended to change, they likely would have done so already. The resolution criteria do allow both names together, which slightly increases probability, but the short timeframe and lack of action to date suggest inertia will prevail. My forecast would be higher if: WorldAtlas showed recent signals of considering the change, international bodies endorsed the name, or more time remained. It would be lower if: WorldAtlas had explicitly stated they won't change, or if international geographic organizations actively opposed the renaming.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill WorldAtlas.com display the body of water northwest of the Caribbean Sea as the Gulf of America before July 1, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nWorld Atlas article: [Gulf Of Mexico (Gulf of America)](https://www.worldatlas.com/gulfs/gulf-of-mexico.html)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if, before July 1, 2025, the World Atlas website at its [North America](https://www.worldatlas.com/webimage/countrys/na.htm) page displays the body of water west of Florida, south of Louisiana and north of the Yucatán Peninsula as the Gulf of America. (At the time of this question, the name displayed is the Gulf of Mexico.)\n\nIn case both names are used, for example \"Gulf of America formerly known as Gulf of Mexico,\" this question resolves as Yes. Note that verification will be from Metaculus admins accessing the webpage from the United States and that therefore resolution will be based on how the page appears when accessed from that location.\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nNo additional information available.\n\nToday is 2025-05-08.\n\nBefore answering you think:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n(e) You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
