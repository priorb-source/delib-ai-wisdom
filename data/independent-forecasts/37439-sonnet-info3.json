  "information": "Donald Trump is scheduled to travel to Saudi Arabia, Qatar, and the United Arab Emirates in mid-May 2025 to participate in a Gulf summit. In late April, Trump mentioned the possibility of a meeting with Putin during this trip. On May 5, Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov stated that Putin's schedule does not currently include a trip to the Middle East.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Approximately 40 days until June 15, 2025, with the resolution window opening in 6 days on May 12, 2025",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No - there is currently no phone call scheduled or confirmed between Trump and Putin for the specified timeframe",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Trump completes his Middle East trip in mid-May without subsequent phone contact with Putin. The two leaders continue communicating through diplomatic channels and intermediaries rather than direct phone calls. No crisis or breakthrough emerges that would necessitate immediate leader-to-leader phone communication during this 34-day window.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Following Trump's Middle East trip, diplomatic momentum on Ukraine negotiations or bilateral issues leads Trump and Putin to schedule a phone call in late May or early June. Both leaders publicly acknowledge the call afterward, satisfying the resolution criteria. This could be triggered by progress in backchannel negotiations or a development requiring direct leader-level coordination.",
    "rationale": "The key evidence includes: (1) Trump and Putin recently spoke in February 2025, establishing precedent for direct communication during Trump's current term; (2) Trump mentioned the possibility of meeting Putin during his mid-May Middle East trip, showing ongoing interest in engagement; (3) However, Kremlin spokesman Peskov stated on May 5 that Putin's schedule doesn't include a Middle East trip, suggesting no imminent in-person meeting. The question specifically asks about phone calls during a 34-day window (May 12-June 15), which is a relatively narrow timeframe. The status quo strongly favors No - on most days, these leaders don't speak by phone. The recent February call shows willingness to communicate, but doesn't guarantee another call in this specific window. The very specific definition requiring both sides to acknowledge the call adds additional hurdles. My forecast isn't higher because: there's no indication of a planned call, Peskov's statement suggests limited engagement around Trump's trip, and the default state is non-communication. My forecast isn't lower because: they have recent precedent for calls, the Ukraine situation creates ongoing reasons for potential communication, and the 34-day window provides multiple opportunities. I would revise upward if: either side announces plans for a call, there's a breakthrough in Ukraine negotiations, or a crisis emerges requiring leader-level coordination. I would revise downward if: diplomatic tensions increase, both sides indicate communication will proceed through other channels, or we approach mid-June without any indication of contact.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill Donald Trump and Vladimir Putin speak on the phone with each other before June 15, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nWikipedia: [February 2025 Putin–Trump call](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/February_2025_Putin%E2%80%93Trump_call)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if, after May 12, 2025 and before June 15, 2025, Donald Trump and Vladimir Putin speak on the phone with each other, according to [credible sources](https://www.metaculus.com/faq/#definitions).\n\nBoth sides must acknowledge the phone call took place for it to count. \"Speak on the phone with each other\" is defined as both Trump and Putin, from different physical spaces, orally uttering words intended for the other individual into a telephone or equivalent device, those words being converted into electrical or digital signals in real time, and then transferred to the other individual via telecommunications links, where they are reconverted into sound waves at the other individual's listening device.\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nDonald Trump is scheduled to travel to Saudi Arabia, Qatar, and the United Arab Emirates in mid-May 2025 to participate in a Gulf summit. In late April, Trump mentioned the possibility of a meeting with Putin during this trip. On May 5, Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov stated that Putin's schedule does not currently include a trip to the Middle East.\n\nToday is 2025-05-06.\n\nBefore answering you think:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n(e) You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
