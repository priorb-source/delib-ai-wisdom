    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "~46 days (until 2025-07-01)",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No announcement; the ruling coalition names and confirms a replacement prime minister and continues governing without calling snap parliamentary elections before July 1, 2025.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "After the PM’s resignation, the SNS-led majority quickly coalesces around a new PM nominee who is confirmed by the National Assembly. Government continues in office; any discussion of elections is deferred, and no official election date is set before July 1.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "The President, after consultations, opts to dissolve the National Assembly (or signals intent to do so) and officially sets a date for snap parliamentary elections—likely for late summer or autumn 2025—publishing a decree before July 1.",
    "rationale": "- Timing: There are about 1.5 months left for an official announcement. Even if there is political turbulence following a PM resignation, Serbia’s constitutional process to attempt forming a new government can easily run beyond July 1 before reaching a forced dissolution. That calendar friction favors “No” in this narrow window.\n- Status quo bias: In Serbia, the ruling SNS and allies typically retain strong parliamentary control. After prior early elections (Dec 2023), the leadership has the option to manage transition via appointing a loyal replacement PM without immediately returning to the polls. The default pathway is to keep governing, which points to “No.”\n- Snap-election propensity vs. window: Serbia has a history of frequent early elections, and President Vučić has used snap polls to consolidate power. This raises the base risk of a “Yes.” However, given the short window to July 1 and the availability of a straightforward replacement-PM option, the odds that an election date is set within the next six weeks are still below 50%.\n- Why not higher: Limited time and a viable non-election pathway (new PM) make an announcement by July 1 less likely. Also, if the leadership wants autumn elections, they could wait to announce later in summer.\n- Why not lower: The PM’s resignation (as per the background article) is a non-trivial trigger. Serbia’s pattern of calling early elections and the leadership’s strategic use of snap polls keep the probability meaningfully above a low single-digit chance.\n- What would move me up: Clear public signals from President Vučić or senior SNS figures favoring snap polls; visible coalition fractures that jeopardize confirming a new PM; formal steps toward dissolution; leaked timelines pointing to an autumn election with an announcement slated for late May/June.\n- What would move me down: Rapid nomination and scheduling of a parliamentary vote on a consensus PM; credible reporting that the coalition will avoid elections until 2026/2027; procedural timelines indicating no dissolution decision before July.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill Serbia announce a general election before July 1, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\n[Serbia could face snap elections as PM’s resignation confirmed](https://tvpworld.com/85681783/serbia-could-face-snap-elections-as-pms-resignation-confirmed-)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if, before July 1, 2025, a specific date on which a general election will be held is officially announced by the government of Serbia or any of its agencies that have the authority to do so. If no such announcement occurs before July 1, 2025, this question resolves as **No**.\n\nThe election does not have to be held before July 1, 2025; this question resolves based on an announcement.\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nNo additional information available.\n\nToday is 2025-05-15.\n\nBefore answering you think:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n(e) You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
