  "information": "The Trump administration has threatened to revoke Harvard University's 501(c)(3) status, citing the university's DEI programs, alleged anti-Semitism, and refusal to comply with demands for reforms to governance and leadership. The administration has frozen $2.2 billion in federal funding and $60 million in contracts intended for the university. In response, Harvard has filed a lawsuit against the administration, arguing that its actions are arbitrary, capricious, and outside the scope of its legal authority. The university has rejected the administration's demands, with its spokesperson stating there is 'no legal basis for revoking the University's exemption.'\n\nThe authority to revoke a 501(c)(3) tax-exempt status rests with the Internal Revenue Service (IRS), not the President. According to legal precedent, revocation typically requires evidence that an organization is violating public policy or engaging in illegal activities. The key Supreme Court case, Bob Jones University v. United States (1983), affirmed that tax-exempt status could be revoked for organizations violating clear public policy, such as racial discrimination. The legal and administrative process in the Bob Jones case took over seven years to resolve. Historically, no major university has had its tax-exempt status revoked in recent decades.\n\nLegal experts and former IRS officials state that the revocation process normally involves a multi-step, years-long procedure including an audit, formal notice, appeals, and litigation. Statutory safeguards, such as IRC § 7217 and a 1998 anti-targeting law, are intended to prevent direct presidential direction or politically motivated targeting. The IRS is also reportedly experiencing significant internal challenges, including leadership turnover with three acting directors in one week and workforce reductions. Despite these procedural hurdles, multiple news outlets have reported the Trump administration has formally asked the IRS to begin revocation proceedings and that the agency is 'making plans' to rescind Harvard’s exemption.",

    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Approximately 67 days (from April 25, 2025 to July 1, 2025)",
    "status_quo_outcome": "Harvard retains its 501(c)(3) tax-exempt status",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "The IRS follows standard procedures for reviewing tax-exempt status, which involve extensive audits, formal notice requirements, appeals processes, and potential years of litigation. Despite political pressure from the Trump administration, institutional safeguards, legal constraints, and the complexity of the revocation process prevent any final determination before July 1, 2025. Harvard's lawsuit further delays any action through court injunctions.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "The Trump administration successfully pressures the IRS to use unprecedented emergency procedures or expedited processes to revoke Harvard's tax-exempt status. The IRS leadership complies despite internal chaos and legal safeguards, issuing a formal revocation order. Courts either allow the action to proceed or do not intervene quickly enough to prevent the revocation before July 1, 2025.",
    "rationale": "The base rate strongly favors Harvard retaining its status. No major university has lost 501(c)(3) status in recent decades, and the legal precedent (Bob Jones University) took over 7 years. The normal IRS revocation process involves multiple steps: audits, formal notices, appeals, and litigation, with statutory safeguards like IRC § 7217 designed to prevent politically motivated targeting. Historical patterns suggest institutional and legal inertia will prevent rapid action.\n\nHowever, several factors create non-negligible risk: (1) Reports indicate the Trump administration has formally requested IRS action and the agency is 'making plans,' (2) The administration has already taken aggressive steps (freezing $2.2 billion in funding), (3) The IRS is experiencing internal turmoil with leadership chaos, potentially making it more susceptible to political pressure, (4) Unprecedented political circumstances could theoretically lead to unprecedented administrative actions.\n\nThe critical constraint is time: only 67 days remain until resolution. Even with maximum political pressure and expedited procedures, revoking a major university's tax-exempt status in roughly two months would be historically unprecedented and legally complex. Harvard's lawsuit adds another layer of delay.\n\nMy forecast is not higher because: the timeframe is extraordinarily compressed, legal safeguards are robust, courts would likely intervene, and no mechanism exists for such rapid revocation. My forecast is not lower because: the administration has demonstrated willingness to push boundaries, there is evidence of actual planning at the IRS, and some probability of extraordinary executive action exists.\n\nI would update higher if: credible reporting emerged of specific imminent revocation orders, evidence of expedited procedures being implemented, or court rulings allowing fast-tracking. I would update lower if: courts issued injunctions, more time passed without concrete action, or clear evidence emerged that normal procedures would be followed.",
