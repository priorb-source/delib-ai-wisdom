    "review": "The other forecasters raise compelling arguments I hadn't fully weighted. Forecaster 2's point about Dodik's historical pattern of using secessionist rhetoric without follow-through is particularly important - this is a repeated behavior pattern that should inform our baseline expectations. Both forecasters emphasize the lack of visible referendum logistics (polling stations, materials, committees) despite legislative groundwork, which is a concrete indicator worth more weight. Forecaster 3's emphasis on the gap between threats and actual announcement resonates - the status quo of 'threatening without announcing' has persisted through multiple escalation cycles. All three of us converge on similar reasoning but weight factors differently, with forecasts clustering 18-30%.",
    "rationale": "Upon reflection, I was likely overweighting recent escalation momentum and underweighting Dodik's established pattern of brinkmanship-for-leverage. The constitutional draft and legislative actions are real, but they represent preparation rather than commitment to announce. Key insight: even the most aggressive recent step (January 9 parade) was defying a court ruling, not announcing a referendum - there's still a significant gap to cross. The lack of any visible referendum logistics (no committees announced, no polling preparations, no voter registration drives) is telling with only 60 days remaining. However, I don't update dramatically lower because: (1) this cycle does appear more escalated than previous ones with concrete legislative steps, (2) the April completion of constitutional consultation is very recent, (3) the Crimea precedent shows rapid organization is theoretically possible, and (4) the conditional nature of threats means a triggering event from central authorities could accelerate action. Balancing Dodik's historical pattern against current escalation level, I'm adjusting down to 25% - acknowledging valid concerns about status quo bias while recognizing this situation's genuine escalation beyond previous cycles.",
