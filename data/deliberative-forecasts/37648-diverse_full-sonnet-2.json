    "review": "Forecaster 2 and 3 offer contrasting perspectives that help clarify the key uncertainties. Forecaster 2's 65% weighs heavily on negotiation momentum and Israeli intelligence, interpreting 'convergence' optimistically as indicating imminent breakthrough. However, this seems to underweight the fundamental incompatibility between US demands (complete removal/dismantling) and Iran's explicit red line (maintaining civilian program). The continued US sanctions during talks particularly undermine the optimistic reading. Forecaster 3's 24% is very close to my 28% and uses similar analytical framework, but makes an important point I underweighted: the resolution criteria only requires 'an agreement with respect to Iran's nuclear program,' which could include an interim or framework deal rather than comprehensive agreement. This lowers the bar meaningfully. Both forecasters note the Israeli intelligence report, though as Forecaster 3 implies, such assessments can be speculative. The negotiation velocity (4 rounds in 6 weeks) is noteworthy, but 'constructive' diplomatic language is standard even when gaps remain wide. Forecaster 2's update conditions (draft text, breakthrough announcements) and Forecaster 3's conditions (IAEA engagement, sanctions softening) are both reasonable markers.",
    "rationale": "After reviewing both analyses, I should update modestly upward from my initial 28%. Forecaster 3's observation about the resolution criteria is important - an interim framework or limited agreement would qualify, not just a comprehensive deal like JCPOA. This meaningfully raises the probability. The sheer velocity of talks (4 rounds since April, 5th scheduled) does indicate more momentum than typical diplomatic theater. However, I remain skeptical of Forecaster 2's 65% for several reasons: (1) the fundamental gap between 'complete dismantlement' and 'red line against dismantlement' represents a chasm requiring major political concessions from one or both sides, (2) the US imposing new sanctions during negotiations suggests continued hardline posture, not imminent compromise, (3) compressed timeframe of 1.5 months is extraordinarily tight for resolving verification mechanisms and sanctions relief schedules even for an interim deal, (4) historical precedent shows Iran nuclear negotiations typically take years. The Israeli intelligence assessment is notable but represents one data point that could reflect speculation or deliberate signaling. My updated forecast balances the genuine momentum and possibility of framework agreement against the severe structural obstacles and tight timeline.",
