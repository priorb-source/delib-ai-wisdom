  "information": "In April 2025, China conducted the \"Strait Thunder-2025A\" military exercises, which involved dozens of aircraft and warships. According to a spokesperson for the Chinese Eastern Theater Command, the operation aimed to test China's capabilities in \"controlling zones\" and \"blockading\" Taiwan, and included simulations of \"strikes on key ports and energy infrastructure.\" Following these and other drills, US military officials, including US Pacific Army Commander Ronald P. Clark and US Indo-Pacific Command Commander Admiral Samuel Paparo, stated that China's exercises simulating a blockade of Taiwan have become a \"regular occurrence\" and that Beijing is rehearsing the \"full spectrum of military operations.\"\n\nIn response to China's military exercises around Taiwan, the US has used terms such as \"intimidation tactics,\" \"provocative,\" \"coercive military activities,\" and \"aggressive military activities.\" In April 2025, the US Department of State accused China of \"putting regional security at risk\" with its drills. To date, US government statements have not officially characterized China's actions as a \"blockade.\" Historically, even during the 1995-1996 Taiwan Strait Crisis, the US did not formally accuse China of a blockade. Diplomatic talks between the US and China were held in Shanghai in April 2025.\n\nAccording to US military leaders, the upcoming 2025 National Defense Strategy (NDS) will prioritize \"preventing a Chinese attack on Taiwan\" as the sole major assumption scenario. This represents a strategic shift to focus on the Indo-Pacific region. At the same time, US Admiral Samuel Paparo has warned that China is rapidly increasing its production of warships and submarines relative to the US, stating a production ratio of 6 to 1.8 for warships and 2 to 1.4 for submarines. Paparo stated that while the US would prevail in a conflict now, its military forces are on a \"bad trajectory.\"",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Approximately 56 days (until July 1, 2025)",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No - the US continues to condemn China's military exercises around Taiwan using strong diplomatic language but does not formally accuse China of blockading Taiwan",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "China continues conducting military exercises and drills that simulate blockades, but stops short of actually preventing ships from accessing Taiwan's ports. The US maintains its current diplomatic posture of condemning these activities as 'provocative' and 'coercive' without crossing the threshold of formally declaring them a blockade. Diplomatic channels remain open, and both sides avoid a major escalation.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "China escalates beyond exercises to actually prevent commercial or military vessels from entering or leaving one or more of Taiwan's seaports. The US government, viewing this as an unacceptable act of aggression and a violation of international norms, issues a formal public statement explicitly accusing China of blockading Taiwan. This could occur due to miscalculation, deliberate Chinese escalation, or in response to some triggering event in cross-strait relations.",
    "rationale": "Several factors strongly favor a NO resolution. First, historical precedent is critical: even during the 1995-1996 Taiwan Strait Crisis, the US did not formally accuse China of blockading Taiwan. This suggests a high bar for using such language. Second, 'blockade' carries enormous legal and military weight under international law - it's essentially an act of war. The US would be extremely cautious about using this term as it could trigger obligations and escalate tensions dramatically. Third, current US statements about China's April 2025 exercises, while critical, deliberately avoid 'blockade' terminology despite those exercises explicitly simulating blockades. The US has used terms like 'intimidation tactics,' 'provocative,' and 'coercive,' but has stopped short of the formal accusation this question requires. Fourth, diplomatic talks occurred in Shanghai in April 2025, indicating maintained communication channels. The principle that the world changes slowly most of the time strongly favors status quo continuation over major escalation within just 8 weeks. However, several factors prevent an extremely low probability. China's military exercises are becoming more frequent and aggressive, explicitly simulating blockades. US military leaders acknowledge China is rehearsing the 'full spectrum of military operations.' The 2025 NDS will prioritize preventing a Chinese attack on Taiwan. Regional tensions remain elevated, and there's always tail risk of miscalculation or deliberate escalation. For me to update higher, I would need evidence of: actual prevention of ships accessing Taiwan ports (not just exercises), a major diplomatic crisis, or intelligence suggesting imminent Chinese action. For me to update lower: sustained de-escalation, increased diplomatic engagement, or Chinese pullback from military activities. With only 8 weeks remaining and the high bar historically set for using 'blockade' language, combined with the status quo bias principle, this remains a low but not negligible probability event.",
