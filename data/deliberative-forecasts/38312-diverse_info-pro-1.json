    "review": "The other forecasters' analyses were highly convincing and highlighted a critical factor I had severely underestimated: the extremely short timeline. Their core argument, that the lack of an invitation by June 3rd for a mid-June summit is almost determinative, is very strong. The logistical and security preparations for such a visit take weeks, not days. The new information that other non-G7 countries like Australia have already been invited transforms the situation from a potential delay into a probable, deliberate exclusion. Forecaster 3's point about specific domestic lobbying efforts against the invitation in Canada further solidifies the political difficulty for the host nation. Their focus on these practical, near-term facts decisively outweighs my initial, more theoretical reasoning about long-term strategic imperatives.",
    "rationale": "I am making a significant update to my forecast, lowering it from 65% to 12%. My initial forecast was fundamentally flawed because it over-weighted the strategic reasons for India's inclusion and underestimated the powerful constraints of logistics, timing, and current bilateral politics. The arguments from the other forecasters convinced me that the absence of an invitation just weeks before the summit is the most important piece of evidence. It is a strong signal that a decision to exclude India has likely already been made. For a 'Yes' outcome, Canada would need to make a rapid political reversal, issue a last-minute invitation, and both sides would have to compress weeks of logistical and security planning into a few days. This chain of events is highly improbable. My new forecast of 12% reflects the overwhelming evidence presented by the other analysts that points towards a 'No' outcome, while leaving a small possibility for a surprise diplomatic breakthrough.",
