  "information": "On the continental level, the AfCFTA has achieved 92% consensus on trade rules, with 49 of 54 African countries having joined the agreement. To support implementation, initiatives such as the Pan-African Payment and Settlement System (PAPSS) have been introduced. Within South Sudan, both the Chamber of Commerce and the Ministry of Trade have publicly advocated for ratification, with the Trade Minister reaffirming the government's commitment at an April 2025 summit. In February 2025, the East African Community (EAC) launched a new trade committee in South Sudan to help harmonize standards with the AfCFTA framework.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "About 60 days (until July 1, 2025)",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No – South Sudan has not yet ratified and, absent a push, tends to move slowly on such measures.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Parliament does not prioritize the ratification bill amid economic and political pressures (e.g., oil revenue crisis, electoral timetable, security issues), or passes it late and the instrument of ratification is not deposited with the African Union Commission before July 1.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "The executive fast-tracks a ratification bill, parliament approves it in May/June, and the government promptly deposits the instrument of ratification with the AU Commission before July 1—possibly spurred by EAC support, business lobbying, and an upcoming continental/regional milestone.",
    "rationale": "- Time horizon and status quo: With ~60 days left, the default is inertia. South Sudan has historically moved slowly on treaty ratifications, and ratification is only complete once the instrument is deposited with the AU Commission, which adds procedural steps beyond a parliamentary vote.\n- Signals pushing toward Yes: According to the assistant’s report, domestic stakeholders (Chamber of Commerce) and the Ministry of Trade have publicly advocated ratification, and the Trade Minister reaffirmed commitment in April 2025. The EAC’s February 2025 launch of a trade committee in South Sudan to harmonize standards with AfCFTA could lower technical barriers. Continental momentum remains strong (broad rules convergence; infrastructure like PAPSS), which can create political incentives to join sooner.\n- Signals pushing toward No: The short window, competing priorities (economic strain from oil disruptions, governance challenges), and capacity constraints make quick legislative action and timely deposit uncertain. Remaining non-ratifiers tend to be the harder cases; base rates for a holdout completing ratification within a two‑month window are modest.\n- Why not higher: No public evidence (yet) of a ratification bill tabled, scheduled for debate, or passed; no cabinet communiqué indicating imminent action; and administrative follow‑through to deposit can slip timelines.\n- Why not lower: Clear political signaling in April 2025, active private‑sector advocacy, and EAC technical engagement increase the chance of a fast‑track if the leadership decides to prioritize it. Ratifications can sometimes be executed swiftly once politically green‑lit.\n- What would move the forecast up: Official notice that the cabinet has approved the ratification, a bill tabled with an expedited timetable, reports of parliamentary passage, or confirmation of deposit to the AU. Any linkage to an AU/EAC deadline or financing conditionality would also raise odds.\n- What would move the forecast down: Signs of parliamentary recess or diversion to urgent crises, credible reporting of delays in preparing schedules/rules of origin commitments, or government statements deprioritizing the file.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill South Sudan ratify AfCFTA (the pan-African free trade agreement) before July 1, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nThe Star Worldwide via MSN: [World Chambers Africa Summit maps economic path for South Sudan](https://www.msn.com/en-xl/africa/other/world-chambers-africa-summit-maps-economic-path-for-south-sudan/ar-AA1CTigs?ocid=BingNewsVerp)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if South Sudan ratifies the African Continental Free Trade Area (AfCFTA) Agreement before July 1, 2025.\n\n\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nOn the continental level, the AfCFTA has achieved 92% consensus on trade rules, with 49 of 54 African countries having joined the agreement.

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
