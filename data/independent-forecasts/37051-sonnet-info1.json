  "information": "The Trump administration has threatened to revoke Harvard University's 501(c)(3) status, citing the university's DEI programs, alleged anti-Semitism, and refusal to comply with demands for reforms to governance and leadership. The administration has frozen $2.2 billion in federal funding and $60 million in contracts intended for the university. In response, Harvard has filed a lawsuit against the administration, arguing that its actions are arbitrary, capricious, and outside the scope of its legal authority. The university has rejected the administration's demands, with its spokesperson stating there is 'no legal basis for revoking the University's exemption.'",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Approximately 67 days (from April 25, 2025 to July 1, 2025)",
    "status_quo_outcome": "Harvard maintains its 501(c)(3) tax-exempt status, as it has held this status continuously throughout its history",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Harvard's lawsuit successfully delays or prevents any revocation action. The IRS follows standard procedures which typically take many months to years, extending beyond the July 1 deadline. Courts may issue injunctions blocking revocation attempts. The bureaucratic and legal processes involved in revoking tax-exempt status from a major institution prove too complex to complete in the remaining 67 days.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "The Trump administration expedites IRS revocation proceedings through executive pressure. The IRS issues a determination letter revoking Harvard's 501(c)(3) status before July 1. Harvard's legal challenges fail to obtain injunctive relief or are resolved against the university within the short timeframe. Unprecedented political pressure overcomes normal bureaucratic and legal obstacles.",
    "rationale": "The base rate strongly favors No: major universities losing 501(c)(3) status is extraordinarily rare, possibly unprecedented for an institution of Harvard's stature. The IRS revocation process typically involves formal notices, opportunities to respond, appeals procedures, and significant documentation - processes that normally take months to years, not weeks.\n\nKey factors supporting a low probability:\n\n1. **Timeframe constraint**: Only 67 days remain, which is exceptionally short for such a complex administrative and legal action\n\n2. **Active legal resistance**: Harvard has already filed suit claiming the administration's actions are arbitrary and capricious, which could result in injunctions or delays\n\n3. **Procedural requirements**: IRS revocation requires following established administrative procedures, even under political pressure\n\n4. **No evidence of initiated proceedings**: The research indicates threats and funding freezes, but no reporting of actual IRS revocation proceedings having begun\n\nThe probability is not lower because: The Trump administration has demonstrated willingness to take aggressive executive actions, has frozen billions in funding, and made explicit public threats. There is clear political will and motivation.\n\nThe probability is not higher because: The combination of the short timeframe, legal obstacles, bureaucratic procedures, and unprecedented nature of such action against a major university makes rapid completion highly unlikely. Legal challenges alone would typically extend beyond 67 days.\n\nTo update higher, I would need: Evidence that formal IRS revocation proceedings have begun, court rulings favoring the administration, or clear precedent for expedited revocations. To update lower: Court injunctions issued, definitive legal expert analysis ruling out the possibility in this timeframe, or IRS statements indicating they will not proceed.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill Harvard University lose its tax exempt status before July 1, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nNew York Times: [Trump Threatens Harvard’s Tax Status, Escalating Billion-Dollar Pressure Campaign](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/15/us/politics/trump-harvard-tax-status.html)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if, at any time before July 1, 2025, Harvard loses its [501(c)(3) status](https://oc.finance.harvard.edu/faq/harvard-university-tax-exempt-organization).\n\nIf there is no credible reporting that Harvard has lost its 501(c)(3) status with the Internal Revenue Service before July 1, 2025, this question resolves as No.\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nThe Trump administration has threatened to revoke Harvard University's 501(c)(3) status, citing the university's DEI programs, alleged anti-Semitism, and refusal to comply with demands for reforms to governance and leadership.

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
