    "review": "Both forecasters emphasize the short-horizon variance (about 20–25 games left before June 15), the presence of a small cluster of very weak teams, and the importance of whether ties count. They also add a useful nuance about “on or after June 15” introducing a bit of timing randomness. None of this provides new hard data, but it highlights that, absent current standings, an equal-share among a 4–6 team cellar cluster is a reasonable baseline. Their conditional thresholds (e.g., jump to ~45–60% if already ≥2 games worst) are sensible. I find their reasoning largely convincing and it suggests my initial 13% was too conservative given tie-counting and the small competing set.",
    "rationale": "We are ~27 days out; most teams will play ~23–27 games in that window. True-talent priors place Colorado in the bottom tier but not uniquely worst. The likely competitor set (e.g., White Sox, A’s, Marlins, Angels, Nationals) yields roughly 4–6 plausible candidates. Over a short span, 2–3 wins often separate the bottom teams, and ties for worst W% are common; if ties count (as the wording implies), that boosts the chance. The NL West strength slightly nudges Colorado downward in the standings, and Coors volatility can produce brief skids. Without current standings to condition on, a reasonable prior for a bottom-tier team among ~5 peers to be at/ tied for the worst on that snapshot date is around the high teens to mid-20s. I’m increasing my estimate from 13% to 20% to reflect that equal-share logic over a short horizon and tie-counting. If we later learn they’re already worst by ≥2 games, I’d move to ~50%; if they’re 2+ games better than the current worst, I’d drop to ~10–12%. If ties did not count, I’d trim ~2–3 points.",
