    "rationale": "My forecast is primarily based on the strong, recent signal of intent from the May 15, 2025 Politico article, where John Morgan detailed a 'campaign blueprint.' This is not a passive consideration; it's an active step towards a campaign launch, indicating he is very serious about running. Such a public move creates momentum and expectation that often leads to a formal announcement. The status quo is that he has not yet announced, which provides a strong prior for a 'No' outcome, but Morgan's actions represent a significant deviation from that baseline. The probability is not higher because the deadline is very short—less than a month remains. Political announcements can be delayed for strategic reasons, or Morgan could still get cold feet after final polling or fundraising assessments. There are no confirmed reports of a specific announcement date or the hiring of a full campaign team, which introduces significant uncertainty. The probability is not lower because detailing a campaign blueprint to a national political outlet like Politico is a very substantial and deliberate action. It's a strong signal meant to test the waters and prepare the ground for an imminent launch. For my forecast to increase, I would need to see leaks of a specific announcement date or reports of key campaign staff being hired. For my forecast to decrease, I would need to see Morgan publicly downplaying his interest or the deadline approaching with no further signals of an impending announcement.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill John Morgan announce his candidacy for Florida governor before July 1, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nPolitico: [John Morgan lays out campaign blueprint for possible Florida governor run](https://www.politico.com/news/2025/05/15/john-morgan-florida-governor-run-00351005)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if John Morgan announces his candidacy for governor of Florida before July 1, 2025. If no such announcement has been made before that date, the question resolves as **No**.\n\n\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nNo additional information available.\n\nToday is 2025-06-06.\n\nBefore answering you think:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n(e) You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
