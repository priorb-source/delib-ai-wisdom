  "information": "The adoption of the name 'Gulf of America' has varied among non-governmental entities. Google updated its Maps service to display 'Gulf of America' for users in the United States, while in other regions, both names are sometimes used. As of late January 2025, other major map publishers like National Geographic and Apple had not made the change. The renaming has generated international controversy, with Mexican officials, including President Claudia Sheinbaum, protesting the unilateral change. The International Hydrographic Organization, which works to standardize the names of bodies of water, has not officially recognized the new name.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Approximately 54 days (from May 8, 2025 to July 1, 2025)",
    "status_quo_outcome": "NO - WorldAtlas.com continues to display 'Gulf of Mexico' on their North America page",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "WorldAtlas.com maintains their current nomenclature on the North America page, following the approach of major cartographic organizations like National Geographic and Apple who have not adopted the 'Gulf of America' naming despite Google's change. They may wait for official international recognition from bodies like the International Hydrographic Organization before updating their main geographic pages.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "WorldAtlas.com updates their North America page to display 'Gulf of America' (alone or alongside 'Gulf of Mexico'), following Google Maps' lead. As a commercial website focused on popular geography content, they may prioritize reflecting current US governmental usage and capturing search traffic related to the naming controversy over waiting for international consensus.",
    "rationale": "This forecast requires weighing several competing factors with about 54 days remaining until resolution. The most significant piece of evidence is that WorldAtlas has already updated their dedicated Gulf article title to 'Gulf Of Mexico (Gulf of America)', demonstrating awareness of and some willingness to acknowledge the naming change. This is a moderately strong signal that they're not categorically opposed to using the new name. However, this is distinct from their North America overview page, which serves as a more authoritative reference map and may be treated more conservatively. The research assistant's report reveals a split among major entities: Google has adopted the change for US users, while National Geographic and Apple have not. The lack of International Hydrographic Organization recognition and Mexican government opposition suggest many organizations are waiting for clearer international consensus. WorldAtlas is a commercial educational website rather than an authoritative cartographic body, which could make them more willing to update quickly for relevance and SEO purposes, but also less motivated to take a controversial position. The status quo bias is strong - most things don't change, especially in cartography where stability is valued. With about 7-8 weeks remaining, there is sufficient time for a website update, but no clear catalyst or deadline pressure that would force the change. My forecast would be higher (40-50%) if WorldAtlas had a history of quickly adopting controversial naming changes, or if more major organizations had already switched. It would be lower (10-15%) if they hadn't already acknowledged the new name in their article title, or if we had less time remaining. I would update upward if other major map publishers announce changes in the coming weeks, or if there's evidence of WorldAtlas updating other geographic pages. I would update downward if National Geographic or other authoritative sources explicitly announce they're maintaining 'Gulf of Mexico'.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill WorldAtlas.com display the body of water northwest of the Caribbean Sea as the Gulf of America before July 1, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nWorld Atlas article: [Gulf Of Mexico (Gulf of America)](https://www.worldatlas.com/gulfs/gulf-of-mexico.html)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if, before July 1, 2025, the World Atlas website at its [North America](https://www.worldatlas.com/webimage/countrys/na.htm) page displays the body of water west of Florida, south of Louisiana and north of the Yucatán Peninsula as the Gulf of America. (At the time of this question, the name displayed is the Gulf of Mexico.)\n\nIn case both names are used, for example \"Gulf of America formerly known as Gulf of Mexico,\" this question resolves as Yes. Note that verification will be from Metaculus admins accessing the webpage from the United States and that therefore resolution will be based on how the page appears when accessed from that location.\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nThe adoption of the name 'Gulf of America' has varied among non-governmental entities.

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
