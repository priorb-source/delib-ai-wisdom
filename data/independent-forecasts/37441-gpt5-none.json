    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Approximately 56 days. The qualifying window is May 12–June 30, 2025, with resolution known by July 1, 2025.",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "EUR/USD trades in its recent ranges (roughly 1.05–1.15), the Fed stays relatively firm versus the ECB, European growth/data remain soft, and no extreme USD-negative shock occurs. Even intraday highs on Yahoo Finance do not reach EUR/USD > 1.25 (which would be needed for USD < 0.80 EUR).",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "A sharp USD selloff within weeks: e.g., a US-specific shock (debt ceiling/default scare, major negative US data, banking stress), an emergency Fed pivot/cut while the ECB turns more hawkish or less dovish, or a geopolitical/tariff episode that uniquely undermines the dollar. EUR/USD spikes above 1.25 at least intraday (captured in Yahoo’s High), making USD < 0.80 EUR sometime between May 12 and June 30.",
    "rationale": "Translation of the threshold: USD < 0.80 EUR implies EUR/USD > 1.25 (since USD/EUR = 1/(EUR/USD)). On Yahoo Finance (EUR=X), achieving this likely means at least the daily High exceeding 1.25 during the window. Context and base rates: Since 2014, EUR/USD has very rarely exceeded 1.25; the last brief touch was around early 2018. In 2020–2024, EUR/USD mostly ranged ~1.05–1.23, with peaks near 1.23 in early 2021. Reaching >1.25 within a ~7-week window would require an unusually large move. Volatility framing: With typical 6–12% annualized EUR/USD vol, a 6–8 week one-sigma move is only a few percent. From a plausible starting area (≈1.08–1.12), getting to >1.25 requires roughly an 8–15% appreciation in EUR/USD—several standard deviations in a short period, unless volatility explodes due to a shock. Macro setup: As of early 2025, the Fed has generally been more constrained to keep policy tighter relative to the ECB (which has been earlier to ease), a configuration that does not favor a rapid EUR surge. While the Morningstar note mentions tariff turmoil and USD weakness, reaching 1.25 is still a high bar. Event risks that could push probability up include a US debt ceiling standoff (the 2023 suspension expired in early 2025), an abrupt Fed pivot driven by a sharp growth shock, or an ECB surprise hawkish stance. The question’s “any point” criterion and the possibility that Yahoo’s High/Low could be used mean even a brief spike would count, which slightly raises the tail probability relative to a close-only check. Research assistant input: No additional information was provided; the forecast relies on historical ranges, macro priors, and tail-risk assessment. Why not higher: The 1.25 threshold is historically rare post-2014, the time window is short, and absent a clear imminent catalyst, such a move would be a multi-sigma event. Why not lower: Tail scenarios (US-specific shock, debt ceiling/default fears, emergency Fed easing, or ECB hawkish surprise) could produce a brief break above 1.25, and the resolution likely accepts intraday highs. What would move me up: EUR/USD breaking above ~1.18–1.20 soon; clear signs of an emergency Fed pivot; acute US-specific political/credit stress; ECB guidance turning decisively more hawkish than the Fed. What would move me down: EUR/USD remaining ≤1.12 into late May; hawkish Fed rhetoric or upside US inflation; weak Eurozone data/ECB dovishness; global risk-off that supports the USD.",
