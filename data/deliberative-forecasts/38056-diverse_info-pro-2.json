    "review": "I have reviewed the analyses from two other forecasters. Forecaster 2's analysis is excellent and aligns closely with my own, but adds a critical new piece of information: a replacement fighter, Brendson Ribeiro, has officially been signed to fight Azamat Murzakanov. This strengthens the case for a 'No' resolution significantly, as the UFC has contractually and promotionally moved on from the original bout. Their reasoning is sound and fact-based. Forecaster 3's analysis appears to be critically flawed. It completely ignores the research assistant's report stating Johnny Walker has withdrawn from the fight. Their entire forecast is based on a fight that is not happening, making their 32% probability and associated competitive analysis irrelevant to the question as it stands. Their analysis is unconvincing and has been disregarded.",
    "rationale": "My initial forecast of 1% was based on the high-confidence reports of Johnny Walker's withdrawal due to injury. The resolution criteria are explicit: if Walker does not fight Murzakanov at UFC 316, the question resolves to No. The deliberation has reinforced my initial assessment. Forecaster 2 provided new, dispositive evidence that a replacement opponent, Brendson Ribeiro, has been officially signed. This moves the status of the fight from 'cancelled' to 'replaced'. The UFC has taken formal, contractual steps to move on, making a reversal where Walker is re-instated into this specific fight at this event infinitesimally small. I am therefore not changing my forecast. The 1% I originally assigned already represents a minimum probability for a highly improbable, 'black swan' event, such as Ribeiro pulling out, Walker being miraculously cleared on the same day, and the UFC scrambling to re-book the original fight. Given the new evidence, this 1% now seems generous, but serves as a reasonable floor for an event that is not logically or physically impossible, merely organizationally unprecedented and extraordinarily unlikely. Forecaster 3's analysis was not considered as it was predicated on a false assumption that the fight was still scheduled.",
