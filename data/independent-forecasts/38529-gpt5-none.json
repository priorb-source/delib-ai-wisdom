    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Roughly 2–4 weeks (primary is June 24, 2025; a presumptive nominee could be called on election night or after RCV/absentee tabulation in the following 1–2 weeks).",
    "status_quo_outcome": "Cuomo narrowly wins a competitive primary under ranked-choice voting.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Progressives consolidate behind Zohran Mamdani, he performs strongly in later RCV rounds as transfers flow to him from eliminated progressive/liberal candidates, and he overtakes Cuomo in the final round. Alternatively, a late-breaking controversy or residency/ballot issue dents Cuomo’s support enough for another candidate to edge him.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Cuomo holds a first-round lead, proves sufficiently acceptable to moderate and outer-borough voters to pick up enough second-choice support from eliminated moderates/centrists, and credible outlets call him the presumptive nominee within days of the primary.",
    "rationale": "- State of race and inertia: With about two weeks to go, available signals (including the referenced article headline) imply Cuomo has been leading but with a tightening margin as Mamdani gains. In short time windows, the status quo tends to persist; a narrow leader often remains a slight favorite, though RCV introduces additional uncertainty.\n- Cuomo’s advantages: Very high name recognition, a likely fundraising/communications edge, and potential consolidation of the moderate lane—especially if the current mayor is weakened or absent from contention. Concern about crime/migrant issues could sustain demand for a centrist, law-and-order profile.\n- Cuomo’s liabilities: He is polarizing and may be disadvantaged on second-choice transfers in RCV. Many NYC Democratic actors and unions have had strained relations with him; elite and labor endorsements could be tepid. A motivated progressive base and coordinated ranking could enable Mamdani to surge in later rounds. NYC’s matching-funds system may also blunt any raw cash advantage.\n- Polling/RCV dynamics: A narrowing lead suggests a competitive race where RCV transfers and turnout composition matter. If Mamdani is the clear progressive standard-bearer and others in that lane underperform, transfers could coalesce to him. Conversely, if moderates coalesce around Cuomo and other moderates’ voters rank him second, he can win.\n- Why not higher: Cuomo’s polarizing brand and likely weak transferability under RCV, potential union and organizational deficits, and the possibility of progressive consolidation make an outright win far from assured.\n- Why not lower: He appears to be the frontrunner in recent polling, has unmatched name recognition, and benefits from potential moderate consolidation and media presence. With limited time left, large opinion shifts are less likely absent shocks.\n- What would move me up: High-quality polls with RCV simulations showing Cuomo winning final rounds; major union/machine endorsements (e.g., 1199SEIU, DC37, UFT) breaking clearly for Cuomo; evidence of fragmented progressive field without consolidation; turnout indicators skewing older/moderate.\n- What would move me down: Credible polling showing Mamdani leading in head-to-head RCV finals; clear, broad progressive consolidation and endorsements; a late damaging story or legal/ballot complication for Cuomo; signs of high progressive turnout and weak moderate enthusiasm.\n- Research assistant: No additional info provided; forecast relies on general electoral dynamics, the linked headline indicating a narrowing lead, and known features of NYC RCV primaries.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill Andrew Cuomo win the 2025 Democratic primary for New York City mayor?\n\nQuestion background:\n[Cuomo’s lead narrows as Mamdani gains ground in NYC mayoral race: poll](https://pix11.com/news/politics/cuomos-lead-narrows-as-mamdani-gains-ground-in-nyc-mayor-race/)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if Andrew Cuomo is the presumptive Democratic nominee for Mayor of New York City after the primary is held on June 24, 2025, according to [credible sources](https://www.metaculus.com/faq/#definitions).\n\nIf by the end of this tournament's scoring no presumptive nominee has been called (for example because there are not yet conclusive results from the vote counting), this question will be annulled.\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nNo additional information available.\n\nToday is 2025-06-09.\n\nBefore answering you think:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n(e) You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
