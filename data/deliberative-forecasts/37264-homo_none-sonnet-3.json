    "review": "Both forecasters make compelling arguments that I had underweighted in my initial analysis. Forecaster 2's point about Mali and Burkina Faso having Level 4 advisories while Niger appears more stable provides valuable comparative context. Both emphasize that nearly 2 years have passed since the July 2023 coup - if conditions truly warranted Level 4, the upgrade likely would have occurred already. This is a strong temporal argument I hadn't fully appreciated. They also both specify more clearly than I did that Level 4 is reserved for the most extreme situations (active warfare, complete state collapse, imminent danger to all Americans), not merely serious security concerns. The convergence of their forecasts at 18-20% versus my 25% suggests I was overweighting the probability of change and underweighting status quo bias given the very short 2-month timeframe.",
    "rationale": "After reviewing the other forecasters' analyses, I am updating my forecast downward from 25% to 20%. The key factors driving this update are: (1) The extremely high bar for Level 4 advisories - they require catastrophic situations beyond the serious-but-manageable security challenges Niger currently faces; (2) The temporal argument that 2 years post-coup without an upgrade to Level 4 is evidence against it happening now in a 2-month window; (3) Stronger weighting of status quo bias - travel advisories are indeed 'sticky' and rarely change without major triggering events; (4) The comparative context that neighboring countries with Level 4 status appear less stable than Niger. However, I'm not going lower than 20% because: Niger does face genuine security risks in the volatile Sahel region, unexpected escalation remains possible though unlikely, and the probability is not negligible. My updated forecast of 20% reflects strong status quo bias as the dominant factor while acknowledging some residual risk of dramatic escalation.",
