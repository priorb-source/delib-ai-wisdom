  "information": "The international community has widely condemned the dissolution of political parties in Mali. The UN High Commissioner for Human Rights, Volker Türk, publicly called on the Malian authorities to reverse the decision. Both Amnesty International and the United Nations have characterized the junta's actions as an attack on freedom of expression and association. The African Union (AU) has been called upon to mediate and support dialogue to restore democratic processes, in line with the African Charter on Democracy, Elections and Governance. This international pressure comes after Mali previously announced its withdrawal from the regional bloc ECOWAS.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "About 40 days (until July 1, 2025)",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No — the May 13 decree remains in force; parties stay dissolved and new parties are not generally allowed to form.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "The junta maintains the dissolution on security/stability grounds, brushes off international criticism, and faces no decisive domestic pressure or legal compulsion before July 1.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Under mounting domestic unrest, elite splits, or to secure aid/legitimacy, the authorities announce a reinstatement of political parties and allow new ones to form (possibly via a transitional roadmap or a court/mediation outcome).",
    "rationale": "Time is short and the regime’s revealed preferences point toward entrenchment, not liberalization. Mali’s junta has repeatedly delayed a transition, earlier suspended party activity (2024) without reversal, and has insulated itself from regional leverage by withdrawing from ECOWAS and aligning more closely with non-Western partners. Reversing a fresh, high‑salience decree within weeks would signal weakness and risk opposition mobilization, which the junta likely wants to avoid. International condemnation (UN, Amnesty) and AU exhortations matter reputationally but carry limited coercive power right now; UNSC action is unlikely given geopolitical splits, and AU tools have had modest bite. That makes a rapid policy U‑turn improbable absent acute internal pressures. Still, I leave a small probability for a tactical concession: significant domestic protests/strikes, a negotiated roadmap to elections brokered by the AU or influential mediators, a court ruling the junta chooses to respect, or a material need to unlock financial support could prompt a partial climbdown that broadly re‑legalizes parties. Why not higher: weak external leverage, regime security logic, and past behavior favor continuity. Why not lower: short‑term tactical reversals do occur under pressure, and an unexpected elite split or economic shock could create incentives to restore parties quickly. Upward update triggers: credible reports of negotiations on a political opening, release of political detainees, signals from Goïta about a near‑term transition timetable, or a high‑impact domestic protest wave. Downward update triggers: intensified repression (arrests/NGO bans), legal entrenchment of the dissolution, or moves further distancing from AU mediation.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nBefore July 1, 2025, will the government of Mali reverse its decision to dissolve all political parties?\n\nQuestion background:\n[Mali's Military Government Shuts Down All Political Parties](https://www.legit.ng/world/africa/1654992-malis-military-government-shuts-political-parties/)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if the government of Mali announces a reversal of its May 13, 2025 presidential decree dissolving all political parties in the country.\n\nA partial reversal, such as allowing the reinstatement of a limited number of parties, will only count as long as new parties are generally allowed to be formed again.\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nThe international community has widely condemned the dissolution of political parties in Mali. The UN High Commissioner for Human Rights, Volker Türk, publicly called on the Malian authorities to reverse the decision.

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
