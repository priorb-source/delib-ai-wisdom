  "information": "According to a June 11, 2025 snapshot, Google’s Gemini-2.5-Pro model ranked first on the Chatbot Arena leaderboard with an Elo score of 1478, while OpenAI’s best model was 53 points behind. The competitive landscape in early 2025 has been characterized by a narrowing gap between top models; the Elo score difference between the top-ranked and 10th-ranked model decreased from 11.9% in 2024 to 5.4% in early 2025. Previous leaderboard leaders in 2025 have included Grok-3 by xAI, which held the top spot in February.\n\nIn mid-June 2025, OpenAI released a new model, o3-pro, which is focused on high-performance reasoning and is available to paid users. The company has delayed the release of its first open-weights model until later in the summer, and reports indicate a potential GPT-5 release is delayed until July 2025. On June 10-11, OpenAI's services, including ChatGPT, experienced a global outage caused by a system error during a software update, for which the company announced a compensation plan for paid users.\n\nChatbot Arena is a crowdsourced benchmarking platform that uses an Elo rating system based on user votes from anonymous, side-by-side model comparisons. A recent study titled 'The Leaderboard Illusion' raised concerns about the platform's fairness, suggesting major tech firms like OpenAI may have an advantage due to private testing, which allows them to selectively publish only their best-performing models to the public leaderboard. The operators of Chatbot Arena have responded to the study, stating that it contains factual errors and misinterpretations.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Approximately 15 days. The question resolves on or after July 1, 2025, and today is June 15, 2025.",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No. As of June 11, 2025, Google's Gemini-2.5-Pro holds the #1 position with an Elo score of 1478, while OpenAI's best model trails by 53 points.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "OpenAI models remain in their current positions or don't accumulate sufficient Elo points by July 1. The recently released o3-pro doesn't perform well enough in blind user comparisons to close the 53-point gap within 15 days. GPT-5 either doesn't release before July 1 or releases too late to accumulate enough votes. Gemini-2.5-Pro maintains its lead through the end of Q2.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "The newly released o3-pro demonstrates exceptional performance in blind comparisons and rapidly accumulates Elo points, closing the 53-point gap. Alternatively, GPT-5 releases before July 1 and immediately shows strong performance in user evaluations. The narrowed competitive landscape in 2025 allows for faster rank changes than historically typical.",
    "rationale": "The status quo strongly favors a No outcome. With only 15 days remaining until resolution, OpenAI needs to overcome a 53-point Elo deficit. Elo rating systems are designed to change gradually based on accumulated head-to-head comparisons, making rapid shifts within such a short timeframe challenging. The research shows that while the competitive landscape has become more dynamic in 2025 (with leadership changes and narrower gaps), this still represents a substantial hurdle. Key factors weighing against a Yes outcome: (1) Limited time for vote accumulation, (2) Elo systems typically require many comparisons to shift significantly, (3) OpenAI just experienced a major service outage which could affect user engagement, (4) GPT-5 is reportedly delayed 'until July' which likely means after July 1. However, several factors prevent an extremely low forecast: (1) o3-pro was just released mid-June and is designed for high-performance reasoning, (2) the gap between top models has narrowed from 11.9% to 5.4% in early 2025, suggesting more volatility, (3) previous leadership changes (Grok-3 in February) show the leaderboard can shift, (4) ties count for resolution, slightly increasing the probability, (5) 'delays until July' could still mean late June. The 53-point gap in context of a ~80-point spread to 10th place is significant but not insurmountable. For me to update higher, I would need evidence that o3-pro is performing exceptionally well in early voting or concrete announcement of a pre-July 1 GPT-5 release. For me to update lower, I would need to see o3-pro performing poorly or confirmation that no new OpenAI models will launch before July 1. Given the strong status quo bias, short timeframe, and Elo system dynamics, I forecast a low but non-negligible probability.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill an OpenAI model be ranked #1 overall on the Chatbot Arena Leaderboard at the end of the 2nd Quarter of 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nMethodology: [Chatbot Arena: An Open Platform for Evaluating LLMs by Human Preference](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.04132)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if a model owned by OpenAI is in the number 1 overall rank (ties count) at the [Chatbot Arena Leaderboard](https://lmarena.ai/leaderboard) when accessed by Metaculus on or after July 1, 2025.

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
