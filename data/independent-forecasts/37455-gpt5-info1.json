  "information": "On April 14, 2025, the Lesotho Communications Authority (LCA) granted Starlink Lesotho a 10-year license to operate a satellite network and provide broadband services nationwide. Starlink Lesotho Pty Ltd, owned by Starlink Holdings Netherlands B.V., had submitted its application on January 24, 2025. The LCA had previously rejected a request from Starlink due to concerns over the company's lack of local ownership. The approval followed the imposition of a 50% US tariff on Lesotho in early April 2025. No official timeline for the service launch was provided at the time of the license grant.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "About 55 days (until 2025-07-01)",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No — the map remains “Coming Soon” and does not flip to “Available” for Lesotho by July 1.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Post-license onboarding takes longer than two months: device type-approval and import arrangements, payment/local-entity setup, and website checkout enablement lag; Starlink keeps Lesotho as “Coming Soon” (possibly with a 2025/2026 window) through June.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Starlink rapidly follows the April 14 license with website enablement and begins accepting orders to Lesotho; the availability map shades at least part of Lesotho as “Available” in May/June, even if deliveries start later.",
    "rationale": "I put extra weight on the status quo: as of May 7, Lesotho is not yet marked available on Starlink’s map, and the default in most countries is that regulatory approval is followed by some operational lag before the site flips to “Available.” Still, a two-and-a-half-month window from license (Apr 14) to July 1 is enough time for Starlink to move fast, and they often do so in newly licensed markets, sometimes within 1–3 months. Lesotho is small and fully surrounded by South Africa; enabling it could be strategically attractive, and Starlink’s laser backhaul reduces dependence on local ground stations. That supports a modestly-better-than-even chance of a swift availability update. \nResearch assistant summary affecting the forecast: the LCA granted a 10-year license on Apr 14, 2025 to Starlink Lesotho Pty Ltd (subsidiary of Starlink Holdings Netherlands B.V.), after prior rejection over local ownership. No official launch timeline was given. This signals regulatory clearance but leaves timing uncertain. \nWhy not higher: website “Available” status usually coincides with orderability, which may require local checkout, tax/import handling, and device approvals; these can push timelines past 2 months. Small market size could lower prioritization. If cross-border sensitivities with South Africa complicate logistics or roaming policy, Starlink may delay the public flip. \nWhy not lower: Starlink has a track record of quick follow-through post-approval in several countries, often in the 1–3 month range; the company already has beams over the region and can sell directly online. The creation of a local entity suggests groundwork is in place. \nUpdates that would move the probability up: official Starlink/LCA announcement of service launch or orderability; map shading changes to “Q2 2025” or “Available”; checkout flow enabling Lesotho addresses; sightings of successful orders or shipments into Lesotho. \nUpdates that would move it down: LCA adds post-license conditions (e.g., device certification delays), customs/import holdups, website shows a later “Coming Soon” date (e.g., Q3/Q4 2025), or credible reporting of distribution/billing obstacles in Lesotho.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill Starlink's website show Lesotho as a country with Starlink availability before July 1, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\n[Lesotho grants license to Musk's Starlink](https://www.ewn.co.za/2025/04/14/lesotho-grants-license-to-musks-starlink)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if, before July 1, 2025, the [Starlink Availability Map](https://www.starlink.com/us/map) has anywhere in Lesotho listed as \"Available.\"\n\n\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nOn April 14, 2025, the Lesotho Communications Authority (LCA) granted Starlink Lesotho a 10-year license to operate a satellite network and provide broadband services nationwide.

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
