    "review": "All three of us employed the same decomposition methodology (P(fight occurs) × P(win|fight)), which validates this approach. We also converged on similar fight occurrence probabilities (85-88%), suggesting this component is well-calibrated. The key divergence is in estimating Pyfer's win probability: Forecaster 2 assessed 65%, while Forecaster 3 and I independently arrived at 50-55%. Forecaster 2 raises a compelling point I may have underweighted: Pyfer's status as an 'ascending middleweight with momentum' and Gastelum's 'mixed results recently.' This suggests Pyfer might be more than a coin-flip favorite. However, without concrete evidence like betting lines or detailed recent performance data, Forecaster 2's 65% confidence seems somewhat optimistic. Forecaster 3's analysis closely mirrors my own reasoning, providing independent validation of the 48-50% range. The fact that two forecasters independently converged on ~48% using similar logic strengthens confidence in this range, though Forecaster 2's momentum argument has some merit.",
    "rationale": "After deliberation, I'm making a modest upward adjustment from 48% to 50%. Forecaster 2's emphasis on Pyfer's momentum and ascending trajectory is a legitimate consideration I may have underweighted. If Pyfer is genuinely on an upward trajectory and Gastelum has struggled recently, this could push his win probability from 53% toward 57-58%. However, I'm not moving to 55% because: (1) Without betting odds or detailed fight analysis, a 65% win probability seems insufficiently justified; (2) Gastelum remains a dangerous veteran with significant experience against elite competition; (3) The ~15% fight cancellation risk remains material; (4) Forecaster 3 independently validated my original reasoning. The convergence of two independent forecasts at 48% provides strong support for this range, while Forecaster 2's momentum argument justifies a small upward adjustment. A 50% forecast represents appropriate uncertainty given the dual risks of cancellation and a competitive matchup.",
