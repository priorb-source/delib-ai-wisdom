    "review": "All three forecasters converged on forecasts between 25-30%, showing strong agreement on the core constraints. We all identified the dual requirements (policy action + spreadsheet update), the compressed 46-day timeline, the difficulty of Congressional action, and the status quo bias. Forecaster 3 raised an important point I hadn't explicitly considered: even if executive action is taken, legal challenges could delay implementation, and maintainers might wait for legal certainty before marking 'complete.' This reinforces the high bar for completion. Forecaster 2's emphasis on uncertainty around maintainer standards is valid, though the fact they marked this 'in progress' rather than complete suggests they do employ meaningful thresholds. The conservative criteria observation is important - if maintainers required only proposals or announcements, this would likely already be marked complete. No forecaster presented evidence of imminent legislative action or executive orders, which would be necessary to support a higher forecast. The tight clustering around 25-30% suggests we're all seeing similar base rates for policy implementation within this compressed timeframe.",
    "rationale": "After reviewing the other analyses, I maintain that the critical bottlenecks remain: (1) achieving actual defunding within 46 days, and (2) maintainers judging this meets their 'complete' threshold. The legal challenges point from Forecaster 3 strengthens the case for a lower forecast - even if rapid executive action occurs, maintainers might reasonably wait to see if it withstands judicial review before marking complete. The conservative criteria observation is also valuable - the maintainers' choice to use 'in progress' rather than 'complete' indicates they require substantial achievement, not just announcements. However, the 'in progress' status does indicate active work, preventing me from going much lower. The lack of evidence for imminent legislative action or executive orders caps the upside. The 25-30% range appears well-calibrated given: Congressional timelines typically exceed 6 weeks for major appropriations changes, executive actions face legal uncertainty, and maintainers employ conservative standards. My 28% forecast appropriately reflects these balanced considerations without compelling reason to shift significantly.",
