    "review": "The other forecasters raised several critical pieces of evidence I had not adequately weighted:\n\nForecaster 2 identified that Benin EXTENDED the closure to Sèmè and Owode borders in Lagos State on May 9, just days after the initial closure. This is a crucial signal suggesting escalation rather than de-escalation, which I completely missed. This directly contradicts any narrative of imminent resolution.\n\nForecaster 3 provided invaluable historical data: only 20% of security-related border closures in ECOWAS since 2015 reopened within 60 days. We have less than half that timeframe (31 days), which suggests the probability should be substantially below 20%. Additionally, the specific precedent of Nigeria's 16-month border closure with Benin (2019-2020) demonstrates that these two countries specifically have a history of prolonged border disputes.\n\nBoth forecasters correctly emphasized the compressed timeframe and serious security nature of the closure. The escalation signal from extending closures to additional points is particularly damaging to the reopening hypothesis.\n\nI find Forecaster 3's use of base rate data especially compelling - if only 20% of similar situations resolve within 60 days, and we have half that time, the probability should logically be well below 20%. Forecaster 2's identification of the border extension as an escalation signal is also highly relevant evidence I should have discovered.",
    "rationale": "After reviewing the other forecasters' analyses, I need to revise my forecast downward based on three key factors I underweighted:\n\n1. **Escalation Signal**: The May 9 extension of closures to Sèmè and Owode borders in Lagos State indicates Benin is expanding rather than reversing its position. This is the opposite of what would precede a reopening.\n\n2. **Historical Base Rate**: If only 20% of similar ECOWAS security-related closures reopened within 60 days, and we have only 31 days remaining (approximately half that timeframe), the probability should be substantially below 20%. The mathematical implication is clear.\n\n3. **Bilateral Precedent**: The 2019-2020 Nigeria-Benin border closure lasted 16 months, demonstrating these specific countries have a pattern of prolonged border disputes.\n\nThe combination of recent escalation, compressed timeline, deteriorating security per AFRICOM, and unfavorable historical precedent all point toward a lower probability than my initial 18%. However, I don't go as low as 12% because economic pressure exists, diplomatic efforts may be occurring privately, and the base rate still shows some closures do resolve quickly. My revised forecast of 14% better reflects the weight of evidence, particularly the historical base rate adjusted for our shorter timeframe.",
