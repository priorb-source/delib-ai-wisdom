    "review": "Both forecasters raise critical evidence I underweighted. Forecaster 2's base rate analysis is particularly damning - African Starlink deployments typically take 4-8 months from licensing to availability, yet only 1.5 months remain. However, their Bangladesh precedent (2-week deployment in May 2025) is crucial counterevidence showing rapid deployment is technically feasible when prioritized. Forecaster 3's point about minimal infrastructure requirements (inter-satellite links through neighboring ground stations) is well-taken and reduces technical barriers. The critical insight both miss: 32 days have passed since the April 13 announcement with no map update, which suggests Somalia may not be receiving priority treatment. If this were a Bangladesh-style rush deployment, we'd likely see progress by now. The tension is between technical feasibility (Bangladesh proves it CAN be done quickly) and practical reality (African base rates and lack of visible progress suggest it WON'T be done quickly).",
    "rationale": "I'm updating down from 60% to 40% based on three key factors: (1) The African deployment base rate of 4-8 months is strong evidence against meeting a 1.5-month timeline, with even the fastest African deployment taking 4 months; (2) The 32-day gap since announcement with no map update suggests Somalia is not receiving prioritized treatment like Bangladesh did; (3) However, the Bangladesh 2-week precedent prevents going too low, proving rapid deployment is technically possible. My initial forecast was too optimistic because I underweighted base rate evidence and status quo inertia. The license approval and public commitments are positive signals, but the operational execution timeline appears to favor a longer deployment. At 40%, I'm giving roughly 2-to-3 odds against, acknowledging that while rapid deployment is technically feasible, the evidence suggests it's unlikely to happen in this case within the remaining timeframe.",
