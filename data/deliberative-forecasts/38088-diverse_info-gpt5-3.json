    "review": "Forecaster 2 adds a concrete base-rate estimate (≈38% U.S. share in ranks 200–300). That’s the most useful new input and broadly aligns with my prior intuition that the mid‑list is internationally diversified. I’m less convinced by their claim of a sharp year-over-year decline in U.S. share (40% to 35%); even if true, it likely doesn’t move a July 1 outcome much over a ~1‑month window. Their emphasis on the short horizon as limiting structural shifts is reasonable, though the day-of outcome is still mostly a function of the local pool’s composition, not the passage of time per se.\n\nForecaster 3 leans on macro sentiment (U.S. confidence, S&P/Nasdaq strength, tariff timing) to push above 50%. I find this unconvincing for this specific rank: (a) the #250 cohort is a heterogeneous mix not particularly dominated by U.S. tech, (b) non‑U.S. equities and FX can offset, and (c) two recent snapshots at #250 were non‑U.S., suggesting the local pool is currently skewed away from U.S. The tariff-delay argument feels tenuous for this micro event. Overall, 55% seems too high versus the base rate and observed recent occupants.\n",
    "rationale": "I continue to anchor on the composition of the local pool around #250. The new base-rate datapoint (≈38% U.S. in ranks 200–300) is a helpful quantitative anchor and is broadly consistent with my earlier view that the chance should be below even. The two latest snapshots at #250 (Italy, then Russia) modestly support the idea that the immediate neighborhood is currently non‑U.S. heavy. While a relative U.S. market/FX tailwind in June could shift the balance, it would need to be pronounced to push the probability above 50%, and there’s no specific evidence here that such a differential move is likely or sustained. \n\nGiven this, I’m nudging my forecast slightly upward from 35% to 36% to reflect the explicit 38% base rate in the 200–300 band while still discounting a bit for the recent non‑U.S. occupancy at #250 and the likelihood that tech-led U.S. outperformance doesn’t strongly target this exact rank. I’d move up if: repeated late‑June checks show frequent U.S. occupancy at #250 or clear, sustained U.S. equity/FX outperformance versus ex‑U.S. I’d move down if: the #245–255 pool appears dominated by non‑U.S. names through June or if commodities/FX shifts favor non‑U.S. billionaires in that band.\n",
