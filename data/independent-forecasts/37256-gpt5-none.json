    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "About 2 months (until June 30, 2025, since ratification must occur before July 1)",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No — South Sudan has not ratified AfCFTA yet and typically moves slowly on treaty ratifications.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Parliament does not take up or pass the ratification bill in time, or it passes but the instrument of ratification is not deposited with the African Union by June 30 due to administrative or political delays.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "The cabinet fast-tracks the ratification bill, parliament approves it promptly, the president assents, and the government deposits the instrument of ratification with the AU before June 30—possibly to align with AU mid-year meetings and signal reform amid economic pressures.",
    "rationale": "- Time horizon: Fewer than 60 days remain. Multiple steps are required: legislative approval, presidential assent, and formal deposit of the instrument with the AU. Any one bottleneck can slip timelines.\n- Status quo and base rates: As of late 2024, AfCFTA ratifications were in the high-40s among AU members, with South Sudan among the holdouts. Movement from non-ratification to ratification tends to be sporadic and often tied to clear executive prioritization. In the absence of strong signals, the status quo (no ratification) is the likeliest outcome over a short window.\n- Country-specific considerations: South Sudan’s legislative process is often slow, with competing priorities (political transition, security, severe fiscal stress from regional disruptions). Administrative capacity constraints make the final step (depositing the instrument) a non-trivial risk even if parliament acts.\n- Reasons for some upside: Ratification is politically low-cost and symbolically valuable. Economic hardship can motivate quick, signaling reforms; AU and regional events around June/July can create a deadline effect. If the executive has already prepared a bill or previously indicated intent, a rapid push is possible.\n- Why not higher: There is no concrete, recent reporting (the assistant had none) showing the bill is on the floor, has passed committee, or is queued for swift passage and deposit. Short time plus multiple steps keeps the base probability modest.\n- Why not lower: The process can be expedited when prioritized, and governments sometimes time ratifications to continental summits. If cabinet approval already occurred or business groups and the AU Secretariat are pushing, a quick sequence is feasible.\n- What would move me up: Credible reports that (a) the cabinet has approved the ratification bill and sent it to parliament; (b) parliament has scheduled an imminent vote or passed it; (c) the presidency plans prompt assent and the Foreign Ministry has prepared the instrument for deposit.\n- What would move me down: Reports of parliamentary recess or gridlock; renewed political/security crises crowding out legislative time; signals that technical schedules (tariff offers/rules of origin) are not ready; or missed internal deadlines close to mid-June.\n- Assistant’s info: The research assistant provided no additional information, so the forecast relies on base rates, process steps, and country context.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill South Sudan ratify AfCFTA (the pan-African free trade agreement) before July 1, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nThe Star Worldwide via MSN: [World Chambers Africa Summit maps economic path for South Sudan](https://www.msn.com/en-xl/africa/other/world-chambers-africa-summit-maps-economic-path-for-south-sudan/ar-AA1CTigs?ocid=BingNewsVerp)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if South Sudan ratifies the African Continental Free Trade Area (AfCFTA) Agreement before July 1, 2025.\n\n\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nNo additional information available.\n\nToday is 2025-05-02.\n\nBefore answering you think:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n(e) You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
