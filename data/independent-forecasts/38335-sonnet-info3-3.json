  "information": "Casey DeSantis is facing public scrutiny related to a House probe into the Hope Florida foundation, an initiative she launched. The investigation was reported by multiple news outlets in late May and early June 2025. The next major campaign finance deadline is June 30, which marks the end of the second fundraising quarter. Historically, major candidates for Florida governor typically announce their campaigns between 8 and 18 months prior to the primary election, which is scheduled for August 2026.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "26 days (from June 5, 2025 to July 1, 2025)",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No - Casey DeSantis has not announced her candidacy as of June 5, 2025",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Casey DeSantis delays her announcement beyond July 1, 2025 due to the ongoing House probe into Hope Florida foundation creating negative publicity, or she decides to wait until after the June 30 fundraising deadline to make a strategic announcement in Q3. With Byron Donalds polling ahead with Trump's backing, she may choose to take more time to build her campaign infrastructure and wait for the investigation to resolve.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Casey DeSantis announces her candidacy before June 30, 2025 to begin fundraising in Q2, deciding that going on offense with a campaign launch is the best way to counter the negative news cycle around the Hope Florida probe. She may calculate that early entry allows her to establish her narrative and compete with Byron Donalds for donor support before the quarter ends.",
    "rationale": "The status quo strongly favors a No resolution. With only 26 days remaining, Casey DeSantis has not yet announced her candidacy. Several factors support maintaining this status quo: (1) The House probe into Hope Florida foundation reported in late May/early June 2025 creates negative publicity and strong incentive to delay any announcement; (2) Historical patterns show Florida governor candidates typically announce 8-18 months before the August 2026 primary, meaning she has a wide window extending through December 2025; (3) Byron Donalds' polling lead with Trump's endorsement may cause her to reconsider her timing and strategy. The main catalyst for a Yes outcome would be the June 30 fundraising deadline - candidates sometimes announce just before quarter-end to maximize Q2 fundraising. However, announcements after fundraising deadlines are also common and tactically sound. Good forecasting practice emphasizes the status quo, and nothing has changed in the past 5 days to suggest an imminent announcement. I would update higher if her campaign signals readiness to launch or the probe is dismissed. I would update lower if the investigation intensifies or she explicitly signals a delay. The 22% probability reflects that while an announcement before July 1 is plausible given the fundraising deadline, the combination of the ongoing probe, lack of current announcement, and ample time remaining in the historical window make delay more likely.",

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
