  "information": "Several bills concerning voter citizenship verification were considered in Florida's legislature. HB 831 would require state-issued IDs to indicate non-citizen status. HB 1381 would require voters to provide proof of citizenship, such as a passport or birth certificate, for new or updated registrations. SB 1330 would require first-time voters to present similar documentation. The 2025 regular legislative session concluded without enacting these bills. A comprehensive bill containing similar provisions, CS/HB 1381, was withdrawn from consideration on May 3, 2025. An extended legislative session, constitutionally required to pass the state budget, began on May 12, 2025.\n\nFlorida's legislature is controlled by a Republican supermajority in both chambers. Governor Ron DeSantis has a history of supporting and signing legislation described as strengthening election integrity. In May 2025, DeSantis signed a law that creates new hurdles for the citizens' initiative process, including a ban on non-citizens and non-residents from gathering signatures for petitions. This followed the enactment of SB 7016 in April 2025, which also restricts ballot initiatives.\n\nThe push for expanded voter citizenship verification in Florida aligns with a broader national trend. The U.S. House of Representatives passed the Safeguard American Voter Eligibility (SAVE) Act, which would require proof of citizenship for voter registration nationwide, though it is unlikely to pass the Senate. Separately, President Donald Trump signed an executive order to impose stricter verification requirements. Other states have also advanced similar legislation; Wyoming passed a law requiring proof of citizenship to vote that is set to become effective on July 1, and a bill in Tennessee to create a citizenship verification portal for election workers has advanced in its state house.",

    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "~56 days (until July 1, 2025)",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No enactment before July 1, 2025",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Regular session has already ended without passage; the budget-focused extended session sticks to appropriations and related conforming/implementing bills, none of which include new voter-citizenship proof requirements. No special session is called with an election-law scope before July 1. Result: no qualifying bill enacted by the deadline.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Legislative leaders or the Governor add election-law items to a special session call (or tuck them into an implementing/conforming bill tied to the budget) and quickly pass a measure like HB 1381/SB 1330 (proof-of-citizenship at registration) or HB 831 (ID marking for non-citizens), with the Governor signing before July 1.",
    "rationale": "- Time and process: The 2025 regular session ended without enacting the relevant bills (HB 831, HB 1381, SB 1330). A budget-driven extended session begins May 12. Florida can pass policy in special sessions, but by default the extended session’s scope is appropriations; adding an election bill would require leadership to expand scope or call a separate special session. That’s possible but uncommon on short notice.\n- Politics: Republicans hold supermajorities and Gov. DeSantis has signed multiple election-related restrictions this spring, indicating receptivity. However, the fact that leadership let these bills die in the regular session suggests either intra-caucus hesitation, legal risk/complexity (e.g., NVRA preemption issues for federal elections), or prioritization elsewhere. Those headwinds don’t vanish in May–June.\n- External momentum: National GOP pushes (e.g., U.S. House SAVE Act; a federal executive order) create pressure, and other states have moved. Still, Florida didn’t act during the easiest window (regular session), implying lower probability of a sudden pivot before July 1 absent a targeted special session.\n- Definition breadth: The question counts not only direct proof-at-registration mandates but also measures like HB 831 (ID marking for non-citizens). That widens the avenues for a “Yes,” but still requires legislative action in a compressed window.\nWhy not higher: Need for a new session or expanded scope in a tight calendar; recent failure to pass during regular session; legal/implementation concerns. Why not lower: Unified GOP control, recent track record of passing election restrictions, and willingness/ability to move quickly if leadership prioritizes it.\nSignals to move up: Announcement of a special session including election laws; filing of implementing/conforming language adding citizenship proof requirements; public statements by the Governor/legislative leaders prioritizing this before July 1. Signals to move down: Budget-only scope confirmed for the extended session; leaders publicly punting to 2026 session; no relevant bills noticed by early June.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nBefore July 1, 2025, will Florida enact legislation expanding its verification requirements of a voter's citizenship?\n\nQuestion background:\nTallahassee Democrat: [Florida may require proof of citizenship to vote under new legislation echoing Trump](https://www.tallahassee.com/story/news/local/state/2025/04/02/got-id-proof-of-citizenship-may-soon-be-needed-to-vote-in-florida/82756919007/)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if, before July 1, 2025, the state of Florida enacts legislation requiring voters to provide proof of US citizenship beyond the requirements at the time of this question, according to [credible sources](https://www.metaculus.com/faq/#definitions).\n\nAny subset of voters being required to provide such proof would count (for example if it only applied to first-time voter registrants or creating a new requirement for mail-in voters). An example of a bill that would count is [HB 831](https://www.flsenate.gov/Session/Bill/2025/831). This question resolves upon enactment; therefore other questions such as when the legislation takes effect or whether it survives court challenges and is implemented is immaterial to this question's resolution.\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nSeveral bills concerning voter citizenship verification were considered in Florida's legislature.

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
