  "information": "In mid-May 2025, John Morgan stated he would observe the field of announced candidates before making a decision on running for governor. He also mentioned that if he were to run, his campaign would be brief, lasting approximately three months. Morgan has publicly considered running for governor in previous election cycles, including 2018 and 2022, but ultimately did not enter the races.\n\nProminent attorney John Morgan has announced plans to launch a new political party aimed at centrist voters, expressing dissatisfaction with the current two-party system. Multiple news outlets reported in February and May 2025 that Morgan has been working on this initiative for months, with lawyers preparing party-formation paperwork for what has been referred to as the 'Capitalist Party' or '#ForThePeople'.\n\nThe field for the 2026 Florida gubernatorial race has seen recent developments. On June 5, 2025, former Republican Congressman David Jolly announced his candidacy for the Democratic nomination. Additionally, State Senator Jason Pizzo has stated his intention to run as an independent. On the Republican side, Congressman Byron Donalds has launched his campaign, and Florida's First Lady, Casey DeSantis, is reportedly considering a run.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Approximately 25 days remain until July 1, 2025",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No announcement is made",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Morgan continues his pattern from 2018 and 2022 of considering but ultimately not entering the gubernatorial race. He focuses instead on his new political party initiative and decides the field is either too crowded or not suitable for his entry. He may also decide to observe the race longer before making any commitment, or conclude that his energy is better spent on building the Capitalist Party infrastructure.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Morgan follows through on his expressed interest and announces his candidacy within the next 25 days. His stated preference for a brief 3-month campaign aligns with announcing in late June 2025 for a 2026 race. The recent entry of David Jolly and others crystallizes the field enough for Morgan to make his decision, and he leverages his new party platform as a vehicle for his gubernatorial campaign.",
    "rationale": "The base rate strongly favors No - Morgan has publicly considered gubernatorial runs in both 2018 and 2022 but did not enter either race. This pattern of consideration without follow-through is significant. However, several factors make this cycle somewhat different: (1) Morgan's recent statements in mid-May 2025 show active engagement with the decision, (2) his timeline comment about a 3-month campaign suggests he's thinking practically about timing, and (3) he's simultaneously working on a new political party, indicating heightened political activity. The field is developing rapidly with recent announcements from David Jolly (June 5), Jason Pizzo, Byron Donalds, and potential entry by Casey DeSantis. This gives Morgan the information he said he wanted before deciding. The 25-day window is tight but feasible for an announcement. Against the Yes outcome: his historical track record, the distraction of the new party initiative, and the fact that building a third-party infrastructure may be his true priority rather than a gubernatorial run. The probability isn't higher because his track record suggests deliberation without action, and starting a new party plus running for governor simultaneously would be extraordinarily ambitious. It isn't lower because his recent activity level and specific comments about timing and observing the field suggest more serious consideration than usual, and the window technically allows for an announcement.",
