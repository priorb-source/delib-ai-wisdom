    "review": "Both forecasters add helpful specificity. Forecaster 2 cites multiple late-spring polls (SurveyUSA, Marist with an RCV sim, Emerson/PIX11/The Hill) consistently placing Cuomo near ~40% with a mid- to high-single/low-double-digit lead and at least one simulation showing him clearing 50% in later RCV rounds. That’s stronger than the generic “lead narrowing” frame I was using and meaningfully increases confidence he can convert. Forecaster 3’s point about endorsements from cohesive, high-turnout blocs (Orthodox Jewish communities) is also material in NYC primaries, and targeted Hispanic outreach plus celebrity endorsements may marginally help. I find F2’s polling-based case persuasive; however, I think their 74% is a bit high given documented tightening, Cuomo’s high negatives, and RCV transfer risk if the left consolidates. F3’s 62% feels closer to the right magnitude, acknowledging both advantages and downside risks. I accept the new polling/RCV-simulation evidence as a reason to move up from my initial estimate, but I still discount for late volatility and polarization under RCV.",
    "rationale": "Update: I’m raising my estimate because the cited Marist RCV simulation and multiple late-spring polls consistently showing Cuomo around ~37–43% first-choice support suggest a sturdier path to a majority than I previously credited. With two weeks left, name ID, resources, and cohesive outer-borough blocs typically matter most; if Cuomo starts near 40%, he’s favored to accumulate enough moderate transfers in later rounds. The time window for a full progressive consolidation is short.\nWhy not higher: The trend appears to be toward a tighter race; Cuomo’s negatives could cap his second-choice acceptability among progressive voters; and a credible late consolidation behind Mamdani (aided by AOC and progressive groups) could flip the final RCV round. The independent “Fight and Deliver” line could also rub Democratic primary voters the wrong way at the margin. NYC primaries can be low-turnout and volatile, and RCV magnifies coalition efficiency if the left unifies.\nNet: The additional polling/RCV evidence moves me from a narrow edge to a modest edge for Cuomo, but I retain meaningful downside for late movement and transfer risk.\nChange: Up from 56% to 63%.",
