    "review": "The other two forecasters and I are in strong agreement on the core drivers of this question. We all identify the international location (Canada) as the primary and unprecedented barrier to Donald Trump's attendance, making a 'No' outcome highly likely. We also all noted that his recent attendance at a UFC event in Miami makes a second appearance just four weeks later improbable based on his past behavior. Forecaster 2 added helpful context by specifically mentioning Trump's contentious relationship with Prime Minister Trudeau. Forecaster 3 introduced two excellent and novel points: 1) the UFC 315 card lacks a transcendent mega-star (e.g., Conor McGregor), which reduces the incentive for Trump to make such an unprecedented trip, and 2) the relative proximity of Montreal to the U.S. Northeast slightly mitigates the logistical travel burden, though not the political or security hurdles. Overall, the deliberation solidified the consensus that attendance is very unlikely, with all forecasts in the 5-8% range.",
    "rationale": "I am holding my forecast at 5%. The deliberation with my colleagues has reinforced my initial analysis that a 'No' vote is the overwhelmingly likely outcome. The most critical factor remains that no former or sitting U.S. President has attended a UFC event abroad, and all of Trump's prior appearances have been at domestic events. This precedent is a very strong anchor for a low probability. \n\nThe arguments raised in the deliberation provided further nuance but did not fundamentally shift the odds, in my view. The point raised by Forecaster 3, that UFC 315 lacks a truly colossal star, actually strengthens my conviction in a 'No' outcome. An unprecedented international appearance would likely be reserved for a marquee event promising maximum media attention. While the counterpoint about Montreal's geographical proximity is valid, it does not overcome the significant political, security, and precedential hurdles of an international visit. Given that the new evidence largely reinforces the existing reasons for a 'No' outcome, I see no reason to adjust my initial 5% forecast, which already accounts for a small, non-zero chance driven by Trump's unpredictability and his relationship with Dana White.",
