    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "About 6 weeks (until July 1, 2025)",
    "status_quo_outcome": "Yes — the CDC page continues to state 0.7 mg/L as the optimal level",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "HHS/CDC, during the ongoing review, temporarily withdraws or revises the recommendation below 0.7 mg/L, or replaces the page with a notice lacking a numeric recommendation, or removes the page with no replacement.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "CDC keeps its existing guidance unchanged, continuing to state that 0.7 mg/L is the optimal concentration that maximizes benefits and minimizes harms.",
    "rationale": "- Inertia/status quo: CDC has recommended 0.7 mg/L since 2015, and such guidance changes typically take months-to-years, not weeks. The April 10, 2025 HHS review announcement leaves only ~2.5 months to July 1, which is a short window for an interagency review, clearance, and public communication change. Bureaucratic processes and scientific review norms favor continuity in the near term.\n- Institutional stance and evidence base: CDC and major dental/medical organizations have long supported community water fluoridation at 0.7 mg/L for caries prevention. While some studies have raised concerns about potential neurodevelopmental effects at higher fluoride exposures, a decisive, immediate consensus shift to drop below 0.7 mg/L (or to suspend a numeric recommendation) would be unusual without a completed review and broad coordination.\n- Political/optics risk: Given current attention (e.g., NPR reporting that HHS will review guidance), there is a nontrivial chance of a temporary “under review” posture. However, agencies generally keep existing guidance in place with a review disclaimer rather than pulling numeric recommendations abruptly.\n- Legal/external triggers: A court ruling compelling rapid regulatory changes or a major new authoritative assessment published before July 1 could prompt a quick update, but such events are uncertain and, on this timeline, unlikely to translate into an immediate CDC website change.\n- Research assistant info: No additional information available, so I rely on public timeline considerations and typical federal review cadence.\nWhy not higher: There is a real, if modest, chance of a precautionary pause in language (e.g., removing the numeric recommendation while the review proceeds) or a politically driven update to a non-numeric stance. Also, a website restructuring or temporary removal could technically resolve as No.\nWhy not lower: Strong status quo bias, established institutional support, and the short timeline to July 1 reduce the likelihood of a substantive change this quickly.\nWhat would move me upward: Explicit CDC/HHS statements that the review will take longer than July 1 and that existing guidance remains in force; any website update reaffirming 0.7 mg/L.\nWhat would move me downward: A CDC/HHS notice signaling suspension or pending revision of the numeric recommendation, a significant adverse court ruling compelling immediate action, or a major, widely publicized new risk assessment prompting rapid interim guidance.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill the CDC still recommend 0.7 mg/L fluoride as the optimal level in community water supplies on July 1, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nNPR: [HHS will review guidance on the addition of fluoride to drinking water](https://www.npr.org/2025/04/10/g-s1-59452/hhs-rfk-fluoride-drinking-water-epa)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if the CDC's [Community Water Fluoridation Recommendations](https://www.cdc.gov/fluoridation/about/community-water-fluoridation-recommendations.html) recommends greater than or equal to 0.7 mg/L as the concentration that maximizes fluoride's oral health benefits while minimizing potential harms. If a lesser amount is recommended or if there is no longer any recommendation at all, then the question resolves as **No**.\n\nIf the page is pulled offline with no replacement, this question also resolves as **No**.\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nNo additional information available.\n\nToday is 2025-05-20.\n\nBefore answering you think:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n(e) You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
