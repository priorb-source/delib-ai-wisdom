  "forecast": {
    "review": "Both forecasters largely align with my reasoning: strong intra‑party signaling that Ouattara will be the RHDP candidate, but no personal declaration yet; weakened opposition reduces the need to announce early; and without a scheduled May nominating event, the near‑term hazard remains modest. Forecaster 3’s emphasis on regional/past timing norms and the value of compressing the campaign window, plus both forecasters’ point about age/health risk management (keeping options open), are incremental arguments that tilt slightly toward a later declaration. They also rightly stress that third‑party statements don’t meet the resolution criterion. No new concrete event timing was introduced, but the combined logic supports a small downward adjustment.",
    "rationale": "Time left is just over one month, with no public indication of a May RHDP congress or set‑piece event. Ouattara benefits from strategic ambiguity: the opposition is constrained, and early declaration could lengthen the period for mobilization and scrutiny while reducing his flexibility given age/health risks. Ministers’ confident statements keep a non‑trivial chance of a choreographed May announcement if the party decides to formalize matters, but absent a scheduled May event, the baseline hazard appears low. I’m nudging my estimate down slightly to reflect the consensus arguments about timing norms and risk management, while preserving a meaningful tail for a sudden May declaration if the RHDP moves to lock in unity or stage a rally/acceptance speech. I would move up on confirmed reports of a May congress or a scheduled national address signaling a candidacy decision; I would move down if party decision-making is publicly slated for June or later or if Ouattara reiterates indecision in May without announcing an RHDP event.",
