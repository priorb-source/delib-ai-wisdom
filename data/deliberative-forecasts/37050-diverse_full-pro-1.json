    "review": "My initial forecast of 25% was significantly higher than my peers' (18% and 14%). The other forecasters presented compelling arguments that I had not fully appreciated. Specifically, they correctly emphasized that the Dow committee typically does not react to short-term price volatility, which was a core pillar of my reasoning. Forecaster 3's point was particularly persuasive: historical changes are driven by specific, structural catalysts like major stock splits (Apple in 2020), M\nout;A, or a clear need for sector rebalancing. The current scenario, despite its drama, lacks such a catalyst. Furthermore, the argument that the most recent change in February 2024 already addressed the major sector imbalance (by adding tech giants like NVIDIA and Amazon) reduces the urgency for another move so soon. Their reasoning convinced me that I overweighted the dramatic but likely ephemeral market events described in the prompt.",
    "rationale": "After reviewing my peers' analyses, I am lowering my forecast significantly from 25% to 15%. The primary reason is that my initial assessment was an overreaction to the narrative of severe market volatility. The other forecasters correctly pointed out the Dow committee's historical pattern of looking past short-term price swings in favor of making changes based on long-term structural factors. The absence of a classic trigger—such as a stock split, merger, or major corporate restructuring—within the prompt makes a change in the next two months much less likely. The base rate of infrequent changes is the dominant factor here. While the underperformance of several stocks (UNH, Nike, IBM) creates a 'watch list,' it is unlikely to provoke an announcement of removal before July 1, 2025, without a more fundamental catalyst. My updated forecast of 15% better reflects the committee's likely inertia and decision-making patterns, while still acknowledging a small but non-zero chance that the extreme market conditions could accelerate a decision for one of the laggards.",
