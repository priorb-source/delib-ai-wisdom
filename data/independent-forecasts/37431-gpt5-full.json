  "information": "The recall, issued on April 24, 2025, by ACC Central Kitchen LLC, is for approximately 64,000 to 65,000 pounds of frozen pork bun products. The recall is classified as Class I and was initiated due to misbranding and an undeclared sesame allergen. The affected products were produced over an extended period, with some items dating back to November 2023. Distribution was limited to retail locations in New York. There have been no reported illnesses associated with the consumption of these products.\n\nThe U.S. Department of Agriculture’s Food Safety and Inspection Service (FSIS) oversees the recall process. For a recall to be formally closed, the FSIS must complete effectiveness checks and verify that the company has removed all affected products from commerce, notified customers, and implemented corrective actions. Historical data for similar recalls show varied timelines; medium-scale allergen recalls (10,000-100,000 lbs) typically take 60 to 120 days to close. Other analyses suggest a mean closure time of 45 days for allergen/misbranding recalls, with about half of comparable recalls in 2023-2024 closing within 70 days.\n\nSeveral factors specific to this recall may influence its duration. Factors that could lead to a longer resolution time include the substantial volume of the product, the long production window, and the product's frozen nature, which means it may remain in consumer freezers for longer periods. Conversely, factors that could shorten the timeline include the recall's limited geographical scope (only New York), the reason being a misbranding/allergen issue rather than pathogen contamination (which typically involves a more complex investigation), and the company's proactive and voluntary initiation of the recall.",

    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Approximately 56 days (until 2025-07-01)",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No — the FSIS recall remains Active on July 1, 2025",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Effectiveness checks take longer than expected due to the large volume, long production window, and the product’s frozen nature; FSIS keeps the recall status Active into July (possibly with an expansion or additional consignees identified), so the status has not flipped to Closed by July 1.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "ACC Central Kitchen LLC rapidly completes notifications and product recovery from retail in New York; FSIS completes effectiveness checks without issues and updates the recall status from Active to Closed by late June.",
    "rationale": "Baseline: The recall began April 24, 2025. The question deadline is July 1, giving about 68 days from initiation to closure for a Yes. The research assistant notes that medium-size allergen/misbranding recalls (10k–100k lbs) often close within 60–120 days, with a mean near 45 days in some datasets and roughly half closing within 70 days. Our window (68 days) lands near that midpoint, suggesting a base probability near 50%. \n\nFactors pushing toward No: (1) Size/complexity: ~64–65k lbs across a long production window (dating back to Nov 2023) implies numerous lots and consignees to verify. (2) Frozen product: while consumer possession doesn’t block closure, frozen items can linger at retail or in distribution, sometimes complicating effectiveness checks. (3) Class I allergen recalls tend to be handled thoroughly; verification may run long. These lean against a quick closure. \n\nFactors pushing toward Yes: (1) Scope limited to retail in one state (New York), which can simplify consignees relative to multi-state recalls. (2) Root cause is misbranding/undeclared allergen rather than pathogen contamination—typically more straightforward to resolve. (3) No reported illnesses and a voluntary recall suggest the firm may be cooperative and responsive, which can speed checks. \n\nStatus quo weighting: The current status is Active. Because closure requires positive verification and an explicit status change by FSIS, the status-quo outcome (still Active on July 1) gets a slight edge. \n\nNet: Balancing the roughly 50/50 historical timing with the above push-pull, and giving extra weight to the status quo, I lean slightly toward No. \n\nWhy not higher: The substantial volume, long production span, and frozen nature introduce real odds that checks extend beyond late June, or that additional distribution details emerge, delaying closure. \n\nWhy not lower: Many allergen/misbranding recalls do close within about two months; the single-state retail footprint and lack of illnesses are favorable for timely closure. \n\nWhat would move me up: Evidence that effectiveness checks are nearly complete; FSIS updates indicating limited consignee count; company statements showing rapid, verified retrieval from retailers; no expansions or new findings through May–June. \n\nWhat would move me down: Any recall expansion (more products, dates, or states); signs of difficulty contacting or verifying consignees; new adverse events; FSIS updates suggesting ongoing or escalated effectiveness checks into late June.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill the USDA-posted recall by ACC Central Kitchen LLC of pork bun products issued April 24, 2025 be closed before July 1, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nConsumerAffairs: [Nearly 65,000 pounds of pork buns recalled for undeclared allergen](https://www.consumeraffairs.com/news/nearly-65000-pounds-of-pork-buns-recalled-for-undeclared-allergen-042525.html)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below.

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any).
