    "review": "Forecasters 2 and 3 raise several important points I underweighted. Most critically, Forecaster 3 identifies the budget rider pathway - Ohio must pass an operating budget by June 30, creating a realistic vehicle for inserting citizenship verification language that both chambers would pass. This is a significant mechanism I overlooked. Forecaster 2 correctly emphasizes that 'enactment' requires only both chambers passing identical bills, not gubernatorial signature, lowering the bar. The mention of recent HB 458 (voter ID law) shows willingness to tighten election laws. However, I believe both forecasters significantly underweight the February 2025 signal. Just 3 months ago, Ohio Republicans actively removed citizenship verification requirements from the transportation budget, choosing instead a much weaker alternative (BMV not offering forms to non-citizens). This is recent revealed preference showing either practical concerns, lack of political will, or internal divisions. If Republicans wanted this badly enough to fast-track in 8 weeks via budget rider or standalone bill, why did they remove it from budget legislation just 3 months ago? Neither forecaster adequately addresses this tension. Forecaster 3 mentions national momentum but Ohio just declined to join that momentum. Additionally, there's no evidence cited of SB 153 progressing or leadership statements prioritizing this before July 1. The budget rider mechanism is real and the supermajorities matter, but the February removal is a powerful counter-signal suggesting this isn't currently a priority for Ohio GOP leadership.",
    "rationale": "I'm updating upward from 20% to 30% based on the valid mechanisms identified by the other forecasters, particularly the budget rider pathway and the lower bar of not requiring gubernatorial signature. The budget must pass by June 30, and riders are common legislative vehicles. With Republican supermajorities, passage is structurally easy if leadership prioritizes it. However, I'm not updating as high as 40-42% because the February 2025 removal of citizenship verification from the transportation budget remains a critical and recent signal. This was revealed preference - when given an opportunity 3 months ago, Ohio Republicans chose NOT to pursue stronger verification requirements. They selected a much weaker alternative approach instead. This suggests either implementation concerns, insufficient political will, internal divisions, or concerns about backlash. No evidence has been presented of changed circumstances, leadership statements, or legislative momentum since February that would overcome whatever obstacles led to that removal. The combination of (a) a realistic pathway via budget rider, (b) structural ease with supermajorities, and (c) enough time if prioritized supports moving above 20%. But the very recent decision to avoid this exact policy keeps me well below 40%.",
