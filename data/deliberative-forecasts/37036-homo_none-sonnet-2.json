    "review": "The other forecasters raise several compelling arguments. Forecaster 2 correctly notes that announcing 12-18 months before a November 2026 election would be normal timing, meaning Osborn could reasonably wait beyond June 1. Forecaster 3 makes the crucial observation that June 1 is an arbitrary deadline from Osborn's perspective - there's no compelling strategic reason he must announce by this date versus later in summer 2025. This is a significant insight I underweighted. The fact that 20 days have elapsed since the Nebraska Examiner article without announcement (as Forecaster 3 emphasizes) is also meaningful evidence against imminent action. All three analyses appropriately apply status quo bias and recognize that exploration doesn't equal announcement. The clustering of forecasts (30-40%) suggests reasonable agreement on the core dynamics, with the main disagreement centering on how heavily to weight the arbitrary nature of the June 1 cutoff versus the genuine possibility of announcement within 38 days.",
    "rationale": "Upon reflection, I find Forecaster 3's argument about the arbitrary deadline most persuasive. From Osborn's strategic perspective, announcing in July or August 2025 would still provide 15-17 months of campaign time for a November 2026 race - well within normal parameters. The June 1 deadline matters for question resolution but likely doesn't drive his actual decision calculus. The passage of 20 days since the exploration report without announcement suggests this is not imminent. However, I don't drop as low as 30% because: (1) public exploration signals real intent that often converts to candidacy, (2) 38 days genuinely provides sufficient time for someone who has decided, and (3) early announcements do occur and have advantages. The lack of additional information about campaign infrastructure, staff hiring, or fundraising preparation also supports caution. I'm updating down from 40% to 35%, moderately weighting the arbitrary deadline argument while maintaining that the timeframe and exploration signal make announcement within this window plausible though unlikely.",
