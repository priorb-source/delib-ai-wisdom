    "review": "Both forecasters converge on the same core points I used: tiny base network (likely Guam, Yap, Taipei, and intermittent Seoul), slow post‑pandemic recovery, and short lead time to add enough routes to reach ≥6 by July 1. They add specific plausible adds (Japan, Philippines, a second Korea city) and emphasize the need for multiple announcements already filed to be visible on FlightsFrom. I find their reasoning sound and in line with airline scheduling realities. One nuance worth underscoring is that downside risk (e.g., a suspension of Yap or Seoul) is at least as plausible as upside; FlightsFrom counts scheduled, low‑frequency services as destinations, but it won’t show charters, so upside requires real filings. Their analyses don’t introduce compelling bullish evidence; if anything, they reinforce the base case.",
    "rationale": "Status quo likely supports 3–5 destinations: Guam and Taipei look durable; Yap and Seoul are plausible but not guaranteed. To resolve Yes, ROR needs at least six listed destinations on FlightsFrom on/after July 1. Achieving that in ~6 weeks would require two or more additional scheduled routes (e.g., a Japan seasonal plus an extra Korea city or Manila) already filed and for sale. Given Palau’s demand constraints (no mainland China feed, soft Korea/Japan demand), limited operator pool, and typical schedule lead times, that’s unlikely. Government/tourism subsidies could still enable short‑season services, so a non‑trivial upside exists, but without concrete evidence of filings, the base case holds. The peers’ analyses align with this and slightly increase my confidence in the downside being at least as likely as any surprise surge. Therefore I keep my prior estimate unchanged.",
