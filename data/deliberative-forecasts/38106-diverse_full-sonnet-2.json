    "review": "Both forecasters make compelling arguments that have caused me to reconsider my initial assessment. Forecaster 2's emphasis on the dependency chain is particularly strong: even if June 2 talks succeed, that leaves less than 4 weeks for planning and executing a presidential trip to an adversary nation—something that typically requires months of advance preparation. This is a more concrete logistical constraint than I initially weighted. Forecaster 3's point about venue selection is also important: even if progress warrants a summit, why would the first meeting be in Russia rather than Washington, a neutral location, or even Istanbul where talks are occurring? A Russia visit would be the most politically controversial option and hardest to justify domestically. The fact that the U.S. isn't even sending a delegation to the June 2 talks signals limited engagement with the process, making a sudden Trump visit even more improbable. Both forecasters correctly emphasize that we'd need a chain of low-probability events: breakthrough on June 2, immediate decision for presidential summit, choice of Russia as venue, and successful execution in 3.5 weeks. Each link in this chain has low probability, and their product is very low.",
    "rationale": "Upon reflection, my initial 8% was too generous. The logical requirements for a 'Yes' outcome form a more tenuous chain than I initially assessed. The dependency on June 2 results creates a hard constraint—serious consideration of a Trump-Putin summit likely cannot begin until after those talks, leaving an extremely compressed timeline. Presidential trips to adversary nations require extensive security planning, advance teams, diplomatic preparation, and political groundwork that simply cannot be accomplished in 3-4 weeks. Even in the optimistic scenario where June 2 produces a breakthrough, the first summit would more likely occur in Washington or neutral territory for optical and political reasons. The combination of: (1) no current planning or announcements, (2) poor recent diplomatic atmosphere, (3) U.S. not participating in June 2 talks, (4) logical preference for non-Russia venue, and (5) insurmountable logistical timeline, makes this outcome highly improbable. However, I maintain a small non-zero probability because Trump has demonstrated willingness to make unprecedented diplomatic moves, and the February mutual invitations technically remain on the table. A probability around 5% appropriately reflects this is extremely unlikely while acknowledging it's not literally impossible.",
