    "review": "Both forecasters make compelling arguments that have caused me to reconsider my initial forecast. Forecaster 3 raises a particularly important procedural point I underweighted: FATF black list changes are typically well-signaled in advance through ICRG evaluations and prior plenary communiqués. With only 3-4 weeks until the June plenary and no such signals evident as of mid-May 2025, this is strong evidence against changes occurring. Forecaster 2 reinforces this with the observation that Russia has remained suspended through multiple plenaries since February 2023 without being formally listed, suggesting this is a deliberate political compromise rather than a temporary state. Both forecasters also correctly note that any Pakistan escalation resulting from India's intelligence would be procedurally and politically implausible by June - I had insufficiently considered the timeline constraints. The consensus around the February 2025 plenary making no black list changes while focusing on grey list activity is compelling evidence of where FATF's attention lies. However, I find Forecaster 3's 7% slightly too low given inherent uncertainties and the possibility of information we lack access to.",
    "rationale": "I am updating my forecast significantly downward from 20% to 13%. The key factors driving this revision are: (1) The procedural argument about telegraphing - major FATF black list changes are typically preceded by clear public signals through ICRG processes, and we see none as of mid-May with only 3-4 weeks to go; (2) The time constraint is more binding than I initially appreciated - consensus-building at FATF for black list changes takes substantial time; (3) Russia's continued suspension without formal listing through multiple plenaries since February 2023 demonstrates FATF's deliberate avoidance of this escalation; (4) The February 2025 plenary's focus on grey list changes rather than black list modifications shows where institutional attention lies. I'm not going as low as 7% because some tail risk remains for unexpected geopolitical developments or non-public information that could emerge in the final weeks. Additionally, we cannot completely rule out a severe governance failure in a grey-listed jurisdiction that forces rapid escalation, though this appears unlikely. The 13% forecast maintains appropriate humility about uncertainty while incorporating the strong procedural and temporal constraints identified by my fellow forecasters.",
