    "review": "Forecaster 3 raises a critical procedural point I underweighted: the resolution requires 'the IMF agreeing to provide money,' which in practice means Executive Board approval, not merely a staff-level agreement. The 2022 precedent where Lebanon's SLA never reached Board approval is highly relevant. The timeline mechanics are more constraining than I initially assessed - even after a June 10 breakthrough, Lebanon must complete prior actions, allow IMF staff to draft board papers, circulate them (typically 1+ week minimum), and secure a Board meeting before July 1. That's an extremely compressed timeline. Forecaster 2 correctly emphasizes Lebanon's consistent political gridlock and the IMF's own 'slow' progress characterization as strong negative signals. Both forecasters provide more realistic assessments of the procedural hurdles. However, I don't fully adopt Forecaster 3's 13% because some probability remains for emergency fast-tracking given the crisis conditions and high-level political pressure. The active negotiations and June 10 second round still matter.",
    "rationale": "Upon reflection, my initial 35% was too optimistic because I insufficiently weighted the procedural requirements. The question requires an announced, signed agreement where 'the IMF agrees to provide money' - this almost certainly requires Executive Board approval, not just negotiator agreement. The timeline is thus: complete prior actions (contentious bank-restructuring law) → finalize staff-level agreement → draft/clear board documents → circulate to board (1+ weeks) → board meeting/approval → announcement. With only 31 days from May 30, getting through all these steps when negotiations just began and the IMF characterizes progress as 'slow' with 'specific concerns' is extremely challenging. Lebanon's 2022 failure to move from SLA to Board approval demonstrates this risk. However, the genuine crisis pressure, EU conditionality, active mission with scheduled June 10 talks, and presidential urgency create a non-trivial probability of either: (a) rapid breakthrough and fast-tracked board process, or (b) emergency facility consideration. These factors prevent me from going as low as 13%. My forecast should fall significantly from 35% toward the 18-22% range.",
