    "no_outcome_scenario": "Fetterman remains frustrated with some Democrats but continues serving as a Democratic senator through July 1, 2025. Despite tensions reported in media, he does not take the dramatic step of switching parties or resigning in the short time remaining.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Fetterman, isolated and angry with Democratic leadership, announces he is switching to become an Independent or Republican before July 1, 2025. Alternatively, though he said he wouldn't, he could resign from the Senate entirely due to the ongoing controversy.",
    "rationale": "This question has an extremely short time horizon of only 33 days. The background articles indicate tensions - Fetterman is described as 'isolated' and 'angry,' and there's been some controversy requiring him to explicitly state he won't resign. Notably, Republican Dave McCormick has publicly supported him, which is unusual cross-party behavior.\n\nHowever, several strong factors favor the status quo: (1) Fetterman explicitly stated he won't resign, (2) party switching mid-term is exceptionally rare - perhaps occurring once or twice per decade across the entire Senate, (3) even senators with significant friction with their party almost never switch, (4) the time frame is very short for such a dramatic decision, and (5) being 'isolated and angry' is far from sufficient to predict a party switch.\n\nThe base rate for a senator switching parties or resigning in any random 33-day period is extremely low, likely under 0.1% historically. Even accounting for elevated tensions, this would be a shocking political move. While the controversy is real enough to generate national coverage, there's no concrete evidence of plans to leave the Democratic caucus.\n\nFor my forecast to increase, I would need: reports of meetings with Republican leadership, explicit statements about considering a switch, or credible insider sources reporting imminent action. For it to decrease further: strong reaffirmations of Democratic membership or clear resolution of the controversy.\n\nGiven the extraordinary rarity of such moves, the short timeframe, and only circumstantial evidence of serious consideration, I assess this probability at 3%.",

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
