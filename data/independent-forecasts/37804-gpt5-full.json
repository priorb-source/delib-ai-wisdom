  "information": "In April 2025, U.S. Health and Human Services (HHS) Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. announced plans to instruct the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) to stop recommending community water fluoridation. HHS confirmed it would convene the Community Preventive Services Task Force to study and issue a new recommendation. Concurrently, the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is reviewing 'new scientific information' on potential health risks of fluoride. Additionally, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has begun the process of phasing out ingestible fluoride tablets and drops from the market.\n\nFlorida has become the second U.S. state, after Utah, to ban the addition of fluoride to public water supplies. Governor Ron DeSantis signed a law in May 2025 that prohibits additives not meeting a new definition of 'water quality additive,' effectively banning fluoride. The decision was supported by the state's surgeon general, who cited potential health risks. This legislative action reflects a broader debate, with some recent studies raising concerns about potential links between fluoride exposure and neurodevelopmental issues in children, while organizations like the American Dental Association continue to support water fluoridation as a key public health measure.\n\nThe U.S. Public Health Service and the CDC last changed the recommended fluoride level in 2015, when it was updated from a range of 0.7–1.2 mg/L to a single level of 0.7 mg/L. That revision process took four years, including public comment periods and interagency review. As of spring 2025, major professional organizations including the American Dental Association (ADA), the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP), and the Association of State and Territorial Dental Directors (ASTDD) have reiterated their support for the current 0.7 mg/L recommendation.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "About 42 days (until July 1, 2025)",
    "status_quo_outcome": "Yes — the CDC page continues to recommend 0.7 mg/L as the optimal concentration.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "HHS directs CDC to suspend or withdraw the recommendation before the Task Force reports; CDC either removes the 0.7 mg/L language, posts that no specific level is recommended pending review, recommends a lower level, or pulls the page with no replacement.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "CDC leaves the existing 0.7 mg/L recommendation in place while HHS/Task Force conduct a longer review; the page remains unchanged through July 1, 2025.",
    "rationale": "- Timing: Only ~6 weeks remain. Large federal recommendation changes, especially reversals of long-standing public health guidance, usually take months and involve interagency review and communications planning. The 2015 change to 0.7 mg/L took years (though a full scientific process isn’t strictly required to pause a web-stated recommendation).  \n- Signals from leadership: In April 2025, HHS Secretary RFK Jr. announced plans to review guidance and reportedly to instruct CDC to stop recommending fluoridation. HHS also said it would convene the Community Preventive Services Task Force to study and issue a new recommendation. That points to a process rather than an immediate switch.  \n- Parallel agency moves: EPA is reviewing new information; FDA is moving to phase out ingestible fluoride tablets/drops. These increase political pressure but do not necessitate a rapid CDC reversal.  \n- Stakeholder resistance: Major professional bodies (ADA, AAP, ASTDD) reiterate support for 0.7 mg/L. CDC’s Division of Oral Health and the historical U.S. Public Health Service position favor fluoridation. Abruptly removing the recommendation would trigger significant pushback.  \n- Practical feasibility of a quick ‘No’: Politically, an administration can change web content quickly (precedent: climate pages in 2017). If HHS prioritizes a swift signal, CDC could edit or pull the page in days, which would resolve this question as No. However, given that a formal review via the Task Force was announced, the more conservative expectation over a 6‑week horizon is that the 0.7 mg/L text remains while the review proceeds.  \nWhy not higher: There is explicit top-down intent to reconsider or halt CDC’s recommendation; the administration could order a temporary suspension or page removal before July 1. That keeps a meaningful tail risk (roughly one-third) that the page is changed or taken down.  \nWhy not lower: Institutional inertia, the short timeline, and the convening of a formal review process all favor the status quo through July 1. There has been no report of an imminent Task Force conclusion or formal directive to immediately remove the recommendation.  \nWhat would move me down: Any CDC/HHS notice that the page is ‘under review’ with removal of the 0.7 mg/L statement; a press release instructing CDC to suspend the recommendation; the CDC page going offline; credible reporting that the Task Force issued an interim finding against recommending a specific level.  \nWhat would move me up: Public HHS/CDC statements clarifying that existing guidance remains in effect pending a months-long review; Task Force timelines indicating no decision before late 2025; visible updates to other materials reaffirming 0.7 mg/L in the interim.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill the CDC still recommend 0.7 mg/L fluoride as the optimal level in community water supplies on July 1, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nNPR: [HHS will review guidance on the addition of fluoride to drinking water](https://www.npr.org/2025/04/10/g-s1-59452/hhs-rfk-fluoride-drinking-water-epa)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if the CDC's [Community Water Fluoridation Recommendations](https://www.cdc.gov/fluoridation/about/community-water-fluoridation-recommendations.html) recommends greater than or equal to 0.7 mg/L as the concentration that maximizes fluoride's oral health benefits while minimizing potential harms. If a lesser amount is recommended or if there is no longer any recommendation at all, then the question resolves as **No**.\n\nIf the page is pulled offline with no replacement, this question also resolves as **No**.\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nIn April 2025, U.S. Health and Human Services (HHS) Secretary Robert F.

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
