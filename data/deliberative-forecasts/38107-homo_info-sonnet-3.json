    "review": "The other forecasters provide valuable additional considerations. Forecaster 2's observation that Comey was already interviewed by the Secret Service without being arrested is particularly significant - this suggests authorities did not find immediate probable cause, which is strong evidence against imminent arrest. Forecaster 3's distinction between indictment and arrest is also important, though the question's definition of arrest as 'submission to an officer's show of force' likely includes voluntary surrender. Both forecasters are slightly higher than me at 5% and 8% respectively. Their reasoning is sound, but I believe they may be slightly overweighting tail risk given the concrete evidence we have: no charges filed, no warrants issued, legal barriers remain high, and the already-completed interview without arrest. The fact that we're now at May 30 with only 32 days remaining and zero legal actions taken is quite telling. If prosecutors were moving toward arrest, we would typically see precursor actions like grand jury convening or warrant applications. The convergence of our forecasts in the 3-8% range suggests appropriate calibration on a low-probability event with an active investigation creating non-zero risk.",
    "rationale": "After reviewing the other analyses, I'm reinforcing my low forecast. The key new insight - that Comey was already interviewed without arrest - actually supports staying at the lower end of the range rather than updating upward. This indicates the Secret Service had opportunity to arrest if they found immediate probable cause, and chose not to. With 32 days remaining and no charges, warrants, or grand jury activity reported, the probability of arrest remains very low. The legal barriers (First Amendment, Supreme Court precedent requiring subjective intent, Comey's innocent explanation) remain formidable. The base rate for arresting former FBI directors for social media posts is essentially zero. While I acknowledge some tail risk from political unpredictability and the active investigation, the concrete evidence overwhelmingly points to no arrest. The other forecasters' slightly higher estimates (5% and 8%) may appropriately capture additional uncertainty, but the lack of any legal progress toward arrest as of May 30 keeps me at the lower end.",
