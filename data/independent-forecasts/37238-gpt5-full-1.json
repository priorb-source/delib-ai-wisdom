  "information": "Donald Trump has a history of attending high-profile sporting events. His recent UFC appearances include UFC 309 in November 2024 and UFC 314 on April 13, 2025. His attendance at UFC 314 was noted on his official public schedule. The time between UFC 314 in Miami and UFC 316 in Newark is less than two months. Some analyses of his past behavior suggest he rarely attends two UFC events in such close succession.\n\nUFC 316 is scheduled for June 7, 2025, at the Prudential Center in Newark, New Jersey. The event's main fight is a bantamweight title rematch between Sean O'Malley and Merab Dvalishvili. Donald Trump and UFC President Dana White have a long-standing public friendship. In the past, Trump hosted early UFC events at his properties, including the Trump Taj Mahal in Atlantic City. White has publicly supported Trump, including an appearance at the 2024 National Republican Convention.\n\nAt UFC 314 in Miami on April 13, 2025, Donald Trump was seen with Dana White and Elon Musk. Reports also mentioned the presence of political figures such as Kash Patel, Robert F. Kennedy Jr., Tulsi Gabbard, Kristi Noem, Ted Cruz, and Marco Rubio. Trump was greeted by Shaquille O'Neal and Joe Rogan, and he entered the arena to the song 'American Bad Ass' by Kid Rock, receiving a positive reaction from the crowd.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "About 38 days (until Saturday, June 7, 2025)",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No — he attends only a minority of UFC pay-per-view events; without new signals, the default is non-attendance.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Trump has conflicting presidential travel (e.g., an international meeting or commemoration around June 6–8) or simply chooses not to go. No credible schedule note or on-the-day sightings emerge, and he never appears within the Prudential Center grounds.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Dana White extends a public or private invite; Trump’s weekend plans put him at Bedminster/NYC; short motorcade to Newark is feasible. He arrives with Secret Service and is seen cageside or in a suite at the Prudential Center during UFC 316.",
    "rationale": "Base rate first: UFC runs monthly PPVs; Trump typically attends a minority of them. That makes “No” the status-quo outcome. Countervailing factors: UFC 316 is in Newark, close to Trump’s Bedminster property and NYC, reducing time and security friction. He has a long, public relationship with Dana White and has repeatedly appeared at UFC cards. Recent behavior: he attended UFC 309 (Nov 2024) and UFC 314 (Apr 13, 2025). Attending again less than two months later is somewhat uncommon for him, which pulls the probability down. Still, location convenience and the high-profile main event (O’Malley–Dvalishvili) push it up relative to a generic card. Key uncertainties: potential presidential commitments around early June (e.g., overseas travel near June 6, or other official events) could preclude attendance. Evidence from the research assistant influencing this forecast: his recent attendance at UFC 314 as a sitting president, the Newark venue/date (June 7), the O’Malley title fight, and the strong Trump–White relationship. Why not higher? He attends only some cards; he just went to 314; official duties may conflict. Why not lower? Newark proximity and his pattern of showing up to marquee UFC events materially increase feasibility. What would move me up: credible schedule indications placing him in NJ/NY that weekend; statements from Dana White/UFC hinting at his presence; local donor events at Bedminster the same weekend; travel plans that keep him domestic. What would move me down: firm reports of overseas travel (e.g., a summit or commemoration) spanning June 6–8; security constraints at Prudential Center; personal health or emergent domestic crises that weekend.",
