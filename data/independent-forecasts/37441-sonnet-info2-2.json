  "information": "The EUR/USD pair is trading within a range of approximately 1.12 to 1.15. Technical analysis suggests that a break above 1.15 could lead to further gains, while falling below key support levels could signal a bearish cycle. Some analysts have set technical targets for the EUR/USD pair to reach 1.25 (equivalent to 0.80 USD/EUR) by late 2025. Historically, May has been a weak month for the EUR/USD pair, with an average negative return of 0.62% over the past 50 years. The Bloomberg Dollar Spot Index showed the dollar was down 7% for the year-to-date as of May 2025.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Approximately 56 days from May 6, 2025 to July 1, 2025, with the resolution window starting May 12, 2025",
    "status_quo_outcome": "NO - The current EUR/USD rate of approximately 1.12-1.15 means the USD is worth about 0.87-0.89 EUR, comfortably above the 0.80 EUR threshold",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "The dollar stabilizes or strengthens as tariff concerns ease, the Federal Reserve maintains its current policy stance, or European economic data disappoints. EUR/USD remains in its current range or moves lower, keeping USD worth more than 0.80 EUR throughout the period",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Escalating trade tensions, unexpected Fed dovishness, US fiscal concerns, or aggressive ECB hawkishness combine to drive EUR/USD rapidly from ~1.13 to 1.25 or higher within the next 1.5 months, causing USD to fall below 0.80 EUR",
    "rationale": "For USD to be worth under 0.80 EUR, EUR/USD must exceed 1.25. Currently trading at 1.12-1.15, this requires approximately a 10-11% appreciation in just 1.5 months. While the dollar has already declined 7% YTD and momentum exists (tariff turmoil, technical weakness), such a large move in this timeframe is historically rare for major currency pairs without a significant shock. Relevant factors from the research: (1) Some analysts target 1.25 by late 2025, not July 1; (2) May is historically weak for EUR/USD (averaging -0.62% over 50 years), which actually works against the needed upward move; (3) Normal monthly EUR/USD volatility is 2-3%, making a 10-11% move in 6-8 weeks uncommon. The established downtrend in the dollar and uncertainty environment provide some possibility, but status quo bias strongly favors the current range persisting. For the forecast to move higher, I would need evidence of accelerating dollar weakness, major policy shifts, or crisis conditions. For it to move lower, I would need signs the dollar weakness is exhausting or mean reversion signals. The combination of significant distance to cover, short timeframe, and historical volatility patterns suggests a low but non-negligible probability",

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
