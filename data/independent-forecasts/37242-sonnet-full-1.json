  "information": "Airlines increased their capacity to the Canary Islands for spring 2025. Jet2.com announced it would offer 1.6 million seats for the summer season, an 8% increase from 2024, with new routes from Bournemouth and London-Luton starting in April. Vueling offered over 145,000 seats to and from the islands for the Easter period, a 10% increase from the previous year. Air Nostrum increased its seat offerings by 7% for the same period. Binter also launched new routes from Córdoba to Gran Canaria starting in mid-April 2025.\n\nPassenger arrival data for the Canary Islands showed year-over-year growth in the first quarter of 2025. AENA reported that traffic in the Canary Islands grew by 3.6% in Q1 2025 compared to Q1 2024. Monthly data showed a 2.2% increase in February and another 2.2% increase in March compared to the same months in 2024. The Easter holiday period in 2025 fell entirely within April, whereas in 2024, it was in late March.\n\nOn April 28, 2025, a massive power outage occurred on the Iberian Peninsula, affecting mainland Spain and Portugal. While the Canary Islands' power grid was not directly hit, the event caused significant disruptions to air travel. Reports indicated that air traffic at major hubs was operating at reduced capacity, leading to widespread flight delays and cancellations. Canary Islands airports experienced knock-on effects, with numerous flights connecting to the mainland being cancelled or delayed. One government official stated that 344 out of 6,000 scheduled flights in Spain were cancelled on that day.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Approximately 1 month. The April 2025 passenger arrival data is expected to be published in early June 2025.",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No - arrivals would NOT fall. The established trend shows continued growth in passenger arrivals to the Canary Islands.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "The positive growth trend continues through April 2025. The Easter holiday falling entirely within April 2025 (versus late March 2024) provides a significant boost to passenger numbers. Increased airline capacity materializes into higher arrivals. The April 28 power outage causes limited disruption affecting only the final 2-3 days of the month, insufficient to offset the growth throughout the rest of April.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "The April 28 power outage and its cascading effects severely disrupt air travel for the final days of April, causing substantial flight cancellations beyond the initial 344 flights. Combined with softer demand from concerns about Trump's policies affecting US tourism and other economic factors, total April arrivals fall below April 2024 levels despite the favorable Easter calendar timing.",
    "rationale": "The baseline expectation strongly favors continued growth. Q1 2025 data showed consistent year-over-year increases: 3.6% overall growth, with February and March each up 2.2%. Multiple airlines increased capacity by 7-10% for spring 2025, indicating strong advance bookings.\n\nThe Easter calendar effect is particularly significant. Easter 2025 fell entirely within April, while Easter 2024 was in late March. Since Easter is a major travel period, this timing shift should substantially boost April 2025 numbers relative to April 2024.\n\nThe primary risk factor is the April 28 power outage on the Iberian Peninsula. However, its impact appears limited: (1) it occurred on April 28, affecting only the last 2-3 days of the month, (2) approximately 344 of 6,000 scheduled flights were cancelled on that day (~5.7%), (3) the Canary Islands' grid was not directly affected, experiencing only knock-on effects. Even assuming disruptions continued for 2-3 days, this would impact roughly 10% of the month's operations.\n\nTrump policy concerns mentioned in the background article represent potential future headwinds but are unlikely to have materialized significantly by April 2025. US tourists are not the primary market for the Canary Islands (UK, Germany, and mainland Spain are larger sources).\n\nFor arrivals to decline despite the positive trend, increased capacity, and favorable Easter timing would require the power outage to have had far more severe and prolonged impacts than currently evident. The weight of evidence points strongly toward continued growth.\n\nI'm not forecasting higher confidence in growth because: (1) the power outage did create real disruption in the final days, (2) there's inherent measurement and reporting uncertainty, (3) unknown factors could have emerged during April.\n\nI'm not forecasting higher probability of decline because: (1) the positive trend has been consistent and strong, (2) the Easter calendar effect is substantial and mechanical, (3) airline capacity increases suggest robust advance bookings, (4) the power outage affected only a small portion of the month.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill inbound airline passenger arrivals to the Canary Islands fall in April 2025 compared with April 2024?\n\nQuestion background:\n[Canarias braces for the consequences of Trump's policies on tourism, potentially leading to a decline in tourist arrivals from the US](https://diariodeavisos.elespanol.com/2025/04/turismo-aranceles/)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if the total number of passenger arrivals to the Canary Islands for the month of April 2025, as presented at the [Canary Islands Tourism Research site](https://investigacion.turismodeislascanarias.com/en/inbound-tourism-arrival-passengers/monthly-data), is lower than the total number for April 2024. If the number for April 2025 is greater than or equal to the number for April 2024, the question resolves as **No**.\n\nSpecifically, Metaculus will access \"Passenger arrivals (AENA). April 2025,\" which is expected to be posted in the beginning of June 2025. The numbers considered will be the monthly totals under Canary Islands. For example, in the [February 2025 report](https://investigacion.turismodeislascanarias.com/sites/default/files/2025-03/Promotur_AENA_febrero%202025_EN.pdf), the number shown for February 2025 is 2,248,198 and the number shown for February 2024 is 2,199,255. Thus, if the question had been comparing February 2025 with February 2024, it would have resolved as No, because the number went up.\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nAirlines increased their capacity to the Canary Islands for spring 2025.
