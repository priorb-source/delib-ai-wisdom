    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "About 32 days (until July 1, 2025)",
    "status_quo_outcome": "Yes — the BC Hydro EV home charger rebate page continues to state Tesla products are not eligible.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Between now and July 1, BC Hydro either (1) removes the explicit mention of Tesla from the EV home charger rebate page (even if the underlying exclusion remains via broader “U.S.-made goods” language), (2) reinstates Tesla’s eligibility, or (3) reorganizes/sunsets the page so it no longer states Tesla is ineligible.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "BC Hydro keeps the March 12 policy language intact on the EV home charger rebate page and continues to explicitly state that Tesla products are not eligible.",
    "rationale": "- Evidence/status quo: As of March 12, 2025, BC Hydro explicitly excludes Tesla products from CleanBC/BC Hydro rebates to preference Canadian goods and exclude U.S.-produced goods where practicable. This is a fresh policy with clear political backing and aligns with provincial industrial policy goals (support Canadian manufacturers like FLO/United Chargers). Website and program language typically have inertia over short horizons.\n- Timing: Only ~1 month remains before resolution. Rapid policy reversals or wording changes are unlikely absent strong pressure.\n- Incentives for continued explicit mention: Tesla is the most common brand customers ask about. Keeping the Tesla call-out reduces customer confusion and contact center load, making it likely the explicit wording persists at least through July.\n- Risks lowering the probability: The resolution hinges on that page explicitly mentioning Tesla by name. BC Hydro could shift to more generic wording (“U.S.-produced goods are excluded”) or restructure content, which would resolve No even if the exclusion substantively remains. Also, albeit unlikely on this timeline, legal/trade concerns or political pushback could prompt a messaging change.\n- Why not higher: Non-trivial risk that BC Hydro edits the page for generality, moves brand-specific text to a different page/FAQ, or updates the program copy during a routine content refresh, removing the explicit Tesla reference.\n- Why not lower: The policy is recent and politically aligned; there is limited time for challenges or reversals; public/industry pressure sufficient to change explicit wording quickly seems unlikely.\n- What would move me up: Confirmation in June that the exact page still names Tesla as ineligible; government or BC Hydro statements reinforcing the brand-specific exclusion; program updates highlighting Canadian-preference with explicit Tesla call-out.\n- What would move me down: Early June website edits removing brand-specific language from that page; announcements signaling a shift to broader origin-based criteria without naming Tesla; indications of legal/policy reconsideration or program suspension/restructuring.\n- Research assistant summary: No additional information beyond the quoted policy; thus the forecast leans heavily on status quo stickiness and short horizon.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill BC Hydro still exclude Tesla from its EV charger rebate program for single-family homes in July 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nAccording to the resolution source, \"The Government of B.C. and BC Hydro are taking action to preference Canadian goods in our rebate programs going forward and to exclude, where practicable, U.S. produced goods. As of March 12, 2025, Tesla products (electric vehicle chargers, energy storage batteries and inverters) are not eligible for CleanBC and BC Hydro rebates. If you purchased or have received pre-approval for your Tesla product before March 12, 2025, it can still qualify for rebates and will be processed as normal.\"\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if BC Hydro at [this page](https://www.bchydro.com/powersmart/electric-vehicles/rebates-incentives/rebates-home-chargers.html) when checked by Metaculus on or after July 1, 2025, says that Tesla products are not eligible for the EV charger at home program. If it does not mention Tesla being ineligible, then this question resolves as **No**.\n\n\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nNo additional information available.\n\nToday is 2025-05-30.\n\nBefore answering you think:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n(e) You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
