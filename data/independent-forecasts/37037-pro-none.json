    "status_quo_outcome": "No",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "The US government makes no changes to the Harmonized Tariff Schedule concerning Lesotho before the resolution date. The additional Section 232 tariff on steel remains listed as +25%, not +50%, thus the condition is not met. Alternatively, the US government corrects the long-standing error and removes Lesotho from the list of countries subject to the tariff, which also results in a 'No' outcome.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "A major administrative error or an unexpected, drastic shift in US trade policy occurs. In a revision of tariff schedules, a new additional duty of 50% is created, and Lesotho is mistakenly included in this category. This would require an active, and likely erroneous, change to the tariff schedule in a very short timeframe.",
    "rationale": "My forecast is overwhelmingly based on the current text of the US Harmonized Tariff Schedule (HTS). The status quo is that there is no '+ 50%' tariff listed for Lesotho. The Section 232 additional tariff on steel products, which has mistakenly applied to Lesotho for years, is explicitly listed as '+ 25%' (e.g., in subheading 9903.80.01). Therefore, for the question to resolve 'Yes', an active change to the HTS would be required. The 50% figure appears to stem from a 2020 AP news article which likely misinterpreted the tariff structure. There is no discernible political or economic motivation for the US to increase an already erroneous tariff on a friendly nation like Lesotho. Given the very short timeframe until the resolution date, bureaucratic inertia makes the continuation of the status quo (a 'No' outcome) the most likely scenario. An active change to introduce a new, higher, and unsubstantiated tariff is extremely improbable. My probability is not zero to account for the minute chance of a significant clerical error during a potential HTS update. It is not higher because a 'Yes' outcome requires a specific action that runs contrary to all available evidence and logical policy drivers. I would raise my forecast only if I saw official documentation from the Commerce Department or USTR proposing a 50% tariff that would apply to Lesotho.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill the US government's harmonized tarifff schedule list the tariff on Lesotho as 50% on June 1, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nAP: [How tiny Lesotho ended up with the highest US tariffs in the world](https://apnews.com/article/lesotho-us-trump-tariffs-b337efa47290e889aa076cc9ede7bc9d)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if the duty provided in the applicable subheading is + 50% for Lesotho at the American government's [harmonized tariff schedule](https://hts.usitc.gov/search?query=lesotho) when accessed by Metaculus on or after June 1, 2025.\n\nWhether the provision is listed as suspended will not affect resolution.\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nNo additional information available.\n\nToday is 2025-04-23.\n\nBefore answering you think:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n(e) You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
