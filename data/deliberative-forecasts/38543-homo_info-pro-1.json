    "review": "My initial forecast and those of the other two forecasters are in strong agreement on the primary driver: the extremely short 15-day timeframe makes a visit highly improbable. However, the other forecasters introduced two crucial pieces of evidence I had not considered, which I find highly persuasive. Forecaster 3 pointed out President Trump's confirmed international travel schedule, with the G7 summit ending June 18 and the NATO summit beginning June 24. This creates a nearly impossible logistical window for a trip to China. Forecaster 2 introduced a key tariff deadline of July 8, which is after the question's resolution date. This detail effectively removes the most plausible motivation for a rushed, last-minute summit. Together, these two arguments convincingly demonstrate that a visit is not only logistically improbable but also lacks a compelling, urgent rationale.",
    "rationale": "I am significantly updating my forecast downward from 5% to 1%. My initial analysis correctly identified the logistical difficulty of a presidential visit on short notice, but it failed to account for the specific, hard constraints presented by my fellow forecasters. The combination of President Trump's packed G7/NATO travel schedule and the fact that the key tariff deadline falls after July 1st presents an overwhelming case against a visit occurring within the next two weeks. These new facts demonstrate that not only is there scarcely any time for a visit, but there is also no pressing deadline to motivate such an extraordinary diplomatic effort. My original 5% forecast gave too much weight to the 'Trump factor' and the general political will for a meeting, while underestimating these concrete, practical barriers. The new probability of 1% now correctly reflects the extreme unlikelihood of a visit, while still allowing for a minuscule chance of an unpredictable 'black swan' event.",
