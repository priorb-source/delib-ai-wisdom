    "review": "All three forecasters identify similar core issues: the NYT article provides evidence of tariff action against Switzerland, but we face significant uncertainty around implementation details and timing. Forecaster 2 makes compelling points about specificity risk - the conjunction of multiple precise conditions (exactly 31%, exactly June 1, exactly subheading 9903.01.60) creates multiplicative uncertainty. Each requirement is a potential failure point. Forecaster 3's analysis closely parallels mine but is slightly more cautious. The most important insight from this deliberation is recognizing that 'No additional information available' from the research assistant is actually significant evidence - if 31% was definitively announced with June 1 implementation, we'd expect more confirmation. The question's extreme specificity could indicate real policy details, but it also means small deviations (30% instead of 31%, May 31 or June 2 instead of June 1) would result in a NO resolution. I initially underweighted the compound probability challenge: even if each individual condition is likely, their conjunction is less so.",
    "rationale": "Upon reflection, I was too optimistic about the alignment of all specific conditions. While the NYT article confirms tariff policy movement toward Switzerland, several factors warrant downward adjustment: (1) Compound specificity - requiring exactly 31%, exactly June 1, and exactly the right subheading multiplies uncertainty. If P(tariff on Switzerland)=0.85, P(exactly 31%)=0.75, P(by June 1)=0.80, P(correct subheading)=0.95, then P(all)≈0.49. (2) The research assistant's lack of confirming details despite the question's precision suggests uncertainty about whether these exact parameters are locked in. (3) Switzerland's diplomatic sophistication and negotiating leverage could result in rate modifications. (4) Typical tariff implementation faces procedural delays and adjustments. However, I'm not going as low as Forecaster 2's 45% because: the question's specific construction suggests real policy basis (questions aren't written with arbitrary numbers), the timeline is feasible if already announced, and the Trump administration has demonstrated capacity for rapid tariff implementation. Balancing these considerations, I'm adjusting down to 55%.",
