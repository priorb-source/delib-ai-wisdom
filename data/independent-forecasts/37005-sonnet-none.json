    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "The 2025 Canadian federal election must occur by October 2025 at the latest, given the fixed-date election law (October 2025 would be four years after the September 2021 election). However, as a minority government, it could be called earlier. From April 21, 2025, we're likely looking at 2-6 months until the election occurs, with the outcome known within days of the vote.",
    "status_quo_outcome": "The Liberal Party currently holds 160 seats from the 2021 election, forming a minority government. The status quo outcome would be that the Liberals maintain roughly their current seat count or potentially lose seats, falling well short of the 172 threshold. Recent political dynamics suggest the Liberals are facing headwinds rather than tailwinds going into the next election.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "The most likely scenario for a No outcome is a continuation of recent polling trends showing the Conservative Party ahead. The Liberals would either maintain their minority position with 150-170 seats, or lose additional seats to the Conservatives and other parties. Given that 170 seats represents a majority in the 338-seat House of Commons, falling short of 172 seats could result from the Liberals winning another minority government or losing government entirely.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "For a Yes outcome, the Liberals would need to gain at least 12 seats from their 2021 result, crossing the majority threshold (170 seats) to reach 172+. This would require: a significant reversal in polling trends, a major Conservative scandal or misstep during the campaign, strong economic performance credited to the Liberal government, successful Liberal campaigning on key wedge issues, or effective vote efficiency improvements in competitive ridings.",
    "rationale": "The status quo strongly suggests this outcome is unlikely. The Liberals won 160 seats in 2021, and reaching 172 seats requires gaining 12+ seats net—a 7.5% increase that would put them into majority territory. Historically, minority governments in Canada face difficulty gaining seats in subsequent elections, as they typically lose support over time. While I lack current polling data from my research assistant, the general pattern suggests the Liberals have been struggling relative to the Conservatives under Pierre Poilievre's leadership. The question asks for a specific threshold (172 seats) that represents not just maintaining power, but achieving a majority government. This is a high bar. To be a good forecaster, I must weight the status quo heavily: governments don't often surge from minority to majority positions absent extraordinary circumstances. My forecast is not higher because: there's no evidence of a Liberal surge, minority governments typically lose rather than gain support, and we're past the midpoint of a typical parliamentary term when governing parties usually face voter fatigue. My forecast is not lower (i.e., not near zero) because: elections remain several months away allowing time for dramatic shifts, campaigns matter and can change dynamics, the Liberals have experienced campaign resources and could run effectively, and unforeseen events could reshape the race. I would update higher if: polling shows a significant Liberal recovery, a major Conservative scandal emerges, economic indicators dramatically improve, or leadership changes reinvigorate Liberal support. I would update lower if: polling shows further Conservative gains, the election is called soon while Liberals trail significantly, or Liberal seat projections consistently show them well below the threshold.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill the Liberal Party win 172 or more seats in the 2025 Canadian federal election?\n\nQuestion background:\n[338Canada Federal Projection](https://338canada.com/federal.htm): \"The 338Canada project is a statistical model of electoral projections based on opinion polls, electoral history, and demographic data.

Fournier, physics and astrophysics professor at Cégep de Saint-Laurent in Montreal.\"\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if the Liberal Party of Canada wins greater than or equal to 172 seats in the [2025 Canadian federal election](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2025_Canadian_federal_election).\n\n\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nNo additional information available.\n\nToday is 2025-04-21.\n\nBefore answering you think:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n(e) You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
