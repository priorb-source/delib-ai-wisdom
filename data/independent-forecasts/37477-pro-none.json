    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "23 days. The outcome will be known on June 1, 2025, based on the newspaper front pages from May 9, 2025, to May 31, 2025.",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No. The status quo, as described in the question's background, is that tariffs are a dominant and persistent topic in US economic and political news, making their daily appearance on the front page of at least one major newspaper highly likely.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "A major, ongoing trade dispute, for instance with China or the EU, continues to escalate throughout May 2025. Daily developments, such as new tariff announcements, retaliatory threats, market reactions, and political debates, are significant enough to warrant a front-page mention in either The New York Times for its political implications or The Wall Street Journal for its economic impact every single day of the resolution period.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "On at least one day during the 23-day period, another major news event—such as a significant natural disaster, a different international crisis, or a major domestic political development—simultaneously dominates the front pages of both newspapers. This, or simply a temporary lull in tariff-related news on a quiet weekend, results in the word 'tariff(s)' being absent from both front pages for a single day, thus triggering a 'Yes' resolution.",
    "rationale": "My forecast is based on a conflict between the high newsworthiness of the topic and the low threshold for the question to resolve to 'Yes'. The background correctly identifies that tariffs, particularly in a political climate shaped by Donald Trump's policies, are a major and enduring news story. This creates a strong pull towards a 'No' outcome, as both the NYT and WSJ are prime outlets for such news. However, the resolution criteria are the decisive factor. A 'Yes' outcome is triggered by just a single day where both papers omit the word 'tariff(s)' from their front page. The resolution window is 23 days long. Over such a period, the natural volatility of the news cycle makes it highly probable that at least one day will occur where other events dominate. Front-page space is finite, and it is statistically unlikely for one specific topic to maintain an unbroken streak of mentions in at least one of two papers for over three weeks. Even the most significant ongoing stories (wars, pandemics) can be momentarily displaced by other breaking news. A quiet Saturday or a brief de-escalation in trade talks could easily produce the single day needed for a 'Yes' resolution. My research assistant's report indicated no additional information, so my analysis relies on these fundamental drivers. \n\nMy forecast is not higher than 70% because the premise that tariffs are a central, high-profile issue is very strong. An intense, escalating trade war could plausibly generate daily front-page news for 23 days, defying the odds. The chance of this 'No' outcome is non-trivial. \n\nMy forecast is not lower than 70% because the 23-day window provides many opportunities for the streak to be broken. The probability of a single, all-consuming news topic maintaining its grip for that long without a single day's interruption from competing news is low. \n\nI would update my forecast towards 'Yes' if a major de-escalation in trade policy were announced or if a different, massive, and enduring news story emerged. I would update towards 'No' if the US were to announce a dramatic and sweeping new set of tariffs at the start of the period, sparking an immediate global crisis that would guarantee daily coverage.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill the word \"tariff(s)\" disappear from the front print pages of The New York Times and Wall Street Journal by June 1, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nWhether reading the newspaper or social media or watching the news, it is highly likely you are going to see something about tariffs - mainly due to US President Donald Trump's renewed love for this somewhat antiquated form of taxation.\n\nThe New York Times and the Wall Street Journal are two of the largest print newspapers in the US. When, if ever, will we seen tariffs wiped from the front pages of both papers?\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question will resolve to \"Yes\" if, after \\[OPEN DATE] and before June 1, 2025, the words, \"tariff\" or \"tariffs\", do not appear on the print front page of The New York Times and the Wall Street Journal.

Format is: yyyy-mm-dd.</sup>\n\nGrammar is not relevant (e.g. \"TARIFF\" will suffice to prevent a \"No\" resolution).\n\n\"Tariff(s)\" must be omitted from both papers' front pages on the same day.\n\n\"Tariff(s)\" can appear anywhere on the page, it does not have to be in a title.\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nNo additional information available.\n\nToday is 2025-05-09.\n\nBefore answering you think:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n(e) You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
