    "review": "Both forecasters raise compelling arguments I initially missed. Most critically, they emphasize a historical structural pattern where UK leaders consistently poll higher than Japanese leaders specifically in Morning Consult data - even when UK PMs are domestically unpopular. Forecaster 3 makes an excellent methodological point: the question resolves on Morning Consult data specifically, not other polling sources. Re-examining the research report, the early May Morning Consult data showed Starmer at 36% vs Ishiba at 29% (Starmer +7), while the late-May figures (Starmer 28%, Ishiba 32%) came from 'other reports' - likely different polling sources. I incorrectly weighted these non-Morning Consult figures as my status quo baseline. Both forecasters also note the 7-day moving average smoothing effect, which makes dramatic swings less probable over just 32 days. Forecaster 3's point about Ishiba's gift-voucher scandal and historical Japanese PM approvals remaining in the low-20s provides important context I overlooked. The structural pattern in the specific resolution source is a powerful baseline that I undervalued.",
    "rationale": "I am significantly updating upward based on three key realizations: First, the last known Morning Consult data (early May) actually showed Starmer ahead by 7 points, not behind as I mistakenly believed by weighing other polling sources. Second, there appears to be a consistent structural advantage for UK leaders over Japanese leaders in Morning Consult's methodology - this is the specific resolution source, so other polls are less relevant. Third, the 7-day moving average smoothing means the 32 days remaining makes a complete reversal less likely without major shocks. Japanese PM approvals have been persistently low (Kishida in 20s, Ishiba at 26% post-scandal), while UK PMs maintain a higher floor in Morning Consult even when unpopular domestically. The June 11 UK spending review is a potential risk factor that could depress Starmer's numbers, preventing me from going as high as Forecaster 3 (68%). However, the structural factors and current Morning Consult baseline strongly favor a Yes outcome.",
