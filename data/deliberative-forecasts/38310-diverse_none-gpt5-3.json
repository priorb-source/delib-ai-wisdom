    "review": "Both forecasters emphasize strong base rates (in-person G7 attendance in 2023 and 2024) and the high diplomatic value of G7 for Ukraine, which I agree are the key drivers. Forecaster 2’s point that the window for disruptive events is narrowing as we enter June is a useful addition I hadn’t explicitly weighed; Forecaster 3 similarly stresses timing and lack of reported obstacles. I’m slightly less persuaded by pushing to 90% without public confirmation, given wartime volatility and the history of last‑minute changes to Zelenskyy’s travel. Still, their arguments justify nudging upward from my initial 75%, especially given the remote, highly secure venue (Kananaskis) and Canada’s strong support, which lower security/logistical friction.",
    "rationale": "Incentives and precedent strongly favor attendance: G7 is the premier platform for securing aid and alignment on sanctions/security guarantees, and Zelenskyy has shown a consistent pattern of attending top-tier fora in person when feasible (G7 2023, 2024). Canada as host increases the diplomatic payoff and likely eases logistics and security. We are already in June, which implies plans are advanced even if not publicly confirmed yet. Countervailing risks remain non-trivial: a sudden battlefield crisis, mass-strike campaign on Ukrainian infrastructure, or credible security intelligence could force a late change to virtual participation or cancellation. The absence of public confirmation keeps me short of 90%, but the base case is clearly “Yes.” I’m updating upward from 75% to reflect the strong base rate, timing, and the persuasive arguments from the other forecasters about motivation and opportunity.",
