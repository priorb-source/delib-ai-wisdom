    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Approximately one month. The outcome will be confirmed by the end of the festival on June 29, 2025.",
    "status_quo_outcome": "Yes. Kneecap are currently on the official Glastonbury 2025 lineup and, if nothing changes, they are scheduled to perform.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Following sustained political and media pressure, and considering the risks associated with an active police investigation into the band, the Glastonbury organisers decide to remove Kneecap from the lineup to protect the festival's reputation and ensure site security.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "The Glastonbury organisers withstand the pressure, possibly framing it as a defence of artistic freedom. The controversy subsides, the police investigation does not result in immediate action, and Kneecap performs their scheduled set as planned.",
    "rationale": "The core of this forecast is a conflict between Glastonbury's counter-cultural ethos and the significant legal and reputational risks posed by Kneecap's recent controversies. The status quo is that the band is scheduled to play, which provides a strong baseline for a 'Yes' outcome. It requires an active decision by the organisers to remove them. Glastonbury has a long history of weathering political storms and defending controversial artistic bookings.\n\nHowever, the factors favouring a 'No' outcome are exceptionally strong. The primary risk is not their generally provocative nature, but the specific police reports concerning alleged support for Hamas and Hezbollah, which are proscribed terrorist organisations in the UK. This elevates the issue from one of bad taste or political dissent to one of potential criminal activity. A major festival like Glastonbury, which coordinates closely with police and security services, will be extremely wary of the legal liability and security implications of hosting a band under active investigation for such offenses. The political pressure from MPs and mainstream media outlets adds significant weight to this risk.\n\nMy probability is not lower than 40% because the band is still on the lineup just one month before the event, suggesting the organisers are hesitant to capitulate to pressure. Glastonbury's organisers, particularly the Eavis family, may feel a principled obligation to resist what they see as censorship. They may be waiting for the police to conclude their investigation or for the media cycle to move on.\n\nMy probability is not higher than 40% because the allegation of supporting proscribed groups is a uniquely challenging one for a UK-based event. It creates a tangible security and legal risk that is harder to defend on artistic grounds compared to general anti-establishment rhetoric. The potential for brand damage and spillovers into the festival's complex security and licensing arrangements is substantial, making a cancellation a prudent, if reluctant, choice for the organisers.\n\nI would increase my forecast if the Metropolitan Police were to publicly drop their investigation or if Glastonbury's organisers issued a definitive statement of support. Conversely, I would decrease my forecast significantly if the police announced they were pursuing charges or if a major festival partner or political figure escalated the pressure campaign.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill Kneecap perform at Glastonbury 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\n[Kneecap](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kneecap_\\(band\\)) are an Irish band who have significantly risen in popularity since their formation in 2017.&#x20;\n\nThe band is a trio consisting of: \"Mo Chara\" (Liam Óg Ó hAnnaidh), \"Móglaí Bap\" (Naoise Ó Caireallain), and \"DJ Próvaí\" (J. J. Ó Dochartaigh) whose songs consist of rap in a mixture of Irish Gaelic and English giving them a unique style.\n\nNamed after a [torture technique](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kneecapping) made infamous by the Irish Republican Army, the group are no stranger to controversies. Whilst most have been minor - complaints about profanity, drug use, violence in their songs, music videos and concerts, and promotion of Irish Republicanism - the band have come under a large amount of controversy resulting in cancelled performances which initially stemmed from a Coachcella performance where the band, \"described Israel's military action in Gaza as a US-funded genocide\".&#x20;\n\nOn top of this, [two reports were made](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/cly5r4gg7l6o) to the UK Metropolitan police:\n\n> \\[...] the band allegedly call for the death of Conservative MPs. Another seems to show a band member shouting \"up Hamas, up Hezbollah\". Both groups are banned in the UK and it is a crime to express support for them.\n\n> \\[...]\n\n> They claimed that footage where they appeared to say \"the only good Tory is a dead Tory\" had been \"taken out of all context\", and apologised for the hurt caused to the families of murdered MPs Jo Cox and Sir David Amess.\n\nThe band are [due](https://www.glastonburyfestivals.co.uk/line-up/) to play at Glastonbury 2025 - the UK's largest and most prestigious music festival - however there have been [calls](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/politics/2025/04/30/kneecap-should-be-banned-full-stop-after-dead-tories-video/) for the band to be removed from the lineup.\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question will resolve as **Yes** if Kneecap officially performs at Glastonbury 2025, scheduled for June 25 to June 29, 2025.\n\n* If Glastonbury 2025 does not take place before September 1, 2025 this question will be **annulled**.\n* Officially perform is defined as a planned performance as allowed by the festival organisers.\n* Any official performance is considered sufficient for this question. If, for example, one band member is banned from the festival, the question will still resolve as **Yes** if the other member(s) perform under the name Kneecap.\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nNo additional information available.\n\nToday is 2025-05-23.\n\nBefore answering you think:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n(e) You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
