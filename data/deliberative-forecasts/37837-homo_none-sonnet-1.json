    "review": "All three analyses converge on similar reasoning with limited data, producing forecasts in the 40-52% range. We all calculated the same historical baseline (~300 reports/month from 180,000 over 50 years) and acknowledged seasonal advantages for June. Forecaster 3 raises an interesting meta-point: the question's 400-report threshold likely represents a meaningful benchmark, possibly \"around or slightly above\" recent monthly medians, suggesting question designers calibrated it to current patterns rather than historical averages. However, I'm cautious about over-indexing on this inference - the threshold could simply be a round number above the historical mean. Forecaster 2's framing of 400 as \"top-tertile performance\" relative to historical baseline is compelling and emphasizes that we're forecasting a notable deviation without evidence of specific catalysts. The 12-point spread (40-52%) indicates reasonable agreement despite our uncertainty. No forecaster introduced concrete data on recent monthly trends, which remains the critical missing piece.",
    "rationale": "Upon reflection, I find Forecaster 2's more conservative approach slightly more compelling given the absence of data supporting elevated recent baselines. While seasonal factors and increased UAP interest provide upward pressure, the burden of proof should favor status quo outcomes when forecasting without triggering events or recent trend data. Forecaster 3's meta-inference about threshold calibration is interesting but speculative - we shouldn't assume question designers have perfect information about 2025 patterns when creating questions in advance. The fact that 400 represents approximately 33% above the long-term historical average suggests it's asking whether an above-average month will occur. Without evidence that recent years consistently exceed 400, and given that most months should cluster around typical values, modest skepticism is warranted. However, June's seasonal advantages (longer days, better weather, more outdoor activity) and continued UAP media attention prevent me from being as conservative as the 40% forecast. I'm adjusting slightly downward from 48% to 45%, giving more weight to status quo bias while maintaining recognition of factors that could drive above-average reporting.",
