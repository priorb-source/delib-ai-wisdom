    "review": "Forecaster 2 makes good points on NATO deterrence, Belarusian consent (thus not counting as an invasion), and the short window. Their reference to large Belarus buildups and exercises is a useful consideration for general risk but is less relevant to this question because such forces would most plausibly be aimed at Ukraine or signaling NATO, not a new non‑Ukraine target. Their 7% feels a bit high given the two‑month horizon and the costs/risks. Forecaster 3’s emphasis on the need for observable logistical preparation and the detectability of any new front is compelling and closely matches my base‑rate view. Their focus on Moldova/Georgia as the main tail risks is aligned with my prior. Overall, I find Forecaster 3 more persuasive; Forecaster 2 adds a useful check on exercise‑related windows but doesn’t move me higher.",
    "rationale": "Time remaining (~2 months) and Russia’s ongoing commitment in Ukraine make a fresh ground invasion elsewhere unlikely. The most plausible pathways are limited and would likely generate early indicators: (1) a sudden move from Russian forces across Georgian ABLs into Tbilisi‑controlled territory; (2) a rapid escalation tied to Transnistria/Moldova; or (3) a small, deniable incursion into a NATO state. All carry high costs and risks of escalation, and scenarios (1) and (2) would still require observable prep or crisis cues that we haven’t seen. Even if a small NATO border incident occurred, US officials might characterize it as an “attack” or “incursion” rather than “invasion,” adding a further linguistic hurdle for resolution. I continue to discount the research assistant’s UN voting claim as non‑credible and not probative. I’m nudging down from 4% to 3% mainly on Forecaster 3’s logistical-detectability point and the short, signal‑poor window remaining. I would move up if there were credible reports of Russian ground force massing near Georgian ABLs or Transnistria, or official US warnings hinting at imminent Russian movements and adopting “invasion” language; down if we see normal exercise patterns and no unusual movements by early June.",
