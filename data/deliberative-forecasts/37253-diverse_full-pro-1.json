    "review": "The other two forecasters and I have reached a strong consensus on the key factors driving this forecast: the very short two-month timeframe, the absence of publicly available intelligence showing preparations at the Punggye-ri test site, and the unprecedentedly long 7.5+ year gap since the last test in 2017. Both other forecasters arrive at a similar low-probability conclusion, with forecasts of 12% and 9% respectively. \n\nI found two arguments particularly persuasive. Forecaster 2 framed the long gap not just as a pause, but as a potential 'fundamental shift' in strategy, which adds weight to the idea that the historical base rate of testing is no longer applicable. More compellingly, Forecaster 3 introduced a cost-benefit analysis, arguing that North Korea has been able to achieve many of its strategic signaling goals through a series of missile, drone, and satellite tests, which incur lower diplomatic and economic costs than a nuclear detonation. This provides a strong strategic rationale for the current status quo and explains why Pyongyang might continue to refrain from a nuclear test despite its aggressive rhetoric.",
    "rationale": "My initial forecast was 15%. After reviewing my colleagues' analyses, I am updating my forecast downward. The arguments presented, especially the cost-benefit framework suggested by Forecaster 3, have convinced me that I was likely overweighting the risk of a surprise test based on general unpredictability and capability. The fact that North Korea has found alternative, lower-cost methods for demonstrating military progress (such as the recent destroyer missile tests) makes it more plausible that this pattern will continue over the very short resolution period. The lack of any observable, short-term preparations at the test site remains the most decisive piece of evidence. A nuclear test is a major undertaking, and while preparations could be hidden, the complete absence of public indicators with only two months remaining significantly lowers the probability. Therefore, I am reducing my forecast by four percentage points to 11%. This revised figure better reflects the strength of the evidence for the status quo continuing, while still acknowledging the non-zero risk of a sudden political decision to test, given that the technical capacity remains in place.",
