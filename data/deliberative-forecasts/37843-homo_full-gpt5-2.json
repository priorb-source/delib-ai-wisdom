    "review": "Both forecasters emphasize the key mechanical constraint I was already leaning on: a Yes requires a public S-1 or a specific company news post; confidential submissions don’t count. They add two useful nuances: (1) companies rarely use a blog to pre-announce plans due to quiet-period sensitivities (making a blog-triggered Yes less likely), and (2) a late-June public S-1 can still be consistent with a fall pricing, so a June filing isn’t out of the question. I’d add one counterpoint: while uncommon, some firms do announce a confidential submission via press release/blog (e.g., Reddit in 2021), which could satisfy the resolution if posted on Discord’s news page. Net, their reasoning is sound and closely aligned with mine.",
    "rationale": "Time left is short (~5.5 weeks). The most probable qualifying trigger is a public S-1; a specific blog announcement is possible but atypical. If Discord targets a post-Labor-Day listing, a late-June public S-1 is plausible but not necessary—many issuers prefer to minimize the public runway and could wait until July/August. The mixed IPO tape and recent Nasdaq volatility do not create a strong incentive to accelerate a public filing before July 1. Countervailing signals (credible March reporting of 2025 plans, top-tier banks engaged, and signs of late-stage readiness) keep the probability meaningfully above a low base. Weighing status quo inertia, calendar seasonality around the July 4 holiday, and the availability of confidential filings, I see a modest but real chance of a late-June public S-1 or an explicit blog post. The additional arguments largely balance out (blog path a bit less likely; early public filing for a fall IPO still plausible), so I’m maintaining my prior.",
