  "information": "According to public statements, François Villeroy de Galhau, a member of the European Central Bank (ECB) council, indicated there is room for gradual interest rate reductions as inflation approaches the central bank's 2% target. The ECB has implemented seven interest rate cuts since mid-2024, lowering the benchmark deposit rate to 2.25% as of its April 2025 meeting. ECB President Christine Lagarde has noted that future policy decisions will be data-dependent, citing 'unprecedented uncertainty'. A report from Qatar National Bank (QNB) stated that the ECB is expected to continue its interest rate cutting cycle in 2025, driven by a weak economic outlook for the Euro Area and stabilized inflation.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Roughly 2–20 days (Eurostat flash on Apr 30 likely updates Trading Economics that day; the final print is typically released mid-May).",
    "status_quo_outcome": "Yes — recent euro area headline inflation has been in the mid‑2s, i.e., above 2.2%.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Headline HICP prints at 2.2% YoY (or lower) for April on Trading Economics, reflecting softer goods/energy and continued disinflation in core; rounding to one decimal makes 2.24% show as 2.2%.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Headline HICP comes in at 2.3% or higher, driven by firm services inflation (late‑April Easter effects), resilient wages, and/or slightly positive energy base effects.",
    "rationale": "Key considerations:\n- Status quo: The most recent readings have been around the mid‑2% range. Even with February’s downward revision (per the article), levels have generally been above 2.2%. That alone tilts the base case to Yes.\n- Threshold/rounding nuance: Trading Economics typically displays euro area headline inflation to one decimal place (matching Eurostat’s flash). Practically, “above 2.2%” means 2.3% or higher on the displayed figure. A true value near 2.25% would appear as 2.2% and resolve No. This discrete rounding risk meaningfully lowers the probability of Yes when consensus hovers near 2.2–2.3.\n- Near‑term drivers: The late Easter in 2025 likely boosts April services prices (travel, hospitality), favoring a print at least as high as March. Energy base effects are no longer as disinflationary as in 2023–24 and could be mildly positive, supporting headline.\n- Countervailing forces: Core goods disinflation and weaker demand (the euro area growth backdrop remains soft) lean against a large upside surprise. The research assistant’s note that the ECB is in a cutting cycle as inflation approaches target reinforces that medium‑term inflation pressure is contained rather than re‑accelerating.\n- Evidence from RA: Policy commentary (Villeroy de Galhau, Lagarde) and QNB’s outlook point to inflation stabilizing near target and a weak economy, consistent with headline around low‑to‑mid 2s rather than a jump. That supports a modest, not high, probability of landing at 2.3%+.\nWhy not higher: A clear disinflation trend, recent downward revisions, and the one‑decimal rounding risk around 2.2 vs 2.3 cap the odds. Why not lower: Recent prints have been above 2.2, Easter timing supports services, and wages remain firm, keeping a floor under inflation.\nWhat would move me: Higher/lower than expected national flashes (Germany, Spain, France, Italy) on Apr 29–30; surprises in energy prices; indications of services strength (e.g., package holidays). If Germany/Spain print hot and oil remains firm, I’d move up toward 70–75. If major countries come in soft and energy dips, I’d move down toward 45–50.",

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
