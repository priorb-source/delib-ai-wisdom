  "information": "A 17% 'reciprocal' tariff on Israeli goods was announced by the US on April 2, 2025, and codified under heading 9903.01.48 of the Harmonized Tariff Schedule (HTS) with an effective date of April 9. Subsequently, the implementation of this tariff was suspended for 90 days, deferring the collection of duties until July 9, 2025. Reports state that the official HTS website has been updated to list a '+17%' duty for Israel, which is currently marked as 'suspended'.\n\nThe US is Israel's largest trading partner, with bilateral trade valued at $34 billion in 2024. The two countries have a 40-year-old free trade agreement. On April 1, 2025, the Israeli government announced the immediate cancellation of all its remaining tariffs on U.S. imports. Following the US tariff announcement, Israeli Economy Minister Nir Barkat stated that officials from both countries are optimistic about reaching a new trade agreement before the suspension period expires on July 9, 2025. Ongoing discussions also aim to address the trade deficit between the nations.\n\nThe United States recently implemented a general 10% tariff on imports from most trading partners. Concurrently, the administration has pursued other trade actions, including imposing a 25% tariff on imported automobiles and certain auto parts, and increasing tariffs on Chinese goods to over 100% in response to retaliatory measures. Additionally, new tariffs ranging from 41% to over 3,500% have been announced on solar imports from several Southeast Asian countries, pending a final decision in June 2025.",

    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "About 5.5 weeks (roughly 38 days) until June 1, 2025",
    "status_quo_outcome": "Yes — the HTS continues to display +17% for Israel (likely still marked as suspended)",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "A US–Israel deal is finalized before June 1 and the White House issues a proclamation revoking or altering HTS 9903.01.48 for Israel, with USITC publishing an HTS revision that removes or changes the +17% listing before June 1.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "No new proclamation or HTS revision before June 1; HTS 9903.01.48 continues to show an additional +17% duty on goods of Israel (potentially marked as suspended), which still resolves the question as Yes.",
    "rationale": "The research assistant reports that on April 2, 2025 the US announced a 17% tariff on Israeli goods, codified at HTS 9903.01.48 effective April 9, and then suspended its collection for 90 days (until July 9). The official HTS site has already been updated to show “+17%” for Israel and is currently marked “suspended.” The question resolves Yes if the HTS lists +17% for Israel on or after June 1, regardless of a suspension. Given the listing already exists and the suspension runs past June 1, the status quo is that the +17% entry remains visible through that date. Changing this would require a new Presidential Proclamation and a published HTS revision by the USITC before June 1—steps that typically take coordination and are not undertaken unless a deal is finalized. Officials reportedly aim to strike an agreement before the July 9 suspension ends, which implies they may keep the listing as leverage until closer to that date rather than removing it early. This supports a Yes by inertia. Why not higher: It’s plausible a rapid deal could be reached and promptly implemented, with an HTS revision before June 1 removing or altering 9903.01.48. Political pressure from affected industries and allies could accelerate such a move. Also, an administrative change or legal development could alter the listing unexpectedly. Why not lower: The tariff is already in the HTS, and the suspension explicitly runs beyond June 1. Historically, pending negotiations often leave such Chapter 99 entries in place until a final resolution is published; early removal would forfeit leverage before the suspension deadline. What would move me upward: Confirmation from USITC that no HTS revision affecting 9903.01.48 is scheduled before June 1; continued indications from USTR/White House that negotiations are ongoing without imminent deal. What would move me downward: A White House/USTR announcement of a finalized agreement with a near-immediate effective date; a Presidential Proclamation revoking or modifying 9903.01.48 with an effective date before June 1; USITC posting a forthcoming HTS revision that removes or changes the +17% listing before June 1.",
