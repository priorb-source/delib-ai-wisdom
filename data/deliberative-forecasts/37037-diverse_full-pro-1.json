    "review": "All three forecasts converge on a high probability of a 'Yes' outcome, primarily driven by the status quo, the short timeframe until resolution, and the high bar for reversing a new U.S. trade policy. Forecaster 2's reasoning is solid, highlighting that the formula-based nature of the tariff provides a justification that is difficult to circumvent for a single country. However, their 80% forecast seems to assign a slightly higher probability to a successful diplomatic intervention than I believe is warranted. Forecaster 3's analysis was the most impactful for me. They introduced a crucial point I had not explicitly weighed: the resolution criteria state that a 'suspended' tariff still resolves as 'Yes'. This is a critical insight. It means a likely diplomatic concession from the U.S.—such as a temporary pause granted to Lesotho after negotiations—would not result in a 'No' resolution. A 'No' requires the outright removal or change of the 50% tariff from the official Harmonized Tariff Schedule (HTS) listing, which is a much higher bar than simply pausing its collection. This significantly reduces the likelihood of a 'No' outcome.",
    "rationale": "I am increasing my forecast from 90% to 95%. My initial reasoning was based on the bureaucratic and political inertia that makes a policy reversal for Lesotho highly unlikely within the five-week timeframe. The analyses from the other forecasters reinforced this core view. The key factor prompting my update is Forecaster 3's analysis of the resolution criteria. The fact that a 'suspended' provision still resolves as 'Yes' is critical. It closes off what I would have considered the most plausible path to a 'No' outcome: a scenario where Lesotho's high-level delegation secures a temporary pause or suspension as a diplomatic victory. Since such a pause would not change the resolution, the conditions required for a 'No' are now much stricter. It would require the U.S. to fully reverse its policy specifically for Lesotho and officially update the HTS to reflect that change before June 1st. Given that the U.S. administration already explicitly excluded Lesotho from a 90-day pause granted to others, such a complete and rapid capitulation seems extremely unlikely. The remaining 5% chance of a 'No' outcome accounts for a highly unexpected and swift policy reversal or a technical issue with how the HTS is updated and displayed.",
