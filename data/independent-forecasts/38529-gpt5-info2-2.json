  "information": "Andrew Cuomo has secured endorsements from several key groups and individuals. These include Luis Dávila Pernas, the chairman of the Democratic Party of Puerto Rico; Latin music star Marc Anthony; and several Orthodox Jewish communities, including the Bobov Hasidic movement, the Crown Heights community, and the Far Rockaway Jewish Alliance. In contrast, Cuomo's primary opponent, Zohran Mamdani, has received the endorsement of Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Roughly 2–3 weeks (primary June 24; presumptive nominee likely called within a few days after, depending on RCV/absentee counting).",
    "status_quo_outcome": "Cuomo remains the narrow frontrunner and wins the Democratic primary.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Late-breaking momentum and turnout for Zohran Mamdani—buoyed by progressive enthusiasm, AOC’s endorsement, and strong RCV transfers from minor progressive candidates—push him past Cuomo in final tallies.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Cuomo holds his small lead, benefits from disciplined turnout among Orthodox Jewish communities and parts of the Latino electorate, performs well in outer-borough neighborhoods, and avoids any new negative revelations; RCV doesn’t overturn his first-round edge.",
    "rationale": "With about two weeks to go, the latest public signal (the linked story) frames the race as tightening but still with Cuomo ahead. In low-turnout NYC Democratic primaries, name recognition, organizational strength, and cohesive voting blocs matter. The research assistant notes Cuomo endorsements from Orthodox Jewish communities (Bobov, Crown Heights, Far Rockaway), Marc Anthony, and Luis Dávila Pernas (Puerto Rico Democratic Party chair), which, if accurate, point to real vote-delivery potential in key neighborhoods. By contrast, Mamdani has the endorsement of Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, which can energize progressives and young voters and help consolidate the left lane—especially relevant under ranked-choice voting if there are minor progressive candidates whose transfers would favor him.\n\nWhy not higher: The lead is reportedly narrowing; progressive enthusiasm and AOC’s backing could drive an effective late turnout surge, and RCV can magnify coalition efficiency if Mamdani consolidates second-choice support. Any negative late story about Cuomo could have outsized impact given existing vulnerabilities.\n\nWhy not lower: Two weeks out, leaders in NYC primaries usually hold unless there’s a shock. Cuomo’s name ID and endorsements tied to vote-rich, turnout-reliable communities provide a sturdier floor. Many voters may be late deciders but lean toward familiar brands, and the bar for overtaking a small but durable lead is non-trivial.\n\nWhat would move me up: Fresh reputable polls showing Cuomo expanding his lead; major union endorsements (e.g., DC 37, 1199SEIU) or clear signs of outer-borough early-vote strength for Cuomo; credible reports that the progressive field has not consolidated behind Mamdani.\n\nWhat would move me down: A high-quality poll putting Mamdani ahead or tied with strong momentum; evidence of strong progressive early vote; a significant late scandal or negative story for Cuomo; visible consolidation of progressive organizations/figures behind Mamdani plus signs that minor candidates’ supporters are breaking heavily to him in second choices.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill Andrew Cuomo win the 2025 Democratic primary for New York City mayor?\n\nQuestion background:\n[Cuomo’s lead narrows as Mamdani gains ground in NYC mayoral race: poll](https://pix11.com/news/politics/cuomos-lead-narrows-as-mamdani-gains-ground-in-nyc-mayor-race/)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if Andrew Cuomo is the presumptive Democratic nominee for Mayor of New York City after the primary is held on June 24, 2025, according to [credible sources](https://www.metaculus.com/faq/#definitions).\n\nIf by the end of this tournament's scoring no presumptive nominee has been called (for example because there are not yet conclusive results from the vote counting), this question will be annulled.\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nAndrew Cuomo has secured endorsements from several key groups and individuals. These include Luis Dávila Pernas, the chairman of the Democratic Party of Puerto Rico; Latin music star Marc Anthony; and several Orthodox Jewish communities, including the Bobov Hasidic movement, the Crown Heights community, and the Far Rockaway Jewish Alliance. In contrast, Cuomo's primary opponent, Zohran Mamdani, has received the endorsement of Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez.\n\nToday is 2025-06-09.\n\nBefore answering you think:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n(e) You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
