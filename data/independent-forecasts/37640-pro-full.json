  "information": "According to statements from Paul Gunning, the EPA's Director of the Office of Atmospheric Protection, the Energy Star program and other climate-related work are being 'de-prioritized and eliminated.' Gunning's office, along with the EPA's climate change division and climate protection partnership division, are slated for closure as part of a broader agency reorganization. The stated goal of the restructuring is to bring the agency to 'Reagan-era staffing levels,' aiming for a savings of $300 million a year by 2026.\n\nThe Energy Star program was launched in 1992 as a voluntary public-private partnership to certify energy-efficient products. Over its 33-year history, government figures and expert analyses estimate the program has saved consumers over $500 billion in energy costs and prevented 4 billion metric tons of greenhouse gas emissions. The program's annual cost is approximately $32 million, while it is credited with saving the average household around $450 per year.\n\nDecommissioning a federal .gov domain typically requires a process lasting several months for internal approvals, security reviews, and coordination with the General Services Administration (GSA). Federal laws, including the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) and record-retention statutes overseen by the National Archives and Records Administration (NARA), mandate archiving procedures. Historically, websites for discontinued federal programs have often remained online as static archives or with placeholder notices for years after the program ended. When other EPA climate-related webpages were targeted for removal in 2017, the outcome was a redirect or a static page, not a complete shutdown of the domain.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "About a month and a half. The current date is May 14, 2025, and the outcome will be determined on or after July 1, 2025.",
    "status_quo_outcome": "Yes. The website EnergyStar.gov is currently online and has been for 33 years. Absent any new action, it would remain online.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "The EPA administration, driven by a strong political mandate to quickly eliminate programs, fast-tracks the technical and administrative process to decommission the EnergyStar.gov domain. They successfully navigate all GSA and NARA requirements, or bypass them, and take the website completely offline before July 1, 2025.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Despite the announcement of the program's elimination, the website remains online. This is due to the bureaucratic and technical time required to decommission a federal domain, which exceeds the seven-week timeline. The website is either left active, converted to a static archive to comply with record-retention laws, or displays a placeholder notice, all of which would result in it being 'online' per the resolution criteria.",
    "rationale": "My forecast is heavily weighted towards 'Yes' based on the principle of bureaucratic inertia and established government procedures. The primary factor is the extremely short timeline. The announcement to eliminate the program was made in early May 2025, leaving less than two months until the resolution date of July 1, 2025. According to the research, the standard process to decommission a federal .gov domain, involving internal approvals, security reviews, and coordination with the GSA, takes several months. This alone makes a successful takedown within the given timeframe highly improbable.\n\nFurthermore, federal record-retention laws (overseen by NARA) and FOIA requirements create a strong incentive to maintain the website's content in an accessible format. The simplest way to comply is to convert the live site into a static archive, which would still resolve as 'Yes'. Historical precedent supports this: when other EPA climate-related websites were targeted for removal in 2017, the outcome was a redirect or a static page, not a complete shutdown of the domain. \n\nMy probability is not higher than 90% because there is a non-zero chance that the current administration could exert extreme political pressure to make a symbolic point, potentially leading to an unprecedentedly rapid takedown that bypasses normal procedures. \n\nMy probability is not lower because the combination of the short timeline, technical hurdles, legal requirements for archiving, and historical precedent presents a formidable set of barriers to the 'No' outcome. For me to lower my forecast, I would need to see evidence that the EPA has initiated an emergency takedown process with the GSA and has a plan to address the legal archival requirements.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill the EPA's EnergyStar.gov still be online on July 1, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nAccording to the [New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/06/climate/epa-energy-star-eliminated.html), \"'The Energy Star program and all the other climate work, outside of what’s required by statute, is being de-prioritized and eliminated,' Paul Gunning, the director of the E.P.A. Office of Atmospheric Protection, told employees during the meeting, according to the recording obtained by The New York Times. Mr. Gunning’s office itself is also slated for elimination.\n\nFor the past 33 years, Energy Star has been known for its recognizable blue label, which shows that an appliance has met energy efficiency standards set by the federal government.\"\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if EnergyStar.gov is online according to [Is It Down Right Now?](https://www.isitdownrightnow.com/energystar.gov.html) when accessed by Metaculus on or after July 1, 2025.\n\nAs of May 7, 2025, the resolution source returns the message, \"Energystar.gov is UP and reachable by us.\"\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nAccording to statements from Paul Gunning, the EPA's Director of the Office of Atmospheric Protection, the Energy Star program and other climate-related work are being 'de-prioritized and eliminated.'

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
