  "information": "According to multiple independent news sources from April 2025, the Project 2025 Tracker showed significant progress. A Blick.ch report from April 8 stated that 100 out of 302 objectives were completed. A week later, on April 16, a Medium.com article reported the number had risen to 105 completed objectives, with an additional 44 listed as \"in progress\". An earlier report from The Daily Dot on February 25 noted that over 36% of its monitored objectives were implemented. One analysis contained in the reports calculated the historical completion rate at approximately 2.2 objectives per day.\n\nProject 2025 is a 922-page strategic document authored by the Heritage Foundation. Its stated aims include restructuring the US government and shrinking the federal bureaucracy. Specific objectives mentioned in news reports include dismantling the United States Agency for International Development (USAID), removing funding for the United Nations Human Rights Council and the W.H.O., allowing political appointees to personally authorize appropriated funding, reducing education programs, and imposing higher tariffs on imports from various countries.\n\nThe Project 2025 Tracker is a public website created by Redditors from the r/Keep_Track subreddit, with Adrienne Cobb identified as its creator. The site monitors and visually demonstrates the progress of the administration's initiatives based on the Project 2025 plan, breaking down the status of objectives by government agency. According to an April 2025 report, the tracker website was attracting between 50,000 and 100,000 visitors daily, with approximately 10% of the traffic originating from outside the United States.",

    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "46 days from May 16, 2025 to July 1, 2025",
    "status_quo_outcome": "Yes - the threshold of 120 objectives will be reached",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "The completion rate drops precipitously to below 0.3 objectives per day, or there are significant political changes that halt Project 2025 implementation, or the tracker's methodology becomes more conservative about classifying objectives as Done, preventing the addition of 15+ objectives over 46 days",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "The tracker maintains even a moderate pace of objective completion, with objectives transitioning from the 'in progress' category to 'Done' status, or the completion rate continues at approximately 0.5-0.7 objectives per day as observed in mid-April",
    "rationale": "The mathematical trajectory strongly favors a Yes outcome. As of April 16, 2025, 105 objectives were completed with 44 more in progress. Only 15 additional objectives need to be classified as Done over the remaining 46 days to reach the threshold of 120. Recent data shows a completion rate of approximately 0.625 objectives per day (5 objectives completed between April 8-16), down from an earlier calculated rate of 2.2 per day, suggesting natural slowing as easier objectives are completed first. However, even at a significantly reduced rate of 0.3 objectives per day - less than half the recent observed pace - the tracker would add approximately 14 objectives by July 1, bringing the total to 119, just shy of the threshold. At the more realistic 0.5 objectives per day, we'd reach approximately 128 objectives. The substantial pipeline of 44 'in progress' objectives provides a ready source for conversions to 'Done' status. The primary risks are: (1) an unexpected collapse in completion rate, (2) methodological changes to the tracker's classification system, or (3) major political disruptions. However, given the momentum, the pipeline of in-progress items, and the relatively small gap to close (15 objectives), these risks appear manageable. My forecast is not higher (>90%) because we lack data from the past month (April 16 to May 16) and cannot confirm the current state. My forecast is not lower (<75%) because the mathematics are compelling - even very conservative completion rates would likely reach the threshold given 46 days and a 44-objective pipeline.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill the Project 2025 Tracker classify at least 120 objectives as \"Done\" on July 1, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nThe 2025 Tracker is a project of the Keep_Track subreddit and is explained [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/Keep_Track/comments/1ii7tbr/project_2025_tracker_is_now_live/).\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if the [Project 2025 Tracker](https://www.project2025.observer/) has ≥120 Objectives classified as Done when accessed by Metaculus on or after July 1, 2025. If it is less than 120, this resolves as **No**.\n\n\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nAccording to multiple independent news sources from April 2025, the Project 2025 Tracker showed significant progress.

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
