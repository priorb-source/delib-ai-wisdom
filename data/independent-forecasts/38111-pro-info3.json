  "information": "As of May 2025, 147 out of 193 UN member states officially recognize the State of Palestine, while 46 members do not. The non-recognizing states include most Western European nations, the United States, Canada, Australia, Japan, and South Korea. In 2024, five countries newly recognized Palestine: Norway, Ireland, Spain, Slovenia, and Armenia. The Israeli government strongly opposes the international recognition effort. An Israeli official stated the country \"will not cooperate\" with such measures and warned of potential further annexation of the West Bank. The United States and several other G7 members also continue to withhold official recognition.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "1 month",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Despite the Franco-British initiative announced in May, diplomatic coordination for a joint recognition proves complex and time-consuming. Key European nations decide to postpone the announcement to build a broader coalition or to align it with a more significant international event later in the year, pushing the action beyond the June 2025 timeframe. Pressure from the US and warnings from Israel contribute to this delay.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Building on the momentum of their May 2025 announcement, France and the UK lead a coordinated recognition of Palestine in June. They may be joined by one or more other European countries (e.g., Belgium, Malta, Portugal) seeking to apply concerted pressure to advance a two-state solution, following the playbook established by Spain, Ireland, and Norway in 2024.",
    "rationale": "The baseline forecast leans towards the status quo, as sovereign recognition is a significant diplomatic act that does not happen frequently. However, recent events create substantial momentum favoring a 'Yes' outcome. The recognition of Palestine by five countries in 2024, including several EU members, demonstrated a shifting European consensus. The key catalyst for this forecast is the new information that the UK has joined a French-led initiative for recognition in May 2025. This involves two permanent members of the UN Security Council and suggests a high-level, coordinated plan is already in motion. The proximity of this announcement to the June 2025 window makes action within this period highly plausible. My probability is set at 65%, indicating that recognition is more likely than not. The forecast is not higher because diplomatic initiatives are subject to delays, and intense opposition from Israel and the United States creates significant political friction that could easily push the timeline beyond June. A one-month window is very specific, and coordinating such a major announcement could slip. The forecast is not lower because the specific, high-profile nature of the Franco-British initiative, announced just before the forecast period, represents a strong and immediate signal of intent that is qualitatively different from the general background debate. I would increase my forecast if other European countries publicly commit to a June timeline. I would decrease it if French or British officials issue statements suggesting a longer-term plan or if the US visibly intensifies its diplomatic pressure on European allies to halt the move.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill a UN member country newly recognize Palestine in June 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\n[UK joins France's initiative for recognition of Palestinian state](https://www.lemonde.fr/en/international/article/2025/05/20/uk-joins-france-s-initiative-for-recognition-of-palestinian-state_6741456_4.html)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if after May 31, 2025 and before July 1, 2025, a UN member country announces that it recognizes Palestine as a sovereign nation. Resolves based on Al Jazeera's [tracking page](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/4/10/mapping-which-countries-recognise-palestine-in-2025) or other credible sources should the tracking page not be timely updated.\n\n\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nAs of May 2025, 147 out of 193 UN member states officially recognize the State of Palestine, while 46 members do not.

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
