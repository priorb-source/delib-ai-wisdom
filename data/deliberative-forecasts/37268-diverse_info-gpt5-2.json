    "review": "Forecaster 2 adds a concrete, new constraint I hadn’t incorporated: the April 15–May 4 alliance registration window. That materially lowers near-term odds of credible participation and thus of an early announcement. Their point that an extension or workaround is possible is fair, but absent signals it should be discounted. Forecaster 3 convincingly emphasizes the recency and intensity of Sadr’s boycott rhetoric; that, plus his tendency to time reversals closer to election day, argues against a pre–July 1 announcement. The main caveat to both analyses: the resolution requires only an announcement to field candidates, not successful registration, and Iraqi timelines can slip. Still, given Sadr’s penchant for maximizing ambiguity, an early commitment is unlikely. Overall, their arguments justify moving down from my prior.",
    "rationale": "Key updates: (1) The alliance-registration window ending May 4 sharply reduces the plausibility of a swift, credible pivot; (2) Sadr has recently doubled down on a boycott and typically reverses late (e.g., mid-August 2021), making a pre–July 1 announcement atypical. While extensions, legal workarounds (e.g., using an allied registered party), or a political crisis could catalyze a reversal and announcement, there are no current indicators of imminent movement. Also, indirect participation via independents without branding would not satisfy the resolution. Given these constraints and timing, I’m lowering my forecast from 22% to 11%.",
