    "review": "The other two forecasters presented reasoning that strongly aligns with my own, creating a clear consensus. We all agree that the primary drivers for a low probability are the extremely short timeline until the July 1, 2025 deadline and the complete lack of public signals (e.g., staff hires, FEC filings) that typically precede a major campaign launch. The arguments I found most convincing, and which I had perhaps underweighted, were the points raised by both Forecaster 2 and Forecaster 3 regarding the strategic disadvantages of such an early announcement. Forecaster 3 in particular framed it well: launching a campaign more than 16 months before the November 2026 election offers few benefits and opens O'Rourke up to a prolonged period of attack. For a candidate with his recent electoral history, a more deliberate, impactful launch later in the cycle seems far more probable.",
    "rationale": "After reviewing my peers' analyses, I am updating my forecast downward. My initial forecast of 20% was primarily based on the short timeline and lack of evidence, while leaving a significant chance for a surprise announcement from a high-profile figure known for taking risks. However, the other forecasters persuasively argued that an announcement before July 1st is not just logistically unlikely, but also strategically suboptimal. Given O'Rourke's losses in the 2020 presidential primary and 2022 gubernatorial race, he has every incentive to be more cautious and strategic about his timing to maximize his chances of success. A hasty launch now would seem counter to that logic. The arguments about the disadvantages of a long campaign runway have convinced me that the probability is lower than I first assessed. I am therefore revising my forecast from 20% to 15%, aligning with Forecaster 2. This revision reflects a greater weight on the strategic reasons for O'Rourke to wait and a lower probability of an imminent, ill-timed announcement.",
