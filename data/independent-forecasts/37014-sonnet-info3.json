  "information": "The election uses a first-past-the-post voting system. Political analyst John Curtice has stated that Reform UK's support is too thinly spread to translate effectively into winning individual seats. For comparison, the peak performance for UKIP in a Kent County Council election was winning 17 seats.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Approximately 9 days. The Kent County Council election will be held on May 1, 2025, with results known shortly after.",
    "status_quo_outcome": "The Conservative Party retains control of Kent County Council, continuing their historical dominance. Reform UK wins some seats but remains a minority party, possibly matching or slightly exceeding UKIP's previous peak performance of 17 seats.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Reform UK's polling support fails to translate into seat wins under first-past-the-post voting. Their vote share is too dispersed across constituencies, allowing Conservatives to hold most seats despite potentially losing vote share. Local factors and incumbent advantage favor established parties. Reform UK wins perhaps 15-25 seats but Conservatives retain 40+ seats.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Reform UK achieves a historic breakthrough in local elections, winning 35-45+ seats to become the largest party. The Electoral Calculus poll proves accurate, with Reform UK successfully consolidating support in specific constituencies despite FPTP. Conservative support collapses dramatically in Kent, with voters shifting en masse to Reform UK over immigration, taxation, or other local issues.",
    "rationale": "Several factors make this unlikely despite the Electoral Calculus poll. First, political analyst John Curtice explicitly warns that Reform UK's support is too thinly spread to win seats under FPTP - this is crucial because Curtice is one of the UK's most respected electoral analysts with deep expertise in vote efficiency. Second, historical precedent is weak: UKIP's peak performance in Kent was just 17 seats, and Reform UK would need to more than double this to win control (Kent has 81 seats). Third, first-past-the-post systematically disadvantages parties with geographically dispersed support. Fourth, local elections often diverge from national polling trends due to incumbent effects and local issues. The Electoral Calculus poll provides some credibility to a Reform UK surge, and the election is imminent (reducing uncertainty), but these structural factors strongly suggest the poll may not accurately predict seat distribution. The probability is not lower because: (1) there is a specific poll predicting Reform UK victory; (2) significant political volatility exists in UK politics; (3) we're very close to the election date. The probability is not higher because: (1) expert analysis contradicts the poll; (2) FPTP creates a massive barrier; (3) historical precedent is very weak; (4) Reform UK would need unprecedented success in local elections.",
