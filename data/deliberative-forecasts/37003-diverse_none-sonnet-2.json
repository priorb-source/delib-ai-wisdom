    "review": "Forecaster 2 raises a critical piece of evidence I did not adequately consider: they provide specific polling numbers from the March 24, 2025 IFDD poll showing SPÖ at 28% and FPÖ at 27% - essentially a statistical tie. This is dramatically different from my assumption that SPÖ maintained a comfortable lead. If accurate, this represents a massive 13-point drop from SPÖ's 2020 performance and transforms the race from likely SPÖ victory to genuine toss-up. Forecaster 3 references the same poll but interprets it as 'SPÖ ahead' without specifics, creating ambiguity. Forecaster 2's specific numbers and detailed analysis suggest they accessed actual poll data, while Forecaster 3's vague description is less convincing. However, Forecaster 3 and I share the same 78% forecast based on similar reasoning about historical dominance and structural advantages. The key disagreement centers on current polling: is the race still comfortable for SPÖ, or has it become a true toss-up? Forecaster 2's evidence, if correct, cannot be dismissed - a sub-1-point polling margin fundamentally changes the probability calculation.",
    "rationale": "Upon reflection, I need to incorporate the possibility that recent polling shows a much closer race than I initially assumed. While I cannot verify the exact polling numbers, Forecaster 2's specific data (SPÖ 28%, FPÖ 27%) is consistent with national FPÖ momentum in Austria and demands serious consideration. However, I'm not revising down to 55% for several reasons: (1) Even if currently tied in polls, SPÖ retains significant structural advantages - 80 years of governance, superior GOTV infrastructure, and incumbency benefits that often manifest in close races; (2) Vienna's urban, diverse electorate has historically been more resistant to right-wing populism than rural Austria; (3) Six months remains sufficient time for SPÖ to respond with targeted campaigning; (4) A single poll, even if concerning, may not fully capture SPÖ's resilient base; (5) Converting a polling tie into an actual electoral victory requires FPÖ to maintain momentum and execute flawlessly, which is uncertain. The truth likely lies between my initial 78% and Forecaster 2's 55%. I'm updating to 67% - acknowledging the race is genuinely competitive while still favoring SPÖ based on their formidable organizational advantages and Vienna's political culture.",
