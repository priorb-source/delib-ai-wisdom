    "review": "The other forecasters raise several compelling arguments I should weigh more heavily. Forecaster 3's emphasis on April 2025 being only *second* warmest (not first) is an important moderation signal I underweighted - it suggests the peak early-year warming may have passed. Both forecasters make a strong case about neutral ENSO conditions being significantly less favorable than the El Niño conditions present during the 2020 and 2016 record Mays. El Niño typically adds 0.1-0.2°C to global temperatures, and without this boost, reaching the +0.95°C threshold becomes considerably harder. Forecaster 3's explicit invocation of status quo bias is also well-founded - records are rare by definition, and even with climate change, most months don't break all-time records. However, I still find value in the evidence I emphasized: three of the first four months of 2025 ranking in the top 2 positions is genuinely exceptional, and the multiple May heat records across Europe (UK, Scotland, France) and North America represent more than isolated incidents. The forecasters cluster between 32-38%, while I was at 45%, suggesting I may have been too optimistic.",
    "rationale": "After reviewing the other analyses, I'm revising downward but not dramatically. The strongest arguments for revision are: (1) Neutral ENSO is a significant headwind - both 2020 and 2016 benefited from El Niño conditions that are absent now, making the +0.95°C threshold harder to reach; (2) April's 'only second warmest' ranking suggests momentum may have peaked rather than continued accelerating; (3) Status quo bias dictates caution - monthly records are inherently rare even in a warming world. However, I'm not revising as low as 32% because: (1) The early 2025 performance remains extraordinary - having three of four months in top 2 positions is remarkable and suggests sustained elevated temperatures; (2) Multiple regional May heat records across diverse locations (UK, Scotland, France, Minnesota) indicate widespread warmth, not isolated events; (3) The long-term warming trend continues to elevate the baseline. My revised forecast of 37% reflects greater weight on the ENSO and moderation concerns while maintaining that the evidence still justifies meaningfully above-baseline probability. This lands me in the middle of the three forecasts (32%, 38%, 45%), which seems appropriate given we're analyzing the same evidence with slightly different emphases.",
