  "information": "The Wall Street Journal's editorial board described a trade deal with the United Kingdom as a step towards unwinding the trade war, writing that the economic damage from tariffs was proving politically risky. The board also has stated that the tariff policy has shaken global confidence in U.S. reliability and called it a 'true gift' to Chinese President Xi Jinping. In April 2025, President Trump suggested tariffs could replace income taxes, a claim that a Wall Street Journal reporter noted reasons to be skeptical of. Following the implementation of tariffs, the Treasury Department raised its borrowing projection for the April-June 2025 quarter to an estimated net marketable borrowing of $514 billion.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "23 days (until June 1, 2025)",
    "status_quo_outcome": "Tariffs are a dominant political and economic topic, making the word 'tariff(s)' a frequent feature on the front pages of major newspapers.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "The debate over the President's tariff policies is so intense and central to the national conversation that on every single day for the remainder of May 2025, at least one of the two specified newspapers features the word 'tariff' or 'tariffs' on its front page, resulting in an unbroken streak.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "On at least one day before June 1, 2025, a different major news event (such as an international crisis, natural disaster, or other domestic issue) displaces the tariff story from the front page of both The New York Times and The Wall Street Journal, or the story is covered without using the specific keyword. This single day breaks the streak required for a 'No' outcome.",
    "rationale": "My forecast is based on a statistical assessment of the resolution criteria. A 'Yes' outcome requires only one day in the 23-day period (May 9-31) where 'tariff(s)' is absent from both front pages. Conversely, a 'No' outcome requires an unbroken 23-day streak of appearances on at least one of them. While the research indicates tariffs are a dominant news story, making the daily probability of an appearance high (estimated at ~94%), the chance of maintaining this streak for 23 days is low. The probability of an unbroken streak is approximately 25% (0.94^23), leaving a 75% chance that the streak will be broken at least once. The volatility of the news cycle, with the high potential for other major stories to emerge, makes it probable that at least one day will pass without the specific keyword appearing on both front pages. My forecast is not higher because the proposal to replace income tax with tariffs is a uniquely compelling story that could plausibly sustain coverage. It is not lower because the 'single day off' condition for a 'Yes' is a very low threshold to meet over a three-week period. I would lower the probability if the tariff debate were to escalate with daily scheduled events (e.g., congressional votes), and I would raise it if a competing major news story were to emerge.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill the word \"tariff(s)\" disappear from the front print pages of The New York Times and Wall Street Journal by June 1, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nWhether reading the newspaper or social media or watching the news, it is highly likely you are going to see something about tariffs - mainly due to US President Donald Trump's renewed love for this somewhat antiquated form of taxation.\n\nThe New York Times and the Wall Street Journal are two of the largest print newspapers in the US. When, if ever, will we seen tariffs wiped from the front pages of both papers?\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question will resolve to \"Yes\" if, after \\[OPEN DATE] and before June 1, 2025, the words, \"tariff\" or \"tariffs\", do not appear on the print front page of The New York Times and the Wall Street Journal. The following URLs will be used to resolve the question:\n\n* The New York Times: [https://www.nytimes.com/section/todayspaper](https://www.nytimes.com/section/todayspaper)\n* Wall Street Journal:\t [https://www.wsj.com/print-edition/20250414/frontpage](https://www.wsj.com/print-edition/20250414/frontpage)\n\n***\n\n<sup>Note: WSJ front page URL for April 14, 2025. Format is: yyyy-mm-dd.</sup>\n\nGrammar is not relevant (e.g. \"TARIFF\" will suffice to prevent a \"No\" resolution).\n\n\"Tariff(s)\" must be omitted from both papers' front pages on the same day.\n\n\"Tariff(s)\" can appear anywhere on the page, it does not have to be in a title.\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nThe Wall Street Journal's editorial board described a trade deal with the United Kingdom as a step towards unwinding the trade war, writing that the economic damage from tariffs was proving politically risky.

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
