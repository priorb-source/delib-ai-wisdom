    "review": "The other forecasters raise several important points. Forecaster 2 makes a compelling argument that announcing a referendum within 4 months of taking office would directly contradict the gradualist mandate and campaign platform - this is stronger framing than my initial analysis. Forecaster 2's observation about governments typically acting in line with their core platforms immediately after elections is behaviorally sound. However, I find the 5% forecast too confident in a 'No' outcome. Forecaster 3 introduces an important consideration I missed: June 21 (National Day) as a potential focal point for symbolic announcements. This is a natural date for major political statements in Greenland. Forecaster 3's 16% forecast aligns closely with my reasoning and appropriately balances the gradualist mandate against the procedural ease of simply announcing a date. Both forecasters correctly emphasize that announcing a date is procedurally much easier than holding the referendum itself - the announcement could be for a vote scheduled years in the future, which would be consistent with gradualism. The consensus among all three forecasts (5%, 16%, 18%) is that this outcome is unlikely but not impossible, with most probability mass in the 15-20% range.",
    "rationale": "After reviewing the other analyses, I'm updating my forecast slightly downward from 18% to 15%. Forecaster 2's argument about directly contradicting the gradualist mandate within the first four months of office is more compelling than I initially weighted. A government announcing an independence referendum date so quickly after campaigning on a slow, methodical approach would be politically inconsistent and risk alienating their electoral base. However, I believe 5% is too low because: (1) the question only requires announcing a date, not holding the referendum - they could announce a 2027 or 2028 date; (2) June 21 National Day provides a natural focal point for such an announcement; (3) political announcements can happen relatively quickly compared to legislative processes; (4) even gradualists might use a future referendum date as a political tool or coalition-building mechanism. The complete absence of news signals from the research assistant weighs against any imminent announcement, but doesn't rule it out entirely. My updated 15% forecast reflects that this is quite unlikely given the gradualist platform and short timeframe, but maintains sufficient probability for the scenarios where a future-dated referendum is announced, particularly around National Day symbolism or as part of coalition agreements.",
