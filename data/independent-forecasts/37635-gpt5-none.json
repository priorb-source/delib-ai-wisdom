    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "About 45 days (roughly 6.5 weeks) until June 28, 2025",
    "status_quo_outcome": "Yes — Milei 61% vs. Sheinbaum 60% on Morning Consult today",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Sheinbaum holds near ~60% while Milei slips a point or two (economic pain, protests, legislative setbacks), or the displayed Morning Consult figures round to a tie (e.g., both at 60%), which resolves as No.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Milei maintains or inches up (continued macro stabilization headlines, incremental policy wins), while Sheinbaum ticks down a point on ordinary volatility or negative news (security, reform controversy), leaving Milei’s displayed figure strictly higher.",
    "rationale": "Time horizon is short and Morning Consult’s 7-day rolling averages tend to move slowly. Both leaders have hovered around the low 60s; Sheinbaum has shown honeymoon-era stability near ~60, while Milei has been more volatile but often in the high 50s/low 60s. With only ~6 weeks left and a current 1-point Milei lead, the base case is that the ordering persists. That said, two forces temper confidence: (1) small-sample week-to-week noise (often ~1–2pp), and (2) resolution rules: a tie in displayed figures counts as No. Even if Milei’s true approval slightly exceeds Sheinbaum’s, rounding can erase a slender lead. Balancing these, I place extra weight on the status quo (world changes slowly) but discount for tie risk and Milei’s higher volatility. Upward update triggers: clear, positive macro news in Argentina (e.g., further visible inflation deceleration, legislative progress) alongside flat Mexican newsflow; or Morning Consult shows Milei pulling 2–3 points ahead in the weeks prior. Downward update triggers: Argentine negative shocks (economic setbacks, protests, policy defeats) or a visible uptick in Sheinbaum’s approval (e.g., successful policy rollout) that closes or reverses the gap; any interim readings showing equal or Sheinbaum> Milei would also push me down. Research assistant provided no additional information, so this forecast rests on tracker behavior, current levels, and typical near-term dynamics.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill Javier Milei have a higher approval rating than Claudia Sheinbaum on June 28, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nAt the time of this question, Sheinbaum is at 60% as compared with Milei at 61%.\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if Javier Milei has a higher approval rating than Claudia Sheinbaum at [Morning Consult](https://pro.morningconsult.com/trackers/global-leader-approval) when checked by Metaculus on or after June 28, 2025. A tie or a lead by Sheinbaum resolves the question as **No**.\n\n\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nNo additional information available.\n\nToday is 2025-05-14.\n\nBefore answering you think:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n(e) You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
