  "information": "UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer faces criticism from Brexit supporters over concessions in a 'renewal' agreement with the EU. His government is also grappling with a sluggish economy, contributing to a decline in popularity. Starmer faces a growing political challenge from Nigel Farage's Reform UK party, whose economic plans he has described as reckless and comparable to the policies of former Prime Minister Liz Truss. Starmer's government plans to reduce the civil service by 50,000 jobs by 2030, aiming to save £2 billion annually, with details to be announced in a spending review on June 11.\n\nJapanese Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba's cabinet approval rating fell to a record low of 26% in a March 2025 Asahi newspaper poll. The 14-percentage-point drop followed a controversy involving the distribution of 100,000 yen gift vouchers to 15 lawmakers from the ruling party, which sparked public distrust. Although Ishiba apologized, he stated he used his own 'pocket money' as a sign of appreciation. All 15 lawmakers subsequently returned the vouchers. On the economic front, Ishiba is pursuing a growth-oriented economy driven by wage increases and investment, and has called for cooperation with the Japan Business Federation (Keidanren).\n\nPolling data from early 2025 shows fluctuating approval ratings for both leaders. A Morning Consult screenshot from early May reported Starmer at 36% and Ishiba at 29%, while other reports citing late-May figures placed Starmer at 28% and Ishiba at 32%. Earlier, a March 2025 Ipsos UK poll found that 30% of Britons believed Starmer was performing well, an increase of 7 percentage points. A YouGov poll from the same period showed Starmer with a 31% positive rating, his highest since September 2024. In April 2025, Starmer and Ishiba held a telephone call to discuss the economic impact of U.S. tariffs and agreed to cooperate on global issues.",

    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "About 32 days (until July 1, 2025)",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No — marginally, given mixed late-May readings and a tie resolves No",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Morning Consult’s trailing 7-day average on/after July 1 shows Shigeru Ishiba at or above Keir Starmer (including a tie). This could come from a small Ishiba rebound into the low 30s while Starmer softens to the high 20s/low 30s, or both converging around ~30%.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Morning Consult’s trailing 7-day average on/after July 1 shows Starmer a few points above Ishiba, e.g., Starmer ~32–36% and Ishiba ~26–30%, consistent with Japan’s lingering scandal drag and Starmer holding early-term mid-30s or low-30s support.",
    "rationale": "Evidence: The research assistant notes that Morning Consult in early May had Starmer ~36% and Ishiba ~29%, while some late-May mentions had Starmer ~28% and Ishiba ~32%. Separate Japanese polling (Asahi) in March put Ishiba’s cabinet approval as low as 26% after the gift-voucher scandal. Historically, Morning Consult places Japanese PM approvals in the high 20s/low 30s, and UK PM approvals in the low-to-mid 30s early in a term. Given MC’s 7-day moving average, abrupt 8-point monthly swings are possible but less likely than gradual drift.\nInterpretation: Over the next month, large moves are unlikely. The Japanese scandal creates a lower base for Ishiba, making sustained mid-30s approval less probable unless there’s a clear positive catalyst. Starmer’s approval has been pressured by economic sluggishness, EU-related criticism, and impending civil service cuts, but he may still hover near ~30–35% as an early-term PM. The most plausible ordering is Starmer ≳ Ishiba by a few points, though it’s close.\nWhy not higher? Two reasons cap my confidence: (1) mixed late-May signals that could imply a narrow Ishiba lead or convergence; (2) a tie counts as No, slightly reducing the chance of Yes when the spread is small.\nWhy not lower? The Japanese approval baseline remains weak post-scandal, and UK PMs early in their term often maintain low-30s approval even amid headwinds. The early-May MC snapshot favored Starmer by a notable margin, suggesting his mid-30s is feasible.\nWhat would move me up? If by mid-June Morning Consult shows Starmer consistently 3–4 points ahead (e.g., UK 33–35, JP 28–30), BoE easing or benign UK economic headlines, and no fresh UK controversies. What would move me down? If MC shows Ishiba durably at or above Starmer (e.g., JP ≥32 while UK ≤30) through mid/late June, a UK backlash to the June 11 spending review, or a positive Japanese policy/news cycle that lifts Ishiba into the low/mid-30s.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer have a higher approval rating than Japanese Prime Minister Shiguru Ishiba on July 1, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nResolution source updates monthly. According to Morning Consult for January 2025: \"The latest approval ratings are based on data collected from Jan. 21-27, 2025. Ratings reflect a trailing seven-day simple moving average of views among adults in each country surveyed.\"\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if Keir Starmer has a higher approval rating than Shiguru Ishiba according to [Morning Consult](https://pro.morningconsult.com/trackers/global-leader-approval) when checked by Metaculus on or after July 1, 2025. If this not the case (including due to a tie), this resolves as **No**.\n\n\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nUK Prime Minister Keir Starmer faces criticism from Brexit supporters over concessions in a 'renewal' agreement with the EU.

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any).
