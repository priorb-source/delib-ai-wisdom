  "information": "Following the March 2025 Greenlandic parliamentary elections, the Demokraatit party, which advocates for a gradual path to independence, emerged as the winner. The new Prime Minister, Jens-Frederik Nielsen, favors incremental autonomy and has emphasized economic development. While the more staunchly pro-independence Naleraq party doubled its number of parliamentary seats, it remains in the opposition. The government has initiated some formal steps, including the presentation of a draft constitution in May 2023 and the formation of a commission under the Self-Government Act to handle independence negotiations; this commission has been given a multi-year mandate.\n\nPublic sentiment in Greenland shows strong support for the principle of independence, with various polls indicating approval from over 80% of the population. However, opinions on the timing vary, with many favoring a more gradual approach. A January 2025 survey revealed that while 84% support independence, 45% of supporters would reconsider if it meant a decline in living standards. The debate over independence has been recently intensified by comments from former U.S. President Donald Trump about acquiring the island, which also prompted a solidarity visit from Danish King Frederik X in late April 2025 and a visit from a U.S. private sector delegation exploring investment opportunities.\n\nGreenland's economy is substantially dependent on an annual block grant from Denmark, which amounts to approximately 4.3 billion Danish kroner and makes up about half of the government's budget. The current government's stated priority is to develop Greenland's mineral resources to build economic self-sufficiency before moving toward political independence. The 2009 Self-Government Act provides the legal basis for Greenland to declare independence through a referendum. Past referendums, such as those in 1979 and 2008, had significantly longer preparation and lead times than the period before the July 1, 2025 deadline.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Less than 2 months, as the deadline is July 1, 2025.",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No. The Greenlandic government will not officially announce a date for an independence referendum by the deadline, continuing its focus on a gradual path to independence.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "The Demokraatit-led government adheres to its stated policy of prioritizing economic self-sufficiency before considering a referendum. The national focus remains on developing mineral resources and managing the Danish block grant, and the commission on independence continues its multi-year work. The deadline of July 1, 2025, passes without any official referendum announcement.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "A significant and unforeseen political event, such as a major diplomatic dispute with Denmark or a surge in international strategic interest, creates overwhelming public and political pressure. The opposition Naleraq party successfully leverages this to force the government's hand, leading to a surprise announcement of a referendum date to quell political instability before the deadline.",
    "rationale": "My forecast is based on the strong alignment of the current Greenlandic government's stated policy, political incentives, and historical precedent against scheduling a referendum in the short term. The primary driver is the governing Demokraatit party's clear 'gradualist' platform, which won the recent election. Their focus is on building economic independence, a long-term project, before pursuing political independence. This is a rational stance, given that Greenland's budget is approximately 50% dependent on a block grant from Denmark, and popular support for independence is conditional on not lowering living standards. Announcing a referendum in the next two months would directly contradict this cautious, foundational strategy. Furthermore, historical referendums on Greenland's status have involved significantly longer preparation times, and the newly formed independence commission has a multi-year mandate, signaling a deliberate, unhurried process. The chances of a 'Yes' outcome are not zero, as political landscapes can change rapidly due to external shocks or domestic pressure from the newly strengthened pro-independence opposition. However, for a 'Yes' outcome to occur, the government would have to completely reverse its core policy in under two months, which is a very high bar. Therefore, the probability remains low. I would increase my forecast if key government figures begin signaling a change in timeline or if a major crisis with Denmark emerges. I would decrease it further if the government signed new long-term economic agreements reinforcing the status quo.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nBefore July 1, 2025, will the government of Greenland officially announce a date for an independence referendum?\n\nQuestion background:\nReuters: [Greenland's independence gradualists win election amid Trump control pledge](https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/greenland-election-tests-independence-ambitions-us-interest-looms-2025-03-11/)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if, before July 1, 2025, a referendum on the independence of Greenland from the Denmark is officially scheduled. If this does not occur before that date, this question resolves as **No**.\n\nFor purposes of this question, the referendum will be considered \"officially scheduled\" when it is announced by a person or entity with the authority to do so within Greenland. Please note that broader legality, such as it being overturned by the government of Denmark, will be considered irrelevant for this question.\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nFollowing the March 2025 Greenlandic parliamentary elections, the Demokraatit party, which advocates for a gradual path to independence, emerged as the winner.
