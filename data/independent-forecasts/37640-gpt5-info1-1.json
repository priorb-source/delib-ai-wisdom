  "information": "According to statements from Paul Gunning, the EPA's Director of the Office of Atmospheric Protection, the Energy Star program and other climate-related work are being 'de-prioritized and eliminated.' Gunning's office, along with the EPA's climate change division and climate protection partnership division, are slated for closure as part of a broader agency reorganization. The stated goal of the restructuring is to bring the agency to 'Reagan-era staffing levels,' aiming for a savings of $300 million a year by 2026.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "About 48 days (until July 1, 2025)",
    "status_quo_outcome": "Yes — EnergyStar.gov remains online.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "EPA rapidly decommissions the domain/hosting before July 1 (e.g., DNS withdrawn, site disabled) so IsItDownRightNow reports it down when Metaculus checks; or an extended technical outage or certificate/DNS misconfiguration coincides with the check.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "The site stays live (even if frozen, slimmed down, or replaced by a notice/redirect to other EPA/DOE pages). IsItDownRightNow still sees energystar.gov responding, so it is marked up.",
    "rationale": "- Status quo and inertia: As of May 7, the resolution source shows the site is up. Federal program eliminations and web decommissioning typically take months, often aligning with the fiscal year (Oct 1). Shuttering a prominent .gov site within ~7 weeks is possible but uncommon.\n- Practical constraints: Energy Star branding and tools (e.g., building benchmarking/Portfolio Manager) are widely embedded in municipal and corporate processes. Even if the program is being eliminated, maintaining a landing page or transitional content is likely. A redirect or static notice would still count as “up” for the resolution source.\n- Cost/benefit: Website operating costs are small relative to the cited $300M savings target. Immediate takedown generates confusion and risk without substantial savings, so a phased approach is more probable.\n- Research assistant summary: Leadership reportedly plans to eliminate Energy Star and other climate work and cut staffing to Reagan-era levels. This raises the risk of an assertive wind-down, but it does not imply a near-term domain shutdown by July 1.\nWhy not higher: There is real political intent to end the program, so a symbolic, accelerated domain decommission (or a forced migration without maintaining the energystar.gov endpoint) is plausible. Also, the resolution depends on a single external monitor at a specific check time—brief outages, DNS changes, or certificate lapses could flip the result to No.\nWhy not lower: Government web changes rarely happen this fast; a redirect or stubbing out the site still likely registers as up. The breadth of Energy Star’s integrations argues for at least a transitional web presence.\nUpdate triggers upward: Explicit agency communication committing to maintain the site through FY2025; evidence of a transition plan keeping energystar.gov live (even as a redirect); signs of DOE hosting continuity.\nUpdate triggers downward: Official decommission notice with a near-term timeline; DNS changes indicating domain retirement; contract termination notices for hosting/CMS; press reporting of an imminent takedown or disabling of public access.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill the EPA's EnergyStar.gov still be online on July 1, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nAccording to the [New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/06/climate/epa-energy-star-eliminated.html), \"'The Energy Star program and all the other climate work, outside of what’s required by statute, is being de-prioritized and eliminated,' Paul Gunning, the director of the E.P.A. Office of Atmospheric Protection, told employees during the meeting, according to the recording obtained by The New York Times. Mr. Gunning’s office itself is also slated for elimination.\n\nFor the past 33 years, Energy Star has been known for its recognizable blue label, which shows that an appliance has met energy efficiency standards set by the federal government.\"\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if EnergyStar.gov is online according to [Is It Down Right Now?](https://www.isitdownrightnow.com/energystar.gov.html) when accessed by Metaculus on or after July 1, 2025.\n\nAs of May 7, 2025, the resolution source returns the message, \"Energystar.gov is UP and reachable by us.\"\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nAccording to statements from Paul Gunning, the EPA's Director of the Office of Atmospheric Protection, the Energy Star program and other climate-related work are being 'de-prioritized and eliminated.' Gunning's office, along with the EPA's climate change division and climate protection partnership division, are slated for closure as part of a broader agency reorganization. The stated goal of the restructuring is to bring the agency to 'Reagan-era staffing levels,' aiming for a savings of $300 million a year by 2026.\n\nToday is 2025-05-14.\n\nBefore answering you think:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n(e) You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
