    "review": "All three forecasters independently arrived at 12%, which is notable - we're all seeing the same fundamental dynamics. The analyses are remarkably consistent: March inventory at 503k requires a 47k increase (9.3% jump) to exceed 550k; recent growth was only 3k/month requiring 8x acceleration; housing starts and permits are declining; sales remain healthy absorbing inventory; and 550k was only exceeded during the 2006-2007 bubble. The reasoning is sound and well-supported. However, I notice one important detail we collectively underweighted: it's already May 8, 2025. Since May readings are typically end-of-month measurements, we're now talking about roughly 3 weeks, not two full months. This makes the timeline even tighter than our analyses suggested. Additionally, none of us have April data yet - if April showed a significant jump (say, 15k+ units), that would be crucial signal. The absence of such data supports our conservative stance.",
    "rationale": "Upon reflection, the consensus at 12% appears well-reasoned but potentially slightly high given the compressed timeline. The core arguments remain valid: we need an extreme 8x acceleration in inventory growth against a backdrop of declining housing starts (-14.2%), falling permits (-2%), weak builder confidence (HMI=42), and healthy sales absorption (724k annual rate, +6% YoY). The only realistic path to Yes involves a severe demand shock freezing the market while completions surge - possible but unlikely in under 3 weeks. The fact that three independent analyses converged at 12% suggests this captures appropriate uncertainty for tail-risk scenarios (economic crisis, credit crunch, unexpected shock). However, the very tight remaining timeframe (May 8 to end-of-May measurement) and absence of any April data showing acceleration warrant a modest downward adjustment. A 10-12% range seems appropriate, balancing recognition of housing market volatility and our current proximity to 550k against overwhelming evidence that supply is slowing and demand remains steady.",
