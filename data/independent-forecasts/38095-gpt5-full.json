  "information": "In late May 2025, President Trump granted clemency to a large group of individuals. News outlets including The Hill and Politomix reported on May 28-29 that over two dozen people received pardons or commutations in what was described as a 'clemency spree' or 'blitz'. According to Office of the Pardon Attorney data, there were approximately 25 clemency actions in May. The recipients included political allies like former Congressman Michael Grimm and former Connecticut governor John G. Rowland, reality TV stars Todd and Julie Chrisley, and musicians such as NBA YoungBoy.\n\nSince taking office in January 2025, President Trump has granted approximately 1,600 pardons or commutations, a figure more than six times the total from his entire first term. A large portion of this number stems from a mass clemency order issued on his first day in office, which pardoned roughly 1,500 individuals convicted of offenses related to the January 6, 2021, Capitol attack. The administration has installed key personnel to manage the process, including Ed Martin as the new pardon attorney at the Justice Department and Alice Marie Johnson as a White House pardon czar.\n\nDuring his first presidential term, Donald Trump did not grant any clemencies during the month of June in any of the four years. For his second term, a May 28, 2025, report from the Washington Times indicated that Trump has signaled more pardons could be forthcoming, including for two men convicted in the plot to kidnap Michigan Governor Gretchen Whitmer. A White House official was also quoted stating the President has come to the aid of political supporters and donors and has expressed sympathy for allies caught in the judicial system.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "About 32 days (until July 1, 2025)",
    "status_quo_outcome": "Yes — continued clemency activity spills into June, exceeding 2 publicly disclosed actions",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "After the late-May clemency blitz and negative press, the White House deliberately pauses to regroup, issuing at most two actions in June; or administrative/legal/political headwinds delay announcements until July.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Another batch is announced in June (e.g., 5–25 names) or a blanket order; alternatively, two high-profile cases (e.g., Whitmer plotters) plus at least one additional ally or celebrity clemency are granted and publicly disclosed.",
    "rationale": "- What we know (from the assistant’s report): In late May 2025, Trump did a clemency ‘spree’ (~25 actions) and has already granted ~1,600 clemencies this term, including ~1,500 via a day-one mass order. Infrastructure is in place (new DOJ pardon attorney; Alice Marie Johnson coordinating). Reporting indicates more clemencies could be forthcoming, with specific potential cases named. In his first term, he issued no clemencies during Junes, but the current term’s pace and style are very different.\n- Status quo weighting: The recent spree and explicit signaling of more clemencies, plus a very low threshold (>2), make “Yes” the default. The existence of a prepared pipeline and Trump’s willingness to court headlines suggest ongoing cadence rather than a hard stop.\n- Why not higher: A short-term pause is plausible after critical coverage (e.g., Guardian piece), to manage optics or internal process. Trump often batches actions; after a late-May batch, staff might target the next wave for early July (symbolic dates) rather than June. Monthly timing noise alone could result in 0–2 publicly disclosed actions in June even if many are in the pipeline.\n- Why not lower: The bar is low (3+). Public disclosure is typical for clemency. Reporting suggests at least two named candidates plus many other potential recipients. Operational capacity is high and legal constraints are minimal; blanket orders would trivially exceed the threshold.\n- What would change my view:\n  • Up: Early-June reporting of planned additional lists; any June 1–10 batch; White House signaling of continuing reviews or a themed initiative (e.g., nonviolent drug offenses).\n  • Down: Explicit White House messaging about a pause, or credible reporting that announcements are being held for July 4; mid-June with zero actions reported; signs of internal bottlenecks or fallout causing delays.\nNet: Given ongoing momentum, infrastructure, and incentives, a small number of June clemencies (≥3) is more likely than not.",

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
