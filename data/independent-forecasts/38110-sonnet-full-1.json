  "information": "The government of Benin closed its land border crossings with Nigeria's Kwara state around May 6-8, 2025. The specific crossing mentioned is between Taberu village in Baruten Local Government Area, Kwara State, and the neighboring Tanu village in Benin. On May 9, 2025, Benin extended its border security operations to the Sèmè and Owode borders in Lagos State. Stated reasons for the closure include concerns over arms smuggling, the emergence of a new militant group known as 'Mahmuda', and unregulated exportation of agricultural products like soya beans and cashews. Reports mentioned intelligence regarding the illegal importation of arms and ammunition from Parakou, Benin, into Nigeria.\n\nOn May 14, 2025, the Nigerian House of Representatives passed a resolution urging the Federal Government to engage in dialogue with the Republic of Benin to resolve the blockade. The motion highlighted the strain on bilateral relations and the disruption to seasonal trade critical to the livelihood of border communities. As of late May 2025, neither the Nigerian nor the Beninese government had issued any public statements suggesting an imminent reopening. On May 30, an AFRICOM briefing noted a deteriorating security threat environment along the Benin-Nigeria frontier.\n\nHistorical data on similar situations in West Africa show that border closures motivated by security concerns often persist for many months. For example, Nigeria's border closure with Benin in 2019-2020 lasted for about 16 months. Similarly, Benin's border with Niger, closed after the 2023 coup, remained shut many months later. A review of 15 security-related border closures in the ECOWAS region since 2015 indicates that approximately 20% were reopened within 60 days. Reopenings within two months are more common when the reasons are purely commercial or administrative, rather than related to terrorism or arms smuggling.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "31 days (from May 31, 2025 to July 1, 2025)",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No - the borders remain closed",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "The security concerns about arms smuggling and the Mahmuda militant group persist. Diplomatic negotiations between Nigeria and Benin prove slow or stall completely. The deteriorating security environment along the border continues, making Benin reluctant to reopen. By July 1, 2025, the borders remain closed with no imminent signs of reopening.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "High-level diplomatic engagement between Nigeria and Benin yields rapid results. Both countries agree on enhanced security measures to address arms smuggling concerns. Economic pressure from affected border communities and ECOWAS mediation facilitate a compromise solution. Benin announces the reopening of the Kwara state border crossings in late June 2025, possibly with enhanced security protocols in place.",
    "rationale": "The borders were closed around May 6-8, 2025, meaning only 23-25 days have elapsed as of May 31. The total window from closure to the July 1 resolution date is approximately 54-56 days, or roughly 2 months. The research assistant's data indicates that only about 20% of security-related ECOWAS border closures since 2015 reopened within 60 days, establishing a base rate of 0.20. However, several factors push my forecast below this base rate. First, the nature of this closure is particularly serious - involving terrorism concerns (the Mahmuda group), arms smuggling, and security threats rather than purely commercial disputes. Historical precedent shows such security-motivated closures typically persist much longer (Nigeria-Benin 2019-2020 lasted 16 months). Second, the May 30 AFRICOM briefing noted a DETERIORATING security threat environment, suggesting conditions are worsening rather than improving. Third, while the Nigerian House passed a resolution calling for dialogue on May 14, there have been no public statements from either government indicating progress toward reopening. Benin actually EXTENDED operations to other border areas on May 9, signaling a hardening rather than softening stance. Fourth, with only 31 days remaining, the time window is extremely tight for the complex diplomatic negotiations, security arrangements, and implementation required to address terrorism and arms smuggling concerns. Factors preventing a lower forecast include the genuine economic pressure from disrupted seasonal trade, ECOWAS diplomatic frameworks that could facilitate resolution, and the fact that the 20% base rate shows some closures do resolve quickly. To update higher, I would need evidence of high-level diplomatic meetings, announcements of security agreements, or explicit government statements about imminent reopening. To update lower, I would need further security incidents, explicit statements about extended closures, or complete absence of diplomatic engagement. My forecast of 15% reflects the low base rate adjusted downward for the deteriorating security situation and lack of any progress signals, while acknowledging that rapid diplomatic resolutions, though unlikely, remain possible.",
