    "review": "All three forecasters converged on similar reasoning with forecasts between 87-93%, suggesting strong agreement on the fundamentals. Forecaster 3 makes an excellent point I should have emphasized more: for a No resolution, only ONE of the seven countries needs to unblock X, making the risk cumulative across all countries. Forecaster 2 appropriately highlights Myanmar and Venezuela as the greatest sources of uncertainty, which I mentioned but perhaps underweighted. Both forecasters identify the same core strengths of the Yes case: extremely short timeframe (26 days), deeply entrenched censorship systems in most countries, and no signals of imminent policy changes. The Wikipedia editing risk is consistently identified across all analyses, though the question's provisions for edit wars provide some protection. The spread between 87-93% represents reasonable disagreement about tail risks rather than fundamental analytical differences.",
    "rationale": "My original 93% was well-reasoned but should account more explicitly for cumulative risk. With seven countries, even if each has only a 1-2% chance of unblocking in 26 days, the combined probability of at least one country unblocking becomes meaningful. Myanmar and Venezuela pose the highest individual risks due to more variable internet policies, though even there, 26 days provides minimal time for policy reversals and Wikipedia updates. China, North Korea, Iran, Russia, and Turkmenistan remain virtually certain to maintain their blocks given their systematic censorship infrastructure and lack of any policy signals suggesting change. The Wikipedia factor remains a small but real risk, though admin discretion provisions mitigate this. I'm updating slightly downward from 93% to 91% to better reflect the cumulative nature of the risk across seven countries, while maintaining confidence that the status quo strongly favors Yes resolution given the extremely compressed timeframe and entrenched nature of these censorship regimes.",
