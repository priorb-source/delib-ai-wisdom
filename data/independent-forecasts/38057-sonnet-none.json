    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Likely 2-8 weeks based on typical UFC event scheduling. UFC 316 would be scheduled in the late May to July 2025 timeframe given the current date of May 26, 2025 and sequential UFC event numbering.",
    "status_quo_outcome": "The fight is scheduled to happen. Merab Dvalishvili is the current UFC Bantamweight Champion after defeating Sean O'Malley in their first meeting at UFC 306 in September 2024. If the status quo holds, the rematch takes place as planned.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Sean O'Malley wins the rematch through knockout, submission, or decision. Alternatively, the fight is cancelled due to injury and Dvalishvili either doesn't fight at UFC 316 or faces a different opponent. Another scenario is a no-contest result or disqualification favoring O'Malley.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Merab Dvalishvili successfully defends his bantamweight title against Sean O'Malley at UFC 316, winning via his signature wrestling-heavy approach, cardio pressure, and control, similar to their first encounter. He wins by decision, submission, or potentially stoppage.",
    "rationale": "Based on the ESPN link suggesting UFC 316 is scheduled as Dvalishvili vs. O'Malley 2, this appears to be a confirmed rematch. Merab won their first fight convincingly via unanimous decision at UFC 306 in September 2024, becoming champion. His relentless wrestling, pressure, and cardio proved to be an effective counter to O'Malley's striking. In MMA rematches, the first fight result is typically predictive, though adjustments can occur. Key factors favoring Merab: (1) decisive first fight victory, (2) style matchup advantage, (3) championship momentum, (4) O'Malley's defensive wrestling remains a weakness. Factors creating uncertainty: (1) O'Malley is an elite striker who could make tactical adjustments, (2) injury risk could prevent the fight from happening (resolves No if Dvalishvili doesn't fight or fights someone else), (3) variance inherent in combat sports. The research assistant provided no additional information, so I'm relying on the match history and typical MMA dynamics. My forecast is not higher because: rematches introduce uncertainty, O'Malley has elite striking skills, and there's meaningful injury/cancellation risk. It's not lower because Merab demonstrated clear dominance in the first fight and his style remains a difficult puzzle for O'Malley. I would update higher if news confirmed both fighters are healthy and in camp, or if O'Malley shows no improvements to his takedown defense. I would update lower if injury reports emerge, or if O'Malley demonstrates significant improvements in wrestling defense.",
