    "review": "Forecasters 2 and 3 raise several important points I should weigh carefully. Most significantly, they both note that approximately 7 days have already passed in the resolution window without achieving the YES condition. This is crucial new information - it establishes that tariffs have appeared on at least one (likely both) front pages consistently for an entire week, suggesting exceptionally strong sustained coverage rather than typical news cycle variation.\n\nForecaster 3's point about word-specific criteria is interesting but ultimately weak - if tariffs are the dominant story as described, papers are likely to use the specific term rather than circumlocutions. Forecaster 2's observation about multiple front page sections (not just top headlines) is well-taken and makes omission less likely.\n\nAll three of us converge on the key tension: only ONE day is needed out of 35+ remaining days (favoring YES), but both papers must simultaneously omit the word while tariffs are clearly the dominant economic story (favoring NO). The 7-day streak of continuous coverage is the most important update to my prior analysis.",
    "rationale": "Reconsidering with the new information that 7 consecutive days have passed with tariff coverage:\n\nThe demonstrated pattern is more persistent than I initially weighted. Seven straight days of appearing on front pages suggests this isn't just a major story but an essentially omnipresent one. This shifts my assessment of the baseline probability meaningfully downward.\n\nHowever, I don't think this warrants dropping as low as 28%. Key factors:\n\n1. **Time remains substantial**: 35 days still provides meaningful opportunity for displacement by truly major breaking news (international crises, disasters, Supreme Court decisions, political scandals)\n\n2. **Low bar remains**: Only ONE day needed, not sustained absence\n\n3. **Probabilistic nature**: Even with 95% daily probability of appearing, over 35 days there's a reasonable chance of at least one miss\n\n4. **News cycle unpredictability**: June often brings unexpected major stories\n\nThe 7-day streak suggests my initial 48% was too optimistic, but Forecaster 3's 28% may be overly anchored on recent past. I'm updating toward the middle of the range established by my colleagues, though slightly above Forecaster 2's 38% given that I still find the 35-day window and low threshold (just one day) to be meaningful factors.",
