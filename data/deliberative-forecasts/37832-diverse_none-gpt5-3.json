    "review": "Both forecasters emphasize the short timeline and lack of pre-IPO signaling; I agree those are the dominant factors. Forecaster 2 adds useful color about typical precursors (IR hiring, major media leaks) and the notion that Databricks is structurally IPO-ready, which supports keeping a small, nonzero probability. Forecaster 3 leans on the CEO’s “dumb to IPO this year” quote as strong evidence for 2025; I’m less convinced that statement (from an earlier period) is binding on mid-2025 decisions, so I would de-weight it relative to the timeline and resolution mechanics. Overall, their reasoning supports a low single-digit-to-low-teens probability; I find F2’s and F3’s frameworks sound, with a slight preference for not over-weighting the dated CEO quote.",
    "rationale": "Time remaining: ~40 days. Resolution hinges on either a public S-1 or a Databricks news post announcing IPO plans; third-party reports alone won’t count. Given the short window and absence of preparatory signals, No remains the base case. However, Databricks is likely IPO-ready and could file a public S-1 in June even if pricing occurs later, which keeps a tail for Yes. I’m nudging slightly upward from my prior 7% because I’m discounting the CEO’s past “dumb to IPO this year” comment as contemporaneous guidance for mid-2025. Still, without credible reports or company signaling, the probability remains low. I would move higher on credible press about an imminent public S-1 or a Databricks blog hinting at listing plans; lower if the company reaffirms staying private through 2025 or the IPO window weakens.",
