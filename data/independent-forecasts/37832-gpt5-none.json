    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "~39 days (until July 1, 2025)",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Databricks continues to signal it won’t go public in 2025 and neither files a public S-1 nor posts any IPO-intent announcement on its official news page by June 30, 2025.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Despite recent comments, Databricks changes course and either publicly files an S-1 or posts on its news page that it plans to go public (e.g., announcing a forthcoming IPO or a confidential submission) before July 1, 2025.",
    "rationale": "- Evidence and baseline: As of today, the resolution criteria have not been met. The TechCrunch/Yahoo Finance item quotes the CEO saying it’s “dumb to IPO this year,” implying 2025 is off the table. With only ~6 weeks left, the status quo strongly favors No. IPO processes often take weeks to months even after a public S-1, and companies rarely pre-announce intentions on their own news page without a filing—especially after explicitly guiding against a 2025 IPO.\n- Resolution mechanics matter: This question resolves Yes only on (1) a public S-1 filing or (2) an announcement on Databricks’ own news page. Press leaks or third-party reports alone won’t resolve it. That further lowers the chance because it requires Databricks’ own public action.\n- Why not lower: Late-stage private companies can pivot quickly if market windows open or strategic needs (employee liquidity, secondary overhang, competitive/market signaling) become urgent. The company could also post a brief news item acknowledging a plan to go public or a confidential submission, which would satisfy the criteria without a public S-1.\n- Why not higher: The CEO’s recent stance against a 2025 IPO, the legal/comms conservatism around IPOs, and the short remaining window materially constrain the odds. Also, if they were already close, we might expect preparatory signals (IR build-out, banker chatter, reporting cadence) to surface—none are noted here.\n- What would move me upward: Credible reports of a confidential filing paired with Databricks signaling on its own channels; a sudden, strong IPO window (AI/software comps ripping, several successful June listings); an unexpected Databricks news post about pursuing a listing (IPO or direct listing). What would move me downward: Reinforced public statements that no 2025 IPO is planned; further market volatility; absence of any preparatory signals by mid-June.\n- Research assistant summary: No additional info provided beyond the background link, which supports the CEO’s non-IPO stance for 2025.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nBefore July 1, 2025, will Databricks announce that it is planning an IPO?\n\nQuestion background:\nTechCrunch: ['It's dumb to IPO this year': Databricks CEO explains why he's waiting to go public](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/dumb-ipo-databricks-ceo-explains-064957000.html)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question will resolve as **Yes** if Databricks, Inc., announces before July 1, 2025, that it is planning an initial public offering. In order to streamline the resolution of this question, there are two resolution sources for the IPO announcement: 1) Databricks filing an [SEC Form S-1](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/sec-form-s-1.asp) or 2) An announcement at the [news](https://www.databricks.com/blog) section of its website. If there is no such announcement before that date, this question resolves as **No**.\n\n\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nNo additional information available.\n\nToday is 2025-05-22.\n\nBefore answering you think:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n(e) You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
