    "review": "My initial forecast of 85% was too high, predicated heavily on the DRC precedent for near-instantaneous service rollout post-licensing. Both Forecaster 2 and Forecaster 3 provided a crucial and convincing counterargument I had underweighted: the 23 days of inaction since Lesotho granted the license on April 14th. This is significant negative evidence that directly contrasts with the DRC case and suggests the situation in Lesotho is different.\n\nForecaster 3's analysis was particularly compelling, as it articulated specific, plausible reasons for this delay beyond simple de-prioritization. Their list of potential administrative and logistical hurdles—such as equipment type approval, tax registration, and establishing import logistics through South Africa (where Starlink is unlicensed)—provides a concrete framework for understanding why a delay is occurring. These are not trivial steps and temper the expectation of an immediate launch. The argument that Starlink would want to solve the logistics of shipping kits *before* updating the map to 'Available' is very persuasive and explains the current status quo.\n\nThese arguments have convinced me to significantly lower my initial forecast. The risk of administrative and logistical drag is much higher than I first assessed.",
    "rationale": "I am revising my forecast down from 85% to 70%. The primary reason for this significant 15-point drop is the excellent points raised by the other forecasters regarding the 23 days that have already passed since the license was granted without any public announcement from Starlink. This is a material piece of evidence suggesting the rollout in Lesotho will not be as swift as it was in the DRC. The specific administrative and logistical hurdles enumerated by Forecaster 3 (e.g., equipment type approval, establishing import channels via unlicensed South Africa) provide a strong explanatory basis for this delay.\n\nDespite this downward revision, I remain at 70%, slightly more optimistic than the other forecasters. The core positive driver remains unchanged: the primary regulatory barrier has been removed. Furthermore, approximately 54 days remain until the deadline, which is a substantial amount of time for a company with SpaceX's demonstrated operational tempo and resources. I believe the identified hurdles are logistical and administrative, not fundamental roadblocks. They are known, solvable problems. It is more likely than not that Starlink will resolve these issues and update its map within the next eight weeks, but the risk of delay is now clearly much higher than I initially appreciated.",
