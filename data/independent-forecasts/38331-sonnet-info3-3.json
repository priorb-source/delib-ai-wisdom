  "information": "In early June 2025, the government of Tanzania blocked access to X. The country's information minister stated the ban was due to the platform hosting explicit sexual material, including pornographic and LGBTQ+ content, which he said was 'contrary to the East African state's laws, culture, customs, and traditions.' The move followed a recent change in X's policy to allow 'consensually produced and distributed' adult content. The Legal and Human Rights Centre (LHRC), a local rights group, described the action as part of a 'troubling pattern of digital repression' ahead of scheduled elections in October.",

    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Approximately 26 days until July 1, 2025 when Metaculus admins will check the Wikipedia page",
    "status_quo_outcome": "Yes - Wikipedia continues to list all seven countries (China, Iran, Myanmar, North Korea, Russia, Turkmenistan, and Venezuela) as currently blocking X",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "One or more of the seven countries unblocks X, or Wikipedia updates its listing to reflect that at least one of these countries no longer maintains a current block on X. This could occur through policy reversals, political changes, or Wikipedia editorial updates reflecting changed circumstances",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "All seven countries maintain their blocks on X through the end of June 2025, and Wikipedia's article continues to list all seven countries in its 'Current' blocking section when accessed on July 1, 2025 or shortly thereafter",
    "rationale": "This is a conjunctive question requiring ALL seven countries to maintain their X blocks for YES resolution. The 26-day timeframe is very short for major policy changes. Key factors supporting a high probability: (1) All seven countries have well-established, long-standing blocks reflecting deep-seated political positions. China, Iran, North Korea, Turkmenistan, and Russia have stable authoritarian censorship regimes with strong ideological commitments to internet control. (2) Unblocking major social media platforms typically requires significant political shifts that don't happen quickly. (3) The status quo strongly favors continuation. Factors creating uncertainty: (1) The conjunctive nature means even one country unblocking leads to NO resolution. (2) Venezuela has historically had variable enforcement of X blocking. (3) Myanmar's political situation remains somewhat fluid post-coup. (4) Wikipedia editing could reflect recent changes we're unaware of, though major blocks are well-documented. The assistant's report about Tanzania is irrelevant as Tanzania isn't in the resolution criteria. Estimating individual maintenance probabilities and multiplying (China 99.5%, Iran 99%, North Korea 99.5%, Russia 97%, Turkmenistan 98%, Myanmar 94%, Venezuela 90%) yields approximately 78-82%. I'm not higher because of Venezuela's historical variability and Myanmar's political fluidity, plus the multiplicative risk of seven countries. I'm not lower because the timeframe is extremely short for policy reversals, these are deeply entrenched censorship positions, and most regimes have strong incentives to maintain control. I would update higher if there were evidence of increased repression or tensions in any countries, or lower if there were reports of negotiations, political transitions, or softening stances toward platform access",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nAt the end of June 2025, will Wikipedia still list all these countries as \"currently\" blocking access to X (formerly Twitter)?\n\nQuestion background:\nAccording to the resolution source, \"Censorship of Twitter refers to Internet censorship by governments that block access to Twitter (officially known as X since July 2023). Twitter censorship also includes governmental notice and take down requests to Twitter, which it enforces in accordance with its Terms of Service when a government or authority submits a valid removal request to Twitter indicating that specific content published on the platform is illegal in their jurisdiction.\"\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if Wikipedia still lists X (formerly known as Twitter) as currently blocked in China, Iran, Myanmar, North Korea, Russia, Turkmenistan and Venezuela at [this link](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Censorship_of_Twitter#Current) when accessed by Metaculus on or after July 1, 2025. If the Wikipedia article does not list X as currently being blocked in any of those countries, this question resolves as **No**.\n\nThe question will resolve as soon as the page is accessed by Metaculus Admins on the resolution date. However, if there are issues accessing the page, then resolution will wait up to July 7, 2025, at which point if Metaculus has still not been able to access the resolution source, this question will be **annulled**. Admins will also use their discretion if there appears to be an [edit war](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Edit_warring) or lack of Wikipedia [consensus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Consensus) and may annul the question in such a case; however, Admins will also strive to resolve the question as definitively Yes or No, and such an edge case should be considered a rare outcome.\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nIn early June 2025, the government of Tanzania blocked access to X. The country's information minister stated the ban was due to the platform hosting explicit sexual material, including pornographic and LGBTQ+ content, which he said was 'contrary to the East African state's laws, culture, customs, and traditions.'

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
