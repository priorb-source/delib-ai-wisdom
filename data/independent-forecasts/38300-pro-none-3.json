    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Approximately 2 weeks. The data for May 2025 is scheduled to be released mid-June, and the question resolves based on the value available on or after June 15, 2025.",
    "status_quo_outcome": "Yes. The most recent available data for April 2025 shows year-over-year growth of 1.488%. Economic data series like industrial production exhibit significant inertia, making the continuation of the current trend the most likely outcome in the short term.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "A 'No' outcome would occur if there was a sharp, unexpected contraction in industrial activity during May 2025. This could be triggered by a sudden disruption in supply chains, a significant pullback in consumer or business spending on goods, or an unforeseen event impacting the mining or utilities sectors, causing the month's output to fall below that of May 2024.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "A 'Yes' outcome occurs if the industrial sector's momentum from April carries through May. Continued resilience in manufacturing and stable output from mining and utilities, without any major negative economic shocks, would result in the year-over-year growth rate remaining positive, even if it moderates slightly from the April figure.",
    "rationale": "My forecast is primarily based on the principle of inertia in macroeconomic data. The most recent data point for April 2025 showed a positive year-over-year growth of 1.488%, which provides a solid buffer against a negative print for May. Given that today is June 2, 2025, the month of May has already concluded. The lack of any information from my research assistant about major economic disruptions, factory shutdowns, or severe weather events during May suggests that no significant negative shock occurred. Industrial production is a broad measure that does not typically reverse sharply from positive growth to negative a single month without a clear catalyst. Therefore, the status quo is heavily weighted. My probability is not higher because monthly economic data can be noisy and subject to revisions. The 1.488% growth, while positive, is not exceptionally strong, leaving some room for a negative surprise if manufacturing or utilities underperformed expectations. A slight downturn could push the number close to zero. My probability is not lower because the positive momentum is a strong signal, and a complete reversal to negative year-over-year growth would be a significant outlier event, for which there is currently no evidence. To update my forecast lower, I would need to see leading indicators for May (such as regional Fed surveys or a final weak ISM PMI) that pointed to a sharp contraction. To update higher, I would need preliminary reports suggesting industrial activity accelerated in May.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill monthly US Industrial production have positive year-over-year growth for May 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nThe Real Economy Blog: [Industrial production index hits record high amid tariffs](https://realeconomy.rsmus.com/industrial-production-index-rises-to-record-amid-tariffs/)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if the monthly number displayed at FRED [Industrial Production: Total Index (INDPRO)](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/INDPRO#) for year-over-year growth is greater than 0.0 for May 2025, when checked by Metaculus on or after June 15, 2025.\n\nWhen accessing the data, ensure settings are Units: Percent Change from Year Ago, Seasonally Adjusted and Frequency: Monthly. For example, the number for April 2025 was 1.48803 as of May 27, 2025.\n\nSince the numbers presented by FRED are expected to be preliminary numbers from the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, please note that subsequent revisions to the number will not cause this question to re-resolve.\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nNo additional information available.\n\nToday is 2025-06-02.\n\nBefore answering you think:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n(e) You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
