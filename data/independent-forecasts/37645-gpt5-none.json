    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "~46 days (until July 1, 2025)",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "SNS uses its parliamentary majority to nominate and confirm a new prime minister, avoiding dissolution. Even if leadership plans for snap elections in autumn 2025, the formal decree calling the vote is withheld until July/August to meet Serbia’s 45–60 day legal window between call and election day.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "President Vučić dissolves the National Assembly in late May or June and issues a decree scheduling snap parliamentary elections for late July or August (or very early July), thereby announcing a specific election date before July 1, 2025.",
    "rationale": "- Timing window and law: In Serbia, parliamentary elections are typically held 45–60 days after they are formally called by presidential decree. Recent practice (e.g., 2016, 2023) aligns with ~45–55 days. If a snap vote were intended for September, the decree would most likely arrive in July/August, not before July 1. That lowers the chance an announcement happens within the next six weeks.\n- Status quo/inertia: The ruling SNS holds a majority and can install a new PM after a resignation without going to elections. Given only ~46 days remain, the path of least resistance is to form a new cabinet and defer any election call.\n- Political practice: Serbia has frequent snap elections, so snap elections in 2025 are plausible. However, votes in peak summer (July–August) are less common and politically suboptimal. That makes a pre–July 1 announcement (which would necessitate a summer election date) less likely.\n- News context: The prompt’s article headline suggests a PM resignation and the possibility of snap elections, which does elevate the hazard vs. a totally calm period. But there is no confirmation that dissolution is imminent. The research assistant provided no additional corroborating details.\nWhy not higher: Legal timing constraints and the unattractiveness of summer polling dates; a straightforward alternative exists (appoint a new PM) that preserves control without immediate elections.\nWhy not lower: Vučić/SNS have a track record of using snap elections tactically; a resignation can be a precursor to dissolution; they could still opt for a late-July/ August vote and call it in late May/June.\nWhat would move me up: Credible reports of imminent dissolution, formal steps toward dissolving the Assembly, coalition fractures preventing a new cabinet, or public statements by Vučić/SNS signaling an election in late July/August.\nWhat would move me down: Swift nomination and parliamentary confirmation of a new PM, or explicit statements that elections will be in the fall (with no decree before July 1).",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill Serbia announce a general election before July 1, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\n[Serbia could face snap elections as PM’s resignation confirmed](https://tvpworld.com/85681783/serbia-could-face-snap-elections-as-pms-resignation-confirmed-)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if, before July 1, 2025, a specific date on which a general election will be held is officially announced by the government of Serbia or any of its agencies that have the authority to do so. If no such announcement occurs before July 1, 2025, this question resolves as **No**.\n\nThe election does not have to be held before July 1, 2025; this question resolves based on an announcement.\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nNo additional information available.\n\nToday is 2025-05-15.\n\nBefore answering you think:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n(e) You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
