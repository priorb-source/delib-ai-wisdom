  "information": "The legal process to ban a political party in Germany requires an application to be submitted to the Federal Constitutional Court by the federal government, the Bundestag, or the Bundesrat. The court must then rule that the party aims to undermine the democratic order. Historically, only two parties have been banned in post-WWII Germany: the Socialist Reich Party (SRP) in 1952 and the Communist Party of Germany (KPD) in 1956. A 2017 attempt to ban the far-right NPD party failed. As of early May 2025, no formal application to ban the AfD had been filed with the Constitutional Court. Separately, Germany's domestic intelligence agency (BfV) has classified the AfD as a 'proven right-wing extremist organization,' which permits state surveillance.\n\nAccording to polling in late April 2025, the Alternative for Germany (AfD) party had support from 25-26% of voters, making it one of the strongest parties in Germany. Internally, the AfD leadership delayed the release of its new foundational program from 2025 to 2027, with party insiders stating the reason was to avoid public debate on contentious issues and internal party conflict ahead of state elections in 2026. In the public sphere, demonstrations protesting the AfD and right-wing extremism were held across multiple German cities on May 1, 2025. Earlier, in February 2025, a rally in Hachenburg demanding a ban on the AfD drew approximately 1,200 participants.\n\nIn January 2025, a cross-party group of 124 lawmakers in the German Bundestag, led by CDU politician Marco Wanderwitz, submitted a motion to initiate a party ban procedure against the AfD at the Federal Constitutional Court. The Bundestag debated this motion, along with a related motion from the Green party to assess the chances of such a procedure's success, on January 30, 2025. While a group of 17 constitutional law experts issued a statement supporting the proposal and asserting the AfD is unconstitutional, reports from the time indicated that no immediate decisions were expected from the debate and that the motion lacked majority support.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Approximately 60 days until July 1, 2025. Today is May 2, 2025.",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No ban. The AfD continues to operate legally as a political party.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "The January 2025 Bundestag motion fails to gain majority support or no formal ban application is submitted to the Federal Constitutional Court. Alternatively, even if an application is filed, the Constitutional Court does not complete proceedings before the deadline, which is the most likely scenario given the complexity and thoroughness required for such constitutional cases.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "A formal application to ban the AfD is urgently submitted to the Federal Constitutional Court within the next few days, the Court agrees to an unprecedented expedited review process given the perceived threat to democratic order, and issues a ruling to ban the party before July 1, 2025. This would require extraordinary political will and an exceptionally fast judicial process.",
    "rationale": "The evidence overwhelmingly suggests a No outcome. Most critically, no formal application has been filed with the Federal Constitutional Court as of early May 2025, with only 60 days remaining until the deadline. Historical precedent shows party bans are extremely rare in post-WWII Germany (only 2 successful bans: SRP in 1952 and KPD in 1956, with a failed NPD attempt in 2017), and such proceedings typically take years, not weeks. The January 2025 motion from 124 lawmakers explicitly lacked majority support in the Bundestag, indicating insufficient political consensus. The AfD's strong polling at 25-26% makes it one of Germany's most popular parties, which complicates the political and legal calculus of banning it. Constitutional Court proceedings require thorough examination and high evidentiary standards - a 60-day timeline would be impossibly rushed. While 17 constitutional law experts support the ban and intelligence services classify the AfD as extremist, these factors address the merits but not the procedural timeline. My forecast is not 0% because extraordinary circumstances could theoretically trigger an emergency process, though this seems highly implausible. It's not higher because the fundamental barriers - no application filed, insufficient time, lack of political majority, and historical precedent - are overwhelming. To update upward, I would need to see an immediate application filing and announcements of expedited proceedings. To update downward, explicit rejection of the motion would eliminate even the small remaining probability.",
