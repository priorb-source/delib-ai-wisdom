  "information": "Resignations from the European Parliament frequently occur when a sitting MEP is appointed to a ministerial position within their national government. Following elections in several member states, new governments were in the process of being formed. Specifically, after the May 18 elections in Portugal, there were rumors that at least two MEPs were being considered for cabinet positions in the new government. Other countries, including Germany, the Netherlands, and Belgium, also had fluid political circumstances that could lead to cabinet reshuffles.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "26 days from today (June 5) until the resolution date of July 1, 2025. The relevant window for resignations is June 9 to July 1, which is 22 days.",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No - the default outcome is that no MEPs resign during the specific 22-day window, as MEP resignations are relatively rare events on any given day.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "No MEPs announce resignations between June 9-July 1, 2025. This could occur if: government formations in Portugal and other countries are delayed beyond this timeframe; potential ministerial appointees decline positions or are not ultimately selected; or the timing of announcements falls outside this narrow window (either before June 9 or after July 1).",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "At least one MEP announces their resignation between June 9-July 1, 2025. Most likely, one or both of the Portuguese MEPs rumored for cabinet positions are officially appointed to the new Portuguese government following the May 18 elections. Alternatively, MEPs from Germany, Netherlands, or Belgium might resign for ministerial appointments during political reshuffles in those countries.",
    "rationale": "The 22-day window is quite narrow, which inherently limits the probability of any specific event occurring. However, several factors make this more likely than a typical random period: (1) Portugal held elections on May 18, approximately 2.5 weeks ago, placing us in the typical timeframe for government formation and cabinet announcements (usually 2-4 weeks post-election); (2) The research assistant specifically mentions rumors of at least two Portuguese MEPs being considered for cabinet positions; (3) Multiple other countries (Germany, Netherlands, Belgium) are experiencing political fluidity that could lead to ministerial appointments. The timing is notably favorable - government formations are actively underway, and the June 9-July 1 window aligns well with when cabinet announcements typically occur after European national elections. Against this, I must weight: the inherent rarity of MEP resignations on any given day (even with 705 MEPs, resignations are infrequent); the uncertainty in exact timing (announcements could slip to early July); and the possibility that rumored appointments don't materialize. The status quo suggests most days pass without resignations. I'm not going higher because: the window is very constrained, timing precision is difficult to predict, and rumors don't always lead to actual appointments. I'm not going lower because: the government formation timing appears favorable, there are specific rumors about multiple MEPs, and multiple countries are mentioned as having fluid political situations increasing the overall probability across the Parliament.",
