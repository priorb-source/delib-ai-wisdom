    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Approximately 3 weeks",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No, Aaron Rouse does not win the primary. His opponent, Babur Lateef, leverages his base in the more vote-rich region of Northern Virginia to secure a narrow victory.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Babur Lateef successfully consolidates the Northern Virginia (NoVA) Democratic vote, which is the largest and most influential bloc in a statewide primary. Rouse's support remains concentrated in his Hampton Roads base and is insufficient to overcome Lateef's advantage in the state's most populous region.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Aaron Rouse's unique biography as a former NFL player and his status as a state senator boost his name recognition statewide. He runs a strong campaign that resonates beyond his Hampton Roads base, makes significant inroads with suburban voters in Northern Virginia and the Richmond area, and ultimately wins the nomination.",
    "rationale": "My forecast is based on the fundamental geography of Virginia's Democratic primary electorate. The race currently appears to be a head-to-head contest between State Senator Aaron Rouse, based in Hampton Roads, and Prince William County School Board Chairman Babur Lateef, based in Northern Virginia (NoVA).\n\nHistorically, NoVA is the demographic and political center of gravity for the Virginia Democratic Party, consistently delivering the largest share of votes in statewide primaries. A candidate with a strong base in NoVA, like Lateef, enters the race with a significant structural advantage. In a low-information primary, voters often default to candidates from their own region, which favors Lateef numerically.\n\nMy probability is not lower than 45% because Aaron Rouse possesses considerable assets that could overcome this geographic disadvantage. As a sitting state senator, he holds a higher office than his opponent. More importantly, his background as a former NFL player gives him a unique public profile and a potential for earned media and name recognition that is rare in a down-ballot primary. This could allow him to build a broader coalition and peel off votes in regions outside his home base, including NoVA.\n\nHowever, my probability is not higher than 45% because overcoming NoVA's numerical superiority is a difficult task. Without specific polling, fundraising data, or major endorsement information, the most reliable prior is the state's political geography. Lateef's regional advantage makes him the narrow, status-quo favorite.\n\nI would increase my forecast for Rouse if I saw polling showing him with a statewide lead or running competitively in NoVA, or if he secured major endorsements from prominent NoVA politicians. Conversely, I would lower my forecast if Lateef consolidates NoVA endorsements and fundraising, solidifying his advantage in that critical region.",

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any).
