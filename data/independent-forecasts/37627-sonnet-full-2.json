  "information": "Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy and Donald Trump have had several communications in 2025. On February 12, they spoke for about an hour about peace efforts and cooperation. On March 19, they spoke again, with Zelenskyy expecting to be briefed on Trump's prior conversation with Vladimir Putin. On May 10, following a meeting with European leaders in Kyiv, Zelenskyy spoke with Trump, stating that Ukraine was ready for direct peace talks if a 30-day ceasefire was agreed upon. On the same day, European leaders also held a joint call with Trump from Kyiv.\n\nA proposal was made for direct Russia-Ukraine talks to be held in Istanbul on May 15, 2025. Volodymyr Zelenskyy agreed to attend and invited Donald Trump to be present at the meeting. Trump expressed optimism about the talks and stated he was considering attending, but noted his schedule was busy. His schedule included a trip to Saudi Arabia, Qatar, and the UAE from May 12, concluding on May 15, the same day as the proposed meeting.\n\nEuropean powers have demanded a 30-day ceasefire from Russia, starting May 12, warning of new sanctions if the demand was ignored. Donald Trump advised Volodymyr Zelenskyy to accept talks with Vladimir Putin without the precondition of a ceasefire. Conversely, Zelenskyy stated that Ukraine's readiness for talks was contingent on Russia agreeing to a 30-day ceasefire and providing for its effective monitoring.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "33 days (from May 13 to June 15, 2025)",
    "status_quo_outcome": "Yes - another phone call is likely to occur",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "The Istanbul peace talks collapse or Trump attends in person, eliminating the need for phone coordination. Communication shifts entirely to other channels (in-person meetings, intermediaries, or written communications). Relations deteriorate significantly, or the situation stabilizes to the point where direct Trump-Zelenskyy calls are no longer needed during this specific window.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Trump and Zelenskyy have a follow-up call after the May 15 Istanbul talks to discuss outcomes. Alternatively, developments in the ceasefire situation (either compliance or violations) prompt a coordination call. Given their established pattern of speaking every 4-6 weeks, another call occurs naturally within this 33-day window as part of ongoing diplomatic engagement on the peace process.",
    "rationale": "The established communication pattern strongly suggests another call is likely. Trump and Zelenskyy have spoken three times in 2025: February 12, March 19, and most recently May 10 (just 3 days ago). This indicates roughly monthly contact during this critical peace negotiation period. While the May 10 call was very recent, the resolution window extends 33 days until June 15, which is longer than their typical interval between calls. The active peace process creates multiple potential triggers for communication: the Istanbul talks on May 15, the 30-day ceasefire demand starting May 12, and ongoing coordination needs. The requirement that both sides acknowledge the call reduces some risk of false positives. However, the probability isn't higher because: (1) they very recently spoke, potentially reducing immediate need; (2) Trump might attend Istanbul in person, enabling face-to-face communication instead; (3) communication could occur through other channels. The probability isn't lower because: (1) the 33-day window is substantial; (2) their established pattern suggests high frequency of contact; (3) the dynamic peace negotiation situation creates multiple likely scenarios requiring coordination; (4) both leaders have shown willingness to engage directly. I would update higher if reports emerge of scheduled calls or if the peace process intensifies. I would update lower if Trump definitively attends Istanbul in person or if communication patterns shift to other officials.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill Donald Trump and Volodymyr Zelenskyy speak on the phone with each other before June 15, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nSky News: [Key moments that have shaped Trump and Zelenskyy's relationship](https://news.sky.com/story/trump-and-zelenskyys-relationship-from-perfect-phone-call-to-oval-office-clash-13331892)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if, after May 12, 2025 and before June 15, 2025, Donald Trump and Volodymyr Zelenskyy speak on the phone with each other, according to [credible sources](https://www.metaculus.com/faq/#definitions).\n\nBoth sides must acknowledge the phone call took place for it to count. \"Speak on the phone with each other\" is defined as both individuals, from different physical spaces, orally uttering words intended for the other individual into a telephone or equivalent device, those words being converted into electrical or digital signals in real time, and then transferred to the other individual via telecommunications links, where they are reconverted into sound waves at the other individual's listening device.\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nUkrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy and Donald Trump have had several communications in 2025.

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
