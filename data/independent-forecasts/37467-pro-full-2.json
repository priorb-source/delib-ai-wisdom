  "information": "Beyond Meat's financial results for the first quarter of 2025 showed a 9.1% year-over-year decline in net revenues to $68.7 million. The company reported a net loss of $52.9 million and a gross loss of $1.1 million, resulting in a gross margin of -1.5%. While the company's international business revenue grew, its U.S. retail channel revenue fell by 15.4%. Citing weak consumer demand and macroeconomic volatility, Beyond Meat withdrew its annual sales forecast for 2025 and issued a revised outlook for the second quarter with expected net revenues between $80 million and $85 million.\n\nAs of March 2025, Beyond Meat had $116 million in cash on hand. The company's liabilities included $1.15 billion in convertible bonds maturing in 2027, which were reported to be trading at 17 cents on the dollar. On May 7, 2025, the company announced it had secured a new $100 million senior secured financing facility. The loan has an initial term of 4.75 years with an interest rate of 12% until February 2030, payable in kind, meaning interest is added to the loan's principal instead of being paid in cash during this period.\n\nIn response to its financial performance, Beyond Meat has implemented several operational changes, including a 17% workforce reduction for non-production staff and a suspension of its operations in China. Management stated its strategic priorities include restoring product distribution within the U.S. market and improving consumer perception through new marketing campaigns. The stated long-term goal for the company is to achieve EBITDA-positive operations by the end of 2026.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Less than 2 months. The deadline is July 1, 2025, and today is May 8, 2025.",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No. The company is currently operating and has just secured new financing, making its continued operation without a bankruptcy filing the most likely outcome in the short term.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Leveraging its existing cash reserves and the newly secured $100 million financing facility, Beyond Meat successfully navigates the next two months. This capital provides sufficient runway to cover operational losses and continue its turnaround efforts, avoiding the need for bankruptcy protection before the July 1, 2025 deadline.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "An unforeseen catastrophic event, such as the discovery of significant financial fraud or a sudden and complete collapse of a key part of its supply chain, triggers a severe liquidity crisis. This crisis exhausts the company's cash and new financing far more rapidly than anticipated, forcing management to seek bankruptcy protection as the only viable option before the July deadline.",
    "rationale": "The core of my forecast is the very short time frame (less than two months) combined with Beyond Meat's recent capital injection. On May 7, 2025, the company announced a new $100 million senior secured financing facility. This is in addition to the $116 million in cash it held as of March 2025. While the company's underlying financial health is extremely poor—evidenced by ongoing net losses ($52.9M in Q1 2025), negative gross margins, declining US revenue, and its convertible bonds trading at highly distressed levels—this new financing provides a critical short-term liquidity bridge. Lenders would not provide such a facility if they anticipated an immediate bankruptcy filing. The loan's interest is payable-in-kind, meaning it doesn't create an immediate cash drain. Therefore, the company has secured sufficient runway to operate well beyond the July 1, 2025 deadline. The probability is not zero because the company is in a precarious state, and an unforeseen 'black swan' event like a major accounting scandal or a critical operational failure could theoretically force a sudden filing. However, the probability is low because a company that has just secured fresh capital is highly unlikely to file for bankruptcy within weeks. I would increase the probability if the new financing deal were to fall through or if a major fraud was revealed. I would decrease the probability if the company announced a significant positive development, though this is unlikely to materially change the already low probability in such a short window.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill Beyond Meat file for bankruptcy before July 1, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nBeyond Meat has had several years of losses and in the most recent quarter it [posted](https://investors.beyondmeat.com/news-releases/news-release-details/beyond-meatr-reports-fourth-quarter-and-full-year-2024-financial) a loss from operations of almost $38 million.\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question will resolve as **Yes** if Beyond Meat, Inc., files any petition for bankruptcy protection in the United States, under any chapter of the United States Bankruptcy Code, before July 1, 2025. The question will resolves on the filing of such a petition, not on whether any bankruptcy protection is granted by a court.

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
