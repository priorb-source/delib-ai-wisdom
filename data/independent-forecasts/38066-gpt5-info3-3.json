  "information": "In May 2025, news reports indicated that Sam Altman had made conciliatory gestures towards Elon Musk. Altman reportedly wrote to Musk proposing a collaboration on the development of artificial general intelligence (AGI) and extended an 'olive branch.' While Musk had not publicly responded to the written offer, reports mentioned that informal contacts had occurred between the technical teams of their respective organizations. Separately, Altman publicly posted on social media to Musk, stating, 'AGI is too important, can't let petty grudges get in the way.'",

    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "About 20 days until the event window opens (after 7:59 AM PDT, June 16, 2025) and ~22 days until it closes (before 00:00 AM PDT, June 18, 2025). If unclear, final resolution by July 1, 2025 (~35 days).",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Both give separate keynotes/fireside chats or one appears remotely/cancels; no jointly scheduled panel; or they are on premises but never share the same physical platform simultaneously.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "YC schedules or spontaneously orchestrates a joint fireside chat/panel (e.g., a moderated conversation or closing session) where both are physically on stage together in San Francisco during June 16–17.",
    "rationale": "Baseline: At large conferences, headliners usually do separate sessions unless a joint segment is explicitly programmed and promoted. Given the high-profile rivalry and logistics, the status quo points to separate appearances or a last‑minute change by at least one party. The requirement that they be physically on the same stage further lowers odds (no virtual/serial appearances).\nPush factors toward Yes: YC has strong incentive to create a marquee moment; both are announced as headliners; media buzz would be huge. The research assistant’s note that Sam Altman extended an olive branch and that there have been informal team contacts slightly increases the chance of a symbolic joint appearance.\nPull factors toward No: No public confirmation of a joint session yet; Musk’s scheduling unpredictability and tendency to favor solo interviews; potential mid‑June conflicts (e.g., typical timing of Tesla’s shareholder meeting) could constrain his physical presence in SF; YC may prefer to avoid a polarizing on‑stage confrontation overshadowing the program.\nWhy not higher: Absent a published agenda or explicit hints of a joint panel, the base rate for rivals sharing a stage is low. Physical co‑presence is a stringent criterion, and Musk’s last‑minute changes are common.\nWhy not lower: Both being announced headliners and the recent conciliatory signals make a surprise or planned joint session plausible, especially if YC wants a headline-grabbing capstone.\nUpdates to watch:\n- Strong upward revision (to 70–85%): YC posts an agenda listing a joint session; either party publicly confirms a joint appearance; trusted reporting leaks a planned on‑stage conversation; Musk’s travel plans place him in SF those days with buffer time.\n- Downward revision (to <10%): Agenda shows only separate sessions; either party indicates remote participation or cancels; scheduling conflicts (e.g., confirmed overlapping obligations) emerge; public rhetoric hardens again.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill Sam Altman and Elon Musk be on the stage together at YC AI Startup School?\n\nQuestion background:\nY Combinator is an American venture capital firm known for launching over 5,000 companies including Airbnb, Stripe, and Reddit. In 2025, Y Combinator announced AI Startup School, a conference in San Francisco held on June 16–17, aimed at 2,000 final-year students and recent graduates in computer science, artificial intelligence, and related fields.&#x20;\n\nY Combinator has announced that both Sam Altman and Elon Musk are among the headline speakers at the AI Startup School, but it is unknown whether they will appear on stage together at the same time.\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question will resolve as Yes if Sam Altman and Elon Musk share a stage together at YC AI Startup School after 7:59 AM, June 16, 2025, and before 00:00 AM, June 18, 2025. Otherwise, this question will resolve as No.\n\nSharing a stage is defined as both individuals being physically present on the same platform at the same time.&#x20;\n\nThis question will resolve according to a preponderance of evidence. If there is no clear evidence of this occurring before July 1, 2025, this question will resolve as No.\n\nAll times for this question are in Pacific Daylight Time (PDT).  &#x20;\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nIn May 2025, news reports indicated that Sam Altman had made conciliatory gestures towards Elon Musk. Altman reportedly wrote to Musk proposing a collaboration on the development of artificial general intelligence (AGI) and extended an 'olive branch.' While Musk had not publicly responded to the written offer, reports mentioned that informal contacts had occurred between the technical teams of their respective organizations. Separately, Altman publicly posted on social media to Musk, stating, 'AGI is too important, can't let petty grudges get in the way.'\n\nToday is 2025-05-27.\n\nBefore answering you think:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n(e) You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
