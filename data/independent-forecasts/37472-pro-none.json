    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Less than 2 months. The question resolves on July 1, 2025.",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No. Sheikh Hasina remains in exile outside of Bangladesh, and the interim government remains in power.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Sheikh Hasina remains in exile, likely in India. The interim government in Bangladesh maintains control and its legal and political barriers to her return, such as potential arrest warrants, remain in effect. India, prioritizing regional stability, does not facilitate her return. Hasina herself decides the political climate is not yet favorable for a comeback and opts to wait for a more opportune moment after this resolution window closes.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "A significant political or social crisis erupts in Bangladesh, weakening the interim government's authority and creating a groundswell of support for Sheikh Hasina's Awami League. Seeing a narrow window of opportunity, she makes a high-risk, dramatic return to rally her supporters, even if it means immediate arrest. Alternatively, diplomatic negotiations between India and Bangladesh could result in her extradition or a negotiated return within this timeframe.",
    "rationale": "My forecast is based on the strong likelihood that the status quo will hold in the short term. Sheikh Hasina was ousted in August 2024 following a popular uprising, and the interim government led by Muhammad Yunus has had several months to consolidate power. This government has a strong incentive to prevent her return, which would almost certainly destabilize the country. It is highly probable that legal cases have been prepared against her, and she would face immediate arrest upon arrival. Furthermore, her host country, presumably India, has a vested interest in a stable Bangladesh and is unlikely to support a premature and disruptive return. While Sheikh Hasina has publicly vowed to return, such statements are common from exiled leaders and serve to maintain political relevance and rally supporters; they do not always translate into immediate action, especially within a very specific and short timeframe like the one for this question (May 12 to July 1, 2025). The forces maintaining the status quo—legal barriers, the interim government's opposition, and regional diplomatic interests—are currently much stronger than the factors favoring her imminent return. My probability is not lower than 15% because Sheikh Hasina is a determined political figure, and the political situation in Bangladesh remains volatile. An unexpected crisis could rapidly change her calculus, making a high-stakes return seem like a viable option. Her public vow cannot be entirely dismissed. My probability is not higher because the political, legal, and diplomatic hurdles for a return in the next seven weeks are formidable. For me to increase my forecast, I would need to see evidence of significant instability within the Bangladeshi interim government, large-scale public protests demanding her return, or official statements from India indicating a change in their position regarding her stay. Conversely, I would lower my forecast if the interim government further consolidates its power or announces major new charges against her.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill Sheikh Hasina return to Bangladesh before July 1, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nFirstpost: [Bangladesh has turned into a ‘terrorist country’: Sheikh Hasina targets Yunus, vows to return](https://www.firstpost.com/world/bangladesh-has-turned-into-a-terrorist-country-sheikh-hasina-targets-yunus-vows-to-return-13878191.html)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if Sheikh Hasina after May 12, 2025 and before July 1, 2025 enters territory of Bangladesh according to [credible sources](https://www.metaculus.com/help/faq/#definitions).\n\nThe circumstances of her entering Bangladeshi territory, whether voluntarily or due to her extradition from India, will not affect resolution.\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nNo additional information available.\n\nToday is 2025-05-08.\n\nBefore answering you think:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n(e) You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
