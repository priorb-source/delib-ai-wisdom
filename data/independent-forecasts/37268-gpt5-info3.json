  "information": "Muqtada al-Sadr has a history of reversing decisions to boycott elections. He previously reversed boycotts in 2014 and 2021. The 2021 reversal occurred in mid-August, approximately two months before the election. Despite his current boycott, al-Sadr has urged his followers to update their voter registration records. Some political sources have discussed the possibility of al-Sadr participating indirectly through an independent list to maintain influence, a strategy he has used in the past. In June 2022, after his party won 73 seats in the 2021 election, he ordered his entire parliamentary bloc to resign.",

    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "About 58 days (until 2025-07-01)",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Al-Sadr maintains his boycott stance through July 1, 2025. He may continue urging registration and keep options open, but without any formal declaration that his movement/list will field candidates. He could also choose to back allied independents informally without an explicit announcement by his movement, which would not meet the question’s criterion.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "A formal statement from the Sadrist movement (under Sairoon/Alliance Towards Reforms or any successor label) announces it will field candidates for the 2025 parliamentary election before July 1. This could follow a political bargain, signs of public mobilization he wants to channel electorally, or revised election timelines requiring earlier list preparations.",
    "rationale": "- Current stance: Reporting indicates Muqtada al-Sadr has recently reaffirmed a boycott, rejecting appeals to participate. That makes the status quo outcome a No. Good forecasting practice gives weight to the status quo because reversals are less common than continuity over short windows.\n- History of reversals: Al-Sadr has reversed boycotts before (notably in 2014 and 2021). In 2021 he re-entered around mid-August—roughly two months before the October election. This shows genuine option value and flexibility, but the timing matters: July 1, 2025 is likely well before the 2025 election date, so a reversal by that early date is less typical for him.\n- Signals of optionality: Your assistant notes he has urged followers to update voter records—consistent with preserving the option to run. There is also chatter about participating indirectly via independents. However, the resolution requires an announcement that his movement will field candidates (name changes allowed). Quiet, deniable backing of independents would likely not satisfy the criterion.\n- Recent behavior: He boycotted the 2023 provincial elections, and after winning big in 2021 he ordered his bloc to resign in 2022, showing willingness to exit formal politics for strategic reasons. That pulls the probability down versus a naïve “he’ll always come back” view.\n- Timing and institutional factors: Candidate-list deadlines tend to be closer to election day; there’s no strong procedural reason to announce by July 1 if the election is later in 2025. Sadr often maximizes leverage by delaying decisions.\nWhy not higher: Fresh reaffirmations of a boycott, a short two-month window, and the likelihood he prefers ambiguity or later timing argue against a pre–July 1 announcement.\nWhy not lower: His track record of last-minute reversals and current voter-registration nudges keep a non-trivial chance alive. Any political bargain or crisis could accelerate an announcement.\nWhat would move me up: Credible reports of the Sadrist movement forming an electoral committee, coordinating with IHEC on list registration, leaks of candidate vetting, or explicit softening statements from Sadr or top lieutenants hinting at re-entry on a near-term timetable.\nWhat would move me down: Another categorical boycott statement from Sadr near mid/late June; indications the movement will only support independents without branding; legal/administrative hurdles or timelines that make early July irrelevant for list registration.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nBefore July 1, 2025, will Muqtada al-Sadr's Alliance Towards Reforms party announce that it will participate in the 2025 Iraqi parliamentary election?\n\nQuestion background:\nbasnews: [Sadr Rejects Iraqi President’s Plea, Reaffirms Election Boycott](https://www.basnews.com/en/babat/881132)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if, before July 1, 2025, the Alliance Towards Reforms announces that it will field candidates in Iraq's [2025 parliamentary elections](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2025_Iraqi_parliamentary_election).\n\n\"Alliance Towards Reforms\" refers to the \"**تحالف سائرون للإصلا**ح\" or \"سائرون\" coalition, party or movement headed by Muqtada al-Sadr, as decribed at [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alliance_Towards_Reforms).

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
