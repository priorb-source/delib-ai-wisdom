    "review": "Both forecasters largely mirror my prior reasoning: licensing on Apr 14 removes the main blocker; Starlink’s post-license activation in Africa often occurs within weeks to a few months; remaining frictions include type approval, tax/commerce setup, logistics, and internal batching of map updates. The new incremental angle I found most useful was the emphasis on end‑of‑Q2 as a natural cadence point for map flips, which modestly increases odds by June 30. Their references to nearby African rollouts and laser backhaul feasibility are consistent with my view. I don’t see strong counter‑evidence that would push meaningfully down; the principal downside remains administrative lag and deprioritization in a small market.",
    "rationale": "Time remaining (~7+ weeks) sits within Starlink’s common 1–3 month window from license to “Available” in many African markets. Lesotho’s small size, clear value proposition, and ISL backhaul reduce technical hurdles. Key uncertainties are type approval and commerce/logistics enablement, plus Starlink’s tendency to batch website/map updates. The end‑of‑Q2 milestone slightly increases the chance they flip Lesotho by June 30 if the back‑office pieces clear. Net of these, I remain just above even, nudging up slightly on the quarter‑end cadence argument, while respecting the non‑trivial risk of administrative lag pushing into July or later.",
