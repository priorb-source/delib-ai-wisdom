  "information": "Brent Metz, a 39-year-old town councilman in Mountain View, Colorado, pleaded not guilty to felony charges related to the shooting of a 17-year-old high school student in September 2024. According to investigators, Metz shot the teen in the face while the teen was sitting in his car outside Metz's home, where he had been trying to take homecoming dance pictures. A Jefferson County Sheriff’s spokesperson stated that there was no indication the teen intended to commit any crime. Metz took a leave of absence from the council after the shooting.\n\nA recall election for Brent Metz is scheduled for May 20, 2025, after a recall petition was successfully certified. The election is being conducted by mail, and ballots were sent to voters in late April 2025. Mountain View is a small town with a population of approximately 500-600 residents and fewer than 400 active voters. No public polling data on the recall election is available.\n\nHistorical data for U.S. local recall elections shows that approximately 60% of recalls that make it to the ballot succeed in removing the official. Several recent recall efforts in other small Colorado towns have been successful. In March 2025, three council members in Dillon were removed by voters in a recall election related to a development plan. In a separate 2025 case in Loveland, the targeted council member resigned from his position after a recall petition gathered sufficient signatures.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "About 8 days (election May 20, 2025; unofficial results likely that night)",
    "status_quo_outcome": "Metz retains his seat (recall fails), since he is currently in office and incumbency is the present state absent successful removal.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "A majority votes to recall Metz, or he resigns before certification—either way he does not retain the seat after the recall election.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "The recall question fails (a majority votes against recalling), and Metz remains on the council after the election.",
    "rationale": "Base rate: Roughly 60% of U.S. local recalls that reach the ballot succeed, implying a 40% survival baseline for incumbents. Context specifics push against Metz: the alleged shooting of a 17-year-old, felony charges, and the sheriff’s statement that there was no indication of a crime by the teen are unusually negative facts likely to mobilize voters for removal, especially in a very small electorate (<400 active voters) where organized recall backers often dominate turnout. The recall petition was certified, signaling nontrivial preexisting support for removal. Recent Colorado small-town recalls have also succeeded, suggesting an environment receptive to such actions. Mail ballots are already out, so late-breaking sentiment shifts are less likely. Countervailing factors: incumbency and small-town personal networks can sometimes blunt recalls; absence of polling leaves uncertainty; some voters may prioritize due process or believe Metz’s account. However, the severity of the incident and ongoing felony case likely outweigh typical incumbency advantages here. I weight resignation before May 20 as low but nonzero; if it occurs, it also leads to a No outcome (he does not retain the seat). Why not higher? The base-rate of recall success, the gravity of the allegations, and small-electorate dynamics all point to a higher-than-baseline chance of removal. Why not lower? Incumbency and potential community support introduce meaningful uncertainty; without polling, a failure of the recall remains plausible. What would move me up (higher Yes probability): credible reports of strong local support for Metz, endorsements from respected community figures, signs the recall effort is disorganized, or legal developments clearly exculpating him before Election Day. What would move me down (lower Yes probability): evidence of unusually high turnout driven by recall proponents, additional negative reporting, public statements by town leaders urging removal, or any indication Metz might resign.",
