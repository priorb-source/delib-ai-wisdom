    "review": "- Forecaster 2 adds concrete, process-centric obstacles I hadn’t incorporated: a thin recent sitting schedule, a May–June calendar reportedly lacking trade items, and acute macro/political disruptions. If accurate, these sharply reduce throughput odds. I think one claim (needing budget allocations for AfCFTA to ratify) is not binding—states can ratify before full implementation—but the broader point about bandwidth and prioritization still stands. The alleged April arrest of a vice-president is a serious claim but I’d want independent confirmation; even without it, the overall environment supports a lower probability.\n- Forecaster 3 leans on political will signals (ministerial commitment, business community support, regional prep). Those are positive but are weak predictors without evidence of the bill being tabled, scheduled, or fast-tracked. Given the two-step domestic process plus AU deposit, 65% seems too high absent procedural milestones.\n- Net: F2’s procedural and agenda-based arguments are more decision-relevant than F3’s signaling evidence. I update downward, though not as low as 2% due to tail risks of executive fast-tracking and symbolic ratification moves under regional pressure.",
    "rationale": "Time remaining is ~60 days. To resolve Yes, South Sudan must complete: (1) TNLA passage, (2) presidential assent, and (3) deposit with the AU. In South Sudan’s context, all three within two months is possible only with visible prioritization and compressed procedure. I initially set 20% to reflect that a political push could overcome inertia. Incorporating F2’s points about limited legislative sittings and an agenda reportedly devoid of AfCFTA, plus competing crises (oil revenue shock, election/peace roadmap), I see lower odds of the needed prioritization. While ministerial statements and private-sector backing (F3) raise the chance above near-zero, they don’t substitute for concrete legislative scheduling. I therefore reduce my forecast from 20% to 12%. I would revise upward quickly if the bill appears on the TNLA order paper with expedited readings or if the presidency signals fast-track and deposit arrangements with the AU; I would revise downward if by late May there’s still no tabling or if parliamentary time is consumed by security/election matters.",
