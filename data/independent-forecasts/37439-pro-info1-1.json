  "information": "According to media reports citing the Kremlin, Donald Trump and Vladimir Putin held phone conversations on February 12, 2025, and March 18, 2025. The February call reportedly lasted nearly 90 minutes. The March call was to discuss the war in Ukraine and a potential 30-day ceasefire proposal. On April 4, 2025, Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov stated that no phone conversations between the leaders were planned for the near future.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "The outcome will be known after the resolution period ends on June 15, 2025. As of today, May 6, 2025, there are approximately 40 days until the outcome is determined.",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No. The most recent official statement from the Kremlin (April 4, 2025) indicated that no phone calls were planned for the near future. Barring a significant change, this status quo will hold and no call will take place.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "No significant event, such as a major military escalation in Ukraine or a tangible diplomatic breakthrough, occurs that would necessitate a direct conversation between the two leaders within the specified timeframe. Diplomatic communications continue through established, lower-level channels, and the Kremlin's April 4th statement holds true.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "A sudden crisis or opportunity related to the war in Ukraine prompts an urgent need for direct leader-to-leader communication. For example, a new ceasefire proposal gains traction, or a dangerous military incident requires de-escalation, leading Trump to initiate a call to Putin which is then publicly acknowledged by both sides.",
    "rationale": "My forecast is based on weighting the most recent official statements against the precedent set by previous interactions and the volatile geopolitical context. The primary evidence supporting a 'No' outcome is the Kremlin's explicit statement on April 4, 2025, that no calls were planned for the 'near future'. High-level diplomatic calls are typically not impromptu, and this statement suggests nothing was on the agenda heading into the resolution period. The world generally changes slowly, and the status quo is that leaders of these two nations do not speak on a monthly basis. However, the probability is not lower because of two key factors. First, Trump and Putin have already spoken twice in 2025 (February and March), establishing a recent precedent for direct communication. Second, Donald Trump's diplomatic style is often unconventional, and he may seek a call to reinforce his image as a dealmaker capable of ending the war in Ukraine. The situation in Ukraine remains highly volatile, and a sudden escalation or opportunity could easily trigger the need for a call. I would raise my forecast if credible reports emerged of a new peace initiative or a significant military crisis. Conversely, I would lower it if the a significant portion of the resolution window passes without any such developments or if either side explicitly rules out a meeting in this period. The current probability of 20% reflects a strong leaning toward 'No' based on the official status quo, while acknowledging the non-trivial chance of a precipitating event given the actors and circumstances involved.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill Donald Trump and Vladimir Putin speak on the phone with each other before June 15, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nWikipedia: [February 2025 Putin–Trump call](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/February_2025_Putin%E2%80%93Trump_call)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if, after May 12, 2025 and before June 15, 2025, Donald Trump and Vladimir Putin speak on the phone with each other, according to [credible sources](https://www.metaculus.com/faq/#definitions).\n\nBoth sides must acknowledge the phone call took place for it to count. \"Speak on the phone with each other\" is defined as both Trump and Putin, from different physical spaces, orally uttering words intended for the other individual into a telephone or equivalent device, those words being converted into electrical or digital signals in real time, and then transferred to the other individual via telecommunications links, where they are reconverted into sound waves at the other individual's listening device.\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nAccording to media reports citing the Kremlin, Donald Trump and Vladimir Putin held phone conversations on February 12, 2025, and March 18, 2025. The February call reportedly lasted nearly 90 minutes. The March call was to discuss the war in Ukraine and a potential 30-day ceasefire proposal. On April 4, 2025, Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov stated that no phone conversations between the leaders were planned for the near future.\n\nToday is 2025-05-06.\n\nBefore answering you think:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n(e) You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
