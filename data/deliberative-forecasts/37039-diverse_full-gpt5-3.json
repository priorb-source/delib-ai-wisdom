    "review": "Both forecasters correctly focus on the resolution criterion: the cell alongside 9903.01.60 showing 31% for Switzerland is what matters, and the suspension flag is irrelevant. They emphasize bureaucratic inertia and the short timeline within an active 90‑day suspension window through July 9, which strongly favors the status quo persisting on June 1. I agree with that framing. They did not add new hard evidence beyond what I had, but they reinforced the procedural and timing arguments. One risk they didn’t explicitly call out is the resolution’s dependence on the specific subheading (9903.01.60); an administrative renumbering or relocation of the Swiss line before June 1 could technically produce a No even if a 31% measure still exists elsewhere. That said, such a renumbering within weeks absent a new proclamation is unlikely. Overall, their reasoning is sound and consistent with my view.",
    "rationale": "Status quo is Yes: as of now 9903.01.60 lists Switzerland at 31%, and the suspension runs past June 1. For a No, the administration would need to both reach a deal and direct USITC to remove/modify the Swiss entry (or renumber/migrate it) before June 1. While rapid changes are possible when driven by a proclamation, the very purpose of the 90‑day suspension is to preserve the listing during negotiations. Legal challenges are less likely to force immediate deletion while the measure is suspended. Given the short ~5‑week window and typical HTS update cadence, I see the probability of a pre‑June 1 removal or renumbering as modest. I’m not updating meaningfully based on the deliberation because no new evidence emerged; my prior 88% already reflects a small tail for an early bilateral deal, a broader policy reversal, or an administrative correction/renumbering before June 1.",
