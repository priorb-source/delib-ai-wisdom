    "review": "Forecaster 3's decomposition approach is particularly valuable, explicitly separating P(scheduled for June 12) from P(completes given scheduled). Their systematic analysis yields 38%, very close to my 40%. Forecaster 2's 65% seems insufficiently cautious given the absence of a DEF 14A filing this close to the proposed date - while they acknowledge this uncertainty, their probability appears to overweight the Bloomberg sources and historical pattern. Both forecasters correctly note that Computershare's June 2 date is likely erroneous given timing constraints, which is a useful insight. The key shared understanding is that the missing proxy filing is the critical uncertainty, with Forecaster 2 noting they'd jump to 95%+ upon its filing. Forecaster 3's point about Delaware law allowing minimum 10-day notice is helpful context - June 12 remains legally feasible even without a filing yet, but the tight window remains concerning for typical corporate practice.",
    "rationale": "After reviewing both analyses, I find my original reasoning largely validated, particularly by Forecaster 3's systematic decomposition. The core uncertainty remains unchanged: no DEF 14A has been filed as of May 27 for a meeting supposedly 16 days away. While June 12 fits the historical Thursday pattern and appears on Bloomberg, the absence of official confirmation is significant. Forecaster 3's breakdown (~45% scheduled × ~85% completes = ~38%) closely mirrors my intuitive assessment. Forecaster 2's higher 65% forecast doesn't adequately account for the missing filing risk in my view. The elimination of June 2 as viable (due to insufficient notice time) does slightly increase the conditional probability that any early June meeting would be on June 12, but this is offset by increased probability of a later date or delayed meeting altogether. The strict resolution criteria requiring full completion (not just commencement) adds meaningful tail risk given 2024's server crash precedent. I see no compelling reason to significantly adjust from my original 40% forecast.",
