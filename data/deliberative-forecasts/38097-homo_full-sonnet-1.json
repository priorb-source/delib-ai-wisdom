    "review": "All three forecasters converge on the same core evidence: Laurent Gbagbo appears already disqualified as of late May 2025 based on multiple sources. Forecaster 3 raises the most important new consideration I hadn't fully examined: uncertainty about whether Gbagbo's status constitutes a formal 'removal from the electoral list for 2025 specifically' versus an ongoing ineligibility from 2018. This is a meaningful distinction for the resolution criteria. However, I note that the sources discuss his disqualification specifically in the context of the 2025 election, stating he 'remains struck from the electoral list' while covering 2025 campaign developments. His party's planned June evaluation further suggests they recognize his current disqualified status for 2025. Forecaster 2's point about the short 32-day window limiting reversal possibilities is well-taken. The range of forecasts (85-92%) is relatively tight, suggesting we all see similar evidence but weight the timing/formalization uncertainties slightly differently.",
    "rationale": "The core evidence remains strong: multiple credible sources confirm Laurent Gbagbo is struck from the electoral list for the 2025 election due to his 2018 conviction and loss of civic rights. The question's language 'has been removed from the electoral list or otherwise become legally ineligible' in past perfect tense suggests it includes existing disqualified states before July 1, not just new disqualifications. The sources discuss Gbagbo's status in the 2025 election context, and his party acknowledges his current disqualified state while planning June actions. Forecaster 3's concern about formal timing adds legitimate uncertainty - there's a question of whether this represents a 2025-specific disqualification action versus continuous ineligibility from 2018. However, for resolution purposes, if Gbagbo is legally ineligible to run in 2025 and this status is documented before July 1, the criteria appear satisfied regardless of when the underlying disqualification originated. The 32-day window is short for major reversals. My forecast accounts for: (1) small possibility of reporting errors, (2) potential legal reversals or appeals, (3) ambiguity about formal timing of 2025 disqualification, but weighs heavily the clear evidence from multiple sources about Gbagbo's current ineligibility status.",
