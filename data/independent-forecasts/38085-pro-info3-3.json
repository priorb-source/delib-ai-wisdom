  "information": "The forecast period coincides with the start of Florida's typical rainy season on June 1, which is also the official start of the Atlantic hurricane season. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) has forecast a 60% chance of an above-average 2025 hurricane season, with 13-19 named tropical storms expected. This is attributed to factors like warmer ocean temperatures and low wind shear. However, a separate NOAA forecast from March 2025 also predicted that drought conditions in South Florida would likely persist from April through June.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Approximately one month.",
    "status_quo_outcome": "As of late April 2025, the number of residents in drought was reported to be 14 million. If conditions do not change, the outcome would be Yes.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "The onset of Florida's typical rainy season in June provides sufficient, widespread precipitation across populated areas, reducing the number of residents in drought to below 14.0 million by the resolution date.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "June rainfall is below average or localized, failing to provide significant relief to the most populated drought-stricken areas. The number of residents in drought remains at or above the 14.0 million threshold.",
    "rationale": "My forecast is primarily based on the conflict between the current status and strong seasonal weather patterns. The most critical data point is the status quo from late April 2025, which indicated 14 million residents were already under drought conditions, exactly at the resolution threshold. This provides a strong anchor for a 'Yes' outcome. However, the forecast period, from May 29 to June 28, directly coincides with the beginning of Florida's wet season, which climatologically is a powerful force for drought alleviation. My rationale leans towards this seasonal pattern being the decisive factor. The NOAA forecast for an active 2025 hurricane season, while not guaranteeing an early storm, slightly increases the probability of a significant rain event in June that could rapidly improve conditions. A NOAA forecast from March did predict drought persistence in South Florida, which provides a key counterpoint and prevents my probability from being lower. For a 'Yes' outcome, the rainy season would need to have a significantly delayed or weak start, which is possible but less likely than a normal onset. My forecast is not lower than 45% because the starting number is exactly at the threshold, meaning any worsening or even stagnation of conditions will result in a 'Yes'. The drought has inertia, and one month may not be enough to reverse it. My forecast is not higher because it would mean betting against the powerful and generally reliable onset of Florida's rainy season. I would increase my forecast towards 'Yes' if the first few weeks of June are demonstrably dry. I would decrease it if a tropical system forms with a track towards Florida or if widespread rains materialize early in the month.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill Florida have 14.0 million or more residents living in drought on June 28, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nUSA Today: [14 million Florida residents are under drought conditions, some extreme: What to know](https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2025/04/28/florida-drought-conditions-what-to-know/83328368007/)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if Drought Monitor at [this link](https://www.drought.gov/states/florida) lists greater than or equal to 14.0 million Florida residents in areas of drought, when the link is accessed by Metaculus on or after June 28, 2025. If the number is below that, this question resolves as **No**.\n\nThe question will resolve as soon as the page is accessed by Metaculus Admins on the resolution date. However, if there are issues accessing the page, then resolution will wait up until the end of the tournament's scoring at which point if Metaculus has still not been able to access the resolution source, this question will be **annulled**.\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nThe forecast period coincides with the start of Florida's typical rainy season on June 1, which is also the official start of the Atlantic hurricane season.

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
