  "information": "The current administration's Department of Defense leadership has explicitly stated a policy shift away from climate initiatives. Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth remarked that the DoD should focus on \"war-fighting\" and that climate programs are \"ripe for cuts.\" In other statements, Hegseth said, \"The Department of Defense is not concerned with climate nonsense; it's about preparing and conducting war.\" The administration has officially ceased to consider climate change a national security issue and revoked a January 2021 executive order on combating the climate crisis.\n\nSpecific actions have been taken to dismantle climate-related military programs. The U.S. Navy officially rescinded its 'Climate Action 2030' plan, a Biden-era initiative to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. Navy Secretary John Phelan announced the decision, emphasizing a renewed focus on \"lethality and our warfighters.\" Furthermore, the Department of Defense has removed $377 million in funding for climate change reduction programs. Other initiatives, such as the Air Force's 'Sustainable Aviation Fuel' program and the Army's plan for tactical vehicle electrification, have also been put in doubt or deemed impractical.\n\nThe Department of Defense's official climate resilience portal, climate.mil, has been offline since January 21, 2025. This takedown is part of a broader removal of climate-related content across various federal websites. Historical precedent from the 2017-2021 Trump administration shows that similar websites taken offline, such as pages on the Environmental Protection Agency's site, often remained down for several years. While some Democratic senators have reportedly demanded an explanation for the portal's removal and may hold hearings in June, no binding mandate or official plan to restore the website has been announced.",

    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "42 days from May 20, 2025 to July 1, 2025",
    "status_quo_outcome": "The climate.mil portal remains offline",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "The current administration continues its explicit policy of deprioritizing climate initiatives. Despite potential Democratic hearings in June, no binding mandate emerges to restore the portal. The DoD leadership maintains its focus on 'war-fighting' over climate concerns, and the site remains offline through July 1st and likely much longer, consistent with the pattern from the previous Trump administration where similar sites remained down for years.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Following Democratic hearings in June, unexpected political pressure, a court order, or congressional action forces the DoD to restore the portal. Alternatively, someone within the DoD decides to restore the technical resource for operational continuity reasons, even if stripped of some climate policy content. However, given the 42-day timeframe and bureaucratic processes, this would require rapid and unlikely developments.",
    "rationale": "The status quo strongly favors the site remaining offline. The portal has been down for nearly four months with zero indication of restoration plans. The current administration has not only taken it offline but has explicitly stated hostility toward climate programs through Secretary Hegseth's remarks calling climate initiatives 'nonsense' and emphasizing 'war-fighting' instead. The administration revoked Biden's climate executive order, rescinded the Navy's Climate Action 2030 plan, and removed $377 million in climate funding - all demonstrating systematic dismantling of climate programs. Historical precedent from 2017-2021 shows similar federal websites remained offline for years. The reported June hearings by Democratic senators lack binding authority and face significant political headwinds. Even if political will existed to restore the site, the 42-day timeframe is extremely short for bureaucratic action. I assign approximately 7% probability rather than near-zero because there remains some small possibility of unexpected developments: a court order, congressional action, technical/operational necessity overriding policy, or administrative miscommunication. However, the overwhelming weight of evidence - explicit policy statements, systematic program dismantling, lack of restoration mechanisms, short timeframe, and historical precedent - suggests the site will remain offline. For me to update significantly higher, I would need to see: concrete restoration plans announced, binding legal action initiated, or a policy reversal signal from DoD leadership. For me to update lower, I would need confirmation that restoration is explicitly prohibited or that the domain itself has been reassigned.",
