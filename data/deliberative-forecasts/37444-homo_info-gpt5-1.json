    "review": "Both peers emphasize inertia, political cost, and the limited practical upside of delisting a damaged, politically toxic asset, which aligns with my view. They add a few useful specifics I hadn’t cited: EU preparing additional sanctions; NS2 AG’s legal/financial constraints (bank account termination upheld in German court, Swiss bankruptcy moratorium). These further diminish the payoff to delisting. They also note investor/CEO proposals to restart with U.S. participation—useful to acknowledge that options exist, but not especially decision‑relevant without visible allied buy‑in. Overall, I find their reasoning directionally sound but their 15% feels high given fresh, on‑record denials by SecState Rubio and concurrent consideration of harsher measures (e.g., 500% tariffs), which both tilt the near‑term policy trajectory away from delisting.",
    "rationale": "~56 days remain. Baseline is that NS2 AG stays on the SDN list; OFAC delistings of high‑profile Russia energy entities are rare and typically tied to substantial policy shifts. Since the Politico story, the most salient public signals run counter to delisting: SecState Rubio’s explicit denial that the administration is considering lifting sanctions on NS2, Interior Sec. Burgum’s opposition, and reporting that the White House is weighing expanded measures (tariffs and broader sanctions). Those cues, plus Congress’s hawkish posture and the EU’s continued sanctions track, make a reversal before July 1 unlikely. The pipeline’s impaired state and Germany/EU disinterest reduce the incentive to pay the political costs of delisting. While the Politico report indicates the idea was at least discussed, and the executive could act quickly if a Ukraine deal required it, there is no credible sign of an imminent framework that trades sanctions relief for progress. Net of the peers’ added points, my balance of evidence still favors a low tail probability rather than the mid-teens. I therefore keep my forecast unchanged.",
