    "review": "The other forecasters presented two critical pieces of evidence I had not considered, both of which substantially weaken the case for a 'Yes' outcome. Forecaster 2's point about Republican lawmakers actively removing a proof-of-citizenship requirement from a transportation bill in February 2025 is the most compelling argument. This 'revealed preference' is a strong signal that the immediate legislative appetite for this policy is much lower than I initially assumed. Forecaster 3's mention of Governor DeWine's reported hesitation introduces another significant procedural hurdle and suggests a lack of unity within the state's Republican leadership. Both arguments persuasively counter my initial assessment that a unified Republican supermajority would make this a high-priority item.",
    "rationale": "I am significantly updating my forecast downwards from 40% to 15%. My initial analysis was based on a tension between strong political will and a very short timeline. The new information provided by my fellow forecasters has convinced me that I fundamentally overestimated the strength and unity of the political will. The legislature's decision in February 2025 to forgo an opportunity to enact this very policy is a powerful data point indicating it is not a top priority. Combined with Governor DeWine's potential opposition, which adds friction and time to a process that has no time to spare, the path to enactment looks far more difficult. The primary obstacle is no longer just the clock, but a demonstrated lack of immediate momentum and consensus within the majority party. A 'Yes' resolution would now require a sudden and surprising reversal of the legislature's recently revealed preference, making it a low-probability outcome.",
