    "review": "Both forecasters reinforced key mechanics I agree with: (1) the short window makes a formal 8‑K termination less likely absent a clear catalyst; (2) CFIUS/presidential prohibition is the central risk, with antitrust relatively minor; (3) incentives and break fees typically push parties to extend rather than abandon if approval still seems achievable. New points they added that sharpen my view: the rarity of presidential prohibitions against acquirers from close allies like Japan; and the emphasis on a near-term outside date as the main non-regulatory catalyst. They also flagged deal-spread signaling as a useful leading indicator. I find their reasoning convincing and consistent with M&A process priors for this time horizon.",
    "rationale": "Given ~6 weeks left and no fresh public indication of an imminent presidential block or a firm outside date before July 1 that won’t be extended, inertia dominates. A “Yes” requires a formal 8‑K termination by July 1, which is a high bar: most adverse developments would still lead to continued negotiations, mitigation, or extensions rather than immediate abandonment. While the political sensitivity and union opposition keep tail risk nontrivial, the ally status of Japan and typical CFIUS mitigation paths reduce the odds of a swift prohibition. Incorporating the others’ emphasis on the rarity of presidential blocks and the likelihood of extension at any late‑June drop-dead date, I trim slightly from my prior. I would move up on credible reports of a CFIUS recommendation to block or clear evidence of a June outside date without extension; I would move down on signs of mitigation progress or an explicit extension past July.",
