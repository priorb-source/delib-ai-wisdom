    "review": "Forecaster 2 presents the most critical piece of information: actual data from May 8, 2025 showing Sánchez at 35% and Erdoğan at 32%. This three-point lead with only 32 days remaining fundamentally changes the analysis from 'can Sánchez catch up?' to 'will Sánchez maintain his lead?' Forecaster 2's reasoning about status quo bias over short timeframes is sound, and their 72% forecast appropriately weights the recency and relevance of this data. Forecaster 3 appears to be reasoning from historical patterns without access to current data, leading to their lower 35% forecast. While Forecaster 3 correctly emphasizes the short timeframe favoring status quo, they miss that the current status quo is Sánchez leading, not trailing. Their claim that 'Erdoğan typically maintains higher approval' may be historically accurate but is less relevant than the actual May 8 data point. The tension between Forecasters 2 and 3 is entirely explained by information asymmetry - Forecaster 2 has current data while Forecaster 3 is extrapolating from history.",
    "rationale": "I was initially operating without knowledge of the current approval ratings, leading to my 42% forecast that assumed we were starting from a near-tie. Forecaster 2's May 8, 2025 data showing Sánchez leading 35% to 32% is decisive new information that should substantially increase my confidence. With only 32 days until resolution, approval ratings typically exhibit strong inertia absent major events. A 3-point lead isn't insurmountable, but it's meaningful - roughly 9% ahead in relative terms. Factors supporting stability: Spain's economic recovery mentioned in the research, the very short timeframe, and lack of evidence suggesting imminent major shifts. However, I'm slightly more cautious than Forecaster 2's 72% because: (1) the 3-point margin is modest enough that normal monthly variation could eliminate it, (2) Turkey's improving consumer confidence could translate to approval gains, and (3) Morning Consult's weekly rolling averages can fluctuate. The constitutional reform initiative for Erdoğan is a wildcard - it could either boost his standing among supporters or fuel opposition concerns. Nevertheless, the recent data point is far more predictive than historical patterns, and status quo bias strongly favors Sánchez maintaining his lead over just one month.",
