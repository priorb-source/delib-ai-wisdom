    "review": "The deliberation reveals a strong consensus among all three forecasters. We have independently arrived at the same 1% probability for the same core reason: the extremely short timeframe of approximately two weeks makes a presidential visit to China logistically and diplomatically infeasible. Forecaster 2 and 3 echoed my assessment that such a visit requires months of planning, and the only path to a 'Yes' outcome is a highly improbable 'black swan' event, like a sudden global crisis. One forecaster raised the point of Mr. Trump being a 'private citizen,' which I find unconvincing as it contradicts the question's premise of 'President Donald Trump.' Overall, their analyses did not introduce any new evidence or compelling arguments that I hadn't already considered; rather, they reinforced the overwhelming strength of the base case for a 'No' resolution.",
    "rationale": "After reviewing the analyses of my fellow forecasters, my reasoning remains unchanged. The consensus among the group strengthens my conviction in the initial forecast. The dominant and decisive factor is the extremely short timeline, with only 16 days remaining until the July 1, 2025 deadline. A state visit by a US President to China is a monumental undertaking involving complex security, logistical, and diplomatic preparations that are planned many months in advance. There is currently no public information, official announcement, or even media speculation to suggest such a visit is being contemplated, let alone arranged. The status quo of no planned visit is a very powerful indicator. For these reasons, I am maintaining my forecast. The 1% probability is not zero, as it accounts for the remote possibility of an unprecedented global emergency that would necessitate a hastily arranged summit, a scenario that is theoretically possible but practically unimaginable on this timeline.",
