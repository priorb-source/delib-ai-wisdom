    "review": "The other two forecasters provide analyses that are highly aligned with my own. We all identified the same critical factors: the unresolved national security demand for data interception, the missed April 2025 launch deadline due to a delayed regulatory 'dashboard', and the extremely short timeframe of ~6 weeks remaining until the resolution date. Their reasoning is sound and built on the same evidence base. The main difference between us is the final probability, reflecting slight variations in weighting the possibility of a last-minute political resolution against the strong evidence of bureaucratic and security-related delays.",
    "rationale": "After reviewing the other forecasts, I am updating my probability slightly upward from 25% to 30%. My initial analysis was heavily weighted by the report that security talks were at a 'preliminary stage' as of late March 2025 and the concrete evidence of a missed April deadline. These facts continue to be the strongest arguments for a 'No' outcome, as resolving such fundamental issues in under two months is highly improbable.\n\nHowever, both Forecaster 2 (35%) and Forecaster 3 (30%) place significant weight on the consistent political will from the Sri Lankan government, as evidenced by the initial license and the approval of tariff plans. I find this perspective persuasive enough to temper my pessimism slightly. While I believe the practical hurdles are more significant than Forecaster 2 does, the deliberation has convinced me that I may have understated the possibility of a swift, high-level political intervention that cuts through the existing delays. Therefore, I am increasing my forecast to 30% to better reflect this non-trivial chance of a sudden breakthrough, bringing my forecast into alignment with Forecaster 3. The core of my belief remains that 'No' is the most likely outcome due to the tight deadline and the complexity of the unresolved issues.",
