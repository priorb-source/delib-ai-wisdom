    "review": "All three of us have converged on remarkably similar forecasts (94-96%), which is reassuring as it suggests we're working with the same evidence and reaching consistent conclusions through independent analysis. Forecaster 3 makes an excellent point about proportional representation systems that I hadn't explicitly stated: in Austria's PR system, vote share translates directly to seat allocation, meaning the SPÖ's 16-19 point polling lead should straightforwardly convert to a seat plurality. This is a valuable clarification that strengthens the case. Forecaster 2's framing of what would be required for an SPÖ loss - catastrophic polling error of 'historic proportions' or unprecedented voter swing - effectively captures the low probability of a No outcome. Neither forecaster raised any contradictory evidence or scenarios I hadn't considered. The tight clustering of our forecasts (94-96%) after independent analysis suggests this range is well-calibrated rather than any of us being significantly off.",
    "rationale": "Upon reflection, I find the convergence of three independent forecasters at 94-96% to be evidence that this range appropriately captures the probability. Forecaster 3's explicit mention of how PR systems work reinforces my existing reasoning - a 16-19 point vote lead in a proportional system virtually guarantees a seat plurality. However, this doesn't constitute materially new empirical evidence that would justify changing my forecast. My original 95% assessment already accounted for: the overwhelming polling lead, minimal time for change, historical precedent, structural advantages, and the near-impossibility of polling errors large enough to matter. The 5% uncertainty I reserved for unforeseen events, systematic polling failures, or black swans remains appropriate. The consensus among forecasters actually validates rather than challenges my original reasoning. There's no compelling argument from the other forecasters that would push me materially higher or lower within the narrow 94-96% range we've all identified.",
