    "review": "Both forecasters reinforce the inertia/process-friction story and add two helpful nuances I hadn’t explicitly weighed: (1) agencies often time major changes to the fiscal year boundary (Oct 1), which makes a July 1 takedown less likely; and (2) the resolution’s “on or after July 1” wording reduces the risk that a brief outage at a single instant produces a No. Forecaster 2’s cost/benefit point (takedown yields little savings but creates confusion) and the breadth of Energy Star integrations (Portfolio Manager, municipal benchmarking) argue for at least a transitional web presence. Forecaster 3’s DOE co-stewardship comment is another continuity signal. I already accounted for bureaucratic timelines, precedent (2017 content removals vs domain removal), and single-monitor risks, but the FY alignment and “on or after” check slightly strengthen the case for Yes.",
    "rationale": "- Status quo: energystar.gov is up as of May 7, and there are only ~7 weeks until July 1. Government domain retirements usually require coordination with GSA/CISA, FOIA/NARA-compliant archiving, and stakeholder communications—typically months, not weeks.\n- Precedent/optics: 2017 EPA climate content changes favored redirects/static pages over domain removal. Given Energy Star’s ubiquity (labels, Portfolio Manager, municipal rules), a soft-landing page or redirect is far likelier than pulling DNS. That would still register as “up.”\n- Measurement details: IsItDownRightNow treats any reachable response (including 3xx redirects/placeholders) as up. The resolution allows checking “on or after July 1,” reducing the chance a momentary outage drives a No.\n- Additional considerations: Aligning major changes with the FY (Oct 1) is common, making a July 1 hard cutoff less probable. Operating cost savings from an immediate shutdown are minimal relative to the political/operational risk of confusion.\n- Residual risks: A symbolic, accelerated takedown remains possible; DNS/TLS misconfigurations or hosting transitions could cause downtime when checked. Single-monitor dependence adds noise, but the flexible check window mitigates this.\nNet: The new arguments (FY timing, flexible resolution timing) push me slightly higher. I keep a modest buffer for political acceleration or technical mishaps.\n",
