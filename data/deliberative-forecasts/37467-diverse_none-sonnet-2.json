    "review": "All three forecasters converged on 10-15%, emphasizing the short timeframe and lack of bankruptcy precursor signals. Forecaster 3 raised a particularly compelling point I hadn't explicitly considered: Beyond Meat's convertible notes mature in 2027, meaning there's no near-term debt maturity wall forcing immediate action. This is crucial evidence that reduces bankruptcy pressure in the next 54 days. Both forecasters also emphasized that public companies with genuine near-term filing risk typically show unmistakable signals - restructuring advisors, forbearance agreements, covenant breaches, missed payments, or going-concern warnings - none of which are currently visible. The base-rate argument for bankruptcy in any specific two-month period was also well-articulated. However, all three appropriately acknowledged the real financial distress: $38M quarterly operating losses represent serious cash burn that maintains meaningful tail risk.",
    "rationale": "Upon reflection, the 2027 debt maturity information is genuinely important and should increase my confidence that bankruptcy won't occur in the next 54 days. Companies typically file for bankruptcy when facing imminent debt maturities they cannot refinance, covenant violations, or acute liquidity crises. The lack of any visible precursor signals (no restructuring advisors announced, no forbearance agreements, no going-concern warnings in recent filings) combined with no near-term maturity wall suggests the immediate risk is lower than my initial 10% estimate. However, the significant operating losses and cash burn remain concerning - a sudden vendor tightening, unexpected covenant issue, or worse-than-expected Q1 2025 results could still trigger a rapid filing. The probability remains non-trivial but the evidence points toward slightly lower odds than my initial assessment. I'm updating from 10% to 12%, aligning with Forecaster 3's analysis which I found most compelling on the debt maturity point.",
