    "status_quo_outcome": "Yes - Tesla products are currently excluded from BC Hydro's EV charger rebate program as of March 12, 2025",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "BC Hydro reverses its policy decision before July 1, 2025, and reinstates Tesla's eligibility for the EV charger rebate program. This could occur due to public backlash, legal challenges, changes in US-Canada trade relations, political pressure, or concerns that excluding a major EV manufacturer undermines broader electrification goals.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "The current exclusion policy remains in place through July 1, 2025. BC Hydro maintains its stated position of preferencing Canadian goods and excluding US-produced goods where practicable. No policy reversal occurs in the remaining month.",
    "rationale": "The status quo strongly favors a Yes outcome. Tesla products were explicitly excluded from BC Hydro rebate programs as of March 12, 2025 - less than three months ago. The stated rationale was to preference Canadian goods and exclude US-produced goods, suggesting this was a deliberate policy decision aligned with broader government priorities rather than an arbitrary choice. Government policy changes typically require significant time, and reversing a recently implemented policy within just a few months would be unusual. With only one month remaining until the resolution date, there is an extremely short window for any policy reversal to occur. My research assistant provided no information suggesting that a policy reversal is being discussed or considered. The lack of any contrary evidence combined with the recency of the policy implementation strongly suggests the exclusion will remain in place. I'm not assigning a probability closer to 100% because: (1) political situations can shift rapidly, especially regarding trade policy; (2) we lack complete information about internal BC Hydro discussions or potential political pressure; (3) a month is enough time for unexpected developments; (4) public backlash or legal challenges could theoretically force change. I'm not going lower because: (1) the default outcome strongly favors Yes; (2) the extremely short timeframe makes reversal unlikely; (3) there's zero evidence of reversal discussions; (4) the policy aligns with stated government priorities around Canadian preference. To update upward, I would need evidence that the policy is firmly entrenched with no reversal discussion. To update downward, I would need evidence of active consideration of policy reversal, legal challenges, significant public pressure, or changes in US-Canada relations affecting this specific program.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill BC Hydro still exclude Tesla from its EV charger rebate program for single-family homes in July 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nAccording to the resolution source, \"The Government of B.C. and BC Hydro are taking action to preference Canadian goods in our rebate programs going forward and to exclude, where practicable, U.S. produced goods. As of March 12, 2025, Tesla products (electric vehicle chargers, energy storage batteries and inverters) are not eligible for CleanBC and BC Hydro rebates. If you purchased or have received pre-approval for your Tesla product before March 12, 2025, it can still qualify for rebates and will be processed as normal.\"\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if BC Hydro at [this page](https://www.bchydro.com/powersmart/electric-vehicles/rebates-incentives/rebates-home-chargers.html) when checked by Metaculus on or after July 1, 2025, says that Tesla products are not eligible for the EV charger at home program. If it does not mention Tesla being ineligible, then this question resolves as **No**.\n\n\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nNo additional information available.\n\nToday is 2025-05-30.\n\nBefore answering you think:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n(e) You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
