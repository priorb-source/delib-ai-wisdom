    "review": "Forecaster 3 raises several critical points I had underweighted. Most importantly, Buffett's comments at Berkshire's May meeting about being net sellers in Q1 and lacking attractive opportunities is strong contemporaneous evidence against adding to positions during that period. This is exactly the kind of signal I said I'd need to revise downward. Additionally, the confidential treatment argument is sophisticated - if Berkshire were building a material position, they could request confidential treatment to avoid front-running, which would mean the increase wouldn't appear in the public 13F and would resolve as 'No' despite actual buying. This creates a structural bias toward 'No' outcomes even under bullish scenarios. Forecaster 3 also notes that Q1 2025 markets were elevated and DPZ was strong, reducing value-buying opportunities. Forecaster 2's emphasis on portfolio inertia aligns with my thinking, though offers less new information. Both forecasters converge around 30-35%, which validates the general reasoning but the specific Q1 2025 context from Forecaster 3 is compelling evidence I should weight more heavily.",
    "rationale": "Upon reflection, I underweighted the specific Q1 2025 market context. Buffett's explicit statement about being net sellers and finding few opportunities in Q1 is direct evidence against equity additions during that period. Combined with elevated valuations and the confidential treatment consideration, the case for 'No' strengthens. The confidential treatment point is particularly important - if Berkshire were aggressively building the position, requesting confidential treatment would be rational, which would mean no reported increase even if they bought. My original 35% was based on generic base rates of position building, but didn't adequately account for the specific Q1 2025 environment. The threshold at 2,382,000 shares is low enough that even a small add would trigger 'Yes', which prevents me from going much lower, but the Q1 selling environment and confidential treatment dynamics warrant a modest downward revision.",
