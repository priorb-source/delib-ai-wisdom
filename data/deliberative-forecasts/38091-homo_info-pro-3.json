    "review": "The other two forecasters presented compelling arguments that caused me to significantly revise my initial forecast. I had based my low 30% probability on the lack of a specific, publicly announced candidate country for a June signing. Forecaster 2 introduced a critical piece of evidence I had missed: a May 22, 2025 statement by acting NASA Administrator Janet Petro anticipating new signatories in the 'coming weeks and months.' This is a very strong positive signal from a primary source, directly countering my main reason for being pessimistic. The phrase 'coming weeks' makes a signing in June highly plausible. Forecaster 3's argument that the recent rate of one signatory per month has become the 'new status quo' was also persuasive, suggesting I had underestimated the program's current momentum. Both forecasters convincingly argued that the strong recent trend and forward-looking statements outweigh the lack of a named candidate.",
    "rationale": "I am significantly increasing my forecast from 30% to 65%. My initial analysis was flawed because it over-weighted the absence of a specific named country and was missing the key statement from the NASA Administrator. The statement that new signatories are expected in the 'coming weeks' is a powerful piece of evidence suggesting that at least one signing is in the final stages of arrangement. This aligns perfectly with the June 2025 timeframe. Combined with the recent momentum of signings in April and May, the evidence now points towards 'Yes' as the more likely outcome. I am updating to 65%, aligning with the other forecasters. I am not forecasting higher because, as they correctly point out, diplomatic events are subject to last-minute scheduling changes. A signing planned for late June could easily slip into early July for logistical reasons, which would cause this specific question to resolve as 'No'. The 65% probability reflects a strong expectation of a June signing while acknowledging the significant uncertainty inherent in precise diplomatic timing.",
