    "review": "All three forecasters converge on the same fundamental analysis: the 46-day timeframe is extremely constraining, IPO preparation typically requires months, Anthropic has strong private funding alternatives, and there are zero current signals of preparation. The key disagreement is in probability weighting. Forecaster 2's 2% is highly conservative but well-reasoned. Forecaster 3's 10% raises valid points about the lower bar (announcement vs. completed filing) and AI capital needs, but I find these arguments insufficiently compelling to justify 2.5x higher probability. The 'hot AI theme' and 'reopened IPO window' are real but don't overcome the practical barriers. Forecaster 3's point about 'positioning' for a later IPO is interesting - a company could announce intent now for execution in Q4 2025 - but companies rarely pre-announce IPO plans months in advance due to the strategic downsides (market scrutiny, employee uncertainty, reduced flexibility). The resolution criteria do specify only an announcement is needed, which is a lower bar than I initially weighted, but empirically companies don't announce far ahead of execution.",
    "rationale": "Upon reflection, I acknowledge that the resolution requires only an announcement of *planning* an IPO, not a filed S-1 or imminent execution. This is indeed a lower bar than full IPO preparation. A company could theoretically post 'We plan to pursue an IPO in late 2025' on their News page. However, this practice is extremely rare in the tech industry because it creates strategic problems: invites regulatory scrutiny, creates employee compensation uncertainty, reduces flexibility if market conditions change, and locks the company into a timeline. Companies typically announce IPO plans only when they're ready to execute within weeks or a few months. Given the 46-day window, lack of any preparation signals, Anthropic's recent $40B private valuation success, and the rarity of far-advance IPO announcements, I'm marginally updating upward from 4% to 5% to account for the lower announcement bar, while maintaining that this outcome remains highly unlikely. The consensus range of 2-10% seems appropriate, and I'm comfortable in the middle-lower portion of that range.",
