    "review": "The other two forecasters provide analyses that are substantively identical to my own. We all agree on the key factors driving this forecast: the extremely short one-month deadline, the complete lack of any logistical or financial groundwork for a Senate campaign, Rep. Norman's reported focus on the 2026 governor's race, his office's explicit denials of a Senate run, and the strength of the incumbent, Sen. Graham, who has already secured key endorsements. There is a strong consensus on the evidence and reasoning. The only point of divergence is the final probability assigned to the very small chance of a surprise announcement. Their reasoning for a 5% forecast rests on a general allowance for 'unforeseen events' and 'rapidly changing political circumstances,' which is a valid consideration. However, they do not offer a specific scenario or argument that I had not already considered in my initial assessment.",
    "rationale": "After reviewing my peers' analyses, I am maintaining my forecast of 2%. The deliberation process has reinforced my confidence in the overwhelming body of evidence that points to a 'No' outcome. My reasoning and that of the other forecasters are in complete alignment regarding the facts. The discrepancy between my 2% and their 5% is a matter of judgment in quantifying a low-probability tail-risk event. I believe 2% (a 1-in-50 chance) more accurately captures the extreme improbability of Norman launching a Senate campaign in the next 30 days. For a 'Yes' outcome to occur, we would need to see a truly disruptive, unforeseen event—like a sudden scandal forcing Graham out or a complete reversal on endorsements from key figures like Donald Trump—materialize and trigger a Norman announcement almost instantly. Given the complete absence of any preparatory steps, which are prerequisites for even a surprise campaign launch, a 5% probability (a 1-in-20 chance) feels too high. Their arguments did not introduce new information to persuade me that the risk is that substantial. Therefore, I stand by my initial assessment.",
