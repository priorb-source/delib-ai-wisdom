    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "The question resolves by June 1, 2025. Today is May 9, 2025, leaving a resolution window of 22 days (May 10 to May 31, 2025). The outcome will be known in less than one month.",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No. The current political environment, which heavily features tariffs as a central policy tool of the US President, suggests that the term 'tariff(s)' will frequently appear on the front pages of major newspapers, making its complete absence from both on any given day unlikely.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "A 'No' outcome occurs if on every single day from May 10 to May 31, 2025, the word 'tariff' or 'tariffs' appears on the front page of at least one of the two newspapers. This would happen if tariff policy remains a dominant and consistent daily news story, for instance due to an ongoing trade dispute, new policy announcements, or continuous political debate.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "A 'Yes' outcome occurs if on at least one day between May 10 and May 31, 2025, the word 'tariff' or 'tariffs' is absent from the front page of both The New York Times and the Wall Street Journal. This could happen on a day where the news cycle is completely dominated by other major, unrelated events, such as a natural disaster, a significant international conflict escalation, or a major domestic political development.",
    "rationale": "My forecast is based on an analysis of the high news salience of tariffs and the high bar set by the resolution criteria. The question resolves 'Yes' if there is just a single day in a 22-day period where both the NYT and WSJ front pages are free of the word 'tariff(s)'.\n\nThe primary factor suggesting a high probability of continued front-page presence (a 'No' outcome) is the context provided: 'US President Donald Trump's renewed love for this somewhat antiquated form of taxation'. A president who actively uses and discusses tariffs as a primary economic tool ensures the topic remains a high-priority item for top-tier news organizations like the NYT (for political implications) and the WSJ (for economic impact).\n\nHowever, even a dominant news story does not make the front page every single day. The 24/7 news cycle is volatile and can be completely captured by unforeseen events. The 22-day window provides multiple opportunities for such an event to occur, pushing tariff-related news off the front page of both papers, even if just for one day. Weekends, in particular, often have different front-page compositions and could provide such an opportunity.\n\nThe requirement for *both* papers to be clear on the *same day* significantly lowers the probability of a 'Yes' outcome compared to either paper individually. Let's estimate the daily probability that at least one paper mentions tariffs as 95%, reflecting the topic's high salience. This implies a 5% daily chance that both are clear. Over a 22-day period, the probability of at least one successful day is 1 - (0.95^22), which is approximately 1 - 0.32, or 68%.\n\nMy forecast is not higher because the strong political focus on tariffs makes their daily presence on at least one of the two front pages very likely. The status quo is that this is a major, ongoing story.\nMy forecast is not lower because the resolution criteria only require a single day's success over a 22-day period. The probability of the news cycle being completely dominated by another story for at least one of those 22 days is substantial.\n\nA forecast update towards 'Yes' (higher probability) would be triggered by the emergence of a massive, non-economic news story (e.g., a major international crisis or natural disaster) early in the resolution window. An update towards 'No' (lower probability) would be triggered by a significant new tariff announcement or the escalation of a trade war, making the topic even more dominant.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill the word \"tariff(s)\" disappear from the front print pages of The New York Times and Wall Street Journal by June 1, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nWhether reading the newspaper or social media or watching the news, it is highly likely you are going to see something about tariffs - mainly due to US President Donald Trump's renewed love for this somewhat antiquated form of taxation.\n\nThe New York Times and the Wall Street Journal are two of the largest print newspapers in the US. When, if ever, will we seen tariffs wiped from the front pages of both papers?\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question will resolve to \"Yes\" if, after \\[OPEN DATE] and before June 1, 2025, the words, \"tariff\" or \"tariffs\", do not appear on the print front page of The New York Times and the Wall Street Journal. The following URLs will be used to resolve the question:\n\n* The New York Times: [https://www.nytimes.com/section/todayspaper](https://www.nytimes.com/section/todayspaper)\n* Wall Street Journal:\t [https://www.wsj.com/print-edition/20250414/frontpage](https://www.wsj.com/print-edition/20250414/frontpage)\n\n***\n\n<sup>Note: WSJ front page URL for April 14, 2025. Format is: yyyy-mm-dd.</sup>\n\nGrammar is not relevant (e.g. \"TARIFF\" will suffice to prevent a \"No\" resolution).\n\n\"Tariff(s)\" must be omitted from both papers' front pages on the same day.\n\n\"Tariff(s)\" can appear anywhere on the page, it does not have to be in a title.\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nNo additional information available.\n\nToday is 2025-05-09.\n\nBefore answering you think:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n(e) You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
