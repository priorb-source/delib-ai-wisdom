    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "About 3–5 weeks (Trading Economics posts INEGI’s April 2025 unemployment in late May).",
    "status_quo_outcome": "Slightly under 3% (recent readings have hovered in the high‑2s to around 3%).",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "US tariff-related disruptions hit Mexican auto and supplier employment hard enough in April to nudge the measured rate to 3.0% or above; or routine month-to-month volatility places the print at exactly 3.0%, which would resolve No.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Tight labor demand continues, informality absorbs shocks, and seasonal hiring (tourism/holidays) keeps the unemployment rate below 3.0% for April.",
    "rationale": "Mexico’s unemployment rate has been structurally low, typically in the high‑2% range to about 3%, supported by strong labor demand from nearshoring and high informality that dampens measured unemployment during slowdowns. Given this status quo, the base case is that April remains below 3.0%. Countervailing risks exist: US tariff ripple effects could slow auto manufacturing and related sectors; monthly ENOE data are somewhat noisy; and the question’s strict threshold means a 3.0% print resolves as No. On balance, I put extra weight on continuity—labor markets change gradually, and shocks often show up first as shifts between formal/informal work rather than outright unemployment. The research assistant provided no new data, so I rely on recent history and structural features of Mexico’s labor market. Not higher: tariff uncertainty, sectoral softness (autos), and the risk of an exact 3.0% reading argue against a very high probability. Not lower: persistent tightness, informality, and typical spring seasonality support odds above 50%. I would update upward if mid‑May indicators (e.g., IMSS formal jobs, sector surveys, tourism flows) remain strong and no significant layoff announcements materialize; I would update downward if credible reports show April auto/maquiladora layoffs, a dip in manufacturing employment, or guidance suggesting an uptick in the ENOE unemployment rate.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill Mexico's unemployment rate be under 3% in April 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nAP: [US tariffs ripple through auto supply chains into Mexico](https://apnews.com/article/mexico-stellantis-trump-tariffs-sheinbaum-569ae29d203b1997d50a3a9655c928a8)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if Mexico's unemployment rate is less than 3.0% for April 2025 according to data presented by [Trading Economics](https://tradingeconomics.com/mexico/unemployment-rate).\n\n\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nNo additional information available.\n\nToday is 2025-04-29.\n\nBefore answering you think:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n(e) You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
