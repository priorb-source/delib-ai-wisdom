    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Approximately 46 days until July 1, 2025",
    "status_quo_outcome": "Fewer than 120 objectives marked as Done, as implementing policy objectives typically requires substantial time even for an aggressive administration",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "The administration faces legal challenges, congressional opposition, or administrative capacity constraints that slow implementation. Many Project 2025 objectives require complex regulatory processes or legislation rather than simple executive actions. By July 1, only 60-100 objectives have been completed, falling short of the 120 threshold.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "The administration moves extremely aggressively on executive actions, particularly policy reversals that can be implemented quickly. Many objectives turn out to be relatively straightforward administrative changes. If the tracker includes 400+ total objectives, achieving 120 (30%) by the 5-month mark becomes plausible with concentrated effort and prioritization of quick wins.",
    "rationale": "With only about 46 days remaining and approximately 5 months having passed since the presumed January 2025 administration start, achieving 120 'Done' objectives represents a very aggressive implementation pace of roughly 24 objectives per month. The status quo strongly suggests this is difficult because: (1) Government policy implementation inherently takes time due to legal requirements, administrative procedures, and coordination across agencies; (2) Many Project 2025 objectives likely involve complex regulatory changes requiring notice-and-comment periods, not just executive orders; (3) Legal challenges can create immediate injunctions; (4) Some objectives require congressional action. However, several factors prevent me from going lower: If many objectives are simple policy reversals or executive actions, rapid implementation is possible; Without knowing the current count or total number of objectives, 120 might represent a reasonable fraction if there are 500+ total objectives; An administration explicitly committed to Project 2025 might prioritize speed. My forecast would increase substantially if I learned: the current count is already above 100, the total objective count is very high (making 120 a smaller percentage), or that many remaining objectives are administrative rather than legislative. I would decrease my forecast if: the current count is low (under 50), many objectives require legislation, or legal challenges are blocking progress. The short remaining timeframe makes large movements difficult, somewhat anchoring the outcome.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill the Project 2025 Tracker classify at least 120 objectives as \"Done\" on July 1, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nThe 2025 Tracker is a project of the Keep_Track subreddit and is explained [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/Keep_Track/comments/1ii7tbr/project_2025_tracker_is_now_live/).\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if the [Project 2025 Tracker](https://www.project2025.observer/) has ≥120 Objectives classified as Done when accessed by Metaculus on or after July 1, 2025. If it is less than 120, this resolves as **No**.\n\n\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nNo additional information available.\n\nToday is 2025-05-16.\n\nBefore answering you think:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n(e) You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
