    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "About 61 days (until 2025-07-01)",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No — the 8-year pattern of no nuclear tests since 2017 persists through June 2025.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Pyongyang continues ballistic missile launches and hostile rhetoric but refrains from a nuclear detonation to avoid crossing China’s red lines; satellite imagery shows no decisive test preparations at Punggye-ri; the window closes without a test.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "North Korea conducts an underground detonation at Punggye-ri before July 1, potentially timed to a symbolic date (e.g., June 25) or as coercive signaling during/after allied drills; the CTBTO IMS detects a seismic event and DPRK claims a successful test.",
    "rationale": "Time horizon is short, and the status quo (no tests since 2017) is strong. Historically, North Korea has shown readiness to provoke with missiles and rhetoric while holding nuclear tests in reserve due to higher diplomatic costs, especially with China. Multiple “imminent test” warnings in 2022–2023 never materialized, suggesting a low baseline hazard absent clear preparatory indicators. With only two months left, the chance of a coordinated political/technical push culminating in a test is limited unless we see telltale activity at Punggye-ri (e.g., tunneling completion, cabling, vehicles, spoil piles, water pumping) or credible allied intelligence/leaks about an imminent test. Reasons for a higher probability include heightened regional tensions, North Korea’s declared nuclear posture, possible desire to validate warhead designs, and the potential for perceived geopolitical cover via closer ties with Russia. Reasons for a lower probability include the longstanding post-2017 restraint, likely Chinese disapproval of a seventh test, and the regime’s ability to achieve signaling goals via missile/satellite activity without incurring the added costs of a nuclear detonation. I put extra weight on the status quo given how slowly these thresholds tend to change. What would move me up: high-confidence reporting of fresh, sustained test-site preparations (especially at Tunnel 3/4), explicit US/ROK intel warnings of an imminent test, DPRK propaganda cues signaling a ‘decisive’ nuclear milestone, or unusual Chinese/Russian diplomatic/military posturing consistent with bracing for a test. What would move me down: explicit DPRK reiteration of restraint/moratorium, visible inactivity or degradation at Punggye-ri through mid-June, or signs of diplomatic engagement that would make a test counterproductive. The research assistant provided no additional information, so this estimate leans on base rates, recent years’ patterns, and the short remaining window.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill North Korea test a nuclear weapon before July 1, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nAccording to Wikipedia, \"North Korea has conducted six nuclear tests, in 2006, 2009, 2013, twice in 2016, and in 2017.\"\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if before July 1, 2025, North Korea tests a nuclear weapon, according to [credible source](https://www.metaculus.com/help/faq/#definitions) reporting such as the [International Monitoring System’s ](https://www.ctbto.org/our-work/detecting-nuclear-tests) and the sources cited at Wikipedia's [List of nuclear weapons tests of North Korea](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_nuclear_weapons_tests_of_North_Korea).\n\n\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nNo additional information available.\n\nToday is 2025-05-01.\n\nBefore answering you think:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n(e) You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
