  "information": "Multiple polls conducted in late April 2025 indicated a consistent lead for the Liberal Party in national popular vote intentions. A poll by UrduPoint (April 21) showed Liberals at 43.3% and Conservatives at 38.4%. The Globe and Mail (April 21) reported Liberals at 43% and Conservatives at 37%. An Infobae/Nanos poll (April 20) placed Liberals at 44.7% and Conservatives at 37.3%. A Liaison Strategies poll (April 17-19) found Liberals at 43% and Conservatives at 38%. The reported gap in these polls ranged from 4.9 to 7.4 percentage points.\n\nPolling data from key regions indicates specific strengths for each party. In Quebec, the Liberal Party holds a lead with 40% support, compared to 25% for the Conservatives. The Liberals also maintain a lead in Ontario. In contrast, the Conservatives lead in the western provinces of Alberta and Saskatchewan. In British Columbia, the race is reported to be tied, with both parties at 42% support.\n\nAnalysis of voter demographics and commitment levels reveals differing patterns. Among declared voters, 76% of Conservative supporters describe themselves as \"very committed\" to their choice, compared to 63% for Liberal supporters. The Conservative Party holds a narrow lead among voters under the age of 35, with 39% support versus 38% for the Liberals. Advanced voting has seen high participation, with over 2 million ballots cast on the first day. No further major debates or campaign-wide events are scheduled before the election.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "About 1 week (results expected on election night, late April 2025)",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No — Liberals maintain their national popular-vote lead and finish first in votes",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "The late-campaign polls hold: Liberals keep a ~5–7 point national edge driven by sizable advantages in Ontario and Quebec; Conservatives rack up large margins in AB/SK but cannot offset population-weighted Liberal strength elsewhere. Normal polling error and turnout patterns aren’t enough to erase the gap.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "A late break and/or polling error narrows and flips the race: Conservatives gain 3–5 points nationally via improvements in Ontario and BC, while Bloc/Caquiste-leaning voters shave Liberal share in Quebec. Higher Conservative turnout (reflected in advanced voting and day-of) plus undecideds breaking right yields a razor-thin Conservative popular-vote win.",
    "rationale": "- Current evidence: Multiple late-April polls show Liberals ahead nationally by roughly 5–7 points (examples cited by the assistant: ~43–45% Liberal vs ~37–38% Conservative). Regionals: strong Liberal leads in Quebec (~40% vs ~25%) and a lead in Ontario; Conservatives dominate AB/SK; BC appears tied around 42–42. This geographic mix typically yields a Liberal national vote edge given the population share of ON+QC.\n- Commitment/turnout: Conservatives show higher voter commitment (76% “very committed” vs 63% for Liberals) and may benefit from enthusiasm and advanced voting. They also lead narrowly among under-35s, though that group tends to have lower turnout. These factors could narrow the gap by 1–2 points but on their own are unlikely to overturn a 5–7 point deficit.\n- Poll error and late movement: Recent Canadian federal elections usually see national popular-vote errors of roughly 1–3 points for major parties. Overturning a 5–7 point deficit would require an unusually large late swing and/or systematic polling miss. That is possible but not the base case.\n- Status quo weighting: With around a week left and no major debates/events remaining, the most likely outcome is that current polling roughly holds. Hence the base case is “No.”\n- Why not higher than ~22%: The consistent multi-poll Liberal lead, plus large Liberal advantages in ON and QC, makes a Conservative popular-vote win a stretch from here. The size of the deficit exceeds typical late shifts.\n- Why not lower than ~22%: Conservatives have won the federal popular vote in recent cycles even while trailing in seats; they show higher commitment; BC is competitive; shifts in ON or a Bloc uptick in QC could reduce the Liberal national share. A modest polling miss or late-decider break could still produce a narrow Conservative edge.\n- What would move me upward: (1) High-quality national polls narrowing the gap to ≤2 points; (2) Clear ON tightening with Conservatives moving into a tie or lead; (3) New evidence of a Bloc surge pulling Liberal support down in QC; (4) Turnout indicators showing disproportionate Conservative participation in ON/BC; (5) A late-breaking issue hurting Liberals.\n- What would move me downward: (1) Fresh polls keeping or widening the Liberal lead (≥6–8 points); (2) Stable or improving Liberal numbers in ON and QC; (3) Signs that advanced/day-of turnout is not unusually favorable to Conservatives.",
