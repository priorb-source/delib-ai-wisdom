  "information": "The drought has caused significant ecological and public safety consequences. The Everglades is experiencing its worst drought in 13 years, causing some areas to dry up completely, which has led to the suspension of tourism activities like airboat tours. As of early May 2025, elevated fire risk resulted in over 100 active wildfires burning more than 3,600 acres of vegetation. In response to the dry conditions, at least 21 counties have issued burn bans.",

    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "One month.",
    "status_quo_outcome": "Yes. According to news reports from late April 2025, Florida was already at the 14.0 million resident threshold. If conditions do not significantly improve, the outcome will be Yes.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Fewer than 14.0 million residents are in drought. This scenario would be driven by an early, widespread, and intense start to Florida's summer rainy season in June, potentially augmented by an early tropical weather system, delivering enough rainfall to substantially improve conditions in populated areas.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "14.0 million or more residents remain in drought. This would occur if the summer rainy season has a delayed start or delivers only scattered, below-average rainfall, which is insufficient to overcome the existing moisture deficits across large population centers within the one-month timeframe.",
    "rationale": "My forecast of 65% is anchored on the status quo. The research provided indicates that as of late April/early May 2025, Florida was already at the 14.0 million resident threshold for drought conditions. Given the short one-month timeframe, the persistence of these conditions is the most likely outcome. Droughts have significant inertia; it takes sustained, widespread rainfall to alleviate them, and a month is a short period for such a recovery. The main factor pushing towards a 'No' resolution is the strong seasonal climatology of Florida, as June marks the typical start of the wet season. However, a merely average onset of rainy weather may not be enough to decrease the affected population below the specified 14.0 million threshold by June 28. The 'Yes' outcome simply requires a continuation of the current state, while a 'No' requires significant, positive change. For this reason, I favor the status quo. The probability is not higher (e.g., >80%) because the start of the wet season is a powerful, reliable phenomenon that creates a very plausible path to rapid drought improvement. The probability is not lower (<50%) because the starting point is already at the resolution threshold, meaning the burden of proof is on the weather to improve the situation, not just maintain it. I would lower my probability upon seeing strong meteorological forecasts for a tropical system or a weather pattern bringing widespread, above-average precipitation to the Florida peninsula in early June. I would raise my probability if long-range forecasts suggest a strengthening high-pressure system that would delay or weaken the onset of the wet season.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill Florida have 14.0 million or more residents living in drought on June 28, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nUSA Today: [14 million Florida residents are under drought conditions, some extreme: What to know](https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2025/04/28/florida-drought-conditions-what-to-know/83328368007/)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if Drought Monitor at [this link](https://www.drought.gov/states/florida) lists greater than or equal to 14.0 million Florida residents in areas of drought, when the link is accessed by Metaculus on or after June 28, 2025. If the number is below that, this question resolves as **No**.\n\nThe question will resolve as soon as the page is accessed by Metaculus Admins on the resolution date. However, if there are issues accessing the page, then resolution will wait up until the end of the tournament's scoring at which point if Metaculus has still not been able to access the resolution source, this question will be **annulled**.\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nThe drought has caused significant ecological and public safety consequences. The Everglades is experiencing its worst drought in 13 years, causing some areas to dry up completely, which has led to the suspension of tourism activities like airboat tours. As of early May 2025, elevated fire risk resulted in over 100 active wildfires burning more than 3,600 acres of vegetation. In response to the dry conditions, at least 21 counties have issued burn bans.\n\nToday is 2025-05-29.\n\nBefore answering you think:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n(e) You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
