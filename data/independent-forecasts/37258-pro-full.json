  "information": "A 2022 UK Supreme Court ruling established that the Scottish Parliament cannot unilaterally hold a legally binding independence referendum without the approval of the UK Parliament in Westminster. The UK government has consistently denied requests for another referendum, a position reiterated by the UK Labour party. The previous independence referendum in 2014 was announced approximately two years before it was held, and precedent suggests constitutional changes require around 18 months of legal and administrative lead time.\n\nIn January 2025, Scotland's First Minister John Swinney described independence as an 'urgent priority'. However, former First Minister Nicola Sturgeon stated in the same month that a referendum was 'off the radar' for now and unlikely before the 2030s. More recent government announcements in April 2025 indicate a strategic focus on the economy, child poverty, and public services. The Scottish Labour leader, Anas Sarwar, has stated his party will not support an independence referendum during the next Holyrood term, regardless of the 2026 election outcome. The leader of the Alba Party, Kenny MacAskill, has suggested using the May 2026 Holyrood elections as a direct mandate for negotiating independence rather than holding a separate referendum.\n\nThe Scottish Government has issued guidance advising against significant or high-profile government announcements between May 15 and June 5, 2025, due to a by-election campaign in the Hamilton, Larkhall and Stonehouse constituency. Separately, tens of thousands of Scottish council workers are being balloted on strike action, with the vote closing on June 12. Public opinion polls on independence are mixed; while one poll showed an 11-point lead for 'Yes,' other sources from late April 2025 indicate polling remains in the 45-55% range against independence, with one citing 54% opposition.",

    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Approximately 2 months, as the question resolves on July 1, 2025.",
    "status_quo_outcome": "The Scottish government will not announce a date for an independence referendum, and the question will resolve as No.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "The Scottish government continues its stated focus on the economy, child poverty, and public services. Acknowledging the legal and political barriers set by the UK government and the Supreme Court, the SNP opts to build its case for independence with a view to the 2026 Holyrood elections, rather than force a symbolic and legally non-binding referendum announcement in the short term. The July 1, 2025 deadline passes without an official date being set.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "In a surprise political move, possibly driven by internal party pressure or a perceived opportunity, the First Minister of Scotland makes a unilateral announcement scheduling an independence referendum. This act would be primarily political, intended to energize the independence movement and force a constitutional confrontation with the UK government, despite the lack of a legal pathway for a binding vote.",
    "rationale": "My forecast is based on several key factors that strongly favor a 'No' outcome. Firstly, the timeline is extremely short. With a deadline of July 1, 2025, there are less than two months remaining. Constitutional referendums typically require extensive lead time for planning and legislation; the 2014 referendum was announced about two years in advance. Secondly, there are significant legal and political hurdles. The 2022 UK Supreme Court ruling prevents the Scottish Parliament from holding a referendum without Westminster's consent, which both the current UK government and the opposition Labour party have consistently refused to grant. Thirdly, the Scottish government's recent public focus has shifted away from an imminent referendum. April 2025 announcements indicate a strategic priority on domestic issues like the economy and public services. This aligns with former First Minister Nicola Sturgeon's assessment that a referendum is 'off the radar' for the time being. Finally, practical constraints, such as the guidance against high-profile announcements until June 5 due to a by-election, further narrow the already tight window for such a major declaration. While independence remains a core goal for the SNP, current strategy appears to be geared towards the 2026 Holyrood elections as the next major step. \n\nMy probability is not lower than 3% because politics can be unpredictable. A sudden, bold, and symbolic announcement, while highly improbable, cannot be entirely ruled out as a political gambit by the First Minister to rally support, especially given his January 2025 statement calling independence an 'urgent priority'. The question only requires an announcement by a Scottish authority, not that the referendum be legally sanctioned by the UK.\n\nMy probability is not higher than 3% because the confluence of legal barriers, the short timeline, the UK government's firm opposition, and the Scottish government's own stated focus on other policy areas makes an announcement before July 1 extremely unlikely. The path of least resistance and greatest strategic sense for the independence movement points towards a longer-term strategy centered on future elections.\n\nI would increase my probability if the First Minister made new public statements directly hinting at an imminent announcement, or if a major political crisis unfolded in Westminster that the SNP believed it could exploit. I would decrease my probability if the First Minister explicitly rules out any referendum announcement before the 2026 Scottish election.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nBefore July 1, 2025, will the government of Scotland officially announce a date for an independence referendum?\n\nQuestion background:\nThe National: [Yes posts huge 11-point lead in new Scottish independence poll](https://www.thenational.scot/news/25089457.yes-posts-huge-11-point-lead-new-scottish-independence-poll/)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if, before July 1, 2025, a referendum on the independence of Scotland from the United Kingdom is officially scheduled. If this does not occur before that date, this question resolves as **No**.\n\nFor purposes of this question, the referendum will be considered \"officially scheduled\" when it is announced by a person or entity with the authority to do so within Scotland. Please note that broader legality, such as within the United Kingdom, will be considered irrelevant for this question, so if the federal government declared the referendum illegal, the question would still resolve as Yes.\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nA 2022 UK Supreme Court ruling established that the Scottish Parliament cannot unilaterally hold a legally binding independence referendum without the approval of the UK Parliament in Westminster.
