    "review": "Both forecasters make valuable points about Florida's wet season being a powerful force for change, which creates meaningful downside risk to a YES resolution. Forecaster 3 provides important new information: NOAA's March seasonal outlook predicted drought persistence through April-June in South Florida, and makes an excellent point about how SE Florida's concentrated population (~6M people) could cause rapid threshold crossings if conditions change there. However, I believe both forecasters underweight key factors: (1) My research assistant's data is from May 29 (today), showing 14.5M residents in drought - this is current and provides a 500k buffer; (2) The severity of current conditions (84% of state, worst since 2012, 7-8 months of accumulation) creates strong inertia; (3) USDM classifications lag precipitation by multiple weeks, and June 28 is only 30 days away - at the very start of the wet season; (4) Current deficits of 6-10 inches require sustained, substantial rainfall, not just a typical wet season onset. Forecaster 2's 65% and Forecaster 3's 55% seem too pessimistic given the strong status quo and the lag between precipitation and drought classification changes.",
    "rationale": "After reviewing the other analyses, I'm adjusting my forecast slightly downward from 78% to 75%. The deliberation highlights that the wet season's onset creates more immediate downside risk than I initially weighted - both forecasters correctly emphasize this as a powerful, reliable phenomenon in Florida. Forecaster 3's point about population concentration in SE Florida is particularly well-taken, as changes there could move the threshold quickly. However, I maintain that drought persistence remains the most likely outcome because: (1) Current conditions as of May 29 show 14.5M residents in drought, providing a real buffer; (2) The drought is severe and well-established over 7-8 months; (3) USDM updates lag precipitation by weeks - even with early wet season rainfall, hydrologic recovery and classification changes take time; (4) NOAA's own outlook predicted persistence through June in South Florida, not rapid improvement; (5) The resolution date is June 28, only 30 days away and at the very beginning of the wet season. The burden remains on weather patterns to create enough sustained rainfall to overcome months of deficit and trigger USDM downgrades within just one month. While the wet season creates a plausible path to NO, the combination of current severity, classification lag effects, and short timeframe favors persistence.",
