    "review": "The other forecasters raised crucial historical data I had not considered. Forecaster 3 identified a remarkably strong recent trend: women have won the Outstanding Chef award in 2014 (Nancy Silverton), 2016 (Suzanne Goin), 2019 (Ashley Christensen), 2020 (Gabrielle Hamilton), and 2022 (Mashama Bailey). This represents approximately 5 wins out of roughly 11 years, or about 45% - significantly higher than I initially estimated. Forecaster 2 also noted similar historical winners and estimated 30-40% of finalists are women in recent years. Both forecasters correctly emphasized that the James Beard Foundation has made deliberate efforts toward inclusivity, which appears to have manifested in actual outcomes, not just rhetoric. The pattern is particularly striking in the 2019-2022 period, where women won 3 out of 4 years. This represents a genuine shift in the award's outcomes that I underweighted in my initial analysis. All three of us share the same limitation: we cannot access the actual 2025 finalist list despite it being referenced in the background material. This remains a critical information gap.",
    "rationale": "Upon reviewing the concrete historical data provided by my fellow forecasters, I need to update my forecast upward. The evidence shows that women have won this award at close to a 45% rate in recent years (2014-2022), with particularly strong representation from 2019-2022. This is substantially higher than the historical baseline I was implicitly assuming. My initial 30% forecast was too anchored to older historical patterns and insufficiently weighted recent trends. The James Beard Foundation's diversity initiatives appear to have had real impact on outcomes. However, I'm not updating all the way to 40% or higher because: (1) we still lack information about the actual 2025 finalists, which could significantly shift probabilities either direction; (2) three consecutive years with women winners (2019-2020-2022) might represent clustering rather than a stable new equilibrium; (3) we don't know if 2023-2024 continued this trend. Balancing the strong recent trend against remaining uncertainty about the specific 2025 field, I'm updating to 38%.",
