  "information": "According to news reports, Florida ranks among the top three US states for total UFO sightings, with 8,623 reported cases documented by the National UFO Reporting Center (NUFORC). On March 28, 2025, a US military aircraft encountered a large group of unidentified objects described as glowing spheres in the sky over Florida. A leaked audio recording of the pilot's radio conversation with an air traffic controller indicated the pilot saw several high-speed objects, experienced communication disruptions, and observed an unusual glow around the plane. A Lockheed AC-130 Spectre gunship was reportedly dispatched to the area in response to the incident.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Approximately 41 days. The question resolves based on June 2025 pilot UFO reports posted to NUFORC, which will be checked on or after July 1, 2025. Today is May 21, 2025, so June hasn't occurred yet.",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No - Florida would likely not have the most pilot sightings. While Florida ranks in the top three states for total UFO sightings, pilot reports are a specific subset that may correlate more with air traffic density and military aviation presence than general sighting patterns. Multiple states with major airports and military installations (California, Texas, Arizona, etc.) would compete for the top position in any given month.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Pilot reports in June 2025 follow typical patterns, with sightings distributed across multiple high-traffic states. California, Texas, or another state with major commercial hubs and military installations reports more pilot sightings than Florida. The March incident doesn't translate into sustained elevated pilot reporting for June, and random monthly variation favors another state.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "The March 28, 2025 military encounter creates heightened awareness among pilots flying over or near Florida. This leads to increased vigilance and reporting among both military and commercial pilots in the region through June. Additional incidents occur in Florida airspace during June, or pilots come forward with previously unreported sightings, resulting in Florida having the clear plurality of pilot reports for that month.",
    "rationale": "This forecast requires careful consideration of several factors. The question specifically asks about PILOT sightings in June 2025, not general UFO reports. While my research assistant notes Florida ranks in the top three states overall for UFO sightings (8,623 cases), pilot reports represent a narrow subset likely more correlated with air traffic volume and military aviation presence than general sighting patterns.\n\nThe March 28, 2025 incident is noteworthy - a military aircraft encountering multiple glowing spheres with leaked audio and an AC-130 response suggests a significant event. However, this occurred 2-3 months before June, and it's unclear whether such an incident would sustain elevated pilot reporting through that period.\n\nKey uncertainties:\n1. We don't know baseline monthly variation in pilot reports by state\n2. States like California and Texas have comparable or greater air traffic\n3. The requirement is for THE MOST sightings - ties resolve as No\n4. Pilot reports are much rarer than general public reports\n\nThe recent incident provides upward pressure on my forecast, as heightened awareness among pilots and authorities could lead to increased reporting. However, good forecasting practice suggests weighting the status quo heavily. Without the March incident, I would expect pilot reports to be distributed among several high-traffic states with no clear dominant leader in any given month. The base rate for Florida being #1 in pilot sightings specifically is likely modest even given its high general sighting numbers.\n\nMy forecast is not higher because: (1) the March incident is 2-3 months old by June; (2) other states have equal or greater air traffic; (3) we need outright plurality, not just high numbers; (4) random monthly variation is substantial with small sample sizes.\n\nMy forecast is not lower because: (1) Florida does have legitimately high UFO activity; (2) the recent military incident is significant and could sustain awareness; (3) Florida's combination of military presence, commercial traffic, and UFO history makes it a credible contender.\n\nI would update higher if: evidence emerged of continued incidents in Florida airspace during April-May, or data showed Florida historically dominates pilot reports. I would update lower if: data showed pilot reports correlate primarily with pure air traffic volume (favoring larger aviation states like California).",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill Florida have the most pilot sightings of UFOs of any US state in March 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nAccording to the [National UFO Reporting Center](https://nuforc.org/about-us/): \"The National UFO Reporting Center was founded in 1974 by noted UFO investigator Robert J. Gribble. The Center’s primary function over the past five decades has been to receive, record, and to the greatest degree possible, corroborate and document reports from individuals who have been witness to unusual, possibly UFO-related events. Throughout its history, the Center has processed over 180,000 reports, and has distributed its information to thousands of individuals.\"\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if The National UFO Reporting Center posts more pilot reports of a UFO/UAP having occurred in the state of Florida than any other state, for the month of June 2025 at [this link](https://nuforc.org/subndx/?id=x) when accessed by Metaculus on or after July 1, 2025.\n\nIf Florida is tied with another state, resolves as No.\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nAccording to news reports, Florida ranks among the top three US states for total UFO sightings, with 8,623 reported cases documented by the National UFO Reporting Center (NUFORC).

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
