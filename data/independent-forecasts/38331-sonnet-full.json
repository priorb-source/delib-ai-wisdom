  "information": "In May 2025, Pakistan restored access to X (formerly Twitter) after a 15-month ban that was first enforced in February 2024. Internet monitoring organization NetBlocks confirmed that access was restored, allowing citizens to use the platform without a VPN. In a separate development, X blocked access to 126 accounts in Turkey in February 2025 following a court order citing the need for 'protection of national security and public order.' The blocked accounts included those of journalists and activists. In April 2025, a court in Ankara issued further access block decisions for several popular Turkish news accounts on the platform.\n\nThe Indian government ordered X to block access to over 8,000 accounts in May 2025, citing a crackdown on 'anti-India content' and violations of local regulations. The blocked accounts included those of several Turkish and Chinese media organizations, as well as independent media outlets and journalists. X stated its disagreement with the orders, noting that 'blocking entire accounts is not only unnecessary, it amounts to censorship... and is contrary to the fundamental right of free speech,' but indicated it would comply while investigating legal options.\n\nIn early June 2025, the government of Tanzania blocked access to X. The country's information minister stated the ban was due to the platform hosting explicit sexual material, including pornographic and LGBTQ+ content, which he said was 'contrary to the East African state's laws, culture, customs, and traditions.' The move followed a recent change in X's policy to allow 'consensually produced and distributed' adult content. The Legal and Human Rights Centre (LHRC), a local rights group, described the action as part of a 'troubling pattern of digital repression' ahead of scheduled elections in October.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Approximately 26 days. The question resolves on or after July 1, 2025, and today is June 5, 2025.",
    "status_quo_outcome": "Yes - all seven countries (China, Iran, Myanmar, North Korea, Russia, Turkmenistan, and Venezuela) continue to be listed on Wikipedia as currently blocking X.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "At least one of the seven countries unblocks X before July 1, 2025, or Wikipedia editors remove one or more countries from the 'currently blocking' list due to editorial reassessment, insufficient evidence, or classification changes. Venezuela, which has had more intermittent restrictions historically, might be most likely to be removed from the list.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "All seven countries maintain their X/Twitter blocks through the end of June 2025, and Wikipedia's article continues to list all of them under current blocks. Given these are highly restrictive regimes with long-standing blocks (China and Iran since 2009, Russia since 2022, etc.), the status quo persists unchanged.",
    "rationale": "The timeframe is very short (26 days), which strongly favors the status quo. The seven countries listed represent some of the world's most restrictive internet censorship regimes with well-established, long-standing blocks on X/Twitter. China and Iran have blocked Twitter since 2009, Russia since 2022 following the Ukraine invasion, Myanmar since the 2021 coup, and North Korea and Turkmenistan maintain exceptionally restrictive internet policies overall.\n\nThe research assistant's report provides context about X censorship globally but notably contains no information about any of the seven specific countries in question changing their policies. The examples given (Pakistan restoring access, Turkey and India blocking specific accounts, Tanzania implementing a new block) involve different countries and don't signal any trend affecting the seven countries we're tracking.\n\nThe primary risk for a NO outcome isn't actual policy changes by these regimes in the next 26 days - that's highly unlikely given their nature and the short timeframe. Instead, the risks are: (1) Wikipedia editorial decisions to reclassify or remove one or more countries based on technical definitions or evidence standards, (2) potential instability in Venezuela's status, which has historically had more intermittent restrictions compared to the others, and (3) edit wars or consensus issues, though admins have discretion to handle these.\n\nMy forecast is not higher (98-99%) because Wikipedia is a human-edited platform subject to editorial judgment, and there's inherent uncertainty in how editors might classify borderline cases. Venezuela represents the biggest individual risk among the seven countries. My forecast is not lower (80-85%) because the timeframe is exceptionally short, these regimes show no signs of liberalization, and the blocks have been stable for years in most cases. Any significant change would require either rapid political shifts (extremely unlikely) or Wikipedia editorial changes (possible but uncommon for well-established facts).",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nAt the end of June 2025, will Wikipedia still list all these countries as \"currently\" blocking access to X (formerly Twitter)?\n\nQuestion background:\nAccording to the resolution source, \"Censorship of Twitter refers to Internet censorship by governments that block access to Twitter (officially known as X since July 2023). Twitter censorship also includes governmental notice and take down requests to Twitter, which it enforces in accordance with its Terms of Service when a government or authority submits a valid removal request to Twitter indicating that specific content published on the platform is illegal in their jurisdiction.\"\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if Wikipedia still lists X (formerly known as Twitter) as currently blocked in China, Iran, Myanmar, North Korea, Russia, Turkmenistan and Venezuela at [this link](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Censorship_of_Twitter#Current) when accessed by Metaculus on or after July 1, 2025. If the Wikipedia article does not list X as currently being blocked in any of those countries, this question resolves as **No**.\n\nThe question will resolve as soon as the page is accessed by Metaculus Admins on the resolution date. However, if there are issues accessing the page, then resolution will wait up to July 7, 2025, at which point if Metaculus has still not been able to access the resolution source, this question will be **annulled**. Admins will also use their discretion if there appears to be an [edit war](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Edit_warring) or lack of Wikipedia [consensus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Consensus) and may annul the question in such a case; however, Admins will also strive to resolve the question as definitively Yes or No, and such an edge case should be considered a rare outcome.\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nIn May 2025, Pakistan restored access to X (formerly Twitter) after a 15-month ban that was first enforced in February 2024.

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
