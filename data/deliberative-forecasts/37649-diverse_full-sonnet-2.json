    "review": "All three forecasts cluster in the 40-60% range, reflecting genuine uncertainty about a borderline timeline. Forecaster 3's analysis (43%) most closely matches my reasoning - both emphasizing that the historical median of ~16 weeks slightly exceeds our 15.5-week window, with Chad-specific logistics challenges balanced against regional momentum. Forecaster 2's 60% forecast seems optimistic given that only 1 of 4-5 African examples was faster than our deadline, and treating the outcome as 'more likely than not' doesn't align well with base rates that lean toward missing. However, Forecaster 2 makes a fair point about Niger's same-day launch suggesting genuine regional operational capacity, and both forecasters correctly note that we've already passed 9 of the 15.5 weeks - meaning we're very close to the DRC's 10-week precedent. The Airtel partnership announced in May 2025 is indeed recent and potentially relevant. My original 40% may have been slightly too pessimistic for a truly borderline case where the primary regulatory hurdle is cleared and we're already 58% through the timeline toward the fastest precedent.",
    "rationale": "Upon review, I'm adjusting up slightly from 40% to 43%. The key insight from deliberation is that while base rates favor missing (median ~16 weeks vs our 15.5 weeks), we're genuinely on the borderline rather than clearly on one side. Three factors support modest upward revision: (1) We've already elapsed 9 weeks with 6.5 remaining - we're very close to DRC's 10-week fast path; (2) Niger's March 13 same-day launch genuinely indicates SpaceX has operational infrastructure in the region; (3) The recent Airtel partnership could accelerate last-mile distribution. However, I'm not moving to 60% because the mathematical reality is that most precedents (Malawi, Zambia, Benin) took longer than our cutoff, and Chad's landlocked status plus need to finalize import rules and spectrum fees represent concrete delay risks. The 43% forecast appropriately weights both the slight base-rate lean toward No and the meaningful probability of a fast-track activation given regional readiness and time already elapsed.",
