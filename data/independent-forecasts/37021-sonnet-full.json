  "information": "According to Ukraine's State Statistics Service, the annual inflation rate has shown an accelerating trend in early 2025, rising from 12.9% in January to 13.4% in February, and reaching 14.6% in March. The monthly inflation rate for March 2025 was 1.5%, up from 0.8% in February. The March data represents the highest annual inflation rate since May 2023. Specific price increases in March were significant in several categories, including eggs (+18.8%) and clothing and footwear (+13.3%). On a year-over-year basis, food and non-alcoholic beverages increased by 17.4%, while housing, water, electricity, gas, and other fuels rose by 20.2%.\n\nThe National Bank of Ukraine (NBU) has maintained its key interest rate at 15.5% in an effort to control inflation. The NBU revised its year-end 2025 inflation forecast to 8.7% and its 2025 GDP growth forecast down to 3.1%. NBU statements indicate an expectation that inflation will peak in the second quarter of 2025 and subsequently decline during the summer, partly due to an anticipated increase in crop yields, which is projected to lower food inflation. The bank has identified ongoing risks including the war, infrastructure damage, and labor shortages.\n\nThe primary factors driving recent inflation include increased production costs for businesses and supply chain disruptions resulting from the war. Intensified attacks on energy infrastructure and population mobilization have also been cited as contributing pressures. The cost of the 2025 Easter food basket was reported to be 18-19% higher than in the previous year. On the other hand, potential disinflationary factors include the NBU's monetary policy and a reported decrease in consumer demand. Some economists expect seasonal factors to lead to an increase in vegetable production and a subsequent decrease in food prices in late spring or early summer.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Approximately 1-2 weeks. April 2025 inflation data from Ukraine's State Statistics Service is typically released in early May, and will be reflected on Trading Economics shortly thereafter.",
    "status_quo_outcome": "Yes, inflation likely reaches or exceeds 15.0%",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "April's monthly inflation rate decelerates significantly from March's 1.5% level, perhaps due to the NBU's tight monetary policy beginning to take effect or early seasonal improvements in agricultural production reducing food prices. Consumer demand continues to decline, and the combined effect keeps the annual rate just below 15.0%, perhaps at 14.7-14.9%.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "The current upward trend continues as war-related pressures persist, including ongoing energy infrastructure damage and supply chain disruptions. Monthly inflation in April remains elevated at 0.8-1.2%, pushing the annual rate from March's 14.6% to at least 15.0%. This aligns with the NBU's expectation that inflation will peak in Q2 2025.",
    "rationale": "The data strongly favors a Yes outcome. Ukraine's annual inflation has accelerated from 12.9% in January to 13.4% in February to 14.6% in March - we need only 0.4 more percentage points to reach 15.0%. The monthly inflation rate of 1.5% in March was substantial, and even a more moderate monthly rate of 0.5-1.0% in April could push the annual figure over the threshold. Critically, the NBU itself has stated it expects inflation to peak in Q2 2025, which encompasses April. This official guidance suggests the central bank anticipates continued upward pressure through April before the expected summer decline driven by crop yields. The war-related factors driving inflation (infrastructure damage, supply disruptions, labor shortages) show no signs of abating in April. Food prices remain particularly elevated, with Easter costs up 18-19% year-over-year. Against this, the NBU's 15.5% interest rate and declining consumer demand could provide some brake, and seasonal agricultural improvements could theoretically arrive early. However, these disinflationary forces are more likely to manifest in late spring/summer rather than April. The forecast is not higher (e.g., 85%+) because there remains some uncertainty about exact timing - inflation could peak in May or June rather than April - and monthly volatility could theoretically keep us just below 15.0%. It's not lower because the trend is unambiguous, we're very close to the threshold, and the NBU's own guidance supports continued increases in Q2. I would revise upward with evidence of continued high monthly inflation in early April data, and downward only with clear signs of rapid deceleration or early seasonal improvements.",
