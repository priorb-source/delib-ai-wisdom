    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Approximately 3 weeks. The University of Michigan typically releases preliminary Consumer Sentiment results around the 10th-14th of each month, so May 2025 preliminary results should be available around May 10-14, 2025.",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No - consumer sentiment remains at or below the April 2025 level of 50.8",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Consumer sentiment remains depressed or declines further as the severe economic or political conditions that caused the historic April plunge persist or worsen through May. The factors driving the second-worst reading in 73 years prove not to be a temporary shock but rather reflect sustained underlying problems. May's reading comes in at 50.8 or lower.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Consumer sentiment improves even modestly above 50.8 as either: (1) the specific shock that caused April's historic drop begins to dissipate, (2) positive economic news emerges (inflation moderation, strong employment data, market stabilization), or (3) natural mean reversion occurs after an extreme reading. Even a small bounce to 51-52 would constitute a Yes resolution.",
    "rationale": "This forecast centers on an extraordinarily unusual situation - April 2025's reading of 50.8 represents the second-lowest consumer sentiment in records dating back to 1952. This context is crucial: we're not dealing with normal fluctuations but rather an historic extreme that suggests severe underlying economic, political, or social distress.\n\nKey considerations favoring continued depression (No): The severity of this reading suggests deep structural problems rather than temporary volatility. Historic lows often persist for multiple months during major crises. The April 11 date means this is very recent, and whatever caused this collapse is likely still affecting consumer psychology. Without information from my research assistant about the specific cause, I must assume the factors are serious enough to produce a 73-year low.\n\nKey considerations favoring improvement (Yes): Consumer sentiment exhibits mean reversion tendencies, especially after extreme readings. Initial reactions to shocks can moderate as people adjust. The question only requires May > 50.8, so even a marginal improvement of 0.1 points would resolve as Yes. Markets and consumer psychology can stabilize quickly after panic.\n\nThe central uncertainty is whether April's reading represents peak pessimism (suggesting near-term bounce) or the beginning of sustained depression (suggesting persistence). Historical precedent shows both patterns exist. The 2022 low around 50.0 during peak inflation persisted for several months before gradually recovering.\n\nGiven the extreme nature of the reading and its recency, I weight the status quo (continued depression) slightly more heavily than mean reversion, but acknowledge substantial uncertainty. My forecast would move higher if: (1) positive economic data emerges in late April, (2) the specific cause of the drop proves transient, or (3) historical analysis shows strong bounce-back patterns from extreme lows. It would move lower if: (4) early May survey hints suggest continued weakness, (5) economic conditions deteriorate further, or (6) the causative factors appear structural rather than temporary.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill the May 2025 University of Michigan Consumer Sentiment number be greater than it was for April 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nCNN: [US consumer sentiment plummets to second-lowest level on records going back to 1952](https://www.cnn.com/2025/04/11/economy/us-consumer-sentiment-april/index.html)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if the University of Michigan's reported Index of Consumer Sentiment, expected to be located [here](http://www.sca.isr.umich.edu/), is greater than 50.8 for May 2025. Less than or equal to that amount resolves the question as **No**.\n\nPreliminary results are sufficient to resolve the question. If there is any confusion about the number, Metaculus will resolve based on whatever number is posted at [this pdf](http://www.sca.isr.umich.edu/files/tbcics.pdf) that is labelled as May 2025, including preliminary. For example, on April 11, 2025 the number displayed was 50.8 for April 2025 (P).\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nNo additional information available.\n\nToday is 2025-04-22.\n\nBefore answering you think:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n(e) You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
