    "review": "Both other forecasters provided excellent, well-structured analyses that align on the core arguments favoring a 'No' outcome. I found their reasoning highly convincing. Forecaster 2 made a strong point that major corporate events like the upcoming Data + AI Summit are typically focused on products and partnerships, not financial announcements like an IPO, which are made through formal channels. This insight tempers my initial weighting of the summit as a likely catalyst. Forecaster 3’s analysis was particularly sharp, highlighting a crucial detail I had overlooked: the resolution criteria specifically require a *public* S-1 or a website announcement, meaning a confidential filing would not trigger a 'Yes'. They also correctly noted the legal risks ('gun-jumping') of an announcement without a concurrent filing, effectively tying the two resolution paths into a single, high-bar event. Together, these arguments paint a clearer picture of the significant logistical and strategic hurdles to a 'Yes' resolution in the next five weeks.",
    "rationale": "After reviewing my peers' analyses, I am revising my forecast downward. My initial 20% was primarily based on the possibility of a surprise announcement at the June Data + AI Summit. The other forecasters persuasively argued that this is an unlikely venue for such an announcement and, more importantly, that the required action is a *public* filing, which is a significant step that is rarely taken without prior leaks or signals (e.g., underwriter selection). The immense capital raised in January 2025 provides Databricks with a long runway and significantly reduces any urgency to go public in the very near term, especially given uncertain market sentiment. The arguments from the other forecasters have convinced me that the inertia of remaining private, combined with the lack of any public preparatory steps and the short timeline, is a stronger force than I initially estimated. I am therefore lowering my forecast from 20% to 15%, aligning with the consensus that a 'Yes' outcome, while possible, is improbable.",
