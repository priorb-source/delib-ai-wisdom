  "information": "A proposal to ban the 'Tush Push' play, initially submitted by the Green Bay Packers, was discussed at the NFL's annual meeting in early April 2025. The proposal was tabled after receiving support from 16 of the NFL's 32 teams, short of the 24 votes required to pass a rule change. The proposal is scheduled to be revisited at the spring league meeting on May 20-21, 2025, in Minneapolis, Minnesota.\n\nMultiple reports indicate that NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell favors the ban. Goodell has stated that the play 'feels more like rugby' than football and that returning to pre-2005 rules that banned pushing players 'makes a lot of sense.' The NFL league office also reportedly wants to eliminate the play. Additionally, the NFL's Competition Committee and health and safety officials, including Dr. Allen Sills, have expressed concerns about the play's potential for injury.\n\nThe original proposal is being reworked into a broader rule that would prohibit pushing or pulling a ball carrier anywhere on the field, not just in the specific quarterback sneak formation. This change aims to frame the issue around general football principles rather than targeting a specific team. On the other hand, the NFL's health and safety department possesses no data indicating any injuries have occurred from the 'Tush Push'. The Philadelphia Eagles, who have used the play with a high success rate, have vocally opposed the ban.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "About 9–19 days (owners meet May 20–21; if no decision then, nearly certain by June 1).",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No (the play remains legal absent new approval/announcement).",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Owners do not reach 24 votes at the May 20–21 meetings; no special meeting or league office rule announcement occurs before June 1.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "At the May meetings, owners approve either (a) a direct ban/restriction on the Tush-Push sneak, or (b) a broader “no aiding the runner” rule (prohibiting pushing/pulling the ball carrier anywhere on the field), which effectively restricts the Tush-Push, and the NFL announces it before June 1.",
    "rationale": "Baseline: If nothing changes, this resolves No, since the play is currently legal and there is only one obvious decision window (May 20–21). The prior discussion reportedly had 16 of 32 clubs in support—eight short of the 24 needed. That is a significant gap this late in the process. Arguments for a higher chance of a ban: (1) Commissioner Goodell and the league office reportedly favor eliminating the play; when leadership pushes a change—especially framed as restoring past football principles—votes can move. (2) The proposal is being broadened to a general ban on pushing/pulling a ball carrier anywhere, which may feel less like targeting one team and could attract additional support. (3) Media reporting suggests momentum/“strong support” for an expansive ban at the May meeting. Arguments for a lower chance: (1) Health-and-safety staff reportedly have no injury data tied to the play, weakening the league’s most persuasive reform frame. (2) Owners have already declined to ban it multiple times in recent years; reversing a 2005 allowance of aiding the runner would be a major change with enforcement ramifications across many routine plays, which could deter swing voters. (3) Moving from 16 to 24 votes in a few weeks is non-trivial; if many of the non-yes clubs are firm no’s rather than undecided, the path narrows. Net: With heavy weight on the status quo and the sizable vote gap, I see a meaningful but sub-50% chance that lobbying and reframing deliver eight more votes in May. I’m above 25% because of Goodell/league office support and the targeted timing of the May meeting, but below 40% due to the lack of injury data and prior reluctance to legislate out the play. What would raise my forecast: credible reporting that the Competition Committee will formally recommend the broader ban; reliable whip counts showing 22–23+ likely yes votes; key swing owners or influential coaches publicly flipping; union/safety coalition or broadcast partners signaling support. What would lower it: reports that enforcement concerns are stalling the broader rule; statements from multiple clubs that they will not support a field-wide aiding-the-runner ban; leaks from the May meetings that the votes aren’t there or that the issue is being deferred again.",
