    "review": "All three of us converged on similar probabilities (22-28%), identifying the same key factors: February 2025's 2.2% growth trend, the minimal impact of US tourism policy given European market dominance, and lack of evidence for April 2025 disruptions. Forecaster 3 made a valuable point I didn't explicitly state: advance booking patterns mean policy impacts wouldn't materialize in April arrivals. However, I notice neither forecaster emphasized as strongly as I did the Easter calendar shift - Easter fell on March 31 in 2024 versus April 20 in 2025. This timing difference is significant for year-over-year April comparisons, as it shifts substantial Easter holiday travel volume from March 2024 into April 2025. This calendar effect should be a strong structural factor favoring higher April 2025 numbers. The other forecasters acknowledged April is strong for Easter/spring breaks generally but didn't highlight this specific comparative advantage for 2025. Their slightly higher probabilities (27-28%) versus my 22% may reflect appropriate caution about unknown factors, but I don't see compelling evidence they provided that undermines the Easter timing argument.",
    "rationale": "After reviewing the other analyses, I maintain high confidence that April 2025 arrivals will exceed April 2024. The core arguments remain strong: (1) Recent growth momentum with February 2025 up 2.2% year-over-year, (2) Favorable Easter calendar positioning giving April 2025 a structural advantage, (3) US policy concerns affecting a minimal market segment for the Canaries, (4) No evidence of disruptions in the now-concluded April 2025 period, (5) Advance booking patterns mean any late-breaking policy concerns wouldn't impact April arrivals. The convergence of all three forecasts in the 22-28% range validates the overall analytical framework. I'll make a small upward adjustment from 22% to 24% as a hedge toward the other forecasters' range and to acknowledge model uncertainty, but I believe the Easter timing effect they underweighted justifies staying on the more confident end of our collective range.",
