  "information": "The US government documented 757 UFO sightings between May 2023 and June 2024. A notable concentration of these incidents occurred in Arizona, which has become a hotspot for sightings, particularly involving military aircraft. On January 19, 2023, a US Air Force F-16 fighter jet was hit by an object described as an 'orange-white uncrewed aerial system' over Arizona, damaging the plane's canopy. This was one of 22 UFO sightings reported by Air Force pilots between October 2022 and June 2023. Some US officials have suggested that the mysterious objects could be advanced drones used by foreign drug cartels for surveillance and smuggling operations.",

    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "~41 days (Metaculus will check NUFORC on/after 2025-07-01)",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No — another state matches or exceeds Florida’s pilot-report count for the month, or there is a tie (which resolves No).",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Arizona, California, or Texas logs as many or more NUFORC pilot reports as Florida in June 2025, or multiple states end with one report each (tie).",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Florida ends June 2025 with 2+ NUFORC pilot reports while every other state has 0–1, e.g., a cluster of airline or GA pilot sightings off the Florida coast or near launch corridors generates multiple reports.",
    "rationale": "Note on ambiguity: The prompt headline mentions March 2025, but the resolution criteria specify June 2025 and a check on/after July 1, 2025. I forecast based on the stated resolution criteria (June 2025).\n\nBase-rate reasoning and status quo: NUFORC “pilot reports” are relatively rare each month, and totals per state are usually small. With low counts, ties are common and any tie resolves No. Historically, states with high aviation activity and/or military training ranges (AZ, CA, TX, FL) plausibly claim a plurality in any given month, but rarely with a decisive margin. Thus, the default (status quo) is that Florida does not uniquely lead in June, either because another state ties or exceeds Florida, or because there’s a multi-way tie at one report.\n\nWhy Florida could lead: Florida has very high aviation density (airlines, GA training hubs), substantial military activity (Eglin, Tyndall, NAS JAX/Key West), and frequent launch activity from the Space Coast that can prompt unusual visual phenomena for pilots. Any small cluster (e.g., multiple airline crews reporting the same event over the Atlantic or Gulf) could produce 2+ NUFORC pilot reports and a unique lead.\n\nWhy not expect Florida to lead: The RA’s summary highlights Arizona as a hotspot for pilot/military UAP incidents in government datasets, suggesting elevated underlying activity in AZ relative to many states. While government reporting channels differ from NUFORC, this still nudges expectations toward the Southwest (AZ, CA, NV, TX). Moreover, low monthly counts and NUFORC posting lags increase the chance of 0–1 reports across several states, making a tie more likely and thus favoring No. Competition from CA/TX (large airspace and frequent operations) also reduces Florida’s chances of a unique top finish.\n\nWhy my forecast isn’t higher: Tie risk is substantial; several likely contender states exist; and Arizona’s elevated pilot/military activity in recent years suggests a non-trivial chance that AZ or another Southwest state edges out Florida.\n\nWhy my forecast isn’t lower: Florida’s aviation density, year-round training, and frequent launches create plausible pathways to a small cluster of pilot reports in a single month, sufficient for a unique lead.\n\nWhat would move me up: Early NUFORC entries showing 1+ June 2025 pilot reports in Florida while other states have none; media reports of a multi-crew/ATC-observed event over Florida; a conspicuous launch-related phenomenon seen and reported by pilots near Florida during June.\n\nWhat would move me down: Early June NUFORC pilot reports concentrated in AZ/CA/TX; an across-the-board trickle of single reports in multiple states (raising tie risk); evidence of NUFORC posting delays that reduce the likelihood of multiple Florida entries by July 1.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill Florida have the most pilot sightings of UFOs of any US state in March 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nAccording to the [National UFO Reporting Center](https://nuforc.org/about-us/): \"The National UFO Reporting Center was founded in 1974 by noted UFO investigator Robert J. Gribble. The Center’s primary function over the past five decades has been to receive, record, and to the greatest degree possible, corroborate and document reports from individuals who have been witness to unusual, possibly UFO-related events. Throughout its history, the Center has processed over 180,000 reports, and has distributed its information to thousands of individuals.\"\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if The National UFO Reporting Center posts more pilot reports of a UFO/UAP having occurred in the state of Florida than any other state, for the month of June 2025 at [this link](https://nuforc.org/subndx/?id=x) when accessed by Metaculus on or after July 1, 2025.\n\nIf Florida is tied with another state, resolves as No.\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nThe US government documented 757 UFO sightings between May 2023 and June 2024.

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
