    "no_outcome_scenario": "The Florida Legislature's 2025 regular session ends without the bill passing both chambers, or the Governor vetoes it. No special session is called before the deadline to address the issue, so the legislation is not enacted.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "The Republican-controlled Legislature passes a bill expanding citizenship verification requirements, and Republican Governor Ron DeSantis signs it into law before July 1, 2025. This may occur at the very end of the regular session or during a special legislative session called by the Governor.",
    "rationale": "My forecast is primarily driven by legislative timing. Today is May 6, 2025. Florida's regular legislative session typically concludes in early May. This means that for this legislation to be enacted, it would either need to have already passed both chambers and be on the Governor's desk, or a special session would need to be called before July 1. While there is strong political alignment in Florida for such a bill — with Republicans holding a supermajority in the legislature and control of the governorship — the procedural window has likely closed for the regular session. The status quo, where no new legislation is passed, is the most common outcome for any given bill. The burden of proof is on the 'Yes' scenario to overcome institutional inertia and a very tight timeline. A special session is possible, as election integrity is a key issue for the Republican base and Governor DeSantis, but they are not common and are typically reserved for urgent matters like the state budget. Given the lack of information indicating the bill has already passed or that a special session is planned, the probability of enactment before July 1 is low. My forecast is not lower than 20% because the political will to pass such a bill is undeniably present in Tallahassee. Governor DeSantis could use a special session to elevate this issue for political purposes. My forecast is not higher because the legislative calendar is the single biggest obstacle. Most proposed bills fail to become law, and the 2025 session is, for all practical purposes, over. I would increase my forecast significantly if the Governor schedules a special session and includes this issue on the call. Conversely, I would lower my forecast if the Governor's office explicitly states there are no plans for a special session before July.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nBefore July 1, 2025, will Florida enact legislation expanding its verification requirements of a voter's citizenship?\n\nQuestion background:\nTallahassee Democrat: [Florida may require proof of citizenship to vote under new legislation echoing Trump](https://www.tallahassee.com/story/news/local/state/2025/04/02/got-id-proof-of-citizenship-may-soon-be-needed-to-vote-in-florida/82756919007/)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if, before July 1, 2025, the state of Florida enacts legislation requiring voters to provide proof of US citizenship beyond the requirements at the time of this question, according to [credible sources](https://www.metaculus.com/faq/#definitions).\n\nAny subset of voters being required to provide such proof would count (for example if it only applied to first-time voter registrants or creating a new requirement for mail-in voters). An example of a bill that would count is [HB 831](https://www.flsenate.gov/Session/Bill/2025/831). This question resolves upon enactment; therefore other questions such as when the legislation takes effect or whether it survives court challenges and is implemented is immaterial to this question's resolution.\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nNo additional information available.\n\nToday is 2025-05-06.\n\nBefore answering you think:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n(e) You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
