    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "55 days (from May 7, 2025 to July 1, 2025)",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No - the recall remains in Active status",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "The FSIS investigation and product recovery process extends beyond July 1, 2025, as Cargill continues to track down distributed products and implement corrective actions. The thoroughness of USDA oversight and the need to verify all contaminated product has been removed from commerce keeps the recall Active past the resolution date.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Cargill successfully completes the product recall, accounts for all affected liquid egg products, implements corrective measures to prevent future contamination by cleaning solutions, and receives FSIS approval to close the recall. The investigation concludes and the status changes to Closed before July 1, 2025.",
    "rationale": "The recall was issued March 28, 2025, meaning it has been active for approximately 40 days as of today (May 7). By July 1, the recall will have been active for 95 days total (approximately 3 months). USDA/FSIS recalls typically range from 60-180 days depending on severity and complexity. This recall involves cleaning solution contamination - a serious issue but with a clear, identifiable source. Liquid egg products are primarily distributed to food service and institutional customers rather than direct to consumers, which should make tracking and recovery somewhat more straightforward than retail recalls. However, FSIS is known for thoroughness, requiring companies to demonstrate complete product recovery and implementation of corrective actions before closing recalls. At 95 days total duration, this falls within the shorter-to-moderate range of typical recall timelines. The status quo bias suggests the recall will remain open, as most government processes move slowly. However, the reasonable timeframe and relatively contained distribution channel provide meaningful probability of closure. My forecast is not higher because 95 days would be relatively fast for a contamination recall, and bureaucratic processes often extend longer. It's not lower because the timeframe is sufficient for many recalls of this type, and the clear contamination source aids swift resolution. I would update higher with evidence of rapid company response or FSIS statements indicating progress; I would update lower with news of expanded scope or complications in the investigation.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill the USDA-posted recall by Cargill Kitchen Solutions of its liquid egg product for an unapproved substance issued March 28, 2025 be closed before July 1, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nABC News: [Liquid eggs recalled due to potential cleaning solution contamination](https://abcnews.go.com/GMA/Food/liquid-eggs-recalled-due-potential-cleaning-solution-contamination/story?id=120329600)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if the status of the recall posted by the U.S. Department of Agriculture’s Food Safety and Inspection Service (FSIS) is changed from Active to Closed on [this page](https://www.fsis.usda.gov/recalls-alerts/cargill-kitchen-solutions-recalls-liquid-egg-products-due-unapproved-substance) before July 1, 2025. If the recall is still shown as Active when the link is accessed by Metaculus on or after July 1, 2025, this question resolves as **No**.\n\n\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nNo additional information available.\n\nToday is 2025-05-07.\n\nBefore answering you think:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n(e) You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
