    "review": "Both forecasters provide thoughtful analyses that largely align with my reasoning. Forecaster 2 emphasizes bureaucratic inertia and the multi-departmental review required for webpage changes, strengthening the status quo case. Forecaster 3 raises the most important new consideration: given the strict resolution criteria requiring the exact phrase 'snack foods,' even a minor editorial revision replacing it with synonyms like 'chips and crackers' or 'ready-to-eat foods' would technically resolve as No, without any substantive policy change. This is a more plausible risk than a major policy shift in 6 weeks, as it could occur during the announced late-May reorganization as simple messaging alignment. However, I find this risk somewhat limited because: (1) deliberately avoiding the exact phrase while keeping the substance would be oddly specific unless intentionally signaling policy direction, (2) standard webpage maintenance typically preserves existing terminology unless there's a reason to change it, and (3) this would still require editorial review to avoid misrepresenting current eligibility. The forecasters' range (84-90%) suggests general consensus on a strong status quo probability with modest uncertainty about administrative changes.",
    "rationale": "My original 87% forecast appropriately balanced the strong status quo factors (short timeframe, no announced changes, state-level waivers with 2026 dates, legal framework unchanged, bureaucratic inertia) against modest risks of webpage updates during the USDA reorganization. Forecaster 3's synonym point is valid and adds slightly more precision to my uncertainty estimate, but this risk was already implicitly included in my original forecast's uncertainty bounds. The three forecasts clustering between 84-90% indicates good calibration. I'm making a very slight downward adjustment to 86% to explicitly acknowledge the somewhat higher risk that a webpage refresh during the late-May reorganization could inadvertently or deliberately replace 'snack foods' with alternative phrasing, even without substantive policy changes. This remains a low-probability outcome given that such changes would need editorial review, risk confusing the public about current eligibility, and lack clear motivation absent a formal policy shift. The core analysis stands: 6 weeks is too short for major SNAP eligibility changes, and wholesale removal of snack food eligibility would be highly unusual before formal rulemaking.",
