  "information": "Saipan has become a popular destination for Korean tourists, who constituted 70% of the island's visitors in 2024. The Governor of Saipan, Arnold Palacios, has identified the Korean tourist market as a primary focus for growth and sustainability. In line with this, the Mariana Visitors Authority launched a marketing campaign titled 'This is the Marianas' for the Korean market. The 2025 Saipan Marathon attracted over 200 Korean participants out of 612 runners from 19 countries. Additionally, KB Kookmin Card initiated a promotional event for its Visa cardholders traveling to destinations including Saipan, offering discounts on flights, hotels, dining, and shopping starting from July 18.",

    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "≈42 days (about 6 weeks)",
    "status_quo_outcome": "Probably No (likely around 4 listed destinations: Guam, Seoul–Incheon, Busan, Tokyo–Narita).",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "FlightsFrom lists only Guam (GUM), Seoul–Incheon (ICN), Busan (PUS), and Tokyo–Narita (NRT) on July 1, and either inter-island commuter routes (Tinian, Rota) are not in their schedule feed or one of PUS/NRT is not operating then, with no new seasonal services added.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "FlightsFrom shows 5+ destinations because either (a) scheduled inter-island services to Tinian (TIQ) and/or Rota (ROP) appear in OAG/FlightsFrom alongside Guam and at least one of PUS/NRT, or (b) a new scheduled seasonal route (e.g., Daegu, Cheongju, Osaka, Nagoya, or Manila) is operating as of July 1.",
    "rationale": "I anchor on the current network and how FlightsFrom counts destinations. Saipan reliably has United to Guam and strong Korea links (ICN, often PUS), with NRT typically operating in peak summer. That plausibly yields four destinations. Crossing to >4 requires either inclusion of scheduled inter-island routes (TIQ/ROP) in FlightsFrom’s data or the addition of another scheduled international city by July. The Korean market is very strong—about 70% of visitors in 2024, targeted marketing, and summer travel demand—so one or more secondary Korean city routes in peak season are plausible. However, many of these have been charter/seasonal and not always reflected as scheduled in OAG/FlightsFrom, and air service to Japan beyond NRT or to the Philippines/Taiwan remains uncertain. The decisive factor may be whether FlightsFrom lists Marianas Southern Airways’ inter-island services; if they are present, a Yes is very likely; if not, it probably stays at four unless a new seasonal route appears. This is why I’m modestly above 50%. Why not higher: uncertainty over FlightsFrom’s inclusion of TIQ/ROP and the fragility/seasonality of secondary routes (PUS/NRT could be reduced or off on the exact date). Why not lower: multiple established routes (GUM, ICN, likely PUS, likely NRT) make four quite robust, and it only takes one more (either inter-island listing or a new seasonal city) to reach five. Updates that would move me up: confirmation on FlightsFrom that TIQ/ROP are listed; firm schedules showing both PUS and NRT operating July 1; announcements of scheduled (not charter-only) services from a Korean secondary city or a Japanese city like KIX/NGO. Updates that would move me down: evidence that NRT or PUS are not operating around July 1, or that FlightsFrom does not list inter-island routes.",
