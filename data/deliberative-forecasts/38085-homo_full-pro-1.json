    "review": "The two other forecasters and I agree on the core drivers of this question: the high starting point of 14.5 million residents in drought versus the significant potential for rapid change due to the onset of Florida's rainy and hurricane season in June. Forecaster 2 (80%) emphasizes the inertia of the severe drought, arguing that a 500,000-person buffer is substantial and unlikely to be erased in just one month. Forecaster 3 (65%) provides a compelling counterpoint by framing the 500,000-person buffer as 'relatively close to the threshold.' This argument is what I found most persuasive and had not fully weighted in my initial analysis. It highlights that we don't need to end the drought entirely, but merely improve conditions for a relatively small percentage (~3.4%) of the currently affected population. This could plausibly happen if soaking rains from daily thunderstorms or a tropical system were to target one of Florida's major population centers, such as Miami-Dade or the Tampa Bay area.",
    "rationale": "After reviewing my peers' analyses, I am adjusting my forecast slightly downward. My initial forecast of 75% was anchored on the severity of the current drought and the NOAA forecast for its persistence. While these are strong points, Forecaster 3's analysis convinced me that I was underestimating the fragility of the 500,000-person buffer. This number of people represents a fraction of the population of a single major metropolitan area. Florida's rainy season, which begins June 1, is characterized by powerful, often localized, thunderstorms that can deliver significant rainfall. The primary mechanism for a 'No' outcome is not necessarily a full-blown hurricane, but could simply be a persistent pattern of wet weather over a densely populated region. The fact that the resolution period coincides perfectly with this major seasonal shift in weather patterns introduces significant volatility. I am not moving as low as Forecaster 3's 65% because I still believe the inertia of a severe, widespread drought and the specific NOAA persistence forecast are powerful factors favoring the 'Yes' outcome. However, I now see a more plausible path to 'No' than I did initially. Therefore, I am lowering my probability from 75% to 70% to better reflect the significant uncertainty and the relatively small margin that needs to be overcome to flip the result.",
