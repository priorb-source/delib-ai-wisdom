    "status_quo_outcome": "The Democratic primary for Lieutenant Governor is a competitive, open race. State Senator Aaron Rouse is a prominent candidate, but no clear front-runner has been established in the field.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Another candidate, such as Babur Lateef, consolidates the powerful Northern Virginia Democratic voting bloc and outperforms Rouse in other key areas like the Richmond suburbs, thereby winning the nomination.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Aaron Rouse leverages his higher statewide name recognition from his professional football career and his key 2023 special election victory to build a broad coalition, winning his home base in Hampton Roads and performing strongly enough in other regions to secure the nomination.",
    "rationale": "This is a competitive two-way primary race, making the outcome uncertain. My forecast gives a moderate edge to Aaron Rouse based on his existing statewide name recognition, which is a significant asset in a lower-information primary for a statewide office. His background as a former NFL player and his victory in a high-profile, hard-fought State Senate special election in 2023 have given him a public profile that is difficult for a challenger like Babur Lateef, a regional school board chair, to match in a relatively short time. Rouse has a strong geographic base in the populous Hampton Roads region and has proven his ability to win in a competitive environment.\n\nHowever, the probability is not higher because Virginia Democratic primaries are often decided by turnout in Northern Virginia (NoVA), which is Babur Lateef's home base. If Lateef can successfully consolidate the NoVA vote, he has a very clear path to victory, as that region can account for a substantial portion of the entire primary electorate. Without reliable public polling or fundraising data, the strength of this regional advantage is difficult to quantify but must be respected as a major factor that could lead to a Rouse loss.\n\nThe forecast is not lower than 60% because Rouse's profile appears better suited for a statewide run than Lateef's, and in the absence of other information, a candidate with higher name ID and a proven win in a swing district holds a tangible, albeit not decisive, advantage. The research assistant's report providing no additional information means this forecast is based on these political fundamentals.\n\nI would increase the probability for Rouse if he secures major endorsements from figures outside his home region, particularly from Northern Virginia, or if fundraising reports show a significant financial advantage. Conversely, I would decrease the probability if polling shows Lateef with a lead or if Lateef secures endorsements that signal a consolidation of the party establishment around his candidacy.",

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
