  "information": "The 13-year gas transmission agreement between Bulgaria’s state-owned gas company Bulgargaz and Turkey’s BOTAŞ was signed in January 2023. The contract includes a 'take or pay' clause, obligating Bulgargaz to pay approximately $580,000 per day regardless of whether it uses the reserved capacity. Since July 2024, Bulgargaz has ceased payments, accumulating a debt reported to be around 4 billion leva (approximately €2 billion). Bulgarian officials have stated the company does not have the financial capacity to pay this debt, and Bulgargaz reportedly expects to incur a loss of 280 million leva in 2024.\n\nBulgarian Prime Minister Boyko Borissov has publicly stated to Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan that 'Bulgaria Needs Out of the Botas Gas Deal.' Former Bulgarian Deputy Energy Minister Zhecho Stankov stated that termination of the contract is blocked until the outstanding debt is fully settled. Despite the public statements, talks between the two countries as of May 2, 2025, focused on price and capacity renegotiation rather than outright cancellation. Turkey has publicly maintained a stance of viewing Bulgaria as a strategic partner and has opposed cancellation.\n\nIn early June 2025, Russian energy company Gazprom abandoned its plan to build a major gas distribution hub in Turkey. Reports cited insufficient pipeline capacity from Turkey to Greece and Bulgaria as a key reason for the project's lack of feasibility. Separately, Bulgaria has pursued other energy initiatives, signing gas exploration and drilling agreements with Shell and NewMed for blocks in the Black Sea. Bulgaria also has reserved 1 billion cubic meters of gas per year from the Alexandroupolis LNG terminal in Greece.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "25 days remain until July 1, 2025",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No cancellation - the agreement remains in force despite non-payment and ongoing disputes",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Negotiations continue through June 2025 focused on renegotiating price and capacity terms rather than cancellation. Turkey refuses to cancel given the €2 billion debt owed, and Bulgaria cannot unilaterally escape due to the debt obligations. The parties continue trying to find a renegotiated solution while the agreement technically remains active.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Either Bulgaria announces unilateral cancellation of the agreement (even if Turkey disputes this), or Turkey cancels due to continued non-payment, or both parties reach a mutual termination agreement. The severe financial crisis at Bulgargaz forces a decisive action, possibly combined with a debt restructuring or settlement arrangement.",
    "rationale": "The status quo strongly favors No. Despite 11 months of non-payment since July 2024 and accumulation of approximately €2 billion in debt, the agreement has not been cancelled. Most critically, the most recent talks in May 2025 focused on renegotiation rather than cancellation. Former Deputy Energy Minister Stankov explicitly stated that termination is blocked until the debt is settled, and Turkey maintains opposition to cancellation while viewing Bulgaria as a strategic partner. Turkey has strong financial incentives to keep the agreement alive to recover its debt. With only 25 days remaining and no indication of breakthrough or imminent announcements, the historical pattern suggests this will continue as a protracted renegotiation. However, the probability is not negligible because: (1) Bulgaria's public statements indicate strong desire to exit, (2) the financial situation is genuinely unsustainable with Bulgargaz facing potential bankruptcy, (3) the question allows for unilateral announcement by either party even if disputed, and (4) 25 days is technically sufficient time for a dramatic policy shift. The forecast is not higher because there are no signs of imminent action and Turkey's opposition appears firm. It's not lower because the financial crisis is severe enough that a breaking point could occur, and political pressure in Bulgaria is mounting.",

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
