  "information": "Historical changes to the Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA) are infrequent. In February 2024, Intel and Walgreens were replaced. In August 2020, Exxon Mobil, Pfizer, and Raytheon Technologies were replaced by Salesforce, Amgen, and Honeywell. In June 2018, General Electric was replaced by Walgreens Boots Alliance, and in March 2015, AT&T was replaced by Apple.\n\nSeveral DJIA components have experienced recent negative performance and events. UnitedHealth Group's stock dropped 22%, causing a record 805-point single-stock decline in the DJIA. In March 2025, Nike's stock dropped 20.1%, Walt Disney's fell 13.3%, and Nvidia's declined 13.2%. IBM shares fell 7.6% after the company announced the cancellation of 15 government contracts. IBM (-6.6%) and Procter & Gamble (-3.7%) have also experienced recent losses.\n\nThe broader US stock market is experiencing significant volatility driven by corporate earnings, trade policy uncertainty, and economic indicators. President Trump's tariffs sparked a 2,200-point drop in the DJIA on April 4, 2025. In response to the impact of tariffs, Deutsche Bank strategists cut their year-end S&P 500 target by 12%. The Federal Reserve is described as cautious due to persistent inflation.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Approximately 2 months and 6 days remain until July 1, 2025",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No companies are dropped from the DJIA, and the current 30-component composition remains unchanged through the resolution date",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Despite recent market volatility and individual stock declines, the S&P Dow Jones Indices committee determines that no changes to the index composition are warranted. The underperforming stocks either stabilize or the committee decides that short-term volatility doesn't justify a component change. The index maintains its current composition through July 1, 2025",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "One or more severely underperforming components—such as UnitedHealth Group (down 22%), Nike (down 20%), IBM (after contract cancellations), or Disney—continues to decline or faces additional negative developments. The DJIA committee announces a replacement to better reflect market conditions or the modern economy, similar to how they replaced Intel just 15 months ago in February 2024",
    "rationale": "Historical data shows DJIA changes are infrequent, occurring roughly every 1.5-4 years. The most recent change was February 2024 (15 months ago) when Intel and Walgreens were replaced. While this recent timeline somewhat reduces the probability of another imminent change, it doesn't preclude one—especially given current market conditions.\n\nSeveral components have experienced significant recent declines: UnitedHealth (-22%), Nike (-20.1%), Disney (-13.3%), and IBM (-7.6% plus contract cancellations). However, single-stock drops alone don't automatically trigger removal. The DJIA committee considers sustained performance, market capitalization, sector representation, and overall economic relevance.\n\nKey factors limiting the probability: (1) Changes are genuinely rare; (2) The last change was relatively recent; (3) Current volatility affects the broader market, not just individual companies; (4) Recently added components like Nvidia (added Feb 2024) are extremely unlikely to be removed so soon; (5) None of the declines represent existential crises like bankruptcy.\n\nFactors supporting some probability: (1) We have 2+ months for an announcement; (2) Multiple components showing weakness simultaneously; (3) High market volatility creates conditions where the committee might act; (4) Historical precedent shows changes can happen when needed.\n\nThe forecast would increase if: credible reports emerge of committee discussions, a component faces bankruptcy/major scandal, or multiple components continue severe underperformance. It would decrease if: we get closer to July 1 without signals, or if stressed stocks recover significantly.\n\nThe status quo strongly favors no change, but the combination of poor individual performance, extended time horizon, and demonstrated willingness to make changes (2024 precedent) justifies a modest probability",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill any of these companies get dropped from the Dow Jones Industrial Average before July 1, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nOregon Business: [Intel Ousted From Dow Jones By Rival Nvidia](https://oregonbusiness.com/intel-ousted-from-dow-jones-by-rival-nvidia/)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if before July 1, 2025, there is any official announcement or confirmation (or credible source reporting) that any of the following companies will no longer be a component of the Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA) either on the official announcement or that the company has been or will be removed from the index: Amazon.com Inc, American Express Co, Amgen Inc, Apple Inc, Boeing Co, Caterpillar Inc, Cisco Systems Inc, Chevron Corp, Goldman Sachs Group Inc, Home Depot Inc, Honeywell International Inc, International Business Machines Corp, Johnson & Johnson, Coca-Cola Co, JPMorgan Chase & Co, McDonald’s Corp, 3M Co, Merck & Co Inc, Microsoft Corp, Nike Inc, Procter & Gamble Co, Sherwin-Williams Co, Travelers Companies Inc, Unitedhealth Group Inc, Salesforce Inc, NVIDIA Corp, Verizon Communications Inc, Visa Inc, Walmart Inc, Walt Disney Co.\n\nAlthough removals from the index are generally effective immediately in order to forestall frontrunning, this is not a requirement for this question. All that is required is for there to be an announcement or confirmation before the resolution date about the removal from the DJIA at any point in time. Therefore this question will resolve based on the announcement or confirmation, not on the actual removal date.\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nHistorical changes to the Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA) are infrequent.

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
