    "review": "The other two forecasters and I share a core thesis: the reported 'plunge' in May sentiment creates significant downward momentum, making a 'No' outcome (<= 60.0) the baseline scenario. We all agree that consumer sentiment has inertia. However, both other forecasters arrived at a slightly higher probability for 'Yes' (45% and 40% vs. my initial 35%), and their reasoning is persuasive. Forecaster 3 made a particularly compelling point that I had not fully weighted: we don't know the quantitative starting point. The 'plunge' could have been from a high level to one still just above 60.0 (e.g., 75 to 63). This is a critical uncertainty, as it changes the requirement from a 'rebound' to mere 'stabilization' to achieve a 'Yes' outcome. Forecaster 2 added helpful detail by highlighting the specific timing of potential catalysts like the May CPI report, which will be released during the June survey period and could easily sway the final number.",
    "rationale": "My initial forecast of 35% was heavily influenced by the negative momentum implied by the word 'plunge,' assuming this had likely pushed the May index below the 60.0 threshold already. The other forecasters' analyses have convinced me that I was likely overconfident in that assumption. Specifically, Forecaster 3's argument about the uncertainty of the May reading's absolute level is a crucial consideration I had undervalued. If the May index settled slightly above 60, the probability of the June index also remaining above 60 is considerably higher than if it had to recover from the high 50s. This uncertainty warrants increasing the probability of a 'Yes' outcome. While I still believe the downward momentum makes 'No' the more probable outcome, I am adjusting my forecast upward to better reflect the ambiguity of the starting point. I am increasing my forecast by 5 percentage points, from 35% to 40%.",
