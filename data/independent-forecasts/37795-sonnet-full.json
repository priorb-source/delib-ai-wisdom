  "information": "As of mid-May 2025, the Colorado Rockies held a record of 8-38, equivalent to a .174 winning percentage. Their run differential was -128. The team's pitching staff ranked last in the league with a 5.80 ERA and a 1.599 WHIP. Offensively, they had the league's worst On-base Plus Slugging (OPS), the most strikeouts at 418, a low walk rate of 7.7%, and a low home run rate of 2.3%. The next-worst team in the league at the time, the Chicago White Sox, had a winning percentage approximately 112 points higher at .286.\n\nThe Rockies' 7-36 record through their first 43 games marked one of the worst starts in Major League Baseball's modern era. The team was on pace to finish the season with a 26-136 record, which would surpass the record for most losses in a season set by the 2024 Chicago White Sox (121 losses). Notable losses included a 21-0 defeat to the San Diego Padres, part of a three-game stretch where they allowed 55 runs, the most by any MLB team in a similar span since 1950. This followed seasons with 103 losses in 2023 and 101 in 2024. Pre-season PECOTA projections had forecast a .343 winning percentage for the Rockies in 2025.\n\nDuring the season, the Rockies' manager Bud Black was fired and replaced by Warren Schaeffer. Hitting coach Jordan Pacheco was also part of the new staff. On May 18, 2025, the team achieved a 14-12 comeback win against the Arizona Diamondbacks, which was their first victory under Schaeffer. A key contributor to this win was shortstop Ezequiel Tovar, who had recently returned from injury and went 5-for-5 with his first home run of the season. The team's upcoming schedule before June 15 included games against several high-performing teams.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "27 days (from May 19, 2025 to June 15, 2025)",
    "status_quo_outcome": "Yes - the Rockies maintain the lowest winning percentage in MLB",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "The Rockies would need to dramatically improve their performance (winning at a .400+ clip) while simultaneously another team like the White Sox collapses completely. Given the 112-point gap in winning percentage and only 27 days remaining, this would require the Rockies to go something like 18-9 while the White Sox go 2-21, which is extremely unlikely.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "The Rockies continue performing at or near their current pace (.174 winning percentage). Even with modest improvement to a .250-.300 pace due to the managerial change and Tovar's return from injury, the 112-point cushion over the next-worst team means they would almost certainly remain the worst team in baseball through June 15.",
    "rationale": "The Rockies currently sit at 8-38 (.174), which represents one of the worst starts in modern MLB history. The gap to the next-worst team (White Sox at .286) is enormous at 112 points. With approximately 27 games remaining until June 15, the mathematical reality strongly favors the status quo. Even if the Rockies improve significantly to a .300 pace going forward (winning 8 of 27 games), they'd finish around 16-57 (.219). For them to NOT have the worst record, another team would need to fall below this level, which would require the White Sox or another team to experience a catastrophic collapse (going roughly 3-20 or worse) in less than a month. While there are some positive signs - the recent 14-12 comeback win, new manager Warren Schaeffer, and Ezequiel Tovar's return from injury - these are unlikely to generate enough improvement to close such a massive gap. The team's fundamentals remain league-worst across pitching (5.80 ERA, 1.599 WHIP) and offense (worst OPS, most strikeouts). The upcoming schedule includes tough opponents, making a dramatic turnaround even less likely. Historical precedent matters: teams don't typically overcome 112-point deficits in winning percentage within 27 days. The new manager bounce could provide modest improvement, but the sample size is just one game. Baseball has inherent variance, and a month provides some room for unexpected developments, which prevents me from going above 90%. However, the gap is so large and the time frame so short that this is a very high-confidence forecast favoring Yes.",
