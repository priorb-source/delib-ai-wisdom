    "yes_outcome_scenario": "The Secret Service determines the seashells post ('86 47') constitutes a threat against President Trump (47th president). Federal prosecutors file charges, and Comey is formally arrested before July 1, 2025, either at his home or after surrendering to authorities.",
    "rationale": "The question hinges on an active Secret Service investigation into Comey's social media post showing seashells spelling '86 47' - interpreted as a reference to eliminating the 47th president. However, several factors make arrest highly unlikely: (1) Base rate - arrests of former FBI directors are virtually unprecedented in U.S. history; (2) Legal bar - First Amendment protections require a 'true threat' standard, and artistic expression with seashells is far more ambiguous than direct threatening language; (3) Time constraint - only 32 days remain, requiring investigation completion, prosecutorial decision, and actual arrest execution; (4) Political optics - arresting a prominent critic would face intense legal scrutiny and potential backlash. Secret Service inquiries into social media posts rarely result in arrests of high-profile figures, particularly when the expression is symbolic rather than explicit. While the investigation's existence creates non-zero probability, and the current politically charged environment could theoretically accelerate action, the overwhelming likelihood is that this investigation either finds insufficient evidence of a true threat or concludes without prosecution. My forecast is not higher because: there's an active investigation creating some risk, and technically any arrest for any reason counts. My forecast is not lower because: the investigation is real and ongoing, political tensions are elevated, and we're dealing with a compressed timeframe where unexpected developments could occur. To move my forecast significantly higher, I would need evidence of: imminent charges being filed, prosecutors signaling intent to arrest, or legal precedent for similar cases. To move it lower, I would need: investigation closure announcements or public statements indicating no threat was found.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill James Comey be arrested before July 1, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\n[Secret Service Is Asking Comey About a Photo of Seashells Spelling ‘86 47’](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/16/us/politics/secret-service-comey-social-media-trump.html)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if former FBI director James Comey is arrested before July 1, 2025, according to [credible sources](https://www.metaculus.com/faq/#definitions).\n\nIn order to streamline this question's resolution, please note that an arrest anywhere in the world, for any reason, will resolve this question as Yes. For purposes of this question, we define \"arrest\" using the definition [posted at Nolo](https://www.nolo.com/legal-encyclopedia/justifies-arrest-probable-cause.html): \"An arrest requires taking someone into custody, against that person's will, in order to prosecute or interrogate. It involves a physical application of force, or submission to an officer's show of force. In sum, the arrestee must not be free to leave. Whether the act by the police is termed an arrest under state law is not relevant. When deciding whether someone has been arrested, courts apply the 'reasonable man' standard. This means asking whether a reasonable person, in the shoes of the defendant, would have concluded that he or she was not free to leave.\"\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nNo additional information available.\n\nToday is 2025-05-30.\n\nBefore answering you think:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n(e) You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
