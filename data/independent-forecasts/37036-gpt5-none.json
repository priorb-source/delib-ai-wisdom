    "rationale": "- Current information: As of April 3, 2025, reporting indicates Dan Osborn is exploring a bid against Sen. Pete Ricketts. No announcement has been made yet, and my research assistant provided no additional updates beyond that. \n- Time horizon: ~5.5 weeks remain. That’s enough time for a planned rollout, but many 2026 contenders announce later in 2025 to time fundraising, staffing, and media cycles. \n- Base rates and timing norms: After a public “exploring” signal, a formal announcement often follows within weeks or months, but for an election more than a year away, it’s common to delay until late summer/fall. This pushes the probability below 50% within this specific, short window. \n- Candidate-specific factors: Osborn appears to have recent statewide infrastructure and name ID (from his 2024 run), which raises the chance of an earlier declaration relative to a first-time candidate. On the other hand, challenging a well-funded incumbent may require careful resource planning, creating incentives to hold off. \nWhy not higher? With no visible signs of an imminent launch (e.g., scheduled announcement event, staff hires, teasers, or FEC Statement of Candidacy), and given that 2026 is still distant, the default is delay. \nWhy not lower? A credible media report that he’s actively exploring, combined with his prior run and existing profile, makes a pre–June 1 launch plausible rather than remote. \nWhat would move me up: Evidence of a planned rollout (dated event invites in May, clear public hints, key staff hires, FEC Statement of Candidacy, escalated fundraising comms). \nWhat would move me down: Public statements downplaying a run, endorsement of another candidate, fundraising or organizational setbacks, or silence through mid-May.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill Dan Osborn announce his candidacy for US Senator from Nebraska before June 1, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nNebraska Examiner: [Nebraska’s Dan Osborn exploring midterm bid against U.S. Sen Pete Ricketts](https://nebraskaexaminer.com/2025/04/03/nebraskas-dan-osborn-exploring-midterm-bid-against-u-s-sen-pete-ricketts/)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if Dan Osborn announces his candidacy for US Senator from Nebraska before June 1, 2025. If no such announcement has been made before that date, the question resolves as **No**.\n\n\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nNo additional information available.\n\nToday is 2025-04-23.\n\nBefore answering you think:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n(e) You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
