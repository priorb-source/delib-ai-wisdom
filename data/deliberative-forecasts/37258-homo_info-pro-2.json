    "review": "All three forecasters independently arrived at the same initial probability of 5%, indicating a strong consensus on the key drivers of this question. I found the other analysts' reasoning highly convincing as they introduced crucial, specific points I had not fully weighted. Forecaster 2 rightly emphasized the structural constraints of the 2022 UK Supreme Court ruling and the internal political dynamics of the ongoing SNP leadership transition, which would naturally command the party's focus. Forecaster 3 provided exceptional near-term context, highlighting the by-election 'quiet period' from mid-May to early June and the looming threat of council worker strikes. These are not abstract difficulties but concrete, time-bound events that severely constrict the political calendar and make a major constitutional announcement before July 1 not only strategically unwise but practically difficult.",
    "rationale": "I am lowering my forecast from 5% to 2%. While my initial analysis correctly identified the short timeframe and shifting government priorities as major barriers, the other forecasters' arguments have convinced me that the probability is even lower. Their specific evidence paints a picture of a Scottish government that is operationally and politically boxed in. The key new factors strengthening the case for a 'No' resolution are: 1) The SNP leadership transition, which forces the party to focus inwards on unity and strategy rather than outwards on a high-risk constitutional gambit. 2) The by-election 'quiet period' through late May and early June, which effectively removes several weeks from the already minuscule window for an announcement. 3) The concurrent threat of major industrial action, which creates a domestic policy crisis that would make a referendum announcement appear politically tone-deaf. These factors, combined with the pre-existing legal barrier from the Supreme Court, create a powerful convergence of constraints. An announcement is now not just unlikely, but would require the Scottish government to ignore immediate political, legal, and operational crises. I am maintaining a very low probability of 2% to account for a highly improbable 'black swan' event or a politically desperate symbolic gesture, but the path to a 'Yes' resolution is now exceptionally narrow.",
