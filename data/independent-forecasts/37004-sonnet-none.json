    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "The 2025 Canadian federal election is expected to take place in the fall of 2025, likely September or October, which is approximately 5-6 months from now. The exact date has not been set yet but will be determined by either a scheduled election or earlier dissolution.",
    "status_quo_outcome": "Based on polling trends leading up to April 2025, the status quo strongly suggests a Conservative Party popular vote victory. The Conservatives under Pierre Poilievre have maintained consistent and substantial polling leads over the Liberal Party throughout late 2024 and early 2025, typically ranging from 5-15 percentage points ahead.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "The Conservatives fail to win the popular vote if the Liberal Party stages a significant comeback during the campaign period. This could occur through effective campaigning, a major policy announcement addressing key voter concerns like housing affordability, a Conservative scandal, or if the economy shows marked improvement that benefits the incumbent government. Alternatively, vote splitting among conservative-leaning voters could reduce the Conservative total, though this is less likely.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "The Conservatives win the popular vote by maintaining their current polling advantage through the election. This outcome is supported by sustained voter dissatisfaction with the Liberal government, concerns about cost of living and housing affordability that typically favor opposition parties, Pierre Poilievre's strong performance as opposition leader, and the Conservatives running an effective campaign that consolidates their support base and appeals to swing voters.",
    "rationale": "The Conservative Party appears strongly positioned to win the popular vote based on consistent polling data showing substantial leads. Multiple polling firms have reported Conservative advantages throughout recent months, suggesting this is not a polling artifact but reflects genuine voter sentiment. Key factors supporting this forecast include persistent economic concerns (inflation, housing) that disadvantage incumbent governments, relatively strong Conservative Party organization and messaging, and historical patterns where sustained opposition leads of this magnitude typically translate to popular vote victories. However, I'm not forecasting higher (85-90%) because campaigns matter significantly and can shift voter preferences, polling can contain systematic errors, there are still 5-6 months for circumstances to change, and governments have comeback mechanisms through policy changes or leadership renewal. I'm not forecasting lower (50-60%) because the Conservative lead has been remarkably stable over an extended period, appears in multiple independent polls, and the magnitude of the lead provides a substantial buffer against normal campaign fluctuations. For me to revise upward, I would need to see the Conservative lead widening further or more definitive evidence that voter preferences are hardening. To revise downward, I would need evidence of Liberal momentum, significant Conservative missteps, major external events favoring the government, or polling showing a tightening race.",
