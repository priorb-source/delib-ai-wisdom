    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Approximately 2-4 weeks until the June 2025 FATF Plenary meeting occurs and results are announced",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No changes are made to the grey list, and all 25 currently listed jurisdictions (Algeria, Angola, Bulgaria, Burkina Faso, Cameroon, Côte d'Ivoire, Croatia, Democratic Republic of Congo, Haiti, Kenya, Laos, Lebanon, Mali, Monaco, Mozambique, Namibia, Nepal, Nigeria, South Africa, South Sudan, Syria, Tanzania, Venezuela, Vietnam, and Yemen) remain on the list",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "The June 2025 plenary concludes with no jurisdictions being added to or removed from the grey list. All countries under increased monitoring maintain their current status, with none completing their action plans sufficiently for removal and no new jurisdictions identified as having strategic AML/CFT deficiencies requiring grey list designation",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "At least one jurisdiction is either added to or removed from the grey list following the June 2025 plenary. This could involve one or more countries successfully completing their action plans and being removed (similar to the Philippines in February 2025), or new jurisdictions being added due to identified strategic deficiencies (similar to Laos and Nepal in February 2025), or both additions and removals occurring",
    "rationale": "The research assistant noted that changes occurred as recently as February 2025, when the Philippines was removed and Laos and Nepal were added to the grey list. This demonstrates that FATF actively updates the list at plenary meetings, which typically occur three times per year. With 25 jurisdictions currently on the grey list, there are numerous candidates for potential changes. Countries are placed on the grey list specifically because they've committed to action plans to address strategic deficiencies, creating inherent dynamism as jurisdictions work toward removal. The base rate for changes appears relatively high - FATF regularly adds and removes jurisdictions as part of its monitoring process. The large number of monitored jurisdictions increases the probability that at least one will either complete its commitments or be newly identified for concerns. The recent February 2025 changes suggest ongoing active monitoring and willingness to make updates. My forecast is not higher (85-95%) because there remains meaningful uncertainty - not every plenary meeting results in changes, and it's possible no country completes sufficient progress while no new deficiencies are identified by June. My forecast is not lower (40-60%) because the combination of 25 monitored jurisdictions, the dynamic nature of action plan completion, recent February changes showing momentum, and FATF's active monitoring role all point toward a relatively high probability of at least one change. I would update higher if I learned of specific countries near completion of their action plans or new jurisdictions under review for grey listing. I would update lower if I learned that most current grey list countries are early in their action plans with minimal progress expected by June",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill any jurisdictions be added to or removed from the FATF \"grey list\" following the FATF Plenary meeting in June 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nAML Intelligence (February 2025) [UPDATE: Philippines removed from FATF ‘grey list’ as Laos, Nepal added to watchlist](https://www.amlintelligence.com/2025/02/breaking-fatf-grey-list-update-laos-and-nepal-added-the-philippines-removed/)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if following its June 2025 plenary, the Financial Action Task Force (FATF) has made any changes to its \"Jurisdictions under Increased Monitoring\" list, which at the time of this question consists of Algeria, Angola, Bulgaria, Burkina Faso, Cameroon, Côte d'Ivoire, Croatia, the Democratic Republic of Congo, Haiti, Kenya, the Lao People's Democratic Republic, Lebanon, Mali, Monaco, Mozambique, Namibia, Nepal, Nigeria, South Africa, South Sudan, Syria, Tanzania, Venezuela, Vietnam, and Yemen. Resolves according to the [official list](https://www.fatf-gafi.org/en/countries/black-and-grey-lists.html).\n\nThe question may resolve according to [credible sources](https://www.metaculus.com/help/faq/#definitions) in case the website is unavailable or not timely updated.\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nNo additional information available.\n\nToday is 2025-05-19.\n\nBefore answering you think:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n(e) You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
