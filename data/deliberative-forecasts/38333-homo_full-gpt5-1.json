    "review": "Both forecasters largely align with my prior read: the remaining window is short, the lack of pre-launch tells is salient, and Donalds’ Trump endorsement depresses Suarez’s near-term incentive. The most useful added emphasis is that an interview-only announcement would satisfy resolution criteria (lowering the logistical bar) and that a June launch could grab a Q2 fundraising headline. Conversely, the point that serious statewide launches usually telegraph weeks in advance strengthens the case for a low near‑term hazard rate. Net, these arguments mostly reinforce a modestly-below-one-in-four probability; the telegraphing argument nudges me slightly down, while the Q2 headline angle prevents a steeper cut.",
    "rationale": "We have ~26 days until the deadline. Status quo is No: there are no filings, no staff hires or venue leaks, and no credible launch reports—typical preconditions for statewide rollouts. The competitive landscape (Donalds already in with Trump’s backing; uncertainty about Casey DeSantis/Gaetz/Nuñez) reduces Suarez’s incentive to rush. His polling (~5%) suggests limited current base. A Yes remains plausible because (1) June is within the historical 12–18 month window, (2) a media-only announcement would count without much prep, and (3) he could seek a Q2 fundraising splash. Offsetting that, the absence of any visible ramp and the donor deterrent effect of Trump’s endorsement argue against a sudden jump. The Miami election-timing/term-extension wrinkle also tilts toward delay. Balancing these, I trim slightly from my prior 22% to reflect the weight of non-signals and consolidation around a rival, while keeping probability above very low due to the ease of a media announcement and the live timing window.",
