  "information": "Several public figures have called for legal action against James Comey. General Michael Flynn predicted that Comey will be indicted. The InfoWars platform cited alleged Department of Justice sources claiming Comey's indictment is 'imminent.' Fox News Legal Analyst Gregg Jarrett stated that Comey could be prosecuted for the post. Current FBI Director Chris Wray reported that the agency has faced a surge in threats against Donald Trump following Comey's post, requiring agents to be diverted from other cases.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Approximately 32 days until July 1, 2025",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No arrest - Comey remains free while any investigation continues",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "The Secret Service investigation concludes without sufficient evidence for arrest, determines the post is protected speech, or legal processes extend beyond July 1 without resulting in custody. Even if charges are contemplated, DOJ may issue a summons to appear rather than arrest, or delays in legal proceedings push any action past the deadline.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "The Secret Service and DOJ rapidly conclude their investigation, determine Comey's post constitutes a credible threat or criminal violation, and execute an arrest within the next 32 days. Prosecutors decide immediate custody is warranted despite Comey being a former high-ranking official who poses minimal flight risk.",
    "rationale": "This forecast spans a very compressed timeframe of only 32 days. While there is an active Secret Service investigation and public calls for action, several factors strongly argue against arrest by July 1. First, arrests of former FBI directors are extraordinarily rare events requiring compelling evidence and careful legal review. The alleged offense (a social media post with seashells spelling '86 47') is ambiguous and potentially defensible as protected speech. Second, even motivated prosecutors typically require months, not weeks, to build cases against high-profile defendants. Third, the sources claiming 'imminent' indictment (InfoWars, General Flynn) lack strong track records for accuracy. Fourth, even an indictment doesn't guarantee arrest - prosecutors often allow prominent figures to surrender voluntarily rather than arresting them. The research assistant's report confirms investigation activity and security concerns, but provides no evidence of grand jury proceedings, charges filed, or imminent law enforcement action. Historical base rates show that investigations of prominent political figures rarely result in arrests, and when they do, the process takes considerably longer than one month. My probability would increase substantially with evidence of sealed indictments, grand jury activity, or DOJ statements indicating imminent charges. It would decrease if the Secret Service closed the investigation or legal experts provided consensus that the post is clearly protected speech. The status quo strongly favors no arrest.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill James Comey be arrested before July 1, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\n[Secret Service Is Asking Comey About a Photo of Seashells Spelling ‘86 47’](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/16/us/politics/secret-service-comey-social-media-trump.html)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if former FBI director James Comey is arrested before July 1, 2025, according to [credible sources](https://www.metaculus.com/faq/#definitions).\n\nIn order to streamline this question's resolution, please note that an arrest anywhere in the world, for any reason, will resolve this question as Yes. For purposes of this question, we define \"arrest\" using the definition [posted at Nolo](https://www.nolo.com/legal-encyclopedia/justifies-arrest-probable-cause.html): \"An arrest requires taking someone into custody, against that person's will, in order to prosecute or interrogate. It involves a physical application of force, or submission to an officer's show of force. In sum, the arrestee must not be free to leave. Whether the act by the police is termed an arrest under state law is not relevant. When deciding whether someone has been arrested, courts apply the 'reasonable man' standard. This means asking whether a reasonable person, in the shoes of the defendant, would have concluded that he or she was not free to leave.\"\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nSeveral public figures have called for legal action against James Comey.

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
