    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "2 months (until July 1, 2025)",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No - no agreement announced",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "The ongoing negotiations between Vietnam and South Korea continue but fail to reach a formal announcement before the July 1 deadline. This could occur due to bureaucratic delays, technical specifications requiring additional consideration, political sensitivities given this would be Korea's first defense arms sale to Vietnam, or the parties simply needing more time to finalize details of the $300 million deal.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "The negotiations for the 20 K9 self-propelled howitzers are at an advanced stage, with only final approvals needed. Both governments announce the agreement in late May or June 2025, marking a historic moment as South Korea's first defense export to Vietnam and demonstrating the strengthening strategic partnership between the two nations.",
    "rationale": "This forecast requires balancing the positive signal from reported active negotiations against the challenging timeline and complexity of the deal. The Korea Herald article indicates real momentum with specific details (20 units, $300M), suggesting negotiations are substantive. However, several factors favor the status quo (no announcement): (1) Only 2 months remain until the deadline, which is a tight window for a major defense agreement; (2) This would be Korea's FIRST defense arms sale to Vietnam, likely creating additional complexity with novel legal frameworks, political considerations, and technical arrangements to establish; (3) International defense procurement typically involves lengthy approval processes, export licenses, and parliamentary/governmental reviews; (4) The research assistant found no additional updates suggesting an imminent announcement; (5) The phrase 'reportedly in negotiations' suggests this has not been officially confirmed. The probability is not higher because there's no evidence of urgent timeline or imminent conclusion. It's not lower because the negotiations appear real with specific parameters, and 2 months technically could be sufficient if all parties prioritized rapid conclusion. To update higher, I would need: reports of advanced negotiations nearing completion, official statements about timeline, or draft agreements being finalized. To update lower, I would need: reports of stalled talks, political opposition, or any indication negotiations remain in early stages.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill Vietnam and South Korea announce an agreement for South Korea to export self-propelled howitzers to Vietnam?\n\nQuestion background:\nThe Korea Herald: [South Korea-Vietnam ties enter new strategic terrain, but need more detailed road map: Seoul envoy](https://www.koreaherald.com/article/10464718) \"Vietnam is reportedly in negotiations to import 20 units of K9 self-propelled howitzers from Korea in a deal valued at $300 million. If finalized, it would mark Korea’s first defense arms sale to the country.\"\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if, before July 1, 2025, the governments of Vietnam and/or South Korea announce an agreement for South Korea to export 2 or more self-propelled howitzers to Vietnam. If no such agreement is announced after the launch of this question and before July 1, 2025, this question resolves as **No**.\n\n\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nNo additional information available.\n\nToday is 2025-05-01.\n\nBefore answering you think:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n(e) You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
