    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Approximately 3 weeks. The data for the week ended June 21 is typically released on the following Thursday, June 26, 2025.",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No. The status quo is a continuation of the resilient labor market seen over the past year, with initial claims hovering in a stable and historically low range, making a print at or below 220,000 a very plausible outcome.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "The US economy continues its 'soft landing' trajectory. Businesses, confident in stable consumer demand and easing financial conditions, retain their workforce. No major sector-specific or macroeconomic shocks occur, keeping weekly claims at or below the 220,000 threshold.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "The cumulative effect of restrictive monetary policy leads to a marginal but noticeable softening in the labor market. A few medium-to-large companies announce layoffs, or there's a slight uptick in claims across various sectors, pushing the volatile weekly number just over the 220,000 mark.",
    "rationale": "My forecast is based on the prevailing economic conditions as of early June 2025. The 220,000 threshold for initial jobless claims is very close to the central tendency observed over the past year, where the 4-week moving average has frequently fluctuated between 215,000 and 225,000. This proximity to the mean makes the outcome highly dependent on normal weekly volatility.\n\nI assign a slightly higher probability to the 'Yes' outcome (55%) for two key reasons. First, the prevailing economic narrative involves a gradual cooling of the labor market due to the lagging effects of the Federal Reserve's monetary policy. This suggests a gentle upward pressure on claims, making a number slightly above 220,000 more probable than one slightly below. Second, the risk distribution for weekly claims is asymmetric; there is more potential for an unexpected upside surprise from a large layoff event than for a sudden plunge to exceptionally low levels.\n\nMy forecast is not higher (e.g., 70%) because the labor market has shown persistent resilience, and a significant jump in claims would require a clear negative shock, for which there is currently no evidence. The short three-week time horizon also favors a continuation of the existing trend over a dramatic shift.\n\nMy forecast is not lower (e.g., 45%) because betting on a sub-220,000 number would ignore the gentle but persistent headwinds facing the labor market from tight credit conditions. The path of least resistance appears to be a slight loosening, not a further tightening, of the labor market.\n\nI would increase my probability for a 'Yes' outcome if the next two weekly jobless claims reports show an upward trend or if there are significant corporate layoff announcements. Conversely, I would decrease my probability if the upcoming reports come in well below 220,000, signaling continued extraordinary strength.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill initial jobless claims for the week ended June 21, 2025 exceed 220,000?\n\nQuestion background:\nAccording to the resolution source, \"An initial claim is a claim filed by an unemployed individual after a separation from an employer. The claim requests a determination of basic eligibility for the Unemployment Insurance program.\"\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if initial jobless claims for the week ended June 21, 2025 is greater than 220,000 according to [FRED](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/ICSA).&#x20;\n\n\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nNo additional information available.\n\nToday is 2025-06-06.\n\nBefore answering you think:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n(e) You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
