    "review": "My initial forecast of 98% was overconfident. It correctly identified the high inertia of state censorship policies but crucially overlooked the specific resolution mechanism: the Wikipedia page itself. Both other forecasters correctly identified this 'Wikipedia process risk' as the primary source of uncertainty. Forecaster 2's argument that the risk is concentrated in Russia and Venezuela, where blocks may be intermittent or ambiguous, is particularly convincing. Forecaster 3 reinforces this point by highlighting the potential for 'editorial disputes or reinterpretation.' My initial analysis failed to distinguish between the probability of a government changing its policy (very low) and the probability of Wikipedia editors changing their classification of that policy (materially higher). The other forecasters persuaded me that this distinction is the core of the question, as a reclassification on the page, even without a real-world policy change, would cause the question to resolve as 'No'.",
    "rationale": "I am significantly lowering my forecast from 98% to 90%. The arguments from the other forecasters convinced me that my original analysis was incomplete. I had focused almost exclusively on the low probability of a fundamental policy reversal by any of the seven authoritarian states within the short, 26-day timeframe.\n\nThe other forecasters correctly pointed out that the main risk is not a policy change, but a 'reclassification' on the Wikipedia page itself. The resolution hinges on what the article *lists*, which is subject to editorial interpretation, consensus, and new data (e.g., from network monitoring groups). This risk is not uniform across all seven countries. For China, Iran, North Korea, Turkmenistan, and Myanmar, the blocks are long-standing and unambiguous, making reclassification very unlikely.\n\nHowever, as Forecaster 2 noted, the situations in Venezuela (history of intermittent blocks) and Russia (throttling, partial access) are more ambiguous. A Wikipedia editor, potentially citing new data or applying a stricter definition of 'currently blocked', could reasonably reclassify one of these countries. This introduces a plausible path to a 'No' outcome that does not require a major geopolitical event. My updated forecast of 90% now incorporates a ~10% probability of failure, with that risk primarily coming from a potential Wikipedia reclassification of Venezuela or Russia, rather than an actual policy reversal by any of the seven governments.",
