  "information": "GameStop's annual shareholder meetings have historically been held in the first half of June. Recent meetings have shown a pattern of being held on a Thursday. Past dates include June 2, 2022 (Thursday), June 15, 2023 (Thursday), and an initial schedule of June 13, 2024 (Thursday). The 2024 virtual meeting was adjourned to a later date after its servers crashed due to overwhelming interest from shareholders attempting to join the webcast.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Approximately 16 days. The outcome will be definitively known on June 12, 2025.",
    "status_quo_outcome": "Gamestop follows its established historical pattern of holding its annual meeting on a Thursday in the first half of June. June 12, 2025, is a Thursday, so the meeting is scheduled for and held on this date without issue.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "The meeting is scheduled for June 12, but the company again underestimates shareholder interest. The virtual meeting platform crashes or experiences critical failures, forcing the company to adjourn the meeting before its official conclusion, thus not satisfying the resolution criteria.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Gamestop schedules its annual meeting for Thursday, June 12, 2025, consistent with its past scheduling cadence. Having learned from the 2024 technical failures, the company employs a robust virtual meeting provider that successfully handles all shareholder traffic, allowing the meeting to be fully completed as planned.",
    "rationale": "My forecast is based primarily on Gamestop's strong historical precedent for scheduling its annual meetings. As the research notes, recent meetings have been held on a Thursday in the first half of June (June 2, 2022; June 15, 2023; scheduled for June 13, 2024). June 12, 2025, is a Thursday and fits this pattern perfectly, making it a highly probable date. The status quo for publicly traded companies is to maintain a predictable schedule for such mandatory events. The primary argument against a 'Yes' outcome is the technical failure of the 2024 meeting. However, this high-profile and embarrassing failure provides a powerful incentive for the company to ensure it does not happen again. I expect Gamestop to have invested in a significantly more robust platform for the 2025 meeting, as the reputational cost of a second consecutive failure would be substantial. My forecast is not higher than 85% because there remains a non-trivial chance of two failure modes. First, the company could select a different Thursday in June (e.g., June 5th or 19th) for logistical reasons, causing this specific question to resolve as 'No'. Second, despite preparations, a technical failure could still occur given the uniquely high and volatile retail shareholder interest in the company. My forecast is not lower because the combination of the strong scheduling pattern and the powerful incentive to prevent a repeat of a known technical issue makes the meeting's successful completion on this date the most likely outcome. I would increase my forecast if Gamestop officially announces the June 12, 2025 date. I would decrease it if they announce a different date or if there are credible reports of issues with their chosen virtual meeting vendor.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill the Gamestop annual meeting take place on June 12, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nCNBC (2024): [Servers for GameStop annual shareholder meeting crash due to overwhelming interest](https://www.cnbc.com/2024/06/13/gamestop-annual-shareholder-meeting-2024-servers-crash.html)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if Gamestop's 2025 Annual Meeting of Stockholders is held on June 12, 2025.\n\nThe meeting is considered to have been held when it fully completed. For example, if the meeting begins but is then postponed due to server issues, the question resolves as **No**.\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nGameStop's annual shareholder meetings have historically been held in the first half of June.

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
