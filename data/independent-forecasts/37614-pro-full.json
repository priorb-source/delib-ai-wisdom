  "information": "Brent Metz, a 39-year-old town councilman in Mountain View, Colorado, pleaded not guilty to felony charges related to the shooting of a 17-year-old high school student in September 2024. According to investigators, Metz shot the teen in the face while the teen was sitting in his car outside Metz's home, where he had been trying to take homecoming dance pictures. A Jefferson County Sheriff’s spokesperson stated that there was no indication the teen intended to commit any crime. Metz took a leave of absence from the council after the shooting.\n\nA recall election for Brent Metz is scheduled for May 20, 2025, after a recall petition was successfully certified. The election is being conducted by mail, and ballots were sent to voters in late April 2025. Mountain View is a small town with a population of approximately 500-600 residents and fewer than 400 active voters. No public polling data on the recall election is available.\n\nHistorical data for U.S. local recall elections shows that approximately 60% of recalls that make it to the ballot succeed in removing the official. Several recent recall efforts in other small Colorado towns have been successful. In March 2025, three council members in Dillon were removed by voters in a recall election related to a development plan. In a separate 2025 case in Loveland, the targeted council member resigned from his position after a recall petition gathered sufficient signatures.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "8 days. The election is on May 20, 2025, with results expected shortly after.",
    "status_quo_outcome": "Brent Metz is the incumbent town councilor for Mountain View, Colorado, though he is currently on a leave of absence.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "A majority of voters in Mountain View cast their ballots in favor of the recall, officially removing Brent Metz from his town council seat. The serious felony charges related to shooting a teenager prove to be an insurmountable obstacle for his political survival.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "A majority of voters cast their ballots against the recall, and Brent Metz retains his seat on the town council. This could result from a mix of low voter turnout, a belief among some locals in the principle of 'innocent until proven guilty', or personal loyalties to Metz within the very small community.",
    "rationale": "My forecast is primarily driven by the extreme severity of the charges against Brent Metz and a strong historical base rate for successful recalls. Metz is accused of a violent felony: shooting a teenager in the face. According to law enforcement, there was no indication the teen was committing a crime. This is not a typical political disagreement over policy but a shocking act of violence that is highly likely to alienate a majority of the electorate, especially in a small town of under 400 active voters where such an event would have a significant community impact. The historical data indicating that approximately 60% of US local recalls that make it to the ballot are successful serves as a strong starting point. The specific circumstances of this case—a violent crime against a minor—suggest this recall is even more likely to succeed than the average case. Recent successful recalls in other small Colorado towns demonstrate a willingness among voters in the state to use this measure. The primary argument for Metz winning is that voters might wait for the outcome of his criminal trial. However, the standard for a recall election is political fitness, not criminal guilt, and the known facts are damning from a public relations perspective. My probability is not lower than 20% because the electorate is very small, which introduces volatility. A small group of loyal supporters could have an outsized impact, especially if turnout is low or if there are unknown facts about the incident that are more favorable to Metz. My probability is not higher than 20% because overcoming a felony charge for shooting a teenager is an exceptionally high bar for any elected official. The combination of the shocking nature of the crime and the base rate for successful recalls makes his removal the most probable outcome. I would increase my forecast for him winning if credible exculpatory evidence were to be released before the election. I would decrease it if any key community figures or groups publicly called for his removal.",
