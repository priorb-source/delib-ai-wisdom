    "review": "Forecaster 2 presents compelling strategic logic and rightly emphasizes the strong groundwork (Defense Minister visit, troop training, comprehensive strategic partnership). However, I believe they underweight the significance of the Q1 2025 deadline passing by four months without any announcement or updated reporting. Their 85% confidence seems too optimistic given this timing miss.\n\nForecaster 3 raises a critical point I had insufficiently considered: the resolution criteria specifically require a government *announcement*, not merely a signed agreement. This is crucial. Vietnam may indeed keep the deal confidential to minimize friction with China, especially given ongoing South China Sea tensions. Their observation that this is Vietnam's FIRST arms purchase from South Korea heightens political sensitivity. The point about buyer-imposed confidentiality potentially preventing a qualifying announcement is astute and shifts my assessment.\n\nBoth forecasters appropriately note the strong fundamentals (diversification from Russia, strategic partnership, completed training). However, the specific announcement requirement combined with Vietnam's historical military procurement opacity creates a distinct hurdle beyond simply completing negotiations.",
    "rationale": "Weighing all perspectives, I'm adjusting my forecast downward slightly from 50% to 47%. The key factors:\n\n**Reasons for modest downward revision:**\n1. The announcement requirement is more restrictive than I initially weighted. Even a completed deal might not be publicly announced if Vietnam prioritizes confidentiality to manage China relations\n2. Four months past the Q1 timeline without any reported progress or updated timeline is more concerning than I initially assessed\n3. First-ever Korean arms sale to Vietnam faces higher political hurdles\n\n**Reasons not to go as low as Forecaster 3's 44%:**\n1. South Korea has strong incentives to publicize such deals for Hanwha's global marketing\n2. Two months remains sufficient time if approvals are indeed in motion\n3. The training and groundwork suggest genuine commitment beyond mere exploratory talks\n\n**Reasons not to go as high as Forecaster 2's 85%:**\n1. The Q1 miss represents a 4-month delay with no explanation\n2. Vietnam's traditional opacity in military procurement is underweighted at 85%\n3. Recent silence from both governments is concerning\n\nMy 47% reflects genuine uncertainty: strong fundamentals and strategic logic support completion, but timing delays, announcement requirements, and political sensitivities create meaningful obstacles to a Yes resolution by July 1.",
