    "review": "- Both forecasters correctly emphasize the resolution criterion (>10M shares) and the ~700k-share (~6–7%) buffer from the last reported ~10.7M. That framing is solid and matches my prior view.\n- They lean heavily on Berkshire’s multi-quarter net-selling trend and record cash build as reasons a trim could have occurred. That’s reasonable, but I think they underweight two counterpoints: (1) AMZN is a relatively small, high-quality position (likely a lieutenants’ holding) that Berkshire has tended to leave untouched for long stretches; (2) Berkshire’s capital needs didn’t require selling AMZN specifically (massive cash, and Japanese trading firm investments aren’t on the 13F, reducing pressure on U.S. holdings).\n- New argumentative nuance: Forecaster 2’s “burden of action” framing (selling is required to flip outcome) is helpful and supports a higher Yes probability; Forecaster 3’s clarity that the question isn’t about incremental buying but about staying >10M is also useful.\n- I don’t find their 65% fully persuasive; it seems to over-translate a portfolio-level net-selling pattern into a meaningful probability of trimming this small position past the threshold. Still, their caution is a good check on overconfidence given how little it would take (~700k shares) to get to No.\n- Net: Their reasoning nudges me slightly lower than my initial estimate, but not all the way to 65%.",
    "rationale": "Baseline: Q4 2024 holding ~10.7M; status quo implies Yes. To resolve No, Berkshire must have sold >700k shares (~6–7%) in Q1 2025. Evidence cuts both ways:\n- For Yes: Berkshire often leaves smaller, high-quality positions unchanged; AMZN’s business momentum remained strong; no evident need to sell AMZN to raise cash; new focus areas (energy, Japanese trading firms) don’t necessarily force U.S. tech trims, especially with ample cash. Historically, AMZN share count has been stable for years.\n- For No: Multi-quarter net-selling pattern and record cash build indicate persistent de-risking; trimming a modest 6–7% would be consistent with broad reductions; leadership transition could prompt incremental portfolio cleanup.\nBalancing these, I continue to weight inertia and the position’s small relative size more heavily than a generic selling trend. However, the small buffer and demonstrated willingness to pare equities keep me from a very high probability. I’m slightly reducing my prior 76% to incorporate peers’ emphasis on the ease of a small trim flipping the outcome and the ongoing net-seller posture.\nTime to resolution is short (13F due by May 15), and absent a leak, uncertainty remains. No new concrete evidence specifically implicates AMZN selling in Q1, so I keep the forecast above two-thirds but trim it modestly.",
