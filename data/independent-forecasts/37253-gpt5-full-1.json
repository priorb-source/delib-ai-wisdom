  "information": "North Korea has conducted six nuclear tests, with the last one occurring in September 2017. The current gap of over seven and a half years is the longest interval between tests. According to South Korea's National Intelligence Service (NIS), the tunnels at the Punggye-ri test site are maintained in an operational condition. The U.S. State Department also assesses that the site remains capable of supporting a seventh test. The IAEA has warned about an 'exponential' expansion of North Korea's nuclear program and ongoing plutonium production at the Yongbyon facility. However, analysis of satellite imagery by the think tank 38 North shows no new tunneling activity at Punggye-ri, and there are no public reports of specific preparations such as equipment movement or other logistical arrangements that would typically precede a test.\n\nIn late April 2025, North Korea conducted the first weapons system tests for its new 5,000-ton 'Choe Hyon-class' destroyer. The tests, observed by leader Kim Jong Un, included the launch of supersonic cruise missiles, strategic cruise missiles, and anti-aircraft missiles. The warship is expected to be delivered to the navy and enter service in early 2026. Earlier in 2025, North Korea conducted several other weapons tests. In April, it tested the 'Haeil-2' underwater attack drone. In February, it test-launched strategic cruise missiles. In January, it conducted its first missile test of the year, firing an intermediate-range ballistic missile with a hypersonic glide vehicle.\n\nNorth Korean leader Kim Jong Un has repeatedly called for strengthening the country's strategic forces. Following the destroyer weapon tests in April 2025, he stated, 'The time has come for North Korea's navy to choose to accelerate nuclear armament.' In January 2025, he said the country's nuclear weapons development program would continue 'indefinitely.' In February 2025, the US, South Korea, and Japan issued a joint statement confirming their trilateral partnership and calling for North Korea's complete nuclear disarmament, pledging to strengthen sanctions enforcement. The European Union condemned North Korea's ballistic missile launch in January 2025, calling it a violation of UN Security Council resolutions.",

    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "About 61 days (through June 30, 2025, UTC)",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "North Korea continues missile, drone, and naval weapons tests and aggressive rhetoric but refrains from a nuclear detonation. Punggye-ri stays in a maintained-but-quiet posture, with no observed pre-test logistics (e.g., cable laying, pumping, instrument placement, portal sealing) emerging in public satellite imagery or allied statements. Beijing quietly signals discontent, and Pyongyang preserves the option value of a future test tied to later political timing.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "In late May or June, commercial and government imagery starts to show renewed activity at Punggye-ri—vehicle traffic, power/cable runs, dewatering, portal preparation—followed days to weeks later by a contained underground explosion detected by the CTBTO’s International Monitoring System and corroborated by allied governments and media.",
    "rationale": "- Status quo weight: The default is no test. North Korea has not tested since September 2017 despite rebuilding Punggye-ri and repeatedly showcasing other systems. Tests carry diplomatic and economic costs (especially with China), and Pyongyang has often achieved signaling aims via missile activity instead.\n\n- Evidence today: The research assistant notes (1) Punggye-ri tunnels are assessed as operational by NIS/State, (2) IAEA sees expanding nuclear material production, but (3) 38 North and public sources show no new tunneling or the usual pre-test preparations. With only ~2 months left, the absence of visible prep is meaningful; historically, days-to-weeks of observable site activity has preceded tests. Recent DPRK weapons demonstrations (cruise missiles, HGV IRBM, underwater drone, destroyer trials) and escalatory rhetoric raise general risk but are weakly predictive of an imminent nuclear test without corroborating site indicators.\n\n- Base rates and timing: Six tests occurred over 2006–2017, with clustering in Jan–Feb and Sep; only one was in late spring (May 2009). The current 7.5+ year gap is the longest, suggesting either deferred need for validation or stronger restraint from external considerations; neither compels a sudden test in the next 61 days absent cues.\n\n- Why not higher: No public pre-test signatures at Punggye-ri; Chinese sensitivity to a test; Pyongyang already achieves deterrence signaling with frequent conventional/strategic launches; limited time window.\n\n- Why not lower: The site appears technically capable; leadership rhetoric emphasizes accelerating nuclear armament; geopolitical cover from heightened great-power rivalry may slightly lower perceived costs; a provocatively timed test (e.g., around a major summit) is a nontrivial tail risk.\n\n- What would move me up: Credible reporting of renewed Punggye-ri activity (vehicle convoys, cable/pipe runs, pumping, portal work), evacuation or security cordons near the site, allied/leaked warnings of imminent test, unusual NOTAMs, or CTBTO detecting precursory seismic events.\n\n- What would move me down: Continued absence of site activity into mid-June; signals of Chinese pressure; DPRK pivoting to alternative provocations (e.g., satellite launch) framed as the month’s major message.\n",
