    "status_quo_outcome": "No",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "NYT does not adopt or quote the specific phrase “reverse purchasing” (or “reverse purchase”) in any article, newsletter, brief, or transcript dated June 10–30, 2025. Coverage of Chinese consumer trends uses alternate translations like “reverse shopping,” “reverse buying,” or simply describes the phenomenon without that exact wording.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "NYT publishes a piece on China’s consumer economy that explicitly quotes or translates the Chinese term as “reverse purchasing,” or an editor/writer uses the exact phrase. Alternatively, an article in another context happens to use the exact words “reverse purchase,” triggering a match in the NYT search within the window.",
    "rationale": "- The requirement is for an exact-phrase match via NYT search for either “reverse purchasing” or “reverse purchase,” and only for items dated June 10–30, 2025. This is a narrow window and a specific phrasing constraint.\n- “Reverse purchasing” is not a common NYT style term; in finance the common term is “reverse repurchase,” and in consumer contexts editors may prefer “reverse shopping” or simply describe the trend. The likelihood that NYT will use this precise phrase in the next three weeks is low absent a strong news hook.\n- The background People’s Daily piece (Apr 30, 2025) indicates a China-specific concept that Western outlets might cover, but translation choices vary, and NYT often avoids uncommon literal translations unless quoting directly. Even if they cover the trend, they may not use these exact words.\n- The alternative phrase “reverse purchase” is also uncommon; NYT would more likely write “reverse a purchase,” “purchase reversal,” or “buyback/repurchase,” not the exact two-word phrase.\n- Research assistant: No additional information available, which neither raises nor lowers base odds.\nWhy not higher: Exact-match requirement and short window make this unlikely, and term rarity in NYT style guides against it.\nWhy not lower: There is some tail risk: a China economy feature could quote state media or social media vernacular and include the exact phrase; or an unrelated article could contain “reverse purchase.”\nWhat would move me up: Signals that Western media are adopting the exact translation, a NYT reporter tweeting/teasing a piece using the term, or an NYT explainer directly engaging with People’s Daily language. What would move me down: Passing of mid-June with no relevant coverage, or evidence that NYT uses alternative translations exclusively.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill the New York Times mention \"reverse purchasing\" before July 1, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nPeople's Daily: [“Reverse purchasing” reflects the vitality of the Chinese market](http://finance.people.com.cn/n1/2025/0430/c1004-40471159.html)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if the NY Times mentions \"reverse purchasing\" in any of its content items as found through [this search](https://www.nytimes.com/search?dropmab=false&lang=en&query=%22reverse%20purchasing%22&sort=best), dated after June 9, 2025 and before July 1, 2025. This question will also count \"reverse purchase,\" which can be found through [this link](https://www.nytimes.com/search?dropmab=false&lang=en&query=%22reverse%20purchase%22&sort=best).\n\n\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nNo additional information available.\n\nToday is 2025-06-05.\n\nBefore answering you think:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n(e) You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
