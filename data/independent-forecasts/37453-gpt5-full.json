  "information": "Alberta Premier Danielle Smith has stated that her government will permit a citizen-led referendum on independence in 2026 if a public petition gathers sufficient signatures. Smith has personally said she does not support separation but believes the decision should be made by Albertans. To facilitate this process, her government introduced Bill 54, which lowers the threshold for initiating a referendum from 20% to 10% of eligible voters (approximately 177,000 signatures) and extends the time for collection from 90 to 120 days. The government also formed a panel called 'Alberta Next' to explore the province's autonomy and future relationship with the federal government.\n\nThe process for triggering a referendum requires a successful citizen petition. The petition must gather at least 177,000 signatures, which then must be officially verified by Elections Alberta before the government can formally schedule a vote. As of early May 2025, a group named 'Project for Alberta Prosperity' announced its intention to organize a signature collection campaign. Its president claimed they had already exceeded the required signature threshold, while other unverified reports mentioned 80,000 signatures being collected in 36 hours. However, no petition had been formally submitted or certified by Elections Alberta.\n\nThe discussion around a potential referendum occurs amid heightened tensions between Alberta and the federal government over energy policies, the carbon tax, and fiscal distribution, particularly following the re-election of the federal Liberal party. The proposal has faced opposition from within Alberta. Leaders of the Sturgeon Lake and Mikisew Cree Nations have publicly opposed an independence referendum, stating their treaties were with the Crown, not the province. The official provincial opposition, the New Democratic Party of Alberta, has accused Premier Smith of promoting separatism.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "About 55 days (until July 1, 2025)",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "The citizen petition is not submitted and certified by Elections Alberta before late June, or the government declines to act immediately even if it is. The Premier reiterates any vote would be in 2026 and keeps the date unspecified, citing the need for verification, consultations, and question wording. July 1 arrives with no formal announcement of a specific referendum date.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "A citizen group quickly gathers and submits far more than the required signatures, Elections Alberta verifies the petition unusually fast in June, and the Premier/Cabinet—under pressure from caucus or public momentum—announces an exact referendum date (likely in 2026) before July 1, 2025.",
    "rationale": "The default is that no date is announced by July 1. Announcing a definitive date within the next ~8 weeks would require both (1) administrative steps to complete quickly and (2) a political decision to escalate. The research assistant notes: Premier Smith says she does not support separation but would permit a citizen-led referendum in 2026 if a petition qualifies; Bill 54 lowers the citizen-initiative threshold to ~10% (~177k signatures) and extends the collection window; a group claims rapid early momentum (unverified) but nothing has been formally submitted or certified by Elections Alberta yet; and there is visible opposition from Indigenous leaders and the provincial NDP. Even if signatures are gathered swiftly, verification typically takes time and the government retains discretion over timing. Smith’s public framing points to 2026 and to a process-first approach, not to announcing a date imminently. Political incentives also favor caution: locking in a date by July 1 would be a dramatic escalation with economic and intergovernmental ramifications; keeping the threat latent preserves leverage without immediate costs. Why not higher? Because the window is short, verification and question-setting are non-trivial, and the Premier has explicitly signaled 2026 rather than an immediate schedule announcement. Why not lower? Because the threshold has been reduced, there appears to be an active organizing effort, and the government has left the door open; a surge in signatures and a fast verification could prompt an earlier-than-expected announcement of a 2026 date. What would move me up: confirmed submission and rapid certification of a petition by Elections Alberta; credible reporting that signatures far exceed the threshold (e.g., 300k+); clear government statements that certification will trigger an immediate date announcement; or a political shock that makes early scheduling advantageous. What would move me down: evidence the petition drive is stalling or facing credibility issues; official guidance that verification will not complete before July; or unequivocal government statements ruling out announcing any date before summer regardless of petition status.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nBefore July 1, 2025, will the government of Alberta officially announce a date for an independence referendum?\n\nQuestion background:\nPolitico: [The quiet threat to Canadian unity isn’t Quebec — it’s Alberta](https://www.politico.com/news/2025/04/27/the-quiet-threat-to-canadian-unity-isnt-quebec-its-alberta-00311719)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if, before July 1, 2025, a referendum on the independence of Alberta from Canada is officially scheduled. If this does not occur before that date, this question resolves as **No**.\n\nFor purposes of this question, the referendum will be considered \"officially scheduled\" when it is announced by a person or entity with the authority to do so within Alberta. Please note that broader legality, such as within Canada, will be considered irrelevant for this question, so if the federal government declared the referendum illegal, the question would still resolve as Yes.\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nAlberta Premier Danielle Smith has stated that her government will permit a citizen-led referendum on independence in 2026 if a public petition gathers sufficient signatures.

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
