  "information": "The political climate in Côte d'Ivoire is marked by the disqualification of several opposition figures ahead of the October 2025 election. In April 2025, Tidjane Thiam, leader of the main opposition party PDCI-RDA, was disqualified after a court ruled he did not meet eligibility conditions due to his prior dual French-Ivorian nationality, despite having renounced his French citizenship. This and other exclusions have led to protests and accusations of electoral manipulation. Reports also mention that other political figures like Charles Blé Goudé and Guillaume Soro have been excluded from the electoral process due to judicial convictions. In response to the political tensions, various groups, including religious leaders and the UN, have called for peaceful dialogue.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "32 days (from May 30, 2025 to July 1, 2025)",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No - none of the five specified candidates have been disqualified yet",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "All five candidates (Gnangbo Kacou, Laurent Gbagbo, Pascal Affi N'Guessan, Jean-Louis Billon, and Simone Gbagbo) remain on the electoral list and legally eligible through July 1, 2025. The recent wave of disqualifications (Tidjane Thiam in April, plus Blé Goudé and Soro) represents the completion of the government's efforts to exclude opposition figures, with no further action taken against these five specific candidates in the remaining month.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "At least one of the five candidates faces disqualification before July 1, 2025. Most likely would be Laurent Gbagbo or Simone Gbagbo given their controversial political histories and potential legal vulnerabilities, or another candidate targeted through judicial proceedings similar to those used against Tidjane Thiam (nationality eligibility) or other opposition figures (criminal convictions).",
    "rationale": "The research assistant's report reveals an active pattern of opposition disqualifications in the lead-up to the October 2025 election. Tidjane Thiam was disqualified in April 2025 on technical grounds (dual nationality), and others like Blé Goudé and Soro have been excluded via judicial convictions. This demonstrates both the government's willingness to use legal mechanisms to exclude opposition candidates and the charged political environment. With 32 days remaining until July 1, there is sufficient time for additional disqualification proceedings. However, several factors moderate my forecast: (1) None of the five specified candidates have been disqualified yet, and status quo bias suggests they may remain eligible; (2) I lack specific information about pending legal challenges against any of these five individuals; (3) The most prominent recent disqualification (Thiam) targeted someone not on this list, suggesting current enforcement may focus elsewhere; (4) Some disqualifications may have already occurred in the April wave. Laurent and Simone Gbagbo stand out as higher-risk candidates given their political histories, but without concrete evidence of proceedings against them, I cannot assign high probability. My forecast would increase if credible sources report legal challenges or eligibility reviews targeting any of these five candidates. It would decrease if these candidates are confirmed on final electoral lists or if the July 1 deadline approaches without new disqualification activity.",

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any).
