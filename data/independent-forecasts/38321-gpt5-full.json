  "information": "According to multiple news reports from early June 2025, the White House has officially confirmed that US President Donald Trump will attend the NATO summit in The Hague. White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt stated, 'I can confirm that Trump will attend the NATO summit.' This confirmation was also echoed by officials from allied nations. Dutch Prime Minister Dik Scoh announced Trump's intention to attend following a phone call between the two leaders. Similarly, Polish Foreign Minister Radoslaw Sikorski stated that Trump had reaffirmed his commitment to the alliance and would be present at the summit.\n\nA primary focus of the summit will be defense spending among NATO members. President Trump has been advocating for member countries to increase their defense spending to 5% of their GDP, a significant increase from the current 2% target. In response to this pressure, NATO Secretary-General Mark Rutte (or Jens Stoltenberg, sources vary) has reportedly proposed a compromise deal: a target of 3.5% of GDP on direct defense spending by 2032, with an additional 1.5% allocated for broader security-related expenditures. The discussions will also address military aid to Ukraine, and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky is expected to attend.\n\nThe NATO summit is scheduled to take place from June 24 to June 26, 2025, at the World Forum in The Hague, Netherlands. This will be the first time the Netherlands has hosted a NATO summit. Over 6,000 delegates and 2,000 journalists from 32 NATO member countries and partner nations are expected to be in attendance. President Trump's schedule for June 2025 also includes other high-profile international travel, such as his attendance at the G7 leaders' summit in Kananaskis, Canada, from June 15 to 17.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "About 20–22 days (the summit is June 24–26, 2025)",
    "status_quo_outcome": "Yes — Trump attends in person as planned",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "A late-breaking change causes Trump not to appear in the summit venue (e.g., sudden health issue, urgent domestic or international crisis that keeps him in Washington, a security concern in The Hague, or a deliberate decision to send a proxy such as the Vice President or Secretary of State). He might travel to Europe but skip entering the summit space, which would also resolve No under the definition.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Trump flies to the Netherlands and physically attends sessions at the World Forum in The Hague, participating in plenary/photo-ops/bilaterals with other heads of state, clearly seen and heard on-site.",
    "rationale": "Multiple credible reports and on-record statements indicate the White House has confirmed President Trump will attend the NATO summit in The Hague in late June. Allied officials (e.g., the Dutch Prime Minister and Poland’s Foreign Minister) have echoed this, and the summit agenda—burden sharing, higher defense spending targets, and Ukraine support—aligns with Trump’s stated priorities, giving him strong incentive to attend and press for concessions. The summit is a marquee event for a U.S. president; historically, once such attendance is confirmed, cancellations are rare. The timing is also feasible relative to other international travel in mid-June. These factors make attendance the status quo path. Reasons this is not higher than the low-to-mid 90s: Trump’s unpredictability and history of late changes, age-related health tail risks, and the possibility of a domestic or international crisis or security issue that either deters travel or leads him to send a surrogate. Reasons it’s not lower: multiple public confirmations, host/allied planning premised on his presence, and strong policy incentives to be there in person. Updates that would move this higher: publication of a detailed White House schedule with specific NATO bilats/plenary timings, visible pre-positioning/logistics for the trip, and departure as scheduled. Updates that would move this lower: reports of illness or medical issues, a major crisis requiring him to remain in Washington, credible security concerns at the venue, or White House language softening from “will attend” to “plans to attend”/“considering.”",
