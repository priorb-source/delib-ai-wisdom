  "information": "Sheikh Hasina has been in exile in India since being ousted from power in August 2024. In statements made in February 2025, she vowed to return to Bangladesh, accusing the interim government of unleashing terrorists and promising to seek justice. Legally, she faces multiple challenges. Bangladesh's International Crimes Tribunal (ICT) has issued her a show-cause notice in a contempt of court case, with a response required by May 15, 2025. Additionally, a separate ICT investigation into alleged crimes against humanity committed during the July 2024 uprising is reportedly in its final stages, with a probe report expected to be submitted within May 2025.\n\nThe political landscape in Bangladesh is currently shaped by an interim government led by Chief Advisor Muhammad Yunus. This government has stated its priority is a reform agenda and has indicated that national elections might be delayed until June 2026. On May 6, 2025, former Prime Minister Khaleda Zia, Sheikh Hasina's long-time political rival, returned to Bangladesh after receiving four months of medical treatment in London. Following her return, her party, the Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP), has increased pressure on the interim government to hold elections sooner, with some leaders demanding polls be held by December 2025.\n\nThe Bangladeshi interim government has publicly stated that securing Sheikh Hasina's extradition from India is a 'top priority.' A formal request for her extradition, along with supporting documents, was submitted to India in December 2024. As of February 2025, India had not officially responded to the request. A spokesperson for Bangladesh's foreign ministry indicated that a formal reminder would be sent to India regarding the extradition at an 'appropriate time' to be determined by the country's political leadership.",

    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "About 7 weeks (until July 1, 2025)",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "India does not act on Bangladesh’s extradition request before July 1, and Sheikh Hasina opts to remain in India given arrest/trial risks at home; she responds to legal proceedings via counsel. No credible reporting of her crossing into Bangladesh occurs in the May 12–June 30 window.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Sheikh Hasina returns voluntarily for political impact (e.g., to rally Awami League supporters or to respond in person to legal processes), or India unexpectedly fast-tracks extradition leading to her arrival in Bangladesh before July 1.",
    "rationale": "Baseline forces favor stasis. Deposed leaders typically remain abroad absent strong guarantees or imminent political opportunities. The interim government is signaling hardline intent (extradition priority; ICT actions including a show-cause notice due May 15 and a crimes-against-humanity probe reportedly nearing submission), which raises the personal/legal risk of return. India has not acted on the December 2024 extradition request and tends to move slowly on sensitive, high-profile extraditions; a rapid turnaround before July 1 looks unlikely.\nCountervailing factors exist but look weaker on the short horizon: Hasina’s public vow to return and potential symbolic timing (e.g., around June events) could push a voluntary return, and domestic politics are fluid (BNP pressure after Khaleda Zia’s May 6 return). Still, the immediate incentives cut against a pre-July return, especially with legal jeopardy likely to increase if the ICT probe concludes in May.\nSummary of provided info shaping the view: Hasina is in India since Aug 2024; vowed in Feb 2025 to return; ICT show-cause due May 15; ICT probe on 2024 uprising near completion; interim gov under Muhammad Yunus prioritizes reform with elections possibly in 2026; BNP pressing for earlier polls; Bangladesh formally requested extradition in Dec 2024; as of Feb 2025 India hadn’t responded.\nWhy not higher: Limited time window, high arrest/trial risk at home, India’s probable caution on extradition, and lack of concrete signals of imminent travel. Why not lower: Explicit vow to return, possible political calculus to energize supporters, and a (non-zero) chance of a sudden diplomatic/legal shift.\nWatch to update upward: Credible reports of a set return date or flight/land border movement; India signaling cooperation on extradition with accelerated legal steps; interim government offering safe passage/negotiations; major shifts weakening the interim government. Watch to update downward: ICT issuing arrest warrants/stronger charges; India granting Hasina formal protection/asylum or publicly rebuffing extradition while she signals no near-term travel; tightening border/security measures.",

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
