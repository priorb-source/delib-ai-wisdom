  "information": "The Project 2025 Tracker is a public website created by Redditors from the r/Keep_Track subreddit, with Adrienne Cobb identified as its creator. The site monitors and visually demonstrates the progress of the administration's initiatives based on the Project 2025 plan, breaking down the status of objectives by government agency. According to an April 2025 report, the tracker website was attracting between 50,000 and 100,000 visitors daily, with approximately 10% of the traffic originating from outside the United States.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Approximately 46 days from May 16, 2025 to July 1, 2025",
    "status_quo_outcome": "The tracker continues its current rate of classifying objectives as 'Done', which may or may not reach the 120 threshold depending on current progress levels",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "The tracker has significantly fewer than 120 objectives marked as Done by July 1, 2025. This occurs if the current count is well below 120 and the administration's implementation pace remains steady or slows, or if the tracker maintainers apply conservative criteria for marking objectives as complete, resulting in a final count of perhaps 80-115 objectives.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "The tracker reaches or exceeds 120 Done objectives by July 1, 2025. This happens if either: (1) the current count is already near 120 and maintains momentum, or (2) there's an acceleration in policy implementation in June 2025 as the administration completes quick-win objectives or issues multiple executive orders, pushing the total over the threshold.",
    "rationale": "This forecast faces significant uncertainty due to lack of current baseline data. The critical unknown is how many objectives are currently marked as Done on the tracker. The administration has been in office approximately 4 months by mid-May 2025. Project 2025 is a comprehensive policy agenda, and tracking requires verification of actual implementation rather than just announcements. With 46 days remaining, the time window is relatively short for dramatic changes. Applying the status quo principle, governmental policy implementation typically proceeds at a steady but not rapid pace. Even with executive orders, actual implementation and verification take time. The tracker maintainers need evidence of completion before classification. If I assume the current count is somewhere in the range of 60-90 objectives (estimated from 4 months of implementation), reaching 120 would require adding 30-60 more in just 6.5 weeks - possible but requiring acceleration from the baseline pace. The forecast is not higher because: (1) government implementation is typically gradual, (2) verification standards may be stringent, (3) the 6.5-week window is short for major changes. The forecast is not lower because: (1) executive actions can be implemented quickly, (2) the current count could already be close to 120, (3) early administration periods sometimes see concentrated activity. To update higher, I would need evidence that the current count is above 100, or that there's been recent acceleration. To update lower, I would need data showing the current count is below 70, or that implementation has stalled.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill the Project 2025 Tracker classify at least 120 objectives as \"Done\" on July 1, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nThe 2025 Tracker is a project of the Keep_Track subreddit and is explained [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/Keep_Track/comments/1ii7tbr/project_2025_tracker_is_now_live/).\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if the [Project 2025 Tracker](https://www.project2025.observer/) has ≥120 Objectives classified as Done when accessed by Metaculus on or after July 1, 2025. If it is less than 120, this resolves as **No**.\n\n\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nThe Project 2025 Tracker is a public website created by Redditors from the r/Keep_Track subreddit, with Adrienne Cobb identified as its creator.

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
