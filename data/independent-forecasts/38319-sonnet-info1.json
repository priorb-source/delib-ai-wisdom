  "information": "Tohoku's industrial production index for March 2025 increased by 7.6% month-over-month, the first rise in three months. The increase was driven by a 52.9% rise in machinery for industrial use, including semiconductors. For context, the nationwide preliminary Industrial Production Index for April 2025 showed a decline of 0.9% month-over-month. Historically, from 2015-2024, the monthly change for the Tohoku index was positive approximately 55% of the time, but the series exhibits modestly negative serial correlation, indicating a tendency for mean-reversion after large monthly movements.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Approximately 17 days until June 21, 2025, when the April 2025 industrial production announcement for Tohoku is expected.",
    "status_quo_outcome": "Given the large 7.6% increase in March 2025, combined with the reported tendency toward mean-reversion after large movements, the status quo expectation would be a decline or minimal growth in April 2025.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "April 2025 shows a month-over-month decline or stays flat (≤ 0.0%) due to mean reversion after the exceptionally large March increase of 7.6%, particularly if the 52.9% surge in machinery production was temporary or if broader economic conditions weaken as suggested by the nationwide 0.9% April decline.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "April 2025 shows a month-over-month increase (> 0.0%) if the strong momentum in semiconductors and industrial machinery continues, or if Tohoku's regional dynamics diverge positively from the national trend despite the nationwide April decline.",
    "rationale": "Several factors point toward a decline in April 2025. Most significantly, March 2025 saw an exceptionally large 7.6% increase - far above typical monthly movements - and the research indicates the series exhibits 'modestly negative serial correlation,' meaning large movements tend to be followed by reversals toward the mean. This pattern is further reinforced by the nationwide preliminary Industrial Production Index for April 2025 declining by 0.9%, suggesting broader industrial weakness. The March increase was also noted as the first rise in three months, suggesting it may have been a temporary rebound rather than sustained growth. Against this, the historical baseline shows positive changes occurring approximately 55% of the time from 2015-2024, which provides some base rate support for a positive outcome. Additionally, the March increase was driven by strong semiconductor and industrial machinery sectors, which could potentially sustain momentum. However, the combination of mean-reversion tendency after large moves, the nationwide April decline, and the magnitude of March's increase makes a decline more likely than the historical 55% baseline would suggest. My forecast is not higher because the evidence for mean reversion is strong and the nationwide data showed a decline. It's not lower because there remains meaningful uncertainty - regional dynamics can differ from national trends, the semiconductor sector could remain strong, and the 55% historical positive rate provides a meaningful floor. I would update higher with evidence of sustained April orders in key industries or positive regional indicators. I would update lower with confirmation of broader industrial slowdown or temporary nature of March's surge.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill the Northeast Japan region (Tohoku) show a month-over-month increase in April 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\n[Tohoku's March industrial production index rises 7.6% from the previous month, the first increase in three months](https://www.nikkei.com/article/DGXZQOCC214DI0R20C25A5000000/)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if the [industrial production announcement](https://www.tohoku.meti.go.jp/cyosa/tokei/iip.html) for April 2025 (expected approximately June 21, 2025) reports a monthly change in production (\"生産\") of greater than 0.0%.\n\n\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nTohoku's industrial production index for March 2025 increased by 7.6% month-over-month, the first rise in three months. The increase was driven by a 52.9% rise in machinery for industrial use, including semiconductors. For context, the nationwide preliminary Industrial Production Index for April 2025 showed a decline of 0.9% month-over-month.

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
