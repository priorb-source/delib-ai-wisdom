    "review": "Both forecasters reinforce the key points: very low month-to-month volatility, the threshold is a strict < $0.6300 (so $0.6300 is a No), and recent levels sit slightly above the cutoff. They add a useful operational detail I hadn’t emphasized: tracking USDA AMS wholesale prices as a near-term indicator. They don’t introduce hard new data for April/May, but their framing of the strict-inequality threshold and the typical 0.62–0.66 range makes the sub-$0.63 outcome look a bit less likely absent fresh evidence. I find their reasoning sound and aligned with my view; the strict-threshold emphasis nudges me slightly downward.",
    "rationale": "Time remaining is short and the May average price is typically sticky. Without an April print in hand and with narratives pointing to mild upward cost pressure, a sub-$0.6300 outcome requires either the April level already being at/under ~$0.632 or broad retail promotions in May. The strict “under $0.6300” criterion slightly reduces the Yes odds versus a naive “around $0.63” framing. Given no new concrete data and historical monthly moves often under 1–2 cents, I trim my estimate from 30% to 28%, reflecting the tight threshold and inertia at slightly above $0.63.",
