  "information": "The White House has officially confirmed that President Donald Trump will attend the G7 summit in Canada from June 15-17, 2025. White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt stated that details of the visit would be announced shortly. Numerous media outlets reported the confirmation in late May 2025, and official G7 participant lists dated June 3 include Trump.\n\nThe 51st G7 Summit is scheduled to take place in Kananaskis, Alberta. Security measures are being implemented, including a controlled access zone around summit venues from June 10-18 and temporary airspace restrictions. In advance of the leaders' summit, U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent and Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell attended preparatory G7 meetings in Banff. Historically, sitting U.S. presidents have attended every in-person G7/G8 summit since its inception in 1975.\n\nAccording to reports from the Nikkei newspaper, the upcoming G7 summit may not produce a traditional final joint statement due to disagreements between the U.S. and other member nations. The summit may instead result in several separate documents on specific topics of cooperation, while excluding more contentious issues like global trade and relations with Russia from the formal agenda to avoid conflict. In preparation for the summit, German Chancellor Olaf Scholz is scheduled to meet with President Trump at the White House on June 5.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Approximately 12–14 days (summit June 15–17, 2025; outcome certain by June 17).",
    "status_quo_outcome": "Yes — President Trump attends in person as planned.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "A late-breaking domestic or international crisis (e.g., major security incident, urgent military escalation, natural disaster), an acute health issue, or a specific security threat in/around the venue leads the White House to cancel or substitute the Vice President/Secretary of State; or a last-minute shift to virtual participation.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Trump travels to Kananaskis, enters the secure venue, and participates in at least one in-person leaders’ session or bilateral, physically present with other heads of state.",
    "rationale": "- Evidence for attendance: The White House has publicly confirmed Trump will attend the June 15–17 G7 in Canada; multiple outlets report the confirmation; official participant lists dated June 3 include him. Canadian authorities have announced security perimeters (June 10–18) and temporary airspace restrictions, consistent with final-stage planning for leader arrivals. A June 5 White House meeting with Chancellor Scholz further signals normal pre-summit choreography. Historically, sitting U.S. presidents attend in-person G7/G8 summits; when a summit is held, non-attendance by a U.S. president is extremely rare. Travel is short (U.S. to Alberta), and logistics appear well advanced. The reported possibility of no joint communiqué does not materially affect the incentive to attend.\n- Why not higher than this: Residual tail risks remain in the ~1–6% range — sudden domestic/international crises requiring the president in Washington, a last-minute security concern, mechanical/weather issues, or an acute personal health issue. Trump’s history of unpredictability adds a small incremental risk, though even he has consistently attended G7s when held.\n- Why not lower: We have formal White House confirmation, official listings, and visible on-the-ground preparations days before the event. The base rate for U.S. presidential attendance is extremely high, and the cost of skipping is significant. With less than two weeks to go and no contrary signals, the status quo heavily favors attendance.\n- What would move the forecast down: Credible reports of a serious security threat near the venue; White House schedule revisions removing the trip; reports of presidential illness; emergence of a major crisis (e.g., U.S. military action) conflicting with travel; Canadian authorities altering the summit format to virtual or postponing it.\n- What would move the forecast up: Formal release of Trump’s detailed travel schedule with wheels-up timing; arrival of advance teams reported by the White House pool; NOTAMs and motorcade/airlift movement confirmations specifically tied to the president’s travel; public confirmation of bilateral meetings in Kananaskis with precise times/locations.",
