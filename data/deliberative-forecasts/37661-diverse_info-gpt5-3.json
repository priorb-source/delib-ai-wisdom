    "review": "Forecaster 2 rightly stresses the short timeline and status-quo inertia, and introduces a new potential risk: a U.S. Senate investigation. I don’t find that investigation especially binding on Bangladesh’s rollout timeline unless it triggers regulatory action or partner hesitation; it seems more reputational than operational, so I weight it modestly. Forecaster 2 also seems to underweight that Bangladesh has already issued core licenses and hosted a public trial, both strong signals of near-term launch readiness.\n\nForecaster 3 usefully highlights that ISL reduces dependence on local gateways and frames the remaining hurdle as tariff approval. I agree political will appears strong and that paperwork can be expedited. However, their framing may underplay other last‑mile items (payments/local pricing, customs/logistics for kits, LI/compliance implementation), any one of which could slip a launch into early July.\n\nNet: I’m between them. I view the approvals and trial as strong positive evidence, stronger than Forecaster 2 allows, but I also think the remaining operational steps make >80% a bit too high without concrete signs (pricing live, orders open).",
    "rationale": "Since my initial 80%, two considerations nudge me down: (1) it’s mid‑May and the publicly signaled May launch hasn’t materialized yet, increasing the chance of a June—or slight post‑June—slip; (2) plausible remaining gates (tariff plan approval, payments/tax setup, kit import/logistics, and any LI/compliance validation) could each consume weeks. The mentioned U.S. Senate inquiry adds some headline risk but is unlikely to be a direct blocker.\n\nBalancing that against strong pro‑launch signals—BTRC licenses granted Apr 30, prior public trial, and explicit government/SpaceX intent for near‑term service—still leaves a better‑than‑even chance the map flips to Available in June. Starlink often updates the map concurrent with opening orders, which can happen quickly once pricing and billing go live.\n\nI would move up on evidence of tariff/pricing approval or orders opening for Bangladeshi addresses; I would move down if June begins with no tangible launch steps or credible reports of regulatory/operational snags.",
