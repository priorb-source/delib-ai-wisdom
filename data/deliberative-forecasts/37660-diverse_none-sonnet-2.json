    "review": "The other forecasters raise several important points that strengthen the bearish case. Most critically, Forecaster 2 identifies that Starlink's map initially showed a Q3 2024 target for Sri Lanka - a deadline that has been missed by multiple quarters. This is concrete evidence of delays beyond what I initially considered. The fact that an explicit target was set and then missed by 6+ months is a stronger negative signal than simply noting that 9 months have passed since licensing. Forecaster 3's detailed breakdown of remaining operational hurdles (device approvals, taxation/billing, import logistics, local gateway permissions) provides useful texture, though these align with the 'infrastructure challenges' I already factored in. All three forecasters converge on the same key dynamics: license approval is positive but insufficient, the 9-month delay since licensing is concerning, and the 6-week window is very tight. The convergence of our forecasts in the 25-35% range suggests we're capturing the essential evidence correctly.",
    "rationale": "After reviewing the other analyses, I'm maintaining my forecast at 25%. The missed Q3 2024 target date is the most significant new information, and it reinforces rather than contradicts my initial reasoning. The pattern is now even clearer: initial target → missed by 6+ months → still no availability → only 6 weeks remaining. This trajectory strongly favors 'No.' While Forecasters 2 and 3 are slightly higher at 32-35%, the difference is marginal and within reasonable interpretation of the same evidence. My 25% already accounts for the possibility of a late-June activation since the license exists and Starlink can update maps quickly once operational barriers are cleared. However, the concrete fact of a multi-quarter delay from the initial target date, combined with no visible progress indicators in the final weeks, suggests that whatever obstacles existed in Q3 2024 likely persist. The status quo inertia of 'not available' after 9 months is powerful evidence against a dramatic shift in the next 6 weeks. I'm not going lower because the license does represent significant progress and eliminates the risk of regulatory prohibition, and 6 weeks, while short, is technically sufficient for a map update if all operational pieces suddenly fall into place.",
