    "review": "The two other forecasters and I have reached a strong consensus, with all of us initially forecasting a 15% probability. We all agree on the core drivers of this forecast: the powerful inertia of the status quo with Sheikh Hasina in exile, the slow and politically sensitive nature of extradition (evidenced by India's months-long non-response), and the extreme personal risk Sheikh Hasina would face upon a voluntary return due to severe pending legal charges. \n\nHowever, the other analysts introduced two points that sharpen the potential pathways to a 'Yes' outcome. Forecaster 2 persuasively argued that the final probe report from the International Crimes Tribunal, expected in May, will add significant legal weight to Bangladesh's extradition request, creating a diplomatic focal point that will be harder for India to ignore. Forecaster 3 provided a compelling political and psychological argument that the return of Hasina's rival, Khaleda Zia, might provoke Hasina into a high-risk voluntary return to avoid political irrelevance. My initial analysis viewed Zia's return primarily as increasing the danger for Hasina, but Forecaster 3's point about it being a potential catalyst for action is a convincing counter-perspective.",
    "rationale": "After reviewing my peers' analyses, I am making a modest upward revision to my forecast. While the fundamental barriers to Sheikh Hasina's return remain formidable, the other forecasters have articulated plausible, near-term catalysts that I had previously underweighted. The imminent finalization of the ICT's probe report (per Forecaster 2) creates a specific event that will increase diplomatic pressure on India. Simultaneously, the new political dynamic created by Khaleda Zia's return (per Forecaster 3) provides a stronger rationale for a voluntary, if risky, return by Hasina to maintain her political relevance. \n\nThese two factors, one impacting the 'extradition' path and the other the 'voluntary return' path, make a break from the status quo within the next seven weeks slightly more probable than I initially assessed. The core assumption remains that a 'No' outcome is most likely, as these catalysts still need to overcome significant diplomatic and personal-risk hurdles. However, they add enough volatility and credible mechanisms for a 'Yes' outcome to warrant a small increase in my forecast. I am therefore adjusting my probability from 15% to 20%.",
