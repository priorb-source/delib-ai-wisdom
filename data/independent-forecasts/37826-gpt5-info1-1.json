  "information": "Following a terrorist attack in Pahalgam, Jammu and Kashmir on April 22, 2025, which killed 26 tourists, the Indian government took several actions against Pakistan. These included suspending the Indus Water Treaty, closing the Attari-Wagah border, and banning the SAARC visa scheme for Pakistan. The Indian military launched 'Operation Sindoor' (also referred to as 'Operation Sundar'), a series of targeted strikes against what were described as terrorist camps in Pakistan-occupied Kashmir and Pakistan proper. Indian sources reported that over 100 terrorists were killed in these operations, including high-value targets. The operation targeted infrastructure linked to groups like Lashkar-e-Taiba and Jaish-e-Mohammed.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "About 40 days (until July 1, 2025)",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No attack in Pakistan proper in June; operations taper to intelligence, diplomatic, and LOC/AJK activity rather than new strikes in Sindh, Baluchistan, Punjab, or KP.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "After April–May punitive actions, New Delhi declares the operation’s main objectives achieved and shifts to pressure via diplomacy/economics and limited actions confined to Pakistan-administered Kashmir. International partners press for restraint; Islamabad avoids major provocations, and any border firing remains either on the LoC/AJK side or conducted by non–Armed Forces units (e.g., BSF), thus not meeting criteria.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "A fresh high-casualty attack inside India or major infiltration attempt in late May/June prompts a follow-on ‘surgical’ strike by the Indian Army/Air Force against camps or leadership targets in KP (e.g., Balakot-style), Punjab, Sindh, or Baluchistan; or Indian Army artillery/loitering munitions engage Pakistani military targets across the IB into Pakistani Punjab during a crisis, with credible attribution to the Armed Forces.",
    "rationale": "- What we know: The April 22 Pahalgam attack (26 tourists killed) triggered severe Indian measures: suspension of the Indus Water Treaty, closure of Attari-Wagah, and a ban on SAARC visas for Pakistan. Your RA reports India launched ‘Operation Sindoor/Sundar’ with targeted strikes on terrorist infrastructure in Pakistan-occupied Kashmir and reportedly in Pakistan proper, claiming >100 militants killed. That implies elevated willingness and capability to hit across the border, including beyond AJK/GB, akin to India’s 2019 Balakot precedent (KP, i.e., Pakistan proper).\n- Status quo bias: Historically, after a major punitive strike, both sides face heavy international pressure to de-escalate. Absent a new trigger, India tends to consolidate gains and shift to economic/diplomatic coercion and counter-infiltration rather than maintain a drumbeat of cross-border kinetic actions into Pakistan proper. That makes “No in June” the base case.\n- Why not lower: The bar to a June strike is not extremely high. Precedent exists (Balakot 2019). India has already crossed some thresholds per RA, suggesting a higher hazard rate in the near term. Any late-May/June incident (e.g., another attack on civilians or soldiers) or actionable intel on high-value targets in KP/Punjab could produce a discrete air or stand-off strike. Even limited Army fires into Pakistani Punjab would qualify if attributable to the Armed Forces.\n- Why not higher: Several dampeners apply. (1) International mediation tends to kick in after initial retaliation, pushing for a cooling-off period. (2) If India believes it already re-established deterrence in April–May, the marginal utility of another Pakistan-proper strike in June is low relative to escalation risks. (3) Many ongoing kinetic exchanges occur on the LoC into AJK/GB, which do not meet the question’s geographic criterion. (4) Border firing along the International Border is often conducted by the BSF (a paramilitary, not part of the Armed Forces), which would not satisfy the criterion unless the Army/Air Force is clearly responsible. (5) Covert actions may lack public, credible attribution to the Indian Armed Forces, risking non-resolution.\n- What would move me up: Credible reports of (a) fresh mass-casualty attacks inside India in late May/June attributed to Pakistan-based groups; (b) Indian leadership explicitly signaling continued cross-border kinetic action into Pakistan proper; (c) visible military preparations—airspace restrictions, forward deployment of strike assets, publicized evacuation orders near the IB; (d) specific intel leaks naming targets in KP/Punjab/Baluchistan; (e) breakdown of backchannel talks/ceasefire.\n- What would move me down: Public statements that Operation Sindoor/Sundar has concluded; restoration or softening of punitive economic/diplomatic steps; successful international mediation; reaffirmed ceasefire protocols; lack of major provocations through late May; a shift of reported strikes solely to AJK/GB or within Indian territory.\nOverall: Elevated but still sub-50% risk window. The most likely path is a pause after initial retaliation, absent a new trigger that would justify a June strike into Pakistan proper.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill the Indian Armed Forces execute a kinetic attack in Pakistan proper in June 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nWikipedia: [2025 India–Pakistan conflict](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2025_India%E2%80%93Pakistan_conflict)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if after May 31, 2025 and before July 1, 2025 the Indian Armed Forces execute a kinetic attack on targets in one of the following provinces of Pakistan: Sindh, Baluchistan, Punjab, or Khyber Pakhtunkhwa.\n\nTo count, an attack must be [kinetic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kinetic_military_action), using explosive weaponry or physical violence. Non-kinetic actions such as a cyberattack would not count, even one resulting in deaths.\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nFollowing a terrorist attack in Pahalgam, Jammu and Kashmir on April 22, 2025, which killed 26 tourists, the Indian government took several actions against Pakistan.

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
