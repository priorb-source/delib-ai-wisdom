    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Less than 2 months, as the resolution date is July 1, 2025.",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No. The current US State Department travel advisory for Tanzania is 'Level 2: Exercise Increased Caution', and it is expected to remain so if current conditions persist.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "The security situation in Tanzania remains stable over the next two months. Incidents of crime and terrorism threats do not escalate significantly beyond their current levels, and the US State Department does not see a need to update the country-wide advisory from Level 2.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "A significant event occurs, such as a large-scale terrorist attack in a major city or tourist area like Dar es Salaam or Zanzibar, or a dramatic and sustained spike in violent crime targeting foreigners. This event prompts a rapid reassessment by the US State Department, leading to an upgrade to 'Level 3 – Reconsider Travel' before the deadline.",
    "rationale": "My forecast is based on the significant inertia of State Department travel advisories and the very short time frame remaining until the question resolves. The current advisory for Tanzania is Level 2, and these ratings are typically only changed in response to a material and sustained deterioration of the security environment.\n\nThe primary risks cited for Tanzania, terrorism and crime, are already factored into the current Level 2 advisory. The terrorism risk is most acute near the Mozambique border, for which a specific 'Level 4 – Do Not Travel' advisory is already in place. For the entire country's advisory to be elevated to Level 3, the threat would need to become more widespread and directly impact areas frequented by American citizens, something not indicated by current open-source information. The research assistant's report of 'No additional information' reinforces this, suggesting a lack of new intelligence pointing to an imminent escalation.\n\nMy probability is not lower than 10% because the underlying risks are real and the security situation, particularly concerning terrorist spillover from Mozambique, is volatile. A single, high-impact event could trigger a rapid change in the advisory. \n\nMy probability is not higher than 10% because, absent a major triggering event, the bureaucratic process and the need for evidence of a sustained change make an upgrade within the next eight weeks highly unlikely. The world generally changes slowly, and the high bar for changing a country-wide advisory favors the status quo.\n\nI would increase my forecast if credible intelligence emerged of specific threats to tourist areas or a series of high-profile violent crimes against foreigners. Conversely, with each passing week without such a triggering event, my confidence in a 'No' outcome would increase.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill Tanzania receive a \"Level 3 – Reconsider Travel\" travel advisory from the US State Department before July 1, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nTravel and Tour World: [Travel Advisory for Tanzania: How Increased Crime and Terrorism Threats Impact Tourists in Popular African Destinations](https://www.travelandtourworld.com/news/article/travel-advisory-for-tanzania-how-increased-crime-and-terrorism-threats-impact-tourists-in-popular-african-destinations/)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if the country of Tanzania has received a Level 3 [travel advisory](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/International-Travel-Country-Information-Pages/Tanzania.html) from the US Department of State before July 1, 2025.\n\n\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nNo additional information available.\n\nToday is 2025-05-02.\n\nBefore answering you think:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n(e) You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
