    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "~38 days (until June 1, 2025)",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No — the HTS does not currently list a blanket 17% duty on products of Israel; most IL (Israel FTA) rates are Free, and any changes would need explicit new HTS provisions.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "The US does not introduce a Chapter 99 (or other) HTS provision setting a 17% duty applying to Israel by June 1, 2025; or any action taken uses a different rate, targets only specific products, or comes after June 1. The US may instead use export controls, sanctions, procurement restrictions, or suspend some FTA benefits without setting a uniform 17% rate.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "The US adds an HTS Chapter 99 (or note) establishing an across-the-board additional duty of 17% on products of Israel (possibly marked as suspended), or otherwise amends the HTS so the applicable provision explicitly lists +17% for Israel by June 1, 2025.",
    "rationale": "- Baseline and inertia: As of the latest stable information prior to my cutoff, Israel enjoys extensive duty-free treatment under the US‑Israel FTA (IL special rates often Free). Creating a uniform 17% rate would be a significant deviation from normal US practice, which typically either removes FTA preferences (reverting to varying MFN rates) or imposes targeted Section 301/232/201 duties at product-level lists, often at 10%, 25%, etc., not a novel across-the-board 17%.\n- Timing: Only ~5.5 weeks remain. Large, novel tariff actions generally involve a public process (USTR investigation or presidential proclamation under existing authority) and HTS amendments published by USITC; while emergency actions are possible, the short runway and lack of widely signaled process make a June 1 listing less likely.\n- Specificity of 17%: The exact 17% figure is unusual in US tariff practice for broad measures. If the US were to move, a round number (10%, 25%) or reversion to MFN rates seems more probable. This lowers the chance that, even if a measure is listed, it will be precisely 17%.\n- Politics: Broad tariffs on a close ally would be a major policy step with domestic political ramifications. Policymakers could favor narrower sectoral measures or non-tariff tools. This supports a No as the status quo outcome.\n- Counter-considerations: The referenced Times of Israel report suggests industry concern about new US tariffs, implying some live policy discussion. The resolution accepts a listing even if suspended, which slightly raises the probability: the US could publish a 17% measure but suspend its application, still satisfying the criterion.\n- Why not higher: No corroborated public signal of a 17% HTS listing; the unusual rate; the short timeline; and the rarity of sweeping tariffs on Israel.\n- Why not lower: Press reporting points to non-zero risk of US tariff action; rapid Chapter 99 additions have precedent; and the resolution counts suspended listings.\n- What would raise my forecast: (1) USTR/White House announcement or Federal Register notice proposing a 17% additional duty on Israeli goods; (2) draft HTS language or Chapter 99 subheading circulating; (3) credible leaks naming 17% specifically; (4) explicit move to suspend IL FTA benefits paired with a uniform 17% rate.\n- What would lower my forecast: (1) Official statements ruling out tariffs; (2) concrete moves toward alternative measures (sanctions/export controls) instead of tariffs; (3) indications of a different rate (e.g., 10% or 25%) or only product-specific actions; (4) lack of any procedural steps by mid‑May.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill the US government's harmonized tarifff schedule list the tariff on Israel as 17% on June 1, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nTimes of Israel: [Israeli exports to US will take annual $2.3B hit under tariffs, industrial org warns](https://www.timesofisrael.com/israeli-exports-to-us-will-take-2-3-billion-hit-under-tariffs-industrialist-org-warns/)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if the duty provided in the applicable subheading is + 17% for Israel at the American government's [harmonized tariff schedule](https://hts.usitc.gov/search?query=israel) when accessed by Metaculus on or after June 1, 2025.\n\nWhether the provision is listed as suspended will not affect resolution.\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nNo additional information available.\n\nToday is 2025-04-24.\n\nBefore answering you think:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n(e) You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
