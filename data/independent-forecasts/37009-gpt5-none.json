    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "About 10 days (until April 30, 2025, inclusive, since the question is ‘before May 1’)",

    "no_outcome_scenario": "Stevens continues focusing on her House role, issues no announcement, or publicly declines to run while Democrats coalesce around another candidate before May 1.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Stevens releases a formal statement or holds an event declaring a 2026 Michigan Senate run (e.g., press release, interview, campaign video) within the next 10 days.",
    "rationale": "- Timing: With only ~10 days left, the base rate for a specific named individual announcing within that window is modest unless there are clear signals. I do not have reports indicating Stevens has formed an exploratory committee, hired Senate-level staff, scheduled a launch, or teased an imminent decision. Absent such indicators, the status quo (no announcement) deserves extra weight. \n- Context from CNN: The April 10 report that Whitmer and Buttigieg (and, per the URL, likely Kristen McDonald Rivet) have bowed out does marginally increase the chance that other Democrats—including House members like Stevens—step forward. Open-seat dynamics can pull candidates in earlier than usual. However, thinning of top-tier options does not by itself imply Stevens will announce within the next 10 days; typically, such moves are preceded by leaks or trial balloons. \n- Lack of corroborating signals: There’s no assistant-provided intel suggesting imminent activity by Stevens (no domain launches, FEC filings paired with clear public statements, staff hires, or media reports hinting at a launch window). \n- Why not higher: No visible pre-launch indicators; very short runway; potential for other statewide figures (e.g., Benson, Nessel, Gilchrist, McMorrow, Dingell) to move first and deter a quick Stevens bid. \n- Why not lower: The seat appears open and important, and several prominent figures have passed, leaving space for a credible, well-funded suburban Detroit Democrat like Stevens. If she has been privately preparing, a late-April rollout is plausible. \n- What would move me up: Credible reporting that she’s making calls to donors, hiring a Senate campaign team, scheduling a Detroit-area kickoff, registering or publicly promoting a Senate-specific website or social handles, or a leak to local press about an imminent launch. \n- What would move me down: A public no from Stevens; a clear, strong Democratic entry (with endorsements) that rapidly consolidates support; or reliable reporting that Stevens will remain in the House for 2026.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill Haley Stevens announce her candidacy for US Senator from Michigan before May 1, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nCNN: [Democrats lose another top contender for US Senate seat in Michigan after Whitmer and Buttigieg bow out](https://www.cnn.com/2025/04/10/politics/michigan-senate-race-democrats-mcdonald-rivet/index.html)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if Haley Stevens announces her candidacy for US Senator from Michigan before May 1, 2025. If no such announcement has been made before that date, the question resolves as **No**.\n\n\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nNo additional information available.\n\nToday is 2025-04-21.\n\nBefore answering you think:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n(e) You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
