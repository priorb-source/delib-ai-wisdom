    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Approximately 2 months (until July 1, 2025).",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No. The most recently reported number is 295, which is below the threshold of 300. If no more UN staff are reported killed, the outcome will be No.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "A comprehensive and lasting ceasefire is implemented in May or June 2025, leading to a halt in UN staff casualties, with fewer than 5 additional fatalities reported. Alternatively, OCHA could cease publishing its impact snapshots, freezing the last reported number at 295.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "The conflict continues through May and June 2025, and at least 5 additional UN staff fatalities are reported by OCHA. This could result from ongoing hostilities, a single mass-casualty event involving a UN facility, or the verification of deaths that occurred prior to the last report.",
    "rationale": "The current reported number of UN staff fatalities stands at 295 as of April 30, 2025, just 5 short of the 300 threshold. The resolution period extends for nearly two more months, until July 1, 2025. The core of this forecast rests on the high probability that the conflict will continue, and that even a low rate of new casualties will be sufficient to cross the threshold. The status quo is an active conflict that has already led to an unprecedented number of UN fatalities. For the outcome to be 'No', there would need to be a near-complete cessation of events causing UN staff deaths for a sustained two-month period. This would likely require a durable ceasefire, which, while diplomatically sought, remains uncertain. My forecast is not higher than 85% because a breakthrough ceasefire or a significant de-escalation of the conflict remains a possibility, however small. Political pressure or strategic shifts could alter the operational environment and improve safety for UN staff. My forecast is not lower because the threshold is incredibly close. The risk to UN personnel operating in Gaza is extreme, and it is highly probable that at least 5 more fatalities will be recorded over a two-month period under current or even slightly de-escalated conditions. A single strike on a UN-run shelter or convoy could resolve this question to 'Yes' in an instant. I would increase my forecast if ceasefire negotiations stall completely or if there is a major escalation in the conflict. I would decrease my forecast if a credible, long-term ceasefire is announced and appears to be holding.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill 300 or more UN staff be reported to be killed in Gaza according to UN's OCHA in its final impact snapshot before July 1, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nSee accompanying Humanitarian update [here](https://www.ochaopt.org/content/humanitarian-situation-update-284-gaza-strip).\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if the number of reported UN staff killed in Gaza is greater than or equal to 300 according to the most recent impact snapshot for the Gaza Strip posted [here](https://www.ochaopt.org/publications) by the United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs as of July 1, 2025. For example, a snapshot dated April 30, 2025, [reports](https://www.ochaopt.org/content/reported-impact-snapshot-gaza-strip-30-april-2025) 295 UN staff fatalities.\n\nIf OCHA stops posting new updates, this resolves as the most recent number, which as of the time of this question would be the impact snapshot posted on April 30, 2025.\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nNo additional information available.\n\nToday is 2025-05-05.\n\nBefore answering you think:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n(e) You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
