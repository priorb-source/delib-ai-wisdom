    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Approximately 32 days (until July 1, 2025)",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Trump does not travel to Russia. Any engagement with Putin happens by phone or in a third country (e.g., Geneva, Helsinki, the Gulf), or is postponed. The White House schedule fills with other events (G7/NATO/preplanned trips), and no credible reporting emerges of Russia-bound travel.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "A rapidly arranged summit in Moscow, St. Petersburg, or Sochi to negotiate or announce a Ukraine ceasefire or broader deal; or an unusual brief stop on Russian soil that counts as a personal visit (e.g., aircraft landing with the President disembarking).",
    "rationale": "- Time window is short and already open (May 19–June 30). With roughly a month left, any presidential trip to Russia would normally show strong advance signals (bilateral announcements, logistics leaks). None are evident per the assistant’s report (no additional information available).  \n- Base rates: US presidents seldom visit Russia, and almost never on very short notice without prior signaling. Trump did not visit Russia in his first term; recent US-Russia relations are exceptionally strained due to the Ukraine war, sanctions, and domestic political optics—factors that strongly disincentivize a Russia visit versus a neutral venue.  \n- Optics and security: A June visit to Russia would face extraordinary political backlash and security complexity; a neutral location would capture nearly all diplomatic benefits with far fewer costs.  \n- Status quo bias: In international diplomacy, especially amid conflict, the default is no rapid, controversial travel. Neutral-site summits are standard (e.g., Helsinki 2018).  \nWhy not higher: Lack of any preparatory reporting; high political/optical costs; strong neutral-venue precedent; compressed timeline.  \nWhy not lower: Trump’s unpredictability and appetite for headline-grabbing moves; a breakthrough in Ukraine talks could spur an unconventional decision, and heads of state can, in rare cases, move quickly.  \nWhat would move me up: Credible reports from the White House/Kremlin about a Russia-based meeting; flight planning/logistics leaks; Trump explicitly signaling intent to go to Russia; a near-term ceasefire framework tied to an in-Russia signing.  \nWhat would move me down: Firm denials from either side; a publicly announced neutral-site meeting; deterioration in security conditions; a published June schedule that leaves no room for such a trip.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill Donald Trump visit Russia before July 1, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nWikipedia: [List of international presidential trips made by Donald Trump](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_international_presidential_trips_made_by_Donald_Trump)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if, after May 19, 2025 and before July 1, 2025, President Donald Trump personally visits Russia.\n\n\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nNo additional information available.\n\nToday is 2025-05-30.\n\nBefore answering you think:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n(e) You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
