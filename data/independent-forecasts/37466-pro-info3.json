  "information": "The name 'Gulf of Mexico' has been established for centuries, dating back to the 16th century. The body of water is bordered by the United States, Mexico, and Cuba and is considered international waters under the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea. A previous proposal to rename it the 'Gulf of America' in 2012 was not approved. The website in question, WorldAtlas.com, is a Canadian-based company. While its main North America map currently displays 'Gulf of Mexico', the title of its specific article on the gulf reads: 'Gulf Of Mexico (Gulf of America)'.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Less than 2 months.",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No. The map on WorldAtlas.com will continue to display the name 'Gulf of Mexico'.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "WorldAtlas.com's editorial team makes no changes to its main North America map, and the label for the body of water remains 'Gulf of Mexico' through the resolution date.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Following an internal editorial decision, a website update, or in error, WorldAtlas.com changes the label on its North America map from 'Gulf of Mexico' to 'Gulf of America' or a variation including that name.",
    "rationale": "My forecast is heavily weighted towards the status quo. Geographical names for major bodies of water are extremely stable and have immense historical inertia; the name 'Gulf of Mexico' has been in standard use for centuries. The timeframe for this question is very short, leaving little time for a significant editorial change to be debated and implemented. As a Canadian-based company covering a body of water bordered by three nations (the US, Mexico, and Cuba), WorldAtlas is likely to adhere to established, internationally recognized nomenclature rather than a nationalistic alternative. The failure of a previous renaming proposal in 2012 further indicates a lack of significant momentum for the change. The primary reason my forecast is not lower than 2% is that WorldAtlas.com already parenthetically acknowledges the alternative name in its article title ('Gulf Of Mexico (Gulf of America)'). This shows an awareness of the name within the organization, creating a non-zero possibility that it could be adopted on the map, whether by deliberate choice, a technical error during a site update, or in response to some sudden, unforeseen political event. I would increase my forecast if a high-profile political campaign to rename the Gulf emerged. I would decrease it as the deadline approaches with no change.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill WorldAtlas.com display the body of water northwest of the Caribbean Sea as the Gulf of America before July 1, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nWorld Atlas article: [Gulf Of Mexico (Gulf of America)](https://www.worldatlas.com/gulfs/gulf-of-mexico.html)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if, before July 1, 2025, the World Atlas website at its [North America](https://www.worldatlas.com/webimage/countrys/na.htm) page displays the body of water west of Florida, south of Louisiana and north of the Yucatán Peninsula as the Gulf of America. (At the time of this question, the name displayed is the Gulf of Mexico.)\n\nIn case both names are used, for example \"Gulf of America formerly known as Gulf of Mexico,\" this question resolves as Yes. Note that verification will be from Metaculus admins accessing the webpage from the United States and that therefore resolution will be based on how the page appears when accessed from that location.\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nThe name 'Gulf of Mexico' has been established for centuries, dating back to the 16th century. The body of water is bordered by the United States, Mexico, and Cuba and is considered international waters under the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea. A previous proposal to rename it the 'Gulf of America' in 2012 was not approved. The website in question, WorldAtlas.com, is a Canadian-based company. While its main North America map currently displays 'Gulf of Mexico', the title of its specific article on the gulf reads: 'Gulf Of Mexico (Gulf of America)'.\n\nToday is 2025-05-08.\n\nBefore answering you think:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n(e) You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
