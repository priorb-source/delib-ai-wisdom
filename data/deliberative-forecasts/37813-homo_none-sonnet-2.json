    "review": "The other forecasters provide valuable additional considerations. Forecaster 2 raises an important seasonality argument about June being a summer month with better weather and more outdoor activity, which could increase UFO reports generally. However, this is somewhat undercut by the fact that December 2024 (winter in Northern Hemisphere) had 6 cube reports. Forecaster 3 provides helpful context by calculating NUFORC's average reporting rate (~300 reports/month) and suggesting cube shapes might typically occur 1-3 times per month, with December's 6 being elevated. Both forecasters interpret 'rare' as meaning the 6-report month was unusual, not that cube shapes only appear a few times per year total. This is a more optimistic interpretation than I initially considered - they're suggesting 'rare' describes December's volume rather than cube shapes being nearly absent. All three forecasts cluster in the 55-70% range, suggesting convergent reasoning with different weightings on uncertainty.",
    "rationale": "After reviewing the other analyses, I believe my initial 55% was slightly too conservative. The key interpretive question is what 'rare in the history of NUFORC' means. I initially leaned toward cube shapes being very infrequent (maybe a few times per year), but the other forecasters make a compelling case that 'rare' describes December's 6 reports being unusually high, not cube shapes being extremely scarce. If December's 6 was elevated and typical months see 1-3 cube reports, then the probability of at least one in June is considerably higher. The binary threshold (only need 1 report) is crucial here. However, I'm not moving all the way to 70% because: (1) we lack data on Jan-May 2025 to confirm cube reports continued after December, (2) December could still be a statistical outlier even if not unprecedented, and (3) 'rare' does signal these are uncommon regardless of the exact interpretation. Forecaster 2's seasonality point is interesting but December's high count suggests seasonality may not be determinative. Balancing these considerations, I'm updating moderately upward to 62%, reflecting increased confidence that cube reports occur regularly enough that June 2025 likely sees at least one, while maintaining some caution given explicit terminology about rarity.",
