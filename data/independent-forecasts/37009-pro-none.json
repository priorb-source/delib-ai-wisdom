    "status_quo_outcome": "No. Haley Stevens has not announced her candidacy, and if the current situation persists without any action from her, she will not have announced by the deadline.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Haley Stevens continues her deliberations past the May 1, 2025 deadline. She may decide the timing isn't right for a demanding statewide Senate campaign, or she may simply be taking more time to build her campaign infrastructure before a formal launch later in the year.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Capitalizing on the recent news of other prominent Democrats declining to run and facing pressure from the party to consolidate support, Haley Stevens' team schedules a press conference or releases a video in the last week of April to formally launch her US Senate campaign.",
    "rationale": "The political context is the most significant factor in this forecast. The provided CNN article indicates that the field of top-tier Democratic candidates for the Michigan Senate seat is rapidly clearing, which dramatically increases the political logic and pressure for a prominent figure like Rep. Stevens to run. The status quo is 'no announcement,' but this is a highly unstable status quo given the new political vacuum. An open Senate seat in a critical swing state like Michigan is a rare opportunity, and the party will be eager to avoid a protracted and messy primary by coalescing around a strong candidate quickly. The primary argument against an announcement is the very tight timeline of less than 10 days. However, a potential campaign of this magnitude would have been in the planning stages for months, and the recent news likely acts as a catalyst to simply move up a planned announcement. My forecast is not higher because a Senate run is a monumental personal and professional decision, and the short timeline leaves little room for last-minute logistical delays or continued indecision. She may also strategically choose a launch date later in May for reasons not publicly known. My forecast is not lower because the political opportunity is exceptionally clear and compelling. For an ambitious politician, this is a prime moment to act, and waiting risks allowing another candidate to seize the momentum. I would increase my forecast if there were leaks from her staff or FEC filings indicating a run. I would decrease it if she made a public statement emphasizing a long deliberation process or if another major Democratic candidate unexpectedly entered the race.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill Haley Stevens announce her candidacy for US Senator from Michigan before May 1, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nCNN: [Democrats lose another top contender for US Senate seat in Michigan after Whitmer and Buttigieg bow out](https://www.cnn.com/2025/04/10/politics/michigan-senate-race-democrats-mcdonald-rivet/index.html)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if Haley Stevens announces her candidacy for US Senator from Michigan before May 1, 2025. If no such announcement has been made before that date, the question resolves as **No**.\n\n\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nNo additional information available.\n\nToday is 2025-04-21.\n\nBefore answering you think:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n(e) You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
