    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Suarez schedules a mid-to-late June event and explicitly says he is running (or files and publicly confirms), timing the launch to capture end-of-Q2 fundraising momentum.",
    "rationale": "- Baseline/status quo: With only ~3.5 weeks left and no concrete reports of an imminent launch (staff hires, venue on calendar, filings), the default is that no announcement occurs before July 1. Most floated candidates never formally declare on the short timeline implied by a single “weighing a bid” article. \n- Timing considerations that raise the odds: For a 2026 gubernatorial race, announcements 12–16 months ahead are common, and the end of Q2 (June 30) is a natural, strategically attractive launch window to show an early fundraising haul. The Axios report in early May suggests active consideration, which could culminate in a June announcement. \n- Considerations that lower the odds: Suarez’s 2023 presidential bid fizzled and he may be more cautious about launching without clear donor/endorsement signals. He may face strong potential rivals and could prefer to wait to assess the field and build a statewide committee before a formal candidacy. Exploratory steps or PAC-building do not meet the resolution criterion. \n- Why not higher: We lack corroborating signals (e.g., leaks of a date/venue, senior campaign hires, formal paperwork accompanied by public confirmation). Without such signals, most “considering” stories don’t convert to a launch within weeks. \n- Why not lower: June is a plausible, even attractive, month to announce for a 2026 run, and the Axios piece implies real interest. That keeps a non-trivial probability on a June launch. \n- What would move me up: Credible reporting of a scheduled announcement event; confirmed senior staff hires; official filings coupled with public statements; donor emails teasing a June launch. \n- What would move me down: Public denial or indication he’s delaying; major rival announces this month and he signals he’ll wait; negative ethics/legal news; formation of a committee without an explicit candidacy paired with messaging about deciding “later this year.” \n- Research assistant summary: No additional info beyond the Axios item; thus, no concrete imminent-launch signals to push probability higher.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill Francis Suarez announce his candidacy for Florida governor before July 1, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nAxios: [Miami mayor weighs gubernatorial bid](https://www.axios.com/2025/05/02/florida-governor-miami-mayor-francis-suarez)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if Francis Suarez announces his candidacy for governor of Florida before July 1, 2025. If no such announcement has been made before that date, the question resolves as **No**.\n\n\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nNo additional information available.\n\nToday is 2025-06-05.\n\nBefore answering you think:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n(e) You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
