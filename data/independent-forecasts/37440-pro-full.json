  "information": "Several bills concerning voter citizenship verification were considered in Florida's legislature. HB 831 would require state-issued IDs to indicate non-citizen status. HB 1381 would require voters to provide proof of citizenship, such as a passport or birth certificate, for new or updated registrations. SB 1330 would require first-time voters to present similar documentation. The 2025 regular legislative session concluded without enacting these bills. A comprehensive bill containing similar provisions, CS/HB 1381, was withdrawn from consideration on May 3, 2025. An extended legislative session, constitutionally required to pass the state budget, began on May 12, 2025.\n\nFlorida's legislature is controlled by a Republican supermajority in both chambers. Governor Ron DeSantis has a history of supporting and signing legislation described as strengthening election integrity. In May 2025, DeSantis signed a law that creates new hurdles for the citizens' initiative process, including a ban on non-citizens and non-residents from gathering signatures for petitions. This followed the enactment of SB 7016 in April 2025, which also restricts ballot initiatives.\n\nThe push for expanded voter citizenship verification in Florida aligns with a broader national trend. The U.S. House of Representatives passed the Safeguard American Voter Eligibility (SAVE) Act, which would require proof of citizenship for voter registration nationwide, though it is unlikely to pass the Senate. Separately, President Donald Trump signed an executive order to impose stricter verification requirements. Other states have also advanced similar legislation; Wyoming passed a law requiring proof of citizenship to vote that is set to become effective on July 1, and a bill in Tennessee to create a citizenship verification portal for election workers has advanced in its state house.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Less than 2 months.",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No new legislation requiring expanded proof of citizenship for voters will be enacted in Florida before July 1, 2025. The state's existing voter registration requirements will remain unchanged.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "The Florida legislature's extended session remains focused on the state budget. No special session is called to address election laws. Supporters of the citizenship verification measure decide to wait and re-introduce legislation in the next regular session, which falls after this question's resolution date.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Governor DeSantis or the legislative leadership, motivated by the national political conversation or pressure from their base, calls a special session to address election integrity. Using the Republican supermajority, they quickly pass a revised version of the previously considered citizenship verification bill, and it is signed into law before the July 1, 2025 deadline.",
    "rationale": "My forecast is primarily driven by the legislative calendar and the recent status of the relevant bills. The 2025 regular legislative session concluded without passing any of the proposed voter citizenship verification bills. Crucially, a comprehensive version of this legislation, CS/HB 1381, was withdrawn from consideration on May 3, 2025. A bill being withdrawn, rather than simply failing to make it to a vote, is a strong signal that it lacked sufficient support or faced significant procedural or political obstacles. The current extended session is constitutionally mandated to pass the state budget, making it an unlikely venue for contentious, non-budgetary policy. The path to enactment before the July 1 deadline would almost certainly require a special session to be called by the Governor. While the political will for such legislation is high, evidenced by the Republican supermajority, Governor DeSantis's track record, and a similar national trend, these factors are insufficient to overcome the procedural reality that the primary window for passage in 2025 has closed. My probability is not lower than 15% because a special session, while unlikely, remains a possibility in Florida's political climate, and if one were called, the bill would likely pass swiftly. My probability is not higher because calling a special session for a bill that was just withdrawn would be an unusual step, and the timeline is extremely tight. For me to increase my forecast, I would need to see a public announcement from the Governor or legislative leaders about their intent to call a special session for this purpose. Conversely, my forecast would decrease as we approach the July 1 deadline with no such announcements.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nBefore July 1, 2025, will Florida enact legislation expanding its verification requirements of a voter's citizenship?\n\nQuestion background:\nTallahassee Democrat: [Florida may require proof of citizenship to vote under new legislation echoing Trump](https://www.tallahassee.com/story/news/local/state/2025/04/02/got-id-proof-of-citizenship-may-soon-be-needed-to-vote-in-florida/82756919007/)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if, before July 1, 2025, the state of Florida enacts legislation requiring voters to provide proof of US citizenship beyond the requirements at the time of this question, according to [credible sources](https://www.metaculus.com/faq/#definitions).\n\nAny subset of voters being required to provide such proof would count (for example if it only applied to first-time voter registrants or creating a new requirement for mail-in voters). An example of a bill that would count is [HB 831](https://www.flsenate.gov/Session/Bill/2025/831). This question resolves upon enactment; therefore other questions such as when the legislation takes effect or whether it survives court challenges and is implemented is immaterial to this question's resolution.\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nSeveral bills concerning voter citizenship verification were considered in Florida's legislature.

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any).
