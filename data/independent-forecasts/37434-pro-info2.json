  "information": "In December 2024, AquaBounty announced it was ceasing fish farming activities, shutting down its last operational facility, and culling its remaining fish stock. The company laid off \"substantially all\" of its staff at the site. With production halted, there is no operating cash inflow. Management has acknowledged that its capital-raising efforts have been unsuccessful for over a year and has stated it is \"assessing alternatives\" for its Ohio facility.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Less than 2 months. The question resolves on July 1, 2025.",
    "status_quo_outcome": "The company, having ceased all revenue-generating operations and failed to raise new capital, will exhaust its remaining cash reserves covering administrative and wind-down costs, leading to a bankruptcy filing to formalize the liquidation of its assets.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "AquaBounty secures a last-minute sale of its primary assets, such as the Ohio facility, for sufficient cash to cover all its liabilities and conduct a solvent wind-down without needing bankruptcy protection. Alternatively, a surprise investor provides enough capital to keep the corporate entity solvent beyond the July 1, 2025 deadline.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "The Board of Directors determines that a formal bankruptcy filing is the most orderly and legally prudent path to liquidate remaining assets and distribute proceeds to creditors. With no income and ongoing expenses, the company files for Chapter 7 or Chapter 11 protection to manage its insolvency.",
    "rationale": "My forecast is based on the company's own admissions and actions. The key information from my research is that AquaBounty has ceased all of its core business activities: it has stopped farming fish, closed its last facility, and laid off nearly all its staff. This means there is no operational revenue, and the company is purely in a wind-down mode, surviving on its remaining cash reserves. Management has also stated that efforts to raise capital have been unsuccessful for over a year, making a last-minute rescue highly improbable. Given these facts, the company is on a clear path to insolvency. A bankruptcy filing is the standard, legally-structured process for a public company in this situation to liquidate assets and settle with creditors. The status quo is a non-operating entity burning through its last funds, which almost invariably ends in bankruptcy.\n\nMy forecast is not higher than 85% because there remains a small possibility that the company could finalize a rapid asset sale (e.g., the Ohio facility) that provides enough cash to pay off creditors and dissolve without a formal bankruptcy filing. Additionally, the precise timing is uncertain; they might have just enough cash to last until shortly after the July 1, 2025 deadline.\n\nMy forecast is not lower than 85% because the fundamental conditions for survival—operations and funding—are absent. The cessation of the entire business is a terminal event, and the most logical and common outcome is a formal bankruptcy process. A turnaround or a solvent liquidation in under two months seems extremely unlikely.\n\nI would update my forecast towards 'No' if there were a public announcement of a binding, all-cash sale of its major assets or a new, secured financing agreement. I would update towards 'Yes' upon news of creditor lawsuits or any company statement explicitly mentioning strategic alternatives that include bankruptcy.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill AquaBounty Technologies file for bankruptcy before July 1, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\n[AquaBounty Technologies Announces Full Year 2024 Financial Results](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1603978/000160397825000012/aqb-20250327xex99_1.htm)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question will resolve as **Yes** if AquaBounty Technologies, Inc., files any petition for bankruptcy protection in the United States, under any chapter of the United States Bankruptcy Code, before July 1, 2025. The question will resolves on the filing of such a petition, not on whether any bankruptcy protection is granted by a court. If no such petition is filed by that date, this question will resolve as **No**.\n\n\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nIn December 2024, AquaBounty announced it was ceasing fish farming activities, shutting down its last operational facility, and culling its remaining fish stock. The company laid off \"substantially all\" of its staff at the site. With production halted, there is no operating cash inflow. Management has acknowledged that its capital-raising efforts have been unsuccessful for over a year and has stated it is \"assessing alternatives\" for its Ohio facility.\n\nToday is 2025-05-05.\n\nBefore answering you think:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n(e) You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
