  "information": "As of late May 2025, an International Monetary Fund (IMF) mission is in Beirut for formal negotiations with the Lebanese government. The first negotiating session took place on May 29-30, with a second round scheduled for June 10. According to officials, a draft 46-month Extended Fund Facility (EFF) worth approximately US$3 billion is being discussed. Lebanon's Finance Minister, Yassine Jaber, stated that there has been progress in the talks, describing them as being on a 'good track.' He also affirmed that the government's plan involves better collection of existing taxes rather than imposing new ones. The Lebanese negotiating team includes the Minister of Economy, the Governor of the Central Bank, and other experts, meeting with the IMF delegation led by Ernesto Rigo.\n\nThe IMF has conditioned an agreement on the implementation of several key reforms. While Lebanon has completed some prior actions, including passing amendments to the bank-secrecy law and establishing an electricity-tariff framework, significant obstacles remain. The passage of a bank-restructuring law and measures to control the cash economy are described as unresolved and politically contentious issues. The IMF has publicly characterized the progress in talks as 'slow' and has expressed specific concerns about provisions in the proposed banking reform law, including the composition of a 'Higher Banking Authority' and the scope of its powers.\n\nSeveral international actors are involved in Lebanon's economic recovery efforts. The European Union has announced that a 500 million euro aid payment is conditional on Lebanon restructuring its banking sector and securing an agreement with the IMF. Separately, the World Bank is in active discussions with Lebanese officials regarding a 'Lebanon Emergency Assistance Project' (LEAP) aimed at reconstruction. A meeting to present this project to donor countries and international institutions is scheduled for June 10. On the domestic front, Lebanese President Joseph Aoun has publicly emphasized the importance of reaching an agreement with the IMF before the summer of 2025.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Approximately one month, as the deadline is July 1, 2025.",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No. Despite ongoing talks, Lebanon's political factions fail to agree on the contentious reforms required by the IMF, particularly the bank-restructuring law, and the deadline passes without an agreement.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "The second round of negotiations on June 10 stalls over the specifics of the bank-restructuring law. Key political factions refuse to concede on the composition and powers of the 'Higher Banking Authority'. The IMF delegation concludes its mission stating that core conditions remain unmet, and the political will to bridge the gap does not materialize before the July 1 deadline.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Driven by severe economic desperation and the leverage of a conditional 500 million euro EU aid payment, Lebanon's political leadership forces a compromise on the bank-restructuring law in mid-June. Seeing this as a significant sign of commitment, the IMF agrees to the terms of the $3 billion Extended Fund Facility, and a deal is formally announced before the end of the month.",
    "rationale": "The forecast is weighted towards 'No' primarily due to the short one-month timeframe and the significant, politically contentious nature of the remaining reforms required by the IMF. The research indicates that while formal negotiations are active and a specific $3 billion deal is being discussed, progress is described by the IMF as 'slow'. The key obstacles, namely the bank-restructuring law and measures to control the cash economy, have been points of failure for years due to Lebanon's entrenched political gridlock. The status quo for Lebanon has been an inability to pass such difficult legislation.\n\nThe probability is not lower than 35% because there is tangible positive momentum. High-level negotiations are underway, key Lebanese officials have expressed public confidence, and significant external pressure from actors like the EU provides a powerful incentive for a breakthrough. The fact that a specific EFF is on the table marks a significant advance over previous stages.\n\nThe probability is not higher than 35% because the hurdles are substantial and historical precedent suggests that consensus on such divisive economic issues is very difficult to achieve in Lebanon, let alone within a single month. The IMF's explicit concerns about the draft banking law suggest the gap is still wide.\n\nI would increase my forecast if there were a credible public announcement that a compromise on the bank-restructuring law's key components had been reached among the main political blocs. I would decrease my forecast if the June 10 talks were publicly described as having stalled or if a key political leader openly rejected the proposed reforms.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill the IMF and Lebanon announce an agreement before July 1, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\n[Lebanon finance minister confident of a new deal with IMF to help crumbling economy](https://www.newarab.com/news/lebanon-finance-minister-confident-new-deal-imf)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if Lebanon and the International Monetary Fund announce any economic agreement between the two entities signed after the launch of this question and before July 1, 2025. In order to count, it must involve the IMF agreeing to provide money to Lebanon, whether through loans, grants, or any other means.\n\n\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nAs of late May 2025, an International Monetary Fund (IMF) mission is in Beirut for formal negotiations with the Lebanese government.

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower.
