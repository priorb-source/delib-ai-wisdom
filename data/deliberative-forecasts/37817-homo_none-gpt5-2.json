    "review": "Both forecasters reinforced key constraints I also noted: small base network, short lead time for adding routes, and dependence on subsidized/seasonal service. They added two useful emphases: (1) clearing the threshold likely requires multiple simultaneous resumptions (e.g., a Japan route plus a second Korea city), and (2) the downside risk that Yap may not be operating in July, which would make the >5 hurdle even higher. They also highlighted that PRC-driven demand is structurally capped by Palau’s diplomatic stance, limiting upside. No new concrete evidence of upcoming route additions was presented, but the arguments about airline planning cycles and fragility of seasonal services are convincing and nudge me slightly downward.",
    "rationale": "Base case remains 3–4 destinations (likely Guam and Taipei; Seoul and/or Yap are uncertain). To resolve Yes, ROR would need at least 6 destinations listed on FlightsFrom on/after July 1. With ~6 weeks left, achieving two or more additional scheduled routes (and having them loaded in timetables) is unlikely without prior announcements or subsidies already in place. The chance of a sudden, multi-route summer ramp (e.g., Japan plus an extra Korea city or Manila/Hong Kong) exists but is modest. We also must account for the possibility that Yap is not operating in July, which would raise the bar further. Given the lack of fresh evidence of new routes and the structural/demand constraints, I’m trimming slightly from my prior estimate to align with the higher likelihood of ≤5 destinations.",
