  "information": "Positive economic factors for the incumbent VHP government include a reduction in inflation from 60% to 10%, compliance with an IMF program, and the signing of a Final Investment Decision with TotalEnergies for the Granmorgu oil field. The government also instituted a 15% salary increase for government employees and pensioners in 2024, with an additional 5% in January 2025. Conversely, negative factors include high public dissatisfaction, with 56% of the public dissatisfied with the current government and 66% believing the country is worse off than five years prior. The country faces persistent poverty and a $4 billion national debt. One report cited President Santokhi's approval rating at approximately 3%.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Approximately 27 days. The 2025 Surinamese general election is scheduled for May 25, 2025, and today is April 28, 2025.",
    "status_quo_outcome": "The VHP (Progressive Reform Party) currently holds power as the incumbent government party under President Santokhi. In a status quo scenario where nothing changes, they would normally have incumbency advantages.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Opposition parties, potentially including the NDP or other coalitions, win more seats than the VHP. Given the 3% presidential approval rating and 56% public dissatisfaction with the government, voters punish the incumbents for economic hardship despite recent improvements. The opposition successfully campaigns on the message that 66% of voters already believe: the country is worse off than five years ago.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "The VHP wins a plurality of seats despite low approval ratings. This could occur if: (1) voters in the final weeks credit the government for difficult but successful economic reforms (60% to 10% inflation reduction, IMF compliance, TotalEnergies oil deal); (2) the opposition vote fragments across multiple parties in Suriname's multi-party system, allowing VHP to win with 25-30% of seats; (3) the 15-20% salary increases for government workers and pensioners create a loyal voting bloc; or (4) polling significantly underestimates VHP support.",
    "rationale": "The research assistant's data reveals an extreme contradiction between economic indicators and public sentiment. On the positive side for VHP: inflation dropped dramatically from 60% to 10%, the government maintained IMF program compliance, secured a major oil investment with TotalEnergies, and increased government salaries by 20% total. These are substantial achievements. However, the political indicators are catastrophic: President Santokhi's ~3% approval rating is extraordinarily low—even deeply unpopular leaders rarely fall below 10-15%. Combined with 56% dissatisfaction and 66% believing the country is worse off, this suggests the economic improvements haven't translated into political support. The $4 billion debt and persistent poverty remain salient issues for voters. With only 27 days until the election, there's insufficient time for such deeply negative sentiment to reverse. While I place some weight on status quo bias and incumbency advantages in normal circumstances, a 3% approval rating overcomes those factors. The forecast isn't lower (5-10%) because: Suriname's multi-party system could fragment opposition voting, allowing VHP to win a plurality with modest vote share; economic fundamentals genuinely have improved; and polling could contain measurement error. The forecast isn't higher (35-50%) because: the approval numbers are too extreme to dismiss, public dissatisfaction is broad and deep-seated, and there's very little time remaining for perception shifts. I would revise upward if new polling showed significant VHP recovery or if opposition unity fractures became evident. I would revise downward if additional polling confirmed the catastrophic approval ratings or if a unified opposition coalition emerged.",
