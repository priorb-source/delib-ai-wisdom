    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "About 13 days (until end of May 4, 2025 KST)",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Han Duck-soo remains as acting president/caretaker and publicly declines to run; the PPP coalesces around another nominee and/or formally nominates someone else before early May. He emphasizes neutrality and stability through the snap election period, echoing the 2017 precedent where the acting president did not run.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "A rapid party draft materializes: the PPP formally urges Han to run, favorable polling and elite endorsements emerge, he resigns his caretaker role if required, and he announces a candidacy in late April or the first days of May to meet compressed timelines for a June election.",
    "rationale": "- Timing: With roughly 13 days left, if Han intends to run he would almost certainly need to announce within this window to meet party nomination and legal registration timelines for a June election. So the probability he runs is approximately the probability of a pre–May 5 announcement.\n- Baseline/status quo: As of today there has been no announcement. Acting presidents in South Korea have historically prioritized neutrality; in 2017, the acting president (Hwang Kyo-ahn) ultimately did not run in the snap election. Han Duck-soo is a technocratic elder statesman with little prior electoral ambition, which tilts the base rate toward not running.\n- Evidence available: The prompt cites a report that support is growing within the PPP to draft Han for a June election. This increases the chance above a very low base, since party elites can move quickly in a compressed timeline. However, my research assistant provided no additional corroborating information, so I avoid assuming a firm draft is underway.\n- Why not higher: Institutional and normative pressures for neutrality while serving as acting president; likely need to resign to run; limited time to build a campaign; availability of alternative PPP figures. The 2017 precedent weighs notably against a run.\n- Why not lower: The reported momentum to draft him, the urgency of a June election, and the possibility that a unifying caretaker figure could be seen as the safest option for the PPP create a non-trivial path to a quick announcement.\n- What would move me up: Credible reports that Han is actively considering or forming a campaign team; a formal PPP request to draft him; scheduling or rule changes that set an early party nomination date; leaked polling showing him clearly stronger than alternatives; any indication he will resign to run.\n- What would move me down: An explicit public refusal from Han; the PPP naming or effectively consolidating behind another candidate; legal/administrative guidance discouraging a run while acting president; statements emphasizing he will remain caretaker through the election.\n\nGiven the short timeline, the historical precedent, and the mixed but plausible drafting signals, I assign a modest probability that he announces before May 5.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill Han Duck-soo announce his candidacy for South Korean president before May 5, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nThe Chosun Daily: [Support grows in PPP to draft Acting President Han for June election](https://www.koreaherald.com/article/10464554)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if Han Duck-soo announces his candidacy for president of South Korea before May 5, 2025. If no such announcement has been made before that date, the question resolves as **No**.\n\n\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nNo additional information available.\n\nToday is 2025-04-22.\n\nBefore answering you think:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n(e) You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
