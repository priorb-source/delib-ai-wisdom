    "review": "Both forecasters independently arrived at 65%, presenting well-reasoned analyses that largely align with my own thinking. They appropriately identified the key tension: the genuine diplomatic need for communication during an active war versus Trump's unconventional approach and the complex relationship history. I find their emphasis on the 33-day window being 'substantial' for routine diplomatic engagement particularly persuasive - this is more than enough time for at least one call to occur under normal circumstances. However, I'm slightly more cautious about one argument: while they note Trump took office in January 2025 and patterns may have established by now, we have zero information about what those patterns actually are. This cuts both ways - they might already be in regular contact, or they might have established alternative communication channels. The convergence on 65% suggests I may have been too conservative at 60%. Their point about phone calls being 'routine' between a US president and a country receiving significant support is compelling, especially over a month-long window.",
    "rationale": "After reviewing both analyses, I'm updating my forecast slightly upward. The strongest argument for increasing my probability is the combination of: (1) the 33-day window truly is substantial for diplomatic engagement, (2) Ukraine's ongoing war status and dependence on US support creates genuine need for coordination, and (3) complete avoidance of phone contact over a full month seems less likely than I initially weighted. Both forecasters made valid points about routine diplomatic practice that I perhaps underweighted. However, I'm not moving all the way to 65% because several uncertainties remain significant: we have no information about current communication patterns, alternative methods (video calls, in-person meetings) are viable and might be preferred, and the complicated Trump-Zelenskyy history (including the impeachment context) introduces real relationship dynamics that could reduce call frequency. The mutual acknowledgment requirement, while minor, does add a small procedural hurdle. I'm settling at 63% - acknowledging the stronger case for routine communication while maintaining some caution about the specific dynamics of this relationship.",
