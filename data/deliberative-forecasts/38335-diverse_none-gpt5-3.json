    "review": "Both forecasters emphasize status quo inertia, the short timeline, and the weight of Trump’s endorsement for Byron Donalds—points I agree with. Forecaster 3 usefully frames the lack of an announcement to date as informative in itself. I’d add that Florida candidates can raise significant funds via political committees without formally announcing, weakening any end-of-quarter (June 30) pressure to declare now. That reduces one of the few plausible reasons for a late-June launch. I find their reasoning largely convincing and it nudges me downward from my prior.",
    "rationale": "Key factors: (1) Time left is short (~25 days) with no visible pre-launch signals (staff hires, filings, event rumors). (2) Trump’s endorsement of Donalds materially raises the cost of an immediate announcement, making a pre–July 1 declaration a high-risk move absent a compelling trigger. (3) The informational value of months without an announcement points toward “wait” rather than “rush.” (4) Countervailing factors exist—Casey DeSantis’s name recognition and capacity for a rapid launch keep a non-trivial chance of a surprise—but the Florida-specific fundraising landscape reduces the need to announce before June 30. Net: I lower my estimate from 24% to 16%, reflecting stronger weight on inertia and diminished quarter-end incentives.",
