    "review": "Both forecasters provide valuable additional evidence that strengthens the case for a low probability. Forecaster 3's point about May's historical weakness for EUR/USD (averaging -0.62% over 50 years) is particularly important new information - this seasonal headwind works directly against the required upward move in the first month of the resolution period. Forecaster 2's concrete data on Fed rate cut probabilities (33-37%) and April's resilient jobs number (177,000) provides useful context showing markets aren't expecting dramatic policy shifts. Both forecasters also provide more precise current EUR/USD levels (1.12-1.15) and calculate a 9.5-11% required move, which aligns with my analysis but is more specific. Their emphasis on normal monthly volatility being just 2-3% reinforces how unusual a 10-11% move would be in 6-8 weeks. All three of us independently arrived at similar conclusions (18-20%), which increases my confidence in this range.",
    "rationale": "After reviewing the other forecasters' analyses, I'm updating my forecast downward from 20% to 18%. The key new evidence that warrants this adjustment is: (1) May's historical seasonal weakness for EUR/USD, which creates an additional headwind in the first critical month; (2) More precise Fed rate cut probability data showing limited market expectations for policy shifts; (3) The convergence of three independent analyses around 18-20%, suggesting this range is well-calibrated. My core reasoning remains unchanged: this outcome requires an exceptionally large currency move (~10-11%) in an unusually short timeframe (~55 days), which historically occurs only during major crises or policy shocks. While current dollar weakness and tariff uncertainty create some possibility, the combination of the required magnitude, short timeframe, seasonal headwinds, and lack of market signals for dramatic Fed policy shifts all point to a low probability. The difference between 18% and 20% reflects the additional seasonal headwind evidence.",
