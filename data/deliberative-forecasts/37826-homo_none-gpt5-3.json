    "review": "Both forecasters reinforce a low single‑digit base rate and add two useful refinements I hadn’t emphasized enough: (1) definitional tightness—incidents in Pakistan-administered Kashmir and BSF-initiated fire don’t count because the BSF isn’t part of the Armed Forces; and (2) operational/weather constraints—early monsoon cloud cover by late June marginally complicates IAF options. They also correctly downplay domestic political incentives for a June 2025 strike and list clear, observable escalation indicators (NOTAMs, airspace closures, CCS meetings). I find their reasoning sound and consistent with the historical pattern and the question’s constraints.",
    "rationale": "My prior (6%) already leaned on base rates (Balakot 2019 as the lone salient precedent into Pakistan proper) and the narrow one‑month window. The added emphasis on definitional exclusions (especially BSF not qualifying) removes some otherwise plausible ‘border exchange’ pathways to resolution. The monsoon/operational factor slightly further suppresses near‑term feasibility for an IAF strike late in the month. Conversely, tail risk persists via a potential mass‑casualty attack in India with credible attribution to Pakistan-based groups, which could trigger a rapid, limited punitive strike (likely IAF) into KP or Punjab. Absent such a catalyst, and with no current signals of crisis (per available info), the status quo strongly favors No. Net effect: a small downward nudge from 6% to 5%.\n\nUp signals: mass‑casualty terror attack with attribution; Indian CCS crisis meetings; unusual IAF forward deployments/airspace notices; public threats of retaliation; sustained ceasefire breakdown along the IB/LoC. Down signals: continued calm into mid‑June; visible backchannel/diplomatic de‑escalation; any incidents confined to LoC/PoK or attributable solely to BSF actions.",
