    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Approximately one month, as the deadline is July 1, 2025.",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No. Rep. Ralph Norman has not declared his candidacy for the US Senate and continues to serve in the House of Representatives.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Rep. Norman continues to explore a potential Senate run, or decides against it, but does not make a formal declaration of candidacy by the July 1, 2025 deadline. He may continue to focus on his House duties and push his decision to later in the year.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Before July 1, 2025, Rep. Norman holds a press conference, releases an official statement, or files the necessary paperwork with the FEC to formally declare his candidacy for the 2026 U.S. Senate race in South Carolina.",
    "rationale": "My forecast is based primarily on the short time remaining until the deadline and the lack of public signals indicating an imminent campaign launch. The status quo, in which a politician has not yet declared for a higher office, is a strong predictor over short timeframes. While Rep. Norman has been 'seriously considering' a primary challenge to Sen. Lindsey Graham since at least 2023, launching a statewide campaign against a well-funded incumbent is a major undertaking that is typically preceded by observable groundwork. As of today, May 30, 2025, there are no credible public reports of Norman hiring senior campaign staff, forming an exploratory committee, or engaging in fundraising specifically for a Senate bid. Such activities would likely be visible or leaked to the press if an announcement were planned within the next month.\n\nMy probability is not higher than 10% because the absence of these preparatory signals is strong evidence against an impending announcement. The strategic logic for announcing in the next 32 days versus waiting until later in 2025 is not overwhelmingly compelling.\n\nMy probability is not lower, however, because Norman is a known and credible potential candidate who could be motivated to launch a surprise campaign to seize the initiative. A sudden announcement is not impossible.\n\nI would increase my forecast probability upon any credible reports of Norman hiring a campaign manager or other key staff for a Senate run, FEC filings, or a 'major announcement' being scheduled. Conversely, I would decrease the probability if Norman makes a definitive statement that he is not running or that he is focused solely on his re-election to the House.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill Ralph Norman declare his candidacy for the US Senate race in South Carolina before July 1, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nAxios: [Sen. Lindsey Graham may face right-wing primary challenge in 2026](https://www.axios.com/2023/09/13/lindsey-graham-primary-challenge-ralph-norman)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if Will Ralph Norman declares his candidacy for the US Senate race in South Carolina before July 1, 2025. If no such announcement has been made before that date, the question resolves as **No**.\n\n\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nNo additional information available.\n\nToday is 2025-05-30.\n\nBefore answering you think:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n(e) You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
