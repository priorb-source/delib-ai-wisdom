    "review": "The other two forecasters provided a crucial piece of analysis that I overlooked in my initial forecast: the explicit probability of the fight not happening as scheduled. Both correctly pointed out that the resolution criteria resolve a cancellation as 'No', making this a significant factor. Their approach of separating the forecast into two components—the probability of the fight occurring and the conditional probability of Walker winning—is a more rigorous methodology. I found their reasoning highly convincing, as a 15-20% cancellation rate for UFC bouts scheduled months in advance is a reasonable, data-driven assumption. While our stylistic analyses of the fighters were largely aligned, their inclusion of this structural factor fundamentally changes the final probability.",
    "rationale": "My initial forecast of 55% was based solely on the stylistic matchup, where I gave Walker a slight edge based on his massive physical advantages against Murzakanov's power. The other forecasters correctly identified my failure to account for the significant probability of fight cancellation, which directly resolves this question as 'No'. I am now adjusting my methodology to reflect their more robust, two-part approach.\n\nFirst, I accept the consensus estimate that there is approximately a 20% chance the fight is cancelled due to injury or other issues. This means there is an 80% probability the event specified in the resolution criteria takes place.\n\nSecond, I will maintain my original assessment of the conditional probability: if the fight happens, I believe Johnny Walker has a 55% chance of winning. His 11-inch reach advantage and unpredictable striking arsenal give him more paths to victory. However, his defensive liabilities and questionable chin provide a clear path for a powerful puncher like Murzakanov, preventing a higher confidence level.\n\nBy multiplying these two probabilities (P(Fight Happens) * P(Walker Wins | Fight Happens)), I arrive at a revised forecast. The change is not due to a new perspective on the fighters, but rather a correction of my initial methodology to properly incorporate the rules of the question and the realities of MMA scheduling. Therefore, I am making a significant downward revision.",
