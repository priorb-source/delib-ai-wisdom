    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "The outcome will be determined once Trading Economics publishes Ukraine's government debt figure for March 2025. As of April 22, 2025, this data is expected to be released imminently, likely within a few days to weeks.",
    "status_quo_outcome": "The status quo involves Ukraine continuing to finance its defense and government operations through substantial international and domestic borrowing amidst the ongoing war. This ensures that government debt continues to accumulate. As the February 2025 figure was 6.01 trillion UAH, the March 2025 figure would remain far above the 1.90 trillion UAH threshold, resulting in a 'Yes' outcome.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "A 'No' outcome is extraordinarily unlikely and would require a scenario such as an unprecedented and immediate debt jubilee where international creditors forgive over 4.1 trillion UAH (more than two-thirds) of Ukraine's debt, with this forgiveness being officially accounted for in the March 2025 statistics. Another highly improbable cause would be a major, multi-trillion UAH error in the data from the reporting source.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "The March 2025 data is released by Trading Economics and reflects the ongoing fiscal reality of the conflict. Ukraine's government debt continues its upward trend, or at the very least does not decrease catastrophically. The official number is published and is well in excess of the 1.90 trillion UAH threshold, likely surpassing 6 trillion UAH.",
    "rationale": "My forecast is based on the most recent available data and the prevailing economic and geopolitical context. The resolution source, Trading Economics, reports Ukraine's government debt for February 2025 as 6.01 trillion UAH. This figure is more than three times the 1.90 trillion UAH threshold in the question. The debt has been on a steep upward trajectory since the full-scale invasion in 2022, increasing from approximately 2.7 trillion UAH to its current level. This trend is driven by the immense cost of the war and Ukraine's heavy reliance on international financial aid, which largely consists of loans. For the outcome to be 'No', the debt would have had to decrease by over 4.1 trillion UAH in a single month, from February to March 2025. Such a massive reduction is fiscally implausible and would require a historic debt forgiveness event that has not been announced or even discussed. My probability is set at 99% and not 100% only to account for the remote possibility of a definitive data error from the source or a fundamental misunderstanding of the resolution criteria. I would only lower my forecast upon seeing credible evidence of a massive, sudden debt write-off that would be reflected in the March 2025 data.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill Ukraine's government debt be at least 1.90 trillion UAH in March 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\n[Ukraine is one step away from stagflation. And here's why](https://en.iz.ru/en/1868046/2025-04-10/ukraine-one-step-away-stagflation-and-heres-why)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if Ukraine's government debt is greater than or equal to 1.90 billion UAH Thousand (in other words, 1.90 trillion Ukrainian hryvnia for the month of March 2025, according to the number presented by [Trading Economics](https://tradingeconomics.com/ukraine/government-debt). Under 1.90 billion UAH Thousand resolves as **No**.\n\n\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nNo additional information available.\n\nToday is 2025-04-22.\n\nBefore answering you think:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n(e) You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
