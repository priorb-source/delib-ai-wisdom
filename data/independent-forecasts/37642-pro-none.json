    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Approximately 1.5 months, until July 1, 2025.",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No. The Federal Reserve continues to hold the federal funds rate at its current level, maintaining a restrictive monetary policy stance to ensure inflation returns sustainably to its 2% target.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Inflation data released in June for the month of May remains stubbornly above the Fed's target, and the labor market shows continued resilience. In its single meeting before the deadline (June 17-18), the FOMC consequently decides to hold rates steady, emphasizing the need for more confidence in the disinflationary trend.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "A significant and unexpected negative shock occurs. This could manifest as a rapid deterioration in the labor market (e.g., a sharp spike in unemployment reflected in the May jobs report) or an acute financial stability crisis, prompting the Fed to implement an 'insurance cut' at its June meeting to support the economy.",
    "rationale": "My forecast is based primarily on the short time frame and the Federal Reserve's established data-dependent posture. As of today, May 14, 2025, there is only one scheduled FOMC meeting before the July 1 deadline. For a rate cut to occur at this meeting, there would need to be a significant and unambiguous shift in incoming economic data to warrant such a policy pivot. The status quo, which my forecast heavily weights, is one of persistent inflation above the 2% target and a resilient economy, a context that supports holding rates steady. The research assistant's report provided no new information to alter this baseline. A 'No' outcome simply requires the continuation of recent trends. A 'Yes' outcome, conversely, requires a low-probability event such as a sudden economic shock or a dramatic and unexpected fall in inflation readings. My forecast probability is not lower than 10 because the possibility of an unforeseen economic or financial shock can never be completely dismissed, and the Fed has shown it can act swiftly in such circumstances. It is not higher because the bar for a rate cut remains very high based on the committee's recent communications, and a single month of data is unlikely to be sufficient to clear it without a crisis. I would raise my probability on clear signs of a sharp economic downturn, such as a major negative surprise in the next jobs report. I would lower it if Fed officials explicitly signal a hold in their pre-meeting commentary.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill the Federal Reserve cut interest rates before July 1, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nJP Morgan: [Following the Fed’s decision to pause rate cuts, what could its next move be?](https://www.jpmorgan.com/insights/global-research/economy/fed-rate-cuts)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if, after the launch of this question and before July 1, 2025 the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) announces a reduction of any amount in the target federal funds rate range.\r\nThe primary resolution source is the FOMC's *target federal funds rate or range* webpage [here](https://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/openmarket.htm), the Federal Reserve's official minutes and statements [here](https://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/fomccalendars.htm), or other [credible sources](https://www.metaculus.com/help/faq/#definitions) in case the Federal Reserve's website is unavailable or not timely updated.\n\nThis question resolves based on the announcement. Therefore, the effective date of the rate cut does not need to be before the resolution date, as long as the announcement is made before then.\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nNo additional information available.\n\nToday is 2025-05-14.\n\nBefore answering you think:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n(e) You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
