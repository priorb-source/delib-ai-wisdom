    "review": "Both forecasters’ reasoning aligns with my prior assessment: the Federal Constitutional Court is the only competent authority for party bans; proceedings are historically rare, stringent, and slow; and there is no sign of a formal filing or an expedited track. Forecaster 3’s concrete timeline for the NPD case (2013–2017) and reminder that only two parties have ever been banned (last in 1956) sharpen the historical context but do not change the time-constraint logic. Forecaster 2’s emphasis on the need for political consensus and the improbability of compressing filing, hearings, and deliberation into <60 days is sound. Neither introduces new evidence suggesting a filing has occurred or that the Court would deviate from precedent with emergency measures. The possibility of an unforeseen shock is noted by both, but remains a very low-probability tail.",
    "rationale": "Time remaining is roughly 60 days. There is no public indication of a formal petition by a competent organ, let alone admissibility decisions, evidentiary development, hearings, and deliberations. The Federal Constitutional Court’s pace in party-ban matters is measured in years, not weeks; an expedited final ban by July 1 would be unprecedented. The resolution requires an official announcement of a ban, not merely initiation of proceedings or intermediate measures. Given the institutional, legal, and procedural hurdles, a ban before the deadline is extraordinarily unlikely. I would update upward only if a formal petition were filed immediately and the Court announced an expedited schedule with hearings and a decision window in May/June, accompanied by clear signals of extraordinary urgency. I would edge downward if we reach late May with no filing. In the absence of new signals, I keep my forecast unchanged.",
