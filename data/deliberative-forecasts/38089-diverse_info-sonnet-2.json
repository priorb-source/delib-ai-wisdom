    "review": "There is a critical discrepancy among the forecasts. Forecasters 2 and I both cite recent May 2025 data showing Sánchez ahead of Erdoğan by 2-3 points (my source: 35% vs 32%, Forecaster 2: 33% vs 31%). However, Forecaster 3 claims the baseline pattern across 2024-early 2025 shows Erdoğan consistently 8-12 points ahead (low-to-mid 40s vs low-to-mid 30s). This fundamentally different understanding of the current state dramatically affects the forecast. If Forecaster 3's baseline is correct and represents the typical state, then either: (a) there was a recent, sharp shift in May 2025 that my research assistant and Forecaster 2 detected, or (b) my research assistant's data is incorrect/misinterpreted. Forecaster 3 raises an important point about mean reversion - if the historical pattern strongly favors Erdoğan, then even if Sánchez is momentarily ahead, reversion to the mean over 33 days becomes more likely. However, Forecaster 3 doesn't explicitly dispute the May 2025 numbers, suggesting they may be unaware of a recent shift rather than denying it. Forecaster 2's analysis of structural factors (Turkey's deep economic crisis vs Spain's political polarization) is persuasive about why current states might persist, but doesn't address the baseline discrepancy.",
    "rationale": "I need to reconcile conflicting information. Two sources (myself and Forecaster 2) cite May 2025 data showing Sánchez ahead, while Forecaster 3 describes a historical baseline favoring Erdoğan. The most plausible explanation is that both are correct: historically Erdoğan led, but recent May 2025 data shows a shift. However, this interpretation raises concerns about persistence. If Sánchez's lead is a recent deviation from a longstanding 8-12 point deficit, mean reversion becomes a serious concern even over just 33 days. The narrow 2-3 point current lead could easily evaporate if it represents statistical noise or a temporary fluctuation around a different equilibrium. Conversely, if the shift reflects genuine changes (Turkey's economic crisis deepening, Spain's recovery solidifying), it could persist. I'm updating down from 68% to account for: (1) the possibility that current data represents a temporary deviation from a stronger baseline favoring Erdoğan, (2) increased uncertainty about the true current state given conflicting reports, and (3) mean reversion risk if the historical pattern is as Forecaster 3 describes. I'm not dropping to 20% because the most recent data still shows Sánchez ahead with limited time remaining, and Forecaster 2's structural analysis about Turkey's deep economic problems is compelling.",
