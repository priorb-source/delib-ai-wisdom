  "information": "As of early May 2025, Muqtada al-Sadr has publicly and repeatedly reaffirmed his boycott of the 2025 Iraqi parliamentary election. In April 2025, he rejected a plea from the Iraqi President to reconsider his decision, stating he would not participate with 'the corrupt'. In March 2025, he forbade his followers from voting or participating in the election. A Qatari report from late April indicated al-Sadr is unwilling to take responsibility for the political mistakes of the rival Shia Coordination Framework. During a speech on May 2, 2025, he told supporters to 'speak out if their speech benefits reform, and remain silent if silence benefits reform.'",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Less than 2 months (from May 3, 2025 to July 1, 2025).",
    "status_quo_outcome": "Muqtada al-Sadr's Alliance Towards Reforms party will maintain its current election boycott, and no announcement of participation will be made before the deadline. The outcome will be 'No'.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Muqtada al-Sadr continues his current strategy of remaining outside the formal political process to maintain his image as an anti-corruption reformer opposing his Shia rivals in the Coordination Framework. He continues to publicly state his refusal to participate, and the July 1, 2025 deadline passes without any change in his party's stance.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "A significant political development occurs, such as major concessions from the Shia Coordination Framework on electoral reform or anti-corruption measures. In response, al-Sadr makes a characteristic tactical reversal, framing his participation as a necessary move to 'save the country' and achieve reform from within. He then directs his party to officially announce its intention to field candidates before the July 1, 2025 deadline.",
    "rationale": "My forecast is based heavily on Muqtada al-Sadr's current and consistently maintained public position. As of early May 2025, he has repeatedly and forcefully reaffirmed his boycott of the 2025 Iraqi parliamentary election. This includes rejecting a personal plea from the Iraqi President in April and forbidding his followers from participating in March. His stated rationale is his refusal to engage with 'the corrupt' political establishment, a strategy that positions him as an outside populist force against his rivals in the Shia Coordination Framework. The timeframe for a reversal is short, at under two months. For a 'Yes' outcome, a major political catalyst would be required to motivate such a significant and public U-turn. \n\nMy probability is not lower than 15% because Muqtada al-Sadr is a notoriously unpredictable political actor with a documented history of making sudden and dramatic reversals in strategy. Iraqi politics are volatile, and a significant crisis or a backroom deal could realistically emerge that changes his calculus before the July 1 deadline. His ambiguous May 2nd speech about using 'speech' or 'silence' for reform leaves him tactical flexibility. \n\nMy probability is not higher than 15% because the weight of current evidence is overwhelmingly in favor of a continued boycott. There are currently no public indicators of negotiations or a softening of his stance. Reversing his very firm, public position would require significant political justification, and without a clear trigger event, the inertia of his current strategy makes a change of course unlikely in the next two months. \n\nI would increase my forecast if there were credible reports of high-level negotiations between the Sadrists and the Coordination Framework or public hints from his office about a potential reconsideration. I would decrease it if he escalates his boycott, for instance by calling for protests against the election, or as the deadline approaches with no change in rhetoric.",

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
