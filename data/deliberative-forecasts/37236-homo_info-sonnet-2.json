    "review": "Both forecasters raised critical data points I had not considered: Forecaster 3 notes February 2025 exports were $278.5 billion (already $16B or 6% above the threshold), and Forecaster 2 highlights March 2025 goods exports of $180.8 billion (up 6.8% YoY). These are actual hard data points, not projections. This fundamentally changes the analysis - for a No outcome, April exports would need to fall approximately 5.7% from February levels, not merely fail to grow year-over-year. However, I find their optimism insufficiently accounting for the April-specific disruptions. The tariffs took effect April 2, meaning nearly the entire month operated under the new regime - unlike February (pre-tariff) or March (partial impact). The 45% drop in China-US shipping bookings YoY is an exceptionally strong indicator of goods export collapse. While Forecaster 3's historical pattern argument (79-93% of Aprils show YoY gains) is normally persuasive, this ignores that April 2025 faced unprecedented mid-month tariff implementation. Forecaster 2's March momentum argument is reasonable but may not account for the lag between tariff announcement and actual trade flow disruption. The February/March data does provide a substantial cushion I underweighted, but the April disruption indicators remain severe.",
    "rationale": "My initial 8% forecast was too pessimistic given the actual February ($278.5B) and March (goods at $180.8B) data, which I did not have. These figures show exports were running well above the $262.578B threshold with a meaningful cushion. For April to resolve No, exports would need to decline 5-6% from February levels, requiring an actual collapse rather than mere stagnation. However, I remain considerably more bearish than the 65-68% forecasts because: (1) The 45% China-US shipping booking decline YoY is a concrete, severe indicator specific to April, (2) Tariffs were implemented April 2, affecting 29 out of 30 days - far more comprehensive than any February/March impact, (3) Retaliatory measures from multiple countries would suppress demand throughout April, (4) Manufacturing PMI contraction indicates reduced export capacity. The February/March cushion is real and meaningful, preventing me from staying at 8%, but the April-specific disruption evidence is too strong to justify 65%+. A 5-6% monthly decline is unusual but not implausible given a major trade shock affecting nearly the full month. I'm updating significantly upward to 35% to reflect the stronger baseline, while maintaining that April disruption indicators make threshold failure more likely than not.",
