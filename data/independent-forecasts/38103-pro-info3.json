  "information": "The exclusion of Tesla from B.C.'s rebate program occurred within a broader context of shifting trade policies and incentives. Canada's federal iZEV rebate program, which offered up to $5,000 for EV purchases, ended on March 31, 2025. A 25% tariff on U.S.-made electric vehicles is also in effect. The B.C. government's action to preference domestic goods extends beyond the EV sector; for instance, the province has also removed U.S. liquor products from the shelves of government-run liquor stores as part of the ongoing trade friction with the United States.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Approximately 1 month, as the outcome is determined on or after July 1, 2025.",
    "status_quo_outcome": "Yes. The policy enacted on March 12, 2025, which excludes Tesla products from the rebate, would remain in effect.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "A swift and unexpected de-escalation of the broader trade dispute between B.C./Canada and the U.S. prompts the B.C. government to reverse its protectionist policy and reinstate Tesla's eligibility for the rebate program before July 2025.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "The current trade friction with the U.S. persists or remains unresolved, and the B.C. government maintains its stated policy of preferencing Canadian goods, leaving the exclusion of Tesla products from the rebate program in place.",
    "rationale": "My forecast heavily favors the status quo. The decision to exclude Tesla products is not an isolated administrative change but a component of a larger B.C. government strategy to preference domestic goods amidst trade friction with the U.S., as corroborated by actions like removing U.S. liquor from government stores. Such politically motivated policies exhibit strong inertia and are rarely reversed quickly. With the resolution date just over one month away (July 1, 2025), the window for resolving the underlying international trade dispute and subsequently reversing this specific provincial policy is extremely narrow. Government policies change slowly, and the context of a trade dispute makes a rapid reversal highly improbable. The probability is not higher than 97% to account for a small but non-zero chance of a 'black swan' event, such as a sudden diplomatic breakthrough or a successful, expedited legal challenge that forces a policy reversal. The probability is not lower because the explicit government announcement, the short timeframe, and the policy's connection to a larger trade dispute make its continuation the overwhelmingly likely outcome. I would significantly lower my forecast if official announcements were made about a de-escalation of the trade dispute. Conversely, I would raise my forecast if trade tensions were to escalate further.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill BC Hydro still exclude Tesla from its EV charger rebate program for single-family homes in July 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nAccording to the resolution source, \"The Government of B.C. and BC Hydro are taking action to preference Canadian goods in our rebate programs going forward and to exclude, where practicable, U.S. produced goods. As of March 12, 2025, Tesla products (electric vehicle chargers, energy storage batteries and inverters) are not eligible for CleanBC and BC Hydro rebates. If you purchased or have received pre-approval for your Tesla product before March 12, 2025, it can still qualify for rebates and will be processed as normal.\"\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if BC Hydro at [this page](https://www.bchydro.com/powersmart/electric-vehicles/rebates-incentives/rebates-home-chargers.html) when checked by Metaculus on or after July 1, 2025, says that Tesla products are not eligible for the EV charger at home program. If it does not mention Tesla being ineligible, then this question resolves as **No**.\n\n\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nThe exclusion of Tesla from B.C.'s rebate program occurred within a broader context of shifting trade policies and incentives. Canada's federal iZEV rebate program, which offered up to $5,000 for EV purchases, ended on March 31, 2025. A 25% tariff on U.S.-made electric vehicles is also in effect.

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
