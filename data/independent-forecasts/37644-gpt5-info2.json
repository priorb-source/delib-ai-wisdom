    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "~46 days (until end of day June 30, 2025)",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Anthropic continues operating privately, relying on existing strategic funding from Amazon/Google and recent private rounds/partnerships for runway. It avoids public “gun-jumping” statements and does not make a News-page announcement. Any IPO preparation remains confidential, with no public S-1 by June 30.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Anthropic publicly files an SEC Form S-1 in June (or posts on its News page that it plans an IPO), aiming for a listing later in 2025 while the IPO window is receptive. The S-1 going public is the trigger for resolution.",
    "rationale": "- Timeframe: Only ~6.5 weeks remain. For this question to resolve Yes, Anthropic must either publicly file an S-1 or explicitly post on its News page that it plans an IPO. Companies rarely announce “planning an IPO” on their websites ahead of an S-1 due to regulatory/gun-jumping concerns, so the S-1 path is the realistic trigger. The short window materially lowers odds.\n- Status quo and funding: Anthropic recently pursued large private financing at a reported ~$40B valuation and has deep strategic ties (e.g., Amazon/Google) and partnerships (e.g., a five-year, $100M Databricks deal). These factors reduce near-term need for public capital and provide alternative liquidity pathways (tenders/secondaries) for employees. Expanding product/features and APAC presence signal growth-stage execution consistent with remaining private for now.\n- Market context/base rates: While the IPO window has improved versus 2022–2023, major frontier-model companies (OpenAI, Cohere, Databricks) have not yet gone public. The base rate of a top AI foundation-model startup making a public S-1 within a 6-week window is low. Anthropic’s public-benefit governance and complex strategic investor arrangements could also complicate timing, further pushing toward later 2025 or beyond.\n- Why not higher: 1) Short fuse to July 1; 2) Likely preference for confidential filings first, which would not resolve Yes until made public; 3) Ample private capital reduces urgency; 4) Companies rarely self-announce IPO plans on their News page before an S-1.\n- Why not lower: 1) If the IPO market remains open, Anthropic could opportunistically file an S-1 in June for a post-summer/fall listing; 2) Employee liquidity or capex needs (compute) could motivate earlier action; 3) A public S-1 for either a traditional IPO or a direct listing would satisfy the resolution.\n- Upward update triggers: Credible reports of Anthropic hiring IPO advisors/underwriters, audit milestones timed for H1, or media leaks of an imminent public S-1; peers (e.g., Databricks) publicly filing S-1 soon; signals of tightened private funding or desire for broad-based employee liquidity.\n- Downward update triggers: Announcement of another large private round/convertible or expanded strategic financing; market risk-off reducing IPO appetite; regulatory or governance complications; explicit statements disavowing near-term public listing.\n- Research assistant summary impact: Product launches (Claude 3.7 Sonnet), partnerships (Databricks), and APAC expansion are consistent with strong private growth and sufficient capital, modestly tilting against a near-term S-1 within the next six weeks.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nBefore July 1, 2025, will Anthropic announce that it is planning an IPO?\n\nQuestion background:\nIn its most recent funding talks, Anthropic [floated](https://www.theinformation.com/articles/openai-rival-anthropic-has-floated-40-billion-valuation-in-early-talks-about-new-funding) a valuation of $40 billion. Although there has been speculation that the company could IPO, nothing concrete has been announced yet.\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question will resolve as **Yes** if Anthropic, Inc., announces before July 1, 2025, that it is planning an initial public offering. In order to streamline the resolution of this question, there are two resolution sources for the IPO announcement: 1) The company filing an [SEC Form S-1](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/sec-form-s-1.asp) or 2) An announcement at the [News](https://www.anthropic.com/news) section of its website. If there is no such announcement before that date, this question resolves as **No**.\n\n\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nAnthropic has recently launched its Claude 3.7 Sonnet model and is reportedly developing new features, including a two-way voice assistant and enhanced memory functions for its AI. The company announced a five-year, $100 million partnership with Databricks to develop corporate AI agents. Concurrently, Anthropic is expanding its operations into the Asia-Pacific region, with plans to establish an office in Korea.\n\nToday is 2025-05-15.\n\nBefore answering you think:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n(e) You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
