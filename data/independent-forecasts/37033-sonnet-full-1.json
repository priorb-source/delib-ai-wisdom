  "information": "In 2020, the Zimbabwean government and representatives of white farmers signed a Global Compensation Deed for a total of $3.5 billion to compensate approximately 4,000 farmers for developments on seized land. On or around April 9, 2025, the government made its first payment of $3.1 million. This disbursement is part of a plan for a first batch of 740 approved claims, totaling $311 million. The initial payment represents 1% of this amount, with the agreement stipulating that the remaining 99% is to be settled through the issuance of 10-year treasury bonds. According to reports, the initial cash payment was distributed to either 21 or 378 farmers. The compensation is explicitly for 'improvements' made on the land, not for the land itself.\n\nThe Zimbabwean government's compensation efforts are part of a broader strategy for international re-engagement and debt restructuring. Officials have linked the payments to efforts to clear arrears on a $21 billion national debt and have Western sanctions lifted. In a separate but related action in February 2025, the government paid $20 million to foreign farmers from several European nations, including Denmark, Germany, and Switzerland, whose 94 farms were seized despite being covered by bilateral investment protection agreements. This payment was the first installment of $145 million owed to this group, with the Treasury planning multi-year allocations through 2028 to cover the balance. In other signs of warming international relations, Zimbabwe suspended tariffs on US goods and President Mnangagwa hosted a delegation of Afrikaner business leaders.\n\nZimbabwe faces significant economic and political challenges that could affect the compensation timeline. The government allocated $10 million in its 2025 national budget for the payments, leaving a balance of $6.9 million after the April disbursement. The country is grappling with a severe economic crisis, including a poor 2024/25 agricultural season due to drought, which has worsened food insecurity. While the country experienced a slight deflation in March 2025, it continues to face liquidity issues. There is also opposition to the compensation plan; a majority of former farmers have reportedly not signed the agreement and still hold their title deeds. Furthermore, a government proposal to raise funds through a US$500 per hectare levy on current land beneficiaries has been rejected by groups such as the Zimbabwe People's Revolutionary Army (ZPRA) ex-combatants.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Approximately 39 days until June 1, 2025",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No - Zimbabwe does not make another payment to white farmers before June 1, 2025",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Zimbabwe faces severe economic constraints due to drought, liquidity issues, and competing priorities. After making their symbolic first payment on April 9, the government decides to wait before the next disbursement. They may prioritize issuing the promised 10-year treasury bonds rather than making additional cash payments, or simply delay the next payment until after June 1 due to the economic crisis and opposition to the compensation plan.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Zimbabwe makes another payment from the remaining $6.9 million in their 2025 budget allocation before June 1. This could be a relatively small disbursement (even $1-2 million would qualify) to demonstrate continued commitment to the compensation program and support their international re-engagement efforts, particularly their goals of debt restructuring and sanctions relief. The government views maintaining momentum on this issue as strategically important for their broader economic agenda.",
    "rationale": "The baseline status quo favors No. Zimbabwe just made its first payment approximately two weeks ago after years of delays, and typically governments don't make multiple payments in quick succession, especially given severe economic constraints. However, several factors support a non-trivial probability of Yes: (1) Recent momentum - the April 9 payment demonstrates active commitment rather than mere rhetoric; (2) Available funds - $6.9 million remains from the 2025 budget allocation; (3) Strategic importance - compensation is explicitly linked to debt relief and removing Western sanctions, which are high priority for Zimbabwe; (4) Low bar - even a small payment would satisfy the criteria. Against this: (1) The first payment was only 1% of the first batch, suggesting a very slow pace; (2) Zimbabwe faces severe drought, food insecurity, and liquidity crises that could delay non-urgent payments; (3) No concrete timeline suggests an imminent second payment; (4) Opposition to the plan from various groups; (5) The government may pivot to issuing treasury bonds rather than cash payments. For me to move higher (45-55%), I would need evidence of: another payment being prepared, explicit government statements about a second disbursement timeline, or improved economic conditions. For me to move lower (15-20%), I would need: evidence that the remaining $6.9 million has been reallocated, statements that the next payment will be delayed, or further economic deterioration. The 39-day timeframe is long enough for another payment but not long enough to expect it as the base case. I'm weighing the recent positive action and strategic motivation against the slow historical pace and economic reality.",
