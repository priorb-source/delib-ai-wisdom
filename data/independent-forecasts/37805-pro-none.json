    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "About 6 weeks",
    "status_quo_outcome": "Yes. As of May 20, 2025, flightsfrom.com lists 6 direct destinations from Saipan (Guam, Tokyo, Seoul, Busan, Rota, Tinian), which is greater than 4.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "A combination of low travel demand and rising operational costs prompts two airlines to suspend their services to Saipan on short notice before July 1st. For instance, the routes to Tokyo and Busan are cancelled, reducing the total destination count to exactly 4.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "The existing flight schedules remain stable through the beginning of the summer travel season. All six current direct routes continue to operate, and the number of destinations remains at 6, easily satisfying the '> 4' condition for a 'Yes' outcome.",
    "rationale": "My forecast is heavily anchored on the status quo, which is a strong predictor of the future, especially over short time horizons. Currently, there are six direct flight destinations from Saipan (SPN) listed on the resolution source website: Guam (GUM), Tokyo (NRT), Seoul (ICN), Busan (PUS), Rota (ROP), and Tinian (TIQ). Since 6 is greater than 4, the present situation resolves the question as 'Yes'. The resolution date is just over one month away. Airline schedules for a given season are typically set far in advance, making major cancellations within this timeframe highly improbable barring a significant unforeseen event. For the outcome to be 'No', at least two of the current six routes would need to be cancelled. This means two of the four international routes (Guam, Tokyo, Seoul, Busan) would have to cease operation. While the background context highlights the fragility of the region's tourism, the cancellation of two distinct international routes within six weeks is a very low-probability event. My probability is not higher than 95% to account for a small chance of a 'black swan' event, such as a sudden regional conflict or a major operational issue with one of the key carriers. My probability is not lower because the inertia of airline scheduling over such a short period makes the continuation of current services the overwhelmingly likely outcome. A higher chance of failure would imply a tangible threat to two separate routes, for which there is currently no evidence.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill there be greater than 4 direct flight destinations from Saipan, Northern Mariana Islands on July 1, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nTravel and Tour World: [Northern Marianas struggles to revive tourism amid flight suspensions and travel restrictions: What you need to know?](https://www.travelandtourworld.com/news/article/northern-marianas-struggles-to-revive-tourism-amid-flight-suspensions-and-travel-restrictions-what-you-need-to-know/)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if there are greater than 4 direct flight destinations listed at the [All scheduled direct (non-stop) flights from Saipan (SPN)](https://www.flightsfrom.com/SPN) tracker when checked by Metaculus on or after July 1, 2025.\n\n\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nNo additional information available.\n\nToday is 2025-05-20.\n\nBefore answering you think:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n(e) You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
