    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Approximately 32 days until July 1, 2025",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No - none of the five candidates are disqualified before the deadline",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "All five candidates (Gnangbo Kacou, Laurent Gbagbo, Pascal Affi N'Guessan, Jean-Louis Billon, and Simone Gbagbo) remain on the electoral list and legally eligible to run through July 1, 2025. Electoral authorities complete their candidate vetting process without removing any of these individuals, and no legal challenges successfully disqualify them in the remaining time.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "At least one of the five candidates is officially removed from the electoral list before July 1, 2025. This could occur through administrative disqualification by electoral authorities, successful legal challenges to their eligibility, or actions by Ivorian courts declaring them ineligible under election law. Given the BBC article's reference to a main opposition leader already being removed, similar actions could affect one or more of these candidates.",
    "rationale": "The BBC article indicates that Ivory Coast's electoral process is already experiencing significant controversy, with at least one main opposition leader being removed from the electoral list. This establishes that candidate disqualifications are actively occurring in this election cycle, suggesting heightened political and legal contestation around eligibility. Laurent Gbagbo and Simone Gbagbo are particularly notable as controversial figures with complex political histories, including Laurent's past presidency and subsequent international legal issues. Pascal Affi N'Guessan is another prominent opposition figure. These are exactly the type of candidates who might face eligibility challenges in a contested political environment. However, several factors temper this assessment: First, we're only 32 days from the July 1 deadline, which is a relatively short window for new disqualifications to materialize. Second, the research assistant provided no additional information about current disqualifications of these specific five candidates, suggesting none may have been disqualified yet. Third, electoral calendars typically solidify as elections approach, making last-minute disqualifications less common though not impossible. The base rate consideration is important - most candidates who haven't been disqualified by late May typically make it through to the election. However, the active controversy indicated by the BBC article and Ivory Coast's history of electoral disputes elevates the risk above baseline. For my forecast to move higher (toward 60-70%), I would need evidence of active legal proceedings against one or more of these specific candidates, or patterns showing multiple recent disqualifications. For it to move lower (toward 20-30%), I would need confirmation that candidate lists have been finalized without challenges, or that these five candidates specifically have cleared all eligibility hurdles.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill any of these candidates be disqualified from running in the 2025 Ivorian presidential election before July 1, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nBBC: [Main opposition leader removed from Ivory Coast electoral list](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c0l0j849143o)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if before July 1, 2025, according to [credible sources](https://www.metaculus.com/faq/#definitions) any of these candidates has been removed from the electoral list or otherwise become legally ineligible to run in the [2025 presidential election](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2025_Ivorian_presidential_election) of the Ivory Coast (Côte d'Ivoire) under the laws of the country: Gnangbo Kacou, Laurent Gbagbo, Pascal Affi N'Guessan, Jean-Louis Billon, or Simone Gbagbo.\n\n\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nNo additional information available.\n\nToday is 2025-05-30.\n\nBefore answering you think:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n(e) You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
