    "review": "The other forecasters raised several important points I had underweighted. Forecaster 3 makes a compelling case about the small gap (1.8 points) relative to typical monthly volatility in this series, and correctly identifies specific near-term catalysts I hadn't emphasized: the May CPI report on June 12 and the June preliminary reading mid-month. The mean reversion argument is also valid - a 30% decline since January is historically extreme, and sentiment measures often bounce back after sharp drops. Both forecasters appropriately weighted the Conference Board's sharp rebound (85.7 to 98) as a significant contrary indicator suggesting consumer sentiment may not be uniformly depressed.\n\nHowever, I think Forecaster 3 at 65% may be underweighting the persistence of structural factors. The 7.3% near-term inflation expectations and widespread trade policy uncertainty (cited by 75% of consumers) are not easily resolved in 3-4 weeks. The cautious consumer behavior data (0.2% spending growth, 4.9% savings rate) reflects real financial stress, not just a sentiment blip.\n\nForecaster 2's analysis at 75% is well-balanced and closely aligned with my original thinking, appropriately weighing both the strong status quo bias and the possibility of volatility-driven reversals.",
    "rationale": "After deliberation, I'm moderately lowering my forecast from 72% to 69%. The key updates to my thinking: (1) The 1.8-point gap is indeed small relative to typical monthly volatility of several points, making a crossover more plausible than I initially weighted. (2) The Conference Board's sharp rebound is a more significant contrary indicator than I credited - it suggests underlying consumer mood may have more upside potential. (3) Specific near-term catalysts exist, particularly the May CPI report on June 12, which could provide a positive shock if inflation data surprises to the downside.\n\nHowever, I'm not moving all the way to 65% because the structural headwinds remain formidable and are unlikely to resolve quickly. Inflation expectations at 7.3% (near-term) and 4.6% (long-term) are substantially above target and reflect deep concerns. Trade/tariff uncertainty affecting 75% of consumers is an ongoing policy issue without clear near-term resolution. The weak ISM readings and cautious consumer spending patterns indicate real economic softness, not just sentiment volatility.\n\nThe status quo at 52.2 provides a safety margin - even with typical monthly volatility, staying below 54.0 remains the more likely outcome. My updated 69% reflects increased respect for mean reversion and volatility possibilities while maintaining that the weight of evidence still favors sentiment remaining depressed.",
