  "information": "As of early June 2025, Sudan has not ratified the AfCFTA agreement nor submitted its Provisional Schedule of Tariff Concessions. The country is in an ongoing civil war, resulting in fragmented government, the absence of a functioning legislature, and suspension from the African Union (AU). Despite the conflict, a draft national AfCFTA implementation strategy for Sudan was previously reviewed and validated by stakeholders in a process supported by the Intergovernmental Authority on Development (IGAD).\n\nAcross Africa, 47 of the 54 signatory nations had ratified the AfCFTA agreement as of July 2024. However, overall implementation of the trade area since its 2021 launch has been described as sluggish. According to trade policy analysts, key impediments include production-related challenges like low industrial output, poor infrastructure, and non-tariff barriers. The original goal of removing tariffs on 90% of goods has been pushed back to 2034.\n\nA recent UN Economic Commission for Africa (ECA) report highlighted the AfCFTA's potential to boost trade-led growth and increase Africa's GDP by 1.2% by 2045 with full implementation. Other regional developments include a forum in Zambia focused on digital trade integration, an emphasis on arbitration for resolving trade disputes, and the promotion of the Pan-African Payment and Settlement System (PAPSS) to facilitate transactions in local currencies. Meanwhile, Nigeria has ratified the agreement, and South Africa and Lesotho are strengthening bilateral trade ties to advance AfCFTA goals.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Less than one month. The outcome will be known by July 1, 2025.",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No. Sudan remains embroiled in a civil war without a functioning government capable of ratifying international treaties.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "The ongoing civil war and resulting governmental paralysis continue through June 2025. No legitimate body exists to ratify the AfCFTA, and the deadline of July 1, 2025, passes with the status quo unchanged.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "A sudden and comprehensive peace agreement is signed within days. A unified, internationally recognized transitional government is formed immediately and, in a major symbolic act, prioritizes and fast-tracks the ratification of the AfCFTA, completing all necessary legal steps just before the July 1, 2025 deadline.",
    "rationale": "My forecast is overwhelmingly driven by the current reality in Sudan. As of June 6, 2025, the country is in a state of intense civil war, which has led to governmental collapse. The barriers to ratification within the less-than-one-month timeframe are insurmountable. Firstly, there is no functioning legislature, which is a fundamental requirement for the legal ratification of an international treaty. Secondly, the state's capacity is entirely consumed by the conflict, not long-term economic policy. Thirdly, Sudan's suspension from the African Union, the sponsoring body of the AfCFTA, indicates a deep diplomatic paralysis. The fact that a draft implementation strategy was reviewed in the past is noted, but this historical progress is rendered irrelevant by the complete breakdown of the state since the conflict began.\n\nMy forecast is not higher because the confluence of war, state collapse, and an imminent deadline makes a 'Yes' outcome a near impossibility. The path to ratification would require a sequence of extremely improbable events: an immediate peace deal, the instant formation of a functional government, and the lightning-fast completion of a complex legal process all within a few weeks.\n\nMy forecast is not absolute zero to account for a 'black swan' event, such as a sudden, externally-brokered peace settlement where fast-tracked ratification is made a symbolic condition. However, this is a purely theoretical possibility with no supporting evidence. I would only increase my probability upon seeing concrete evidence of a comprehensive peace deal being implemented and a unified government being formed.",

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
