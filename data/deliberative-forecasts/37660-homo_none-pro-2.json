    "review": "My initial forecast of 75% was in strong agreement with Forecaster 3, and in significant disagreement with Forecaster 2. The core difference in our analyses is the interpretation of the nine months that have passed since Starlink received its license in Sri Lanka. Forecaster 2 views this period as a 'prolonged delay' and negative evidence, suggesting a slow pace that will miss the deadline. In contrast, Forecaster 3 and I interpret this 9-11 month timeframe as a standard, expected period for operational rollout, including ground station deployment and logistical arrangements. I find Forecaster 2's reasoning unconvincing, as historical rollouts in countries like the Philippines and Nigeria took a similar 8-9 months. This timeframe is the process itself, not evidence of a problem. However, the deliberation raised two points that warrant a small adjustment to my forecast. First, as Forecaster 2 implicitly notes and I now explicitly weigh, with only 46 days left, the timeline is tight. The rollout is proceeding at a normal, not an accelerated, pace, leaving little buffer for even minor last-minute snags. Second, Forecaster 3 introduced a valuable, specific risk I hadn't fully considered: a potential dependency on gateway infrastructure in neighboring countries like India, where regulatory approval remains pending. While this is speculative, it represents a plausible failure scenario that slightly increases the probability of a 'No' outcome.",
    "rationale": "I am slightly decreasing my forecast from 75% to 70%. The fundamental positive factors remain unchanged: Starlink was officially granted its operating license in August 2024, clearing the largest administrative hurdle. The nine months that have passed since are consistent with a standard pre-launch preparation period for a new country, and the government appears supportive. However, the deliberation has convinced me to slightly temper my optimism. With only 46 days remaining until the July 1, 2025 deadline, the window for activation is narrow. The fact that the service has not yet launched suggests this is a standard-priority rollout, not a rushed one, which means any minor, unforeseen logistical or bureaucratic issue could easily push the activation past the deadline. More importantly, Forecaster 3’s point about potential dependency on ground stations in India, which has not yet granted its own approval, introduces a tangible risk of a significant delay. While Starlink may be building a gateway in Sri Lanka itself, this external dependency risk is a plausible explanation for the current timeline and a reason for slightly lower confidence. Thus, while I still believe a 'Yes' outcome is highly probable, I am reducing my forecast by 5 percentage points to account for the tight deadline and the newly considered risk of regional infrastructure dependency.",
