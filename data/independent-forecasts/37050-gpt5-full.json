  "information": "Historical changes to the Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA) are infrequent. In February 2024, Intel and Walgreens were replaced. In August 2020, Exxon Mobil, Pfizer, and Raytheon Technologies were replaced by Salesforce, Amgen, and Honeywell. In June 2018, General Electric was replaced by Walgreens Boots Alliance, and in March 2015, AT&T was replaced by Apple.\n\nSeveral DJIA components have experienced recent negative performance and events. UnitedHealth Group's stock dropped 22%, causing a record 805-point single-stock decline in the DJIA. In March 2025, Nike's stock dropped 20.1%, Walt Disney's fell 13.3%, and Nvidia's declined 13.2%. IBM shares fell 7.6% after the company announced the cancellation of 15 government contracts. IBM (-6.6%) and Procter & Gamble (-3.7%) have also experienced recent losses.\n\nThe broader US stock market is experiencing significant volatility driven by corporate earnings, trade policy uncertainty, and economic indicators. President Trump's tariffs sparked a 2,200-point drop in the DJIA on April 4, 2025. In response to the impact of tariffs, Deutsche Bank strategists cut their year-end S&P 500 target by 12%. The Federal Reserve is described as cautious due to persistent inflation.",

    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "About 67 days (until July 1, 2025)",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "The S&P Dow Jones Indices committee makes no membership changes through July 1, 2025. Despite volatility and some weak performers (e.g., Boeing, 3M, Verizon, IBM, Disney, Nike), none trigger a sector-representation or price-weighting concern large enough to warrant a swap, and there are no major constituent splits, spin-offs, or M&A forcing action.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "S&P Dow Jones Indices announces a change to improve sector representation or address price-weighting distortions—e.g., Verizon or Disney is dropped for Alphabet or Meta; IBM is dropped for Alphabet; Boeing is dropped due to ongoing operational crises; or 3M is dropped following additional restructuring—effective immediately or on a near-term date. Any such announcement before July 1 resolves the question as Yes.",
    "rationale": "Base rates favor No. DJIA changes are infrequent and tend to cluster around clear catalysts: major corporate actions (spin-offs, mergers), large stock splits that distort the price-weighted index, or a desire to refresh sector representation. Over the last decade, changes occurred in 2015, 2018, 2020, and February 2024 (Intel and Walgreens out; Nvidia and Amazon in). That cadence implies roughly one change every 2–3 years, not multiple per year, which makes another change within the next ~2 months less likely.\n\nWhat could push to Yes? The most plausible candidates to be dropped in the near term are legacy or underperforming names where there is a strong replacement fit: Verizon (potentially replaced by Alphabet to modernize Communication Services representation), IBM (potentially replaced by Alphabet or Meta), Boeing (if its operational/safety issues worsen materially), or 3M (if further restructuring or legal developments materially change its profile). However, none of these appear to have an imminent, known catalyst on a <70-day horizon, and the Dow already boosted its large-cap tech exposure just last year with Nvidia and Amazon.\n\nWhy not higher? The research notes recent sharp moves (e.g., UNH’s large drop, Nike/Disney/Nvidia declines, tariff-driven selloffs). The Dow committee generally does not react to short-term price volatility. Without a split, spin-off, merger, or clear sector-balance rationale, odds remain modest.\n\nWhy not lower? The committee has shown a willingness to act to keep the index representative (e.g., multiple changes in 2024). If they judge Communication Services underrepresented versus market leadership, swapping in Alphabet for Verizon or IBM is a coherent move that could be announced at any time.\n\nKey updates that would move my forecast up: 1) credible reporting/rumors of committee discussions about adding Alphabet/Meta or removing a named laggard; 2) a major split by a high-priced component affecting index balance; 3) a material corporate event (e.g., Boeing regulatory crisis escalation, a large M&A/ spin-off among constituents). What would move it down: a quiet news flow with no relevant corporate actions through mid-June, or explicit commentary from S&P Dow Jones Indices suggesting no near-term changes.\n\nNetting these, I overweight the status quo and assign a modest tail for a representation-driven swap before July 1.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill any of these companies get dropped from the Dow Jones Industrial Average before July 1, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nOregon Business: [Intel Ousted From Dow Jones By Rival Nvidia](https://oregonbusiness.com/intel-ousted-from-dow-jones-by-rival-nvidia/)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if before July 1, 2025, there is any official announcement or confirmation (or credible source reporting) that any of the following companies will no longer be a component of the Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA) either on the official announcement or that the company has been or will be removed from the index: Amazon.com Inc, American Express Co, Amgen Inc, Apple Inc, Boeing Co, Caterpillar Inc, Cisco Systems Inc, Chevron Corp, Goldman Sachs Group Inc, Home Depot Inc, Honeywell International Inc, International Business Machines Corp, Johnson & Johnson, Coca-Cola Co, JPMorgan Chase & Co, McDonald’s Corp, 3M Co, Merck & Co Inc, Microsoft Corp, Nike Inc, Procter & Gamble Co, Sherwin-Williams Co, Travelers Companies Inc, Unitedhealth Group Inc, Salesforce Inc, NVIDIA Corp, Verizon Communications Inc, Visa Inc, Walmart Inc, Walt Disney Co.\n\nAlthough removals from the index are generally effective immediately in order to forestall frontrunning, this is not a requirement for this question. All that is required is for there to be an announcement or confirmation before the resolution date about the removal from the DJIA at any point in time. Therefore this question will resolve based on the announcement or confirmation, not on the actual removal date.\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nHistorical changes to the Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA) are infrequent.

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
