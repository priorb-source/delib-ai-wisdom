    "review": "All three analyses converge on similar reasoning and arrive at forecasts between 20-30%, which suggests we're identifying the key factors correctly. Forecaster 3 raises an important point I initially underweighted: if The Guardian article discussing the climate website purges was published in early February 2025, and the site remained down through May 5, this represents 3+ months of being offline, not just the 2-3 weeks I initially emphasized. This longer timeline is significant evidence that this represents entrenched policy rather than a temporary action. Both other forecasters appropriately highlight that military climate resilience has operational value for base planning and readiness, which I also noted. Forecaster 2's point about military institutional independence is valid but may be overstated given how consistently the Trump administration has implemented its climate policy agenda across agencies. The consensus that 6 weeks is short for policy reversal but technically sufficient for website restoration if prioritized is reasonable. Neither forecaster presented evidence of active restoration efforts, legal challenges, or congressional pressure that would justify a higher forecast.",
    "rationale": "Upon review, Forecaster 3's observation about the extended timeline (3+ months offline rather than just weeks) is important new information that strengthens the case for an entrenched policy position. This makes restoration less likely than my initial assessment suggested. However, I maintain that six weeks provides meaningful time for change if circumstances shift, and the military's operational need for climate resilience planning provides a legitimate non-ideological rationale for restoration that could generate internal resistance. The lack of any reported restoration efforts, legal challenges, or congressional action as of mid-May 2025 is also significant negative evidence. Balancing the longer offline period (which I underweighted) against the still-meaningful 6-week window and genuine military operational concerns, I should revise my forecast slightly downward from 25% to 22%. This positions me between my original estimate and Forecaster 3's more pessimistic 20%, acknowledging the stronger evidence of policy entrenchment while maintaining that the timeframe and military operational pressures prevent this from being a near-certainty.",
