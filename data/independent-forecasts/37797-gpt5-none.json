    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "About 5–6 weeks (FATF June 2025 plenary outcomes are typically published immediately after the meeting).",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No change: the list remains Iran, North Korea, and Myanmar.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "FATF maintains the current “High-Risk Jurisdictions subject to a Call for Action” list with Iran, DPRK, and Myanmar; ongoing deficiencies and geopolitics make removals unlikely, and no grey-listed country is escalated.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "FATF adds a new jurisdiction (e.g., escalates a grey‑listed jurisdiction that has severely failed its action plan or a politically salient case) or removes one of the three current jurisdictions due to demonstrable compliance progress and FATF acknowledgement post‑plenary.",
    "rationale": "Time to resolution is short, and there are no advance signals here of imminent changes. Historically, the FATF “black list” changes infrequently compared to the grey list. In the last several years, notable changes were rare (e.g., Myanmar’s addition in 2022; Iran’s countermeasures status changes in 2016/2020), while many plenaries pass with no black‑list change. The current three—DPRK, Iran, Myanmar—each face substantial, entrenched issues that make near‑term removal unlikely by June 2025. Escalation from grey to black generally follows clear ICRG signaling and repeated failure to meet action‑plan milestones; absent such signals, additions are possible but uncommon. Political escalations (e.g., blacklisting a major economy) would be extraordinary and typically preceded by sustained public signaling; none is evident in hand. Given base rates and the lack of new indications, I put extra weight on status quo persistence. Why not higher: black‑list changes are historically rare per plenary, and removals look especially unlikely for all three current jurisdictions by June 2025. Why not lower: there is always some chance that FATF escalates a struggling grey‑listed jurisdiction or makes a political determination; a single addition or removal would resolve Yes. What would move me up: pre‑plenary ICRG statements or credible press leaks flagging a specific jurisdiction for ‘call for action’; official notices that a grey‑listed country failed its plan in a way that triggers counter‑measures; unexpectedly rapid reforms acknowledged by FATF for Myanmar or Iran. What would move me down: explicit FATF pre‑briefings indicating no changes to the call‑for‑action list; evidence of progress insufficient for removal and no jurisdictions flagged for escalation. Research assistant provided no additional information, so this forecast leans on structure, base rates, and recent history.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill any jurisdictions be added to or removed from the FATF \"black list\" following the FATF Plenary meeting in June 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nWikipedia: [Financial Action Task Force blacklist](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Financial_Action_Task_Force_blacklist)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if following its June 2025 plenary, the Financial Action Task Force (FATF) has made any changes to its \"High-Risk Jurisdictions subject to a Call for Action\" list, which at the time of this question consists of North Korea, Myanmar and Iran. Resolves according to the [official list](https://www.fatf-gafi.org/en/countries/black-and-grey-lists.html).\n\nThe question may resolve according to [credible sources](https://www.metaculus.com/help/faq/#definitions) in case the website is unavailable or not timely updated.\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nNo additional information available.\n\nToday is 2025-05-19.\n\nBefore answering you think:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n(e) You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
