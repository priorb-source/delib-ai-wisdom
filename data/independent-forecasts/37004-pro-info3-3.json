  "information": "Analysis of voter demographics and commitment levels reveals differing patterns. Among declared voters, 76% of Conservative supporters describe themselves as \"very committed\" to their choice, compared to 63% for Liberal supporters. The Conservative Party holds a narrow lead among voters under the age of 35, with 39% support versus 38% for the Liberals. Advanced voting has seen high participation, with over 2 million ballots cast on the first day. No further major debates or campaign-wide events are scheduled before the election.",

    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Approximately 6 months, as the election is scheduled to occur on or before October 20, 2025.",
    "status_quo_outcome": "The Conservative Party wins the popular vote, as they did in the previous two federal elections in 2019 and 2021.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "A successful last-minute Liberal campaign mobilizes its less-committed base and reverses the Conservatives' narrow lead among younger voters, allowing the Liberals to narrowly edge out the Conservatives in the popular vote.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "The Conservatives' highly committed base turns out at a higher rate than other parties' supporters, and they maintain their slight advantage with younger voters, securing the most votes nationally for the third consecutive election.",
    "rationale": "My forecast is primarily based on the established precedent from the 2019 and 2021 elections, where the Conservative Party won the popular vote. The status quo is a powerful force in forecasting, and repeating this outcome is a highly plausible scenario. The provided research assistant's report strengthens this position. The higher commitment level among Conservative voters (76% 'very committed' vs. 63% for Liberals) is a significant indicator of a turnout advantage, which is crucial in a close race. Furthermore, the Conservatives holding a narrow lead with voters under 35, while slim, suggests they are making inroads with a key demographic, which is essential for winning a plurality of votes nationally. With no further major debates, there are fewer opportunities for significant shifts in the campaign dynamic, which tends to benefit the party with a more energized base.\n\nMy probability is not higher because the race is evidently close. The lead among younger voters is razor-thin and could easily be reversed. A small swing in public opinion or a particularly effective Liberal get-out-the-vote operation could be enough to change the popular vote outcome. The power of incumbency should not be dismissed.\n\nConversely, my probability is not lower because the combination of a highly motivated base, the precedent of winning the popular vote twice, and a political environment likely focused on issues like cost-of-living provides the Conservatives with a distinct advantage in this specific contest. For me to lower my forecast, I would need to see a sustained polling shift in favor of the Liberals or a significant, unforced error from the Conservative campaign. To raise it, I would need to see the Conservatives' polling lead expand consistently outside the margin of error.",

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any).
