  "information": "In April 2025, several protests occurred in India related to land and religious laws. On April 14, protests against a Muslim land law in eastern India turned violent, resulting in three reported deaths. Separately, from April 8-12, violent protests against the Waqf Act took place in Murshidabad, West Bengal. Muslim communities also held symbolic \"Lights Off\" protests against the Waqf (Amendment) Act, 2025. Ongoing communal tensions have been noted in West Bengal and Uttarakhand.\n\nReports from various news outlets indicate several planned or recent mobilizations. The Free Press Journal reported on a planned march involving 10,000 farmers. India Today has covered rallies organized by the Trinamool Congress (TMC) for teachers. Additionally, a global housing action day protest was scheduled for April 26, 2025, with events planned in multiple countries, including India.\n\nIndia has a history of large-scale demonstrations that have exceeded 10,000 participants, including the farmers' protests of 2020-2021 and the anti-CAA protests of 2019-2020. The Global Protest Tracker recorded 145 anti-government protests worldwide in the 12 months preceding May 2025. Reports also indicate that authorities in India have used technologies such as drones with facial recognition to identify participants in farmer protests and subsequently confiscate their passports.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Approximately 2 months until July 1, 2025",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No - most protests do not reach 10,000+ participants and even when they do, they may not be documented by the specific Global Protest Tracker",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "The current protest movements in India (related to the Waqf Act, Muslim land laws, and farmer issues) either dissipate, remain below the 10,000 participant threshold, or fail to be documented by the Carnegie Endowment's Global Protest Tracker despite potentially occurring",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "One of the ongoing protest movements escalates significantly, drawing 10,000+ participants to a single event - such as the mentioned planned farmer march or a major rally against the Waqf Amendment Act - and this protest gets documented by the Global Protest Tracker with sufficient participant numbers before July 1, 2025",
    "rationale": "India has demonstrated capacity for large-scale mobilization with the 2020-2021 farmers' protests and 2019-2020 anti-CAA protests exceeding 10,000 participants. The research assistant reports multiple active protest movements in April 2025, including violent protests over land laws and the Waqf Act, plus a planned farmer march specifically mentioning 10,000 participants. With approximately 2 months remaining, there is adequate time for these movements to organize major demonstrations. However, the critical constraint is the Global Protest Tracker's specific coverage. The tracker recorded only 145 anti-government protests globally in 12 months, suggesting selective documentation criteria. Not every large protest gets included, and the tracker may have lag time in reporting or specific thresholds beyond just participant numbers. The 10,000+ threshold is substantial but achievable in India's context. The forecast is not higher because: (1) the specific documentation requirement is restrictive, (2) planned protests often don't materialize at expected scale, (3) current protests may have started before question launch and wouldn't count. The forecast is not lower because: (1) India has proven capacity for mass mobilization, (2) multiple active protest movements increase chances, (3) elevated tensions suggest continued unrest, (4) 2 months provides sufficient organizing time. I would update higher if: specific large protests are announced with confirmed dates, tensions escalate further, or evidence emerges of tracker's reliable India coverage. I would update lower if: current movements dissipate, government suppression increases, or tracker shows sparse recent India coverage",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill the Global Protest Tracker report any protests in India with 10,000+ participants, before July 1, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nReuters: [Three dead as protests against Muslim land law turn violent in eastern India](https://www.reuters.com/world/india/three-dead-protests-against-muslim-land-law-turn-violent-eastern-india-2025-04-14/)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below.

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
