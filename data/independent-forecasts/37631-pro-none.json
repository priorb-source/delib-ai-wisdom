    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "1 month and 14 days",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No. As of mid-May 2025, Tesla's market capitalization is slightly higher than Walmart's, though the gap is narrow.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Tesla's market cap remains higher than Walmart's, likely driven by positive news regarding its future growth initiatives like the Robotaxi, strong Q2 delivery expectations, or a broader market shift back towards growth stocks.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Walmart's market cap surpasses Tesla's. This is likely caused by a decline in Tesla's volatile stock price due to increased competition or execution concerns, combined with Walmart's stock remaining stable or appreciating due to its perception as a defensive value stock.",
    "rationale": "My forecast is based on the small current gap in market capitalization and the significant difference in the volatility and nature of the two companies. As of today, May 13, 2025, Tesla's market cap is only slightly ahead of Walmart's, making the status quo outcome 'No', but this lead is fragile. The question essentially pits a high-volatility growth stock (Tesla) against a low-volatility value stock (Walmart) over a short, 6-week period. The provided background information, citing a JPMorgan analysis, highlights significant institutional concern about Tesla's valuation and potential for decline, which supports the 'Yes' scenario. Tesla's valuation is heavily dependent on future narratives (AI, Robotaxis, FSD) which can shift rapidly with news cycles. In contrast, Walmart's valuation is anchored to its consistent, massive revenues and its status as a defensive staple, making large, unexpected drops less likely. Given the narrow gap, even a minor stumble by Tesla or a modest gain by Walmart could flip the outcome. Therefore, I believe the probability of Tesla's higher volatility working against it in the current market environment is slightly greater than the probability of it maintaining its lead.\n\nMy forecast is not higher than 55% because the outcome is very close to a coin flip. The status quo is 'No', and any positive catalyst for Tesla, such as a well-received FSD update or strong preliminary delivery numbers, could easily widen its lead over Walmart.\n\nMy forecast is not lower than 50% because the inherent volatility of Tesla's stock and the documented headwinds it faces (intense EV competition, margin pressures) create a substantial and plausible path for its market cap to dip below Walmart's within the given timeframe. \n\nI would update my forecast higher (towards Yes) with any negative news for Tesla, such as production delays or a guidance cut, or if Walmart posts exceptionally strong earnings. I would update lower (towards No) if Tesla announces a significant positive development or if market sentiment broadly shifts to strongly favor growth and technology stocks.",
