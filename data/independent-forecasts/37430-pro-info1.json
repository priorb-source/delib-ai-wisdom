  "information": "According to Taiwo Oyedele, the Chairman of the Presidential Committee on Fiscal Policy and Tax Reforms, the proposed Tax Reform Bill includes a provision to exempt real estate transactions from Value Added Tax (VAT). Official statements indicate the bill also contains exemptions on stamp duties for rents below N10 million per month and capital gains tax on the sale of dwelling houses. The stated purpose of these reforms is to reduce the tax burden on the construction and real estate sectors, thereby lowering housing costs and improving affordability for low-income earners.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Less than 2 months.",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No, real estate transactions would officially remain subject to VAT as no new exempting legislation is enacted.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "The National Assembly fails to pass the Tax Reform Bill, or a version of it without the VAT exemption, before July 1, 2025. This could be due to legislative delays, prioritization of other bills, or political disagreements over other aspects of the broader tax reform package.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "The National Assembly fast-tracks the Tax Reform Bill, passing it through both chambers, and the President signs it into law before the July 1, 2025 deadline. The enacted legislation includes the specific provision exempting real estate transactions from VAT.",
    "rationale": "There is significant positive momentum for this legislation, driven by the Presidential Committee on Fiscal Policy and Tax Reforms. The policy's stated goal—to improve housing affordability—is politically popular and unlikely to face major opposition on its own merits. This strong executive backing and clear policy rationale make passage probable. However, the primary risk is the compressed timeline. With less than two months until the deadline, the Nigerian legislative process, which can be slow, may not conclude in time. The bill is part of a larger tax reform package, and delays caused by more contentious elements in the package could prevent this specific, popular provision from being enacted by the deadline. Therefore, while the political will is a strong positive indicator, the procedural risk of legislative delay is substantial. My forecast is not higher because of the significant risk that the legislative process simply runs out of time. It is not lower because the high-level executive push and popular nature of the reform make it a priority that is likely to be expedited. I would increase my forecast upon news that the bill has passed a second reading in either legislative chamber. I would decrease my forecast if there is no significant legislative progress by early June 2025 or if major political disputes arise concerning other parts of the bill.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill Nigeria enact legislation exempting real estate transactions from VAT before July 1, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\n[FG: Tax reform bill to exempt real estate transactions from VAT, boost housing affordability in Nigeria](https://nairametrics.com/2025/04/25/fg-tax-reform-bill-to-exempt-real-estate-transactions-from-vat-boost-housing-affordability-in-nigeria/)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below.

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
