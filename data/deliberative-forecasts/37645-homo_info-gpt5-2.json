    "review": "Forecaster 2 usefully foregrounds the 45–60 day legal window between calling and holding elections. That’s a key constraint I underweighted: if the government prefers an early September election, the announcement would most likely come in July, which would miss this question’s cutoff. Their point about the political unattractiveness of a late July/August vote is also persuasive. Forecaster 3’s analysis introduces the claim of a new government winning a confidence vote in mid‑April; that contradicts the provided timeline (Vučić still saying on May 14 a decision would be made “within ten days”), so I discount that premise. I agree with both on the default toward no announcement given a stable majority and coalition preferences against early polls, and with F2 that the remaining paths to a pre‑July 1 announcement are narrow and summer‑dependent.",
    "rationale": "I’m revising down from 40% to 28%. The main update is weighting the legal/timing mechanics: a pre‑July 1 announcement implies a late July or August election date due to the 45–60 day rule, and that is politically suboptimal. If Vučić opts for elections but prefers early September, the announcement would likely slip into July, resolving this question as No. While Vučić’s repeated “decision within ten days” keeps a real option for snap polls, the ruling bloc’s stable majority and coalition signals against early elections make forming a new cabinet the path of least resistance. Thus, conditional on choosing elections at all (which I now put modestly below even odds), the probability that the specific date is announced before July 1 is further reduced by the summer‑timing disincentive. I discount Forecaster 3’s low baseline because it relies on a likely incorrect assumption about an April confidence vote. Overall, a Yes remains plausible but requires both a decision for snap polls and a willingness to hold them in late summer.",
