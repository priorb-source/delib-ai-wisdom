  "information": "In April 2025, Russian President Vladimir Putin instructed the government to create a mechanism for the 'reverse purchase' of assets from foreign investors who have exited the Russian market. The government was given a deadline of May 15, 2025, to establish the procedures for these transactions. The decree specifies that the conditions for reverse purchases must account for the rights and interests of the current Russian owners of these assets.",

    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "About 26 days (until July 1, 2025)",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "NYT covers Russia’s asset policy and China consumer trends using more standard terms (e.g., “buyback,” “repurchase,” “reverse repurchase,” “buy back assets”) and never prints the exact phrases “reverse purchasing” or “reverse purchase” in any item dated June 10–30, 2025.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "A mid/late-June NYT piece (news, DealBook, or opinion) quotes Russian documents or officials using the term “reverse purchase,” or runs a feature on China’s “reverse purchasing” trend and reproduces that exact wording, triggering a hit in the specified NYT search window.",
    "rationale": "The resolution requires the exact phrases “reverse purchasing” or “reverse purchase” to appear in NYT content dated June 10–30, 2025. Exact-phrase matches are uncommon unless a term is standardized or widely quoted. The status quo—NYT using more familiar terminology—leans No. The research assistant notes that Putin ordered a mechanism for the “reverse purchase” of assets, with procedures due mid-May. That creates a plausible hook for June follow-up coverage, but NYT and other Western outlets more often use terms like “buy back,” “repurchase,” or “reverse repurchase,” not “reverse purchase.” Also, if NYT already covered this in May with different wording, it reduces odds they’ll newly adopt the exact phrase in the June 10–30 window. A secondary route is coverage of China’s consumer trend labeled “reverse purchasing,” but that phrasing isn’t yet common in English-language business reporting. Why not higher: limited 3-week window; exact-phrase constraint; strong likelihood of alternative terminology. Why not lower: there is a live policy development in Russia that could be quoted verbatim and a potential China trend angle, either of which could produce a direct quote of “reverse purchase/purchasing.” Upward updates: evidence that Russian government/major wires (Bloomberg, Reuters, AP) are using the English term “reverse purchase” in June; NYT DealBook or international desk previews adopting that language; Chinese trend stories explicitly using “reverse purchasing” in English. Downward updates: NYT and wires consistently describe the Russia mechanism without that exact phrase through mid-June; emerging consensus on alternative wording (e.g., “buyback mechanism”) without quotes of “reverse purchase.”",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill the New York Times mention \"reverse purchasing\" before July 1, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nPeople's Daily: [“Reverse purchasing” reflects the vitality of the Chinese market](http://finance.people.com.cn/n1/2025/0430/c1004-40471159.html)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below.

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
