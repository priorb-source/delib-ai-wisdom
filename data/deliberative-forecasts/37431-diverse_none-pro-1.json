    "review": "The other forecasters provided structured reasoning that improved upon my own, primarily by introducing explicit base rate estimates for recall closure timelines. Forecaster 2 suggested a typical timeline of 2-4 months for this type of recall, while Forecaster 3 suggested 1-3 months. This key difference in base rates seems to account for most of the divergence in their final probabilities (32% vs. 46%). I found Forecaster 2's more conservative 2-4 month estimate slightly more convincing, as government regulatory processes often trend towards the slower end. Furthermore, Forecaster 3's argument that a ~65,000-pound recall likely involves a complex, wide distribution network was a crucial point I had not weighed heavily enough. A complex distribution network is a significant factor that would delay the verification and documentation steps necessary for closure, pushing the timeline towards the longer end of any estimated range. Both analyses reinforced that the status quo outcome is 'No' and that a resolution before July 1 would require an unusually efficient process.",
    "rationale": "My initial forecast of 40% was based on the general sense that the 67-day timeframe was tight but possible, weighing the high-risk Class I status against the large product volume. The other experts' analyses prompted me to refine this reasoning. I now place more weight on the arguments suggesting a longer timeline. Specifically, I am persuaded by Forecaster 2's citation of a 2-4 month typical closure time, which places our 67-day deadline at the very optimistic beginning of that range. I am also convinced by Forecaster 3's point that the ~65,000-pound volume implies a wide and potentially complex distribution network, which is a major logistical hurdle for a swift recall closure. These factors make a resolution before July 1 less likely than I had initially assessed. While an efficient recall is still possible (as reflected in Forecaster 3's more optimistic base rate), the balance of evidence now points more strongly towards the recall remaining 'Active' past the deadline. Therefore, I am lowering my forecast from 40% to 35%, to better reflect the likely friction from bureaucratic processes and the logistical challenges implied by the recall's scale.",
