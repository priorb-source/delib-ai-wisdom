    "yes_outcome_scenario": "An unforeseen and severe international crisis emerges, necessitating an emergency, last-minute summit. Bypassing normal protocols, a visit is rapidly arranged and Donald Trump travels to and arrives in China before July 1, 2025.",
    "rationale": "The primary factor driving this forecast is the extremely short timeframe. With only 16 days remaining until the July 1, 2025 deadline, the logistical, security, and diplomatic complexities of organizing a US presidential visit to China make it practically impossible. Such trips require weeks, if not months, of meticulous advance planning. There are currently no public announcements, official statements, or even credible media rumors to suggest that a visit is being contemplated, let alone planned. The status quo is that such high-level diplomatic engagements are not spontaneous. Therefore, the default outcome of 'No' is overwhelmingly likely. The probability is not zero to account for the minute possibility of a 'black swan' event—a sudden, severe global crisis that would necessitate an unprecedented, emergency meeting. My forecast would only increase from this very low baseline upon the emergence of credible, official reports that a visit is being hastily arranged.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill Donald Trump visit China before July 1, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nFox News: [Trump touts 'very positive' breakthrough with Xi after slamming China for trade violation](https://www.foxnews.com/politics/trump-touts-very-positive-breakthrough-xi-after-slamming-china-trade-violation) | Wikipedia: [List of international presidential trips made by Donald Trump](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_international_presidential_trips_made_by_Donald_Trump)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if, after this question opens and before July 1, 2025, President Donald Trump personally visits China.\n\n\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nNo additional information available.\n\nToday is 2025-06-15.\n\nBefore answering you think:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n(e) You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
