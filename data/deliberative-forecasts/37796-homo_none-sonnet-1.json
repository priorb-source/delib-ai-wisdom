    "review": "All three forecasters converged remarkably closely (70-72%), which provides some validation of our reasoning. We all identified the same key factors: the February 2025 changes demonstrating active list management, the low bar for resolution requiring only any single change, the large pool of 25 monitored jurisdictions, and FATF's three-meetings-per-year schedule. However, Forecaster 3 raised a compelling timing argument I underweighted: only 3-4 months separate the February and June plenaries. If the February meeting addressed the 'most ready' candidates - the Philippines for removal and Laos/Nepal for additions - this reduces the probability that sufficient progress will occur by June for another removal. While new additions remain possible through ongoing global monitoring, the recent February activity might have cleared the pipeline of imminent changes. Forecaster 3's emphasis on status quo bias is also well-taken - not every plenary results in changes, and defaulting to assuming change may overestimate the probability. That said, I find the counterarguments still compelling: 25 jurisdictions creates multiple paths to resolution, the question's low bar significantly increases probability versus predicting specific changes, and FATF's demonstrated active monitoring suggests they won't let too many meetings pass without updates.",
    "rationale": "After deliberation, I'm adjusting my forecast slightly downward from 72% to 69%. The most persuasive new consideration is the timing factor - with only 3-4 months between the February changes and the June plenary, there's less time for current grey list members to complete action plans sufficiently for removal. The February update may have addressed the lowest-hanging fruit. However, I'm not adjusting dramatically because: (1) new jurisdictions can be identified for grey listing at any time through FATF's ongoing global monitoring, independent of when the last changes occurred, (2) the 25-jurisdiction pool still provides reasonable odds that at least one makes sufficient progress, (3) four months, while short, isn't negligible for demonstrating compliance progress, and (4) the low resolution bar (any change, not specific changes) maintains a relatively high probability. The convergence of all three forecasts around 70% suggests this range appropriately balances the competing considerations.",
