    "review": "The other two forecasters have made a critical error in their initial assessment, which invalidates the core of their reasoning. Both Forecaster 2 (20%) and Forecaster 3 (27%) operate under the incorrect assumption that Niger is currently at a Level 3 advisory and would need to be upgraded to Level 4. Their arguments about the rarity of Level 4 upgrades and the need for a significant catalyst are based on this flawed premise. In reality, as per the State Department's own website linked in the prompt, Niger has been at 'Level 4: Do Not Travel' since August 2023, following the military coup. Therefore, their low-probability forecasts are not a result of a different interpretation of risk, but a fundamental misunderstanding of the current situation. My initial analysis correctly identified that Niger is already at Level 4, making the question not about an upgrade, but about whether a new advisory will be *issued* before the deadline. The other forecasters' arguments are unconvincing because they are analyzing a different question entirely (the probability of an upgrade from Level 3 to Level 4).",
    "rationale": "My original reasoning stands and is significantly strengthened by the flawed premises of the other forecasts. The central point is that Niger is already under a 'Level 4 – Do Not Travel' advisory, and this advisory was last updated in August 2023. The question resolves 'Yes' if any new advisory is issued that confirms this Level 4 status before July 1, 2025.\n\nThere are two main pathways to a 'Yes' resolution:\n1.  **Procedural Re-issuance:** State Department advisories are reviewed periodically. By July 1, 2025, the existing advisory for Niger will be nearly two years old. It is highly probable that a routine review and re-issuance would occur within this timeframe. Given the ongoing political instability, the withdrawal of Western forces, and persistent threats of terrorism and kidnapping, there is virtually no chance of a downgrade. Therefore, any procedural update will reaffirm the Level 4 status.\n2.  **Event-Driven Re-issuance:** The security and political situation in Niger remains volatile. Any significant event, such as a major terrorist attack, a high-profile kidnapping of a Westerner, or a further deterioration in the U.S. diplomatic posture, would almost certainly trigger an immediate update to the travel advisory, reaffirming the 'Do Not Travel' warning.\n\nThe arguments from the other forecasters about advisory 'stickiness' actually support my position when applied correctly. The status quo is Level 4, and stickiness implies it is very unlikely to change. Their low forecasts are irrelevant as they are based on faulty data.\n\nI am increasing my forecast from 65% to 75%. This reflects my increased confidence after confirming that the counterarguments were based on a factual error. The primary uncertainty remains the exact timing of the State Department's bureaucratic schedule, which could fall just outside the two-month window. However, the combination of a very likely procedural update (given the old date of the current advisory) and the constant potential for an event-driven update makes a 'Yes' resolution the strong base case.",
