    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Approximately 2 months (until July 1, 2025)",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No - if current protests do not escalate to 10,000+ participants or are not documented by the Global Protest Tracker",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "The protests mentioned in the April 14 Reuters article remain localized in eastern India and do not reach 10,000+ participants. Alternatively, even if large protests occur, the Global Protest Tracker may not document them due to reporting delays, selection criteria, or focus on other regions. The protests could also de-escalate through government response or negotiations.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "The ongoing protests against the Muslim land law in eastern India escalate significantly, drawing 10,000+ participants as they spread to other regions. The deaths reported on April 14 could catalyze broader participation. Alternatively, India could see other large-scale protests emerge over different issues (economic, political, religious, or agricultural) within the 2-month window, which the Global Protest Tracker documents.",
    "rationale": "India has a well-established pattern of large-scale protests given its population of 1.4+ billion, active civil society, and diverse political landscape. Recent years have seen major protests including farmers' protests (2020-2021) and CAA/NRC protests (2019-2020), both drawing hundreds of thousands of participants. The April 14 Reuters article reporting three deaths in protests against Muslim land law indicates significant tensions and potential for escalation. Violent incidents often catalyze broader participation. However, several factors temper the probability: (1) Not all protest movements reach 10,000+ participants - many remain localized or smaller-scale; (2) The Global Protest Tracker is selective and may not report every large protest, particularly if it has reporting delays or prioritizes other criteria; (3) The 2-month window, while reasonable, is relatively short; (4) Government responses could suppress or de-escalate protests before they reach the threshold. My forecast is not higher because there's no guarantee the current protests will escalate to the required scale or that the Tracker will document them. It's not lower because India's history and current situation suggest a meaningful probability of large protests occurring. I would update upward if: reports emerge of protests growing rapidly in multiple cities, additional triggering events occur, or the Tracker begins documenting the ongoing protests. I would update downward if: the current protests are contained quickly, the government announces concessions, or the Tracker shows no activity in India as July approaches.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill the Global Protest Tracker report any protests in India with 10,000+ participants, before July 1, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nReuters: [Three dead as protests against Muslim land law turn violent in eastern India](https://www.reuters.com/world/india/three-dead-protests-against-muslim-land-law-turn-violent-eastern-india-2025-04-14/)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if the [Global Protest Tracker](https://carnegieendowment.org/features/global-protest-tracker?lang=en) reports a protest in India with 10,000 or more participants with a start date after the launch of this question and before July 1, 2025.\n\nA protest with at least 10,000 participants that is active at the launch of this question does not count for resolution.\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nNo additional information available.\n\nToday is 2025-05-02.\n\nBefore answering you think:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n(e) You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
