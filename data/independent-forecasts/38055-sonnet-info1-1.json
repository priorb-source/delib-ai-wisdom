  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Approximately 12 days until June 7, 2025, when UFC 316 takes place",
    "status_quo_outcome": "The fight between Joe Pyfer and Kelvin Gastelum is scheduled to proceed as planned on the main card of UFC 316, and one fighter will defeat the other (barring a draw or no contest)",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "The fight with Gastelum is cancelled again at the last minute due to injury, weight cut issues, or other complications, and Pyfer does not fight a replacement opponent. Alternatively, the fight proceeds but Pyfer loses to Gastelum by knockout, submission, or decision",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "The scheduled bout proceeds as planned and Joe Pyfer successfully defeats Kelvin Gastelum via knockout, TKO, submission, or decision. Alternatively, if the Gastelum fight falls through, Pyfer accepts a short-notice replacement opponent and wins",
    "rationale": "This forecast requires assessing two key probabilities: (1) whether the fight actually happens, and (2) if it does, whether Pyfer wins. Regarding the first point, the fight has already been cancelled once from UFC Mexico on March 29, which raises some concern about reliability. However, at 12 days out from UFC 316, most scheduled bouts do proceed - I estimate approximately 85-87% probability the fight happens. Regarding Pyfer's chances of victory, the research indicates he has slight advantages in grappling and reach against the southpaw Gastelum. Without detailed records or ranking information, I treat this as roughly even odds with a slight edge to Pyfer given his mentioned technical advantages - perhaps 50-53% if the fight occurs. The combined probability (fight happens × Pyfer wins) yields roughly 45-48%. My forecast is not higher because: there's real cancellation risk given the history, I lack detailed information about the fighters' current form and relative skill levels, and MMA outcomes are inherently unpredictable. My forecast is not lower because: the fight is scheduled and imminent (status quo favors it happening), Pyfer has identified technical advantages, and there's no strong evidence suggesting he's an underdog. I would update higher if I learned Pyfer is ranked significantly higher or has much better recent performance, or if we got closer to fight day without issues. I would update lower if injury news emerged or if analysis showed Gastelum as a clear favorite",
