    "review": "Both Forecaster 2 and Forecaster 3 introduced critical new evidence that was not available in my initial analysis. Forecaster 2's point about the very recent $450 million Series G funding round and the $200 million tender offer is extremely persuasive. These actions provide Rippling with a long cash runway and offer liquidity to stakeholders, directly mitigating the two primary drivers for an IPO. Forecaster 3's evidence of CEO Parker Conrad's direct statements in May 2025, claiming an IPO is 'not imminent' and that there are 'no specific plans,' is equally compelling. It is a powerful signal of intent, especially given the short timeframe before the question's deadline. Both forecasters arrived at the same 5% probability, and their reasoning is sound, well-supported, and aligns perfectly with the new evidence. Their arguments have convinced me that my initial assessment, while logical based on the limited information I had, was far too optimistic about the possibility of a 'Yes' outcome.",
    "rationale": "I am significantly updating my forecast downward from 15% to 5%. My initial analysis correctly identified the short time horizon and the Deel lawsuit as significant barriers to an IPO announcement. However, it was missing two crucial pieces of information brought forward by the other forecasters. Firstly, as Forecaster 2 noted, Rippling just closed a major funding and tender offer round in May 2025. Raising $450 million and providing $200 million in liquidity to employees and investors are actions a company takes to fortify its position as a private entity and delay the need to go public, not as an immediate prelude to it. Secondly, as Forecaster 3 highlighted, CEO Parker Conrad explicitly stated to the press that an IPO is 'not imminent.' A public statement like this from the CEO, coupled with the strategic financial moves, makes an announcement within the next five weeks incredibly unlikely. The combined weight of this new evidence—the capital to delay, the liquidity to reduce pressure, and the CEO's direct denial—is overwhelming. My initial 15% is no longer tenable. I am lowering my forecast to 5% to align with this new, much stronger body of evidence. I am not going lower than 5% to account for the very small possibility of a 'dual-track' process or that the CEO's comments were strategic misdirection in a rapidly changing market, but these possibilities are remote.",
