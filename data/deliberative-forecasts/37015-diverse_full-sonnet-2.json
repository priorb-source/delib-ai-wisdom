    "review": "The convergence of all three forecasts at 10-12% is striking and suggests we've identified the key factors correctly. Forecaster 2 and 3 both provide rigorous analyses that align closely with mine. The most valuable new information is Forecaster 3's mention of the 2017 precedent: acting president Hwang Kyo-ahn declined to run under similar neutrality concerns and timing constraints. This historical parallel strengthens the case that caretaker norms are binding and not just theoretical. Forecaster 3 also makes a useful distinction that the resolution only requires an announcement (not actual ballot access), though correctly notes this doesn't meaningfully change the calculus given the overwhelming barriers. Forecaster 2's emphasis on the lack of 'groundswell of public demand' needed to overcome procedural hurdles is well-taken. All three analyses agree on the core tension: substantial PPP factional pressure (50+ lawmakers) creates a non-zero probability, but missed deadlines, abysmal polling, historical precedent, lack of infrastructure, and the extremely narrow window (now just 11 days to May 4) make an announcement highly improbable.",
    "rationale": "The 2017 Hwang Kyo-ahn precedent is the key new piece of evidence. It demonstrates that in a closely analogous situation, South Korean constitutional norms and caretaker constraints proved binding enough to prevent an acting president from running. This reinforces that the barriers I identified are not merely theoretical but have held in recent practice. However, I must also weigh that each political moment is unique—the current PPP faction's organized pressure (with a formal support committee) may be stronger than in 2017. The time remaining has also shortened from 13 to 11 days, making campaign preparation even more implausible. Against this, Forecaster 3's point about Korean parties' capacity for rapid decision-making under emergency conditions is valid. The convergence of independent forecasts at 10-12% suggests this range is well-calibrated. Given the additional weight of the 2017 precedent but acknowledging remaining uncertainty from the organized PPP pressure, I'm making a modest downward adjustment from my initial 12% to 11%. This reflects marginally increased confidence that norms will hold, while still acknowledging the non-trivial factional pressure that prevents a forecast near zero.",
