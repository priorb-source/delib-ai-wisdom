    "review": "Forecaster 2 provides excellent analysis, particularly the crucial point about GoPro's main debt maturity (convertible note) being November 2025 - AFTER the July 1 deadline. This significantly reduces the probability of a near-term filing since companies typically file bankruptcy when facing debt maturities they cannot meet. The observation about ongoing operations (product launches, partnerships, scheduled earnings) is also well-taken. Forecaster 3 raises important concerns about the current ratio of 0.5 and severe financial distress, but appears to conflate 'high bankruptcy risk generally' with 'bankruptcy filing in the next 53 days specifically'. While a 0.5 current ratio and $432M net loss are alarming, they don't necessarily predict a filing in such a compressed timeframe, especially with $283M cash on hand and no immediate debt maturity. The key distinction is between financial distress (high) and probability of bankruptcy filing before July 1 (low due to short timeline and lack of near-term catalyst). Forecaster 2's analysis about companies exhausting out-of-court options first is particularly compelling - there's no evidence of restructuring advisors, missed payments, or covenant breaches that typically precede filings.",
    "rationale": "After reviewing both analyses, I'm moving my forecast down slightly from 4% to 3%. Forecaster 2's point about the November 2025 debt maturity is decisive - without a near-term maturity or known trigger event, there's no clear catalyst that would force GoPro to file in the next 53 days specifically. While Forecaster 3 correctly identifies severe financial distress, this addresses GoPro's general bankruptcy risk rather than the specific question of filing before July 1, 2025. The upcoming May 12 earnings report will be informative, but even negative results wouldn't typically trigger an immediate bankruptcy filing without other factors. The base rate for bankruptcy filings in any 8-week period remains very low even for distressed companies. I maintain some probability above zero because unexpected developments (covenant breaches, sudden supplier cuts, legal issues, or accelerated debt) could theoretically force a filing, but the probability is quite low given the short timeline and absence of known near-term catalysts.",
