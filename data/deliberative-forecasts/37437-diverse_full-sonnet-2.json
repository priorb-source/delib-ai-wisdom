    "review": "All three forecasters converge on 2-3%, which provides strong validation of the probability range. Forecaster 2 effectively emphasizes the catastrophic risk of failure for the CCP if an invasion were launched prematurely, reinforcing deterrence logic. Forecaster 3 raises two particularly valuable points I hadn't fully considered: (1) The outlying island scenario - a limited seizure of Kinmen, Matsu, or other Taiwan-controlled islands is more plausible than full Taiwan invasion in this timeframe, and the U.S. might still label this as 'invading Taiwan' since these are Taiwan-controlled territories. This increases tail risk slightly. (2) U.S. wording constraints - many escalation scenarios (blockade, quarantine, aerial/naval strikes) wouldn't trigger the resolution criteria since they don't involve ground forces, and the U.S. might avoid the term 'invasion' even in some coercive scenarios. This cuts against resolution probability. Forecaster 3's detailed mobilization indicators list (civilian ferry requisition, maritime exclusion zones, troop movements to Fujian/Guangdong) is also useful for anchoring what we should expect to see before action. The consensus on 2027 as the key readiness date, derived from CIA Director Burns and multiple military leaders, remains the strongest anchor against near-term action. All forecasters correctly note that with only ~8 weeks remaining and no observable mobilization indicators, the base rate for this specific outcome is extremely low.",
    "rationale": "After deliberation, I maintain my 2% forecast. The outlying island scenario raised by Forecaster 3 is a legitimate tail risk that slightly elevates probability - a limited fait accompli against Kinmen or Matsu is more plausible than full Taiwan invasion in 8 weeks, and could satisfy the resolution criteria if the U.S. publicly accuses China of invading Taiwan-controlled territory. However, several factors prevent me from updating higher: (1) Even outlying island operations would generate observable indicators (amphibious force positioning, civilian vessel requisitions, exclusion zones) that aren't currently reported. (2) The 2027 readiness timeline remains a very strong anchor - all intelligence assessments point to that date, not mid-2025. (3) Forecaster 3's point about U.S. wording is valid - the resolution requires specific language about ground forces invading Taiwan, which the U.S. might not use in many escalation scenarios. (4) With only 57 days remaining, there's insufficient time for the preparations required even for limited operations without detection. (5) The catastrophic consequences of failed action (per Forecaster 2) create strong deterrence against premature moves. The deliberation reinforces that 2-3% is the appropriate range for this extremely low-probability but non-zero tail risk scenario.",
