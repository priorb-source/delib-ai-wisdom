    "review": "The other two forecasters identified the same core tension as I did: the baseline for a Class III recall (median closure ~90 days) versus the specific complicating factors of this case (large volume, multi-state foodservice distribution, and very long shelf life). We all agree these factors push the probability below 50%. Forecaster 2 (40%) and Forecaster 3 (46%) arrived at slightly more optimistic conclusions than my initial 35%. They seem to anchor more closely to the 90-day median and then discount for the complications, whereas I treated the complications, especially the long shelf life, as more fundamentally challenging to the standard timeline. Forecaster 3 made an excellent point I had not explicitly considered: administrative lags at FSIS could delay the status change even if Cargill's work is complete. This argument actually strengthens the case for a 'No' resolution. Their reasoning was convincing and well-structured, highlighting that while we all see the same picture, we have slightly different weights on the key variables.",
    "rationale": "After reviewing the other analyses, I am adjusting my forecast. My initial assessment at 35% was the most pessimistic of the group. While my reasoning remains unchanged—namely that the combination of wide foodservice distribution and a very long shelf life (into 2026) presents a significant hurdle to achieving verified product retrieval within the 95-day window—the other forecasts have prompted me to moderate this view slightly. The fact that two other experts landed in the 40-46% range suggests I may have been overweighting the negative factors and underweighting the mitigating ones (Class III status, no illnesses, highly capable company). The 95-day resolution window is very close to the historical median for this recall class. While this specific recall is more complex than the median case, it may not be a dramatic outlier. Therefore, I am revising my forecast upward to incorporate the group's perspective. I am moving from 35% to 40%, aligning with Forecaster 2. This reflects a slight decrease in my confidence in a strongly negative outcome, acknowledging that an efficient recall by Cargill could plausibly meet the deadline, even with the existing challenges. The probability remains below 50% because the long shelf-life factor continues to be a major obstacle that, in my view, makes a 'No' resolution more likely than not.",
