    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Approximately 46 days (until July 1, 2025)",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No - the objective remains marked as 'in progress' and is not marked as complete by the deadline",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Federal funding for NPR and PBS continues in some form, or while some actions have been taken (explaining the 'in progress' status), the spreadsheet maintainers do not consider the objective fully complete by July 1. This could occur if funding is reduced but not eliminated, if legislative/executive actions are announced but not fully implemented, or if the maintainers maintain high standards for what constitutes 'complete' elimination of funding.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "The Trump administration takes swift executive action to redirect or eliminate CPB funding, and/or Congress passes appropriations bills that zero out funding for NPR/PBS within the next 1.5 months. The Keep_Track subreddit maintainers then update the spreadsheet to mark this objective as complete, determining that federal funding has been sufficiently stopped to meet the Project 2025 goal.",
    "rationale": "The key challenge here is the 1.5-month timeline. The objective is currently 'in progress,' suggesting some preliminary actions may have been taken, but moving from 'in progress' to 'complete' requires both: (1) actual substantive defunding to occur, and (2) community moderators to judge it complete.\n\nDefunding NPR/PBS would primarily require reducing or eliminating appropriations to the Corporation for Public Broadcasting (CPB). This typically requires congressional budget action, which moves slowly even with unified government control. While executive actions could redirect some funding, complete elimination would likely need legislation.\n\nThe 'complete' designation is a high bar. The spreadsheet maintainers would likely require clear evidence that federal funding has been definitively stopped, not just proposed or partially reduced. Given bureaucratic timelines, appropriations processes, and potential legal challenges, achieving and confirming complete defunding within 46 days is challenging.\n\nMy forecast is not higher because: the timeline is very compressed for major policy implementation, 'complete' suggests full achievement rather than partial progress, and federal budget processes are notoriously slow.\n\nMy forecast is not lower because: the 'in progress' status suggests active work on this goal, the Trump administration may prioritize this ideological objective, and executive actions could potentially achieve rapid changes that maintainers might mark as complete.\n\nI would update higher if: evidence emerges of imminent congressional votes on defunding, executive orders are issued specifically targeting CPB funding, or the spreadsheet maintainers indicate they use looser standards for 'complete.' I would update lower if: we pass mid-June without major legislative action or the appropriations calendar shows no relevant bills scheduled.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill the Project 2025 Tracker spreadsheet have the objective of stopping funding for NPR and PBS marked as complete before July 1, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nAt the time of this question, the objective was marked as \"in progress.\" The 2025 Tracker is a project of the Keep_Track subreddit and is explained [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/Keep_Track/comments/1ii7tbr/project_2025_tracker_is_now_live/).\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if the Project 2025 objective to \"stop funding for NPR and PBS\" is marked as complete according to [this spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1QGG6wNHna-1tt91yXNkOauAJJ7snobFjfEnmxlmzhl4/edit?gid=0#gid=0) before July 1, 2025. If it is anything other than complete (such as \"in progress\") when accessed by Metaculus on or after July 1, 2025, then the question resolves as **No**.\n\n\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nNo additional information available.\n\nToday is 2025-05-16.\n\nBefore answering you think:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n(e) You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
