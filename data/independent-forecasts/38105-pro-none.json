    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Approximately one month, as the question resolves on July 1, 2025.",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No agreement will be announced, as Lebanon's political infighting and resistance to reforms from vested interests, which have stalled progress for years, will continue.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Lebanon's fragmented political class fails to agree on and implement the key prior actions required by the IMF, such as financial sector restructuring, a capital control law, and exchange rate unification. Powerful political and banking interests continue to block these reforms to protect their own positions. The caretaker government lacks the political power to overcome this opposition, and the one-month timeframe proves insufficient to break years of deadlock. The deadline passes without a signed agreement.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "An acute escalation of the economic crisis, such as a new currency collapse or major social unrest, creates overwhelming pressure on the political establishment. This forces a rare moment of consensus, leading to the rapid passage of a minimal set of reforms deemed sufficient by the IMF. Alternatively, intense, last-minute diplomatic pressure from an external power like France or the United States brokers a breakthrough. This allows for a deal to be hastily finalized and announced just before the July 1, 2025 deadline.",
    "rationale": "My forecast is based primarily on the persistent political paralysis that has prevented Lebanon from implementing the necessary reforms to secure an IMF deal for several years. The status quo is one of inaction. A Staff-Level Agreement (SLA) has been in place since April 2022, but Lebanon has failed to enact the 'prior actions' required to unlock funds. These reforms, particularly in the banking sector, directly threaten the entrenched interests of the political and financial elite, who have consistently blocked progress.\n\nThe caretaker government has limited authority, and the country has lacked a president for an extended period, creating a leadership vacuum that makes passing contentious legislation nearly impossible. The provided information—a finance minister's expression of confidence—is considered cheap talk; politicians frequently express optimism that does not reflect the underlying political reality.\n\nWhy the probability is not lower than 10%: The economic situation in Lebanon remains dire, and a complete collapse is a constant threat. This desperation could, in theory, force a sudden political breakthrough. There is always a small possibility that external pressure or an unforeseen internal event could catalyze a last-minute deal.\n\nWhy the probability is not higher than 10%: The timeframe of approximately one month is extremely short to overcome years of deep-seated political gridlock. The structural impediments that have blocked a deal until now remain firmly in place. A higher probability would fail to adequately weigh the strong historical evidence of inaction and the powerful vested interests opposing the IMF's conditions.\n\nI would increase my forecast if there were credible reports of a parliamentary breakthrough on one of the key IMF-mandated laws. I would decrease it further if prominent political blocs explicitly reject a proposed reform package, reaffirming the ongoing stalemate.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill the IMF and Lebanon announce an agreement before July 1, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\n[Lebanon finance minister confident of a new deal with IMF to help crumbling economy](https://www.newarab.com/news/lebanon-finance-minister-confident-new-deal-imf)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if Lebanon and the International Monetary Fund announce any economic agreement between the two entities signed after the launch of this question and before July 1, 2025. In order to count, it must involve the IMF agreeing to provide money to Lebanon, whether through loans, grants, or any other means.\n\n\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nNo additional information available.\n\nToday is 2025-05-30.\n\nBefore answering you think:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n(e) You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
