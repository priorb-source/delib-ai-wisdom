  "information": "The preliminary University of Michigan Consumer Sentiment Index for April 2025 was 50.8, the second-lowest level since records began in 1952. This represented the fourth consecutive monthly decline, a drop of 11% from the March 2025 reading of 57.0, and a cumulative decline of over 30% since December 2024. According to Surveys of Consumers Director Joanne Hsu, the decline was 'pervasive and unanimous across age, income, education, geographic region, and political affiliation.'\n\nMultiple reports highlighted significant macroeconomic concerns. Year-ahead inflation expectations rose to 6.7%, the highest level recorded since 1981, with consumers widely citing worries about tariffs. The share of consumers expecting unemployment to rise increased for the fifth consecutive month, reaching its highest point since 2009. Concurrently, the Conference Board’s Leading Economic Indicators registered four consecutive monthly drops. Policy uncertainty was also a factor, with ongoing tariff implementation, market volatility, and potential changes in Federal Reserve leadership.\n\nSpecific industries and markets have shown negative reactions to the economic climate. Moody's Ratings downgraded the retail industry's outlook to 'negative' due to 'bleak' prospects amid the ongoing trade war, predicting that tariffs will harm profitability and raise consumer prices. In response to tariffs, Volkswagen has implemented an 'import surcharge', and companies like Temu, Shein, and Hermès announced price increases. The financial markets have also been volatile, with the S&P 500 Index falling significantly after the tariff announcement. Separately, the U.S. beef industry has expressed concern that poor consumer sentiment could negatively impact demand.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "About 17 days to the preliminary May 2025 reading (likely Fri, May 9, 2025). Preliminary is sufficient to resolve.",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No — sentiment stays at or below 50.8 given recent downward momentum and ongoing macro/policy headwinds.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Tariff uncertainty and price pass-throughs persist into early May, equities remain choppy, gasoline prices stay elevated, and jobless-claims/layoff headlines tick up. Consumers’ inflation and unemployment expectations remain high. The index prints ~48–50.8.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Policy rhetoric cools (e.g., tariff delays/clarity), equities rebound, gas prices stabilize, and macro data surprise slightly better. A modest mean-reversion bounce lifts the index above the very depressed April level, e.g., ~52–55.",
    "rationale": "April’s preliminary 50.8 is the second-lowest on record and follows four consecutive monthly declines and a 30% drop since Dec 2024. The research assistant notes sharply higher year-ahead inflation expectations (6.7%, highest since 1981), rising expectations of unemployment (highest since 2009), negative Conference Board LEI streak, tariff-driven price increases, and equity volatility. That cocktail points to continued pressure on sentiment into early May. Status quo therefore leans No (≤50.8). Countervailing force: at such depressed levels, the index often exhibits some mean reversion and monthly volatility; a modest relief rally in markets or any tariff de-escalation could nudge May above 50.8. Why not higher: persistent policy/inflation uncertainty, downward momentum, and broad-based weakness across demographics argue against a quick rebound. Why not lower: we are near historical lows, so downside may be somewhat bounded and month-to-month noise can produce small upticks. What would move me up: clear de-escalation/delay of tariffs, a sustained equity rebound into early May, falling gas prices, or benign labor headlines. What would move me down: renewed tariff salvos, further equity selloff, rising gas prices, deteriorating jobless claims, or additional negative surprises in leading indicators before the survey window.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill the May 2025 University of Michigan Consumer Sentiment number be greater than it was for April 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nCNN: [US consumer sentiment plummets to second-lowest level on records going back to 1952](https://www.cnn.com/2025/04/11/economy/us-consumer-sentiment-april/index.html)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if the University of Michigan's reported Index of Consumer Sentiment, expected to be located [here](http://www.sca.isr.umich.edu/), is greater than 50.8 for May 2025. Less than or equal to that amount resolves the question as **No**.\n\nPreliminary results are sufficient to resolve the question. If there is any confusion about the number, Metaculus will resolve based on whatever number is posted at [this pdf](http://www.sca.isr.umich.edu/files/tbcics.pdf) that is labelled as May 2025, including preliminary. For example, on April 11, 2025 the number displayed was 50.8 for April 2025 (P).\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nThe preliminary University of Michigan Consumer Sentiment Index for April 2025 was 50.8, the second-lowest level since records began in 1952.

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
