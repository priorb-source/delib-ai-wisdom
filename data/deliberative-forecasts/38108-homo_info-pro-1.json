    "review": "Both forecasters provided crucial new information. Forecaster 2 introduced a significant counterpoint I hadn't considered: the integration of DOGE into the OMB and the resulting bureaucratic friction could slow down progress. This provides a tangible mechanism for failure. However, Forecaster 3's analysis was more persuasive. Their sharp focus on the resolution criteria—that this is about a *claimed* number, not a verified one—is paramount. The new information they provided about the claims already being disconnected from reality (citing double-counting and 'zombie contracts') fundamentally changes the nature of the problem. It shifts the primary driver from 'finding savings' to 'political communication'.",
    "rationale": "I am updating my forecast upward. My initial reasoning was correct in identifying the political incentive to reach a round number, but it was naively based on extrapolating a trend that I assumed had some connection to reality. Forecaster 3's analysis, supported by evidence of existing inaccuracies, convinces me that the claimed number is largely a political construct. The department has the incentive and, critically, the mechanism (via flexible accounting) to ensure the number surpasses $200 billion. The risk of bureaucratic friction from the OMB merger, raised by Forecaster 2, is a valid point, but I now see it as secondary. Such friction might slow the generation of *justifications*, but it is unlikely to stop the politically motivated act of updating a number on a website, especially with a deadline looming. The primary risk is now a political scandal or investigation forcing their hand, but a 30-day timeline makes it less likely that such a risk will materialize with sufficient force to alter the outcome. The arguments for 'Yes' have been significantly strengthened, thus I am increasing my probability from 75% to 85%.",
