  "information": "Florida has become the second U.S. state, after Utah, to ban the addition of fluoride to public water supplies. Governor Ron DeSantis signed a law in May 2025 that prohibits additives not meeting a new definition of 'water quality additive,' effectively banning fluoride. The decision was supported by the state's surgeon general, who cited potential health risks. This legislative action reflects a broader debate, with some recent studies raising concerns about potential links between fluoride exposure and neurodevelopmental issues in children, while organizations like the American Dental Association continue to support water fluoridation as a key public health measure.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Approximately 1 month and 11 days (from May 20, 2025 to July 1, 2025).",
    "status_quo_outcome": "Yes. The CDC currently recommends 0.7 mg/L, and if no change occurs by the resolution date, the question resolves as Yes.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Intense political pressure, driven by recent state-level policy changes and an ongoing HHS review, compels the CDC to expedite its process and either recommend a level below 0.7 mg/L, remove the specific recommendation altogether, or take the guidance page offline before July 1, 2025.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "The HHS review of fluoride guidance, announced in April 2025, proceeds at a typical bureaucratic pace. Due to the need for thorough scientific evaluation and consensus-building, the review is not completed by July 1, 2025, leaving the existing 0.7 mg/L recommendation as the official guidance on the CDC's website.",
    "rationale": "My forecast is based primarily on the high degree of institutional inertia within federal public health agencies like the CDC and the very short timeframe for a change to occur. The resolution date is just over a month away, while the HHS review was only announced in April 2025. It is extremely improbable for a federal agency to complete a comprehensive scientific review, achieve consensus on a contentious topic, and formalize new public health guidance in under three months. Such processes typically take many months, if not years.\n\nThe research indicating that Florida has banned fluoride and that HHS is reviewing the guidance is the primary reason the probability is not higher. This political pressure introduces a non-trivial chance of a rapid, politically motivated change. For instance, the agency could pull the recommendation page offline pending the review, which would cause the question to resolve as 'No'. However, this is a low-probability event compared to the status quo prevailing.\n\nMy forecast is not lower because the scientific and medical establishment, exemplified by organizations like the American Dental Association, largely remains in support of the current guidance. This provides a strong counterweight to political pressure. For me to lower my forecast, I would need to see evidence of an accelerated review timeline or leaks suggesting a new recommendation is imminent. Conversely, I would raise my forecast if HHS or the CDC issued a statement confirming the review would extend well beyond July 2025.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill the CDC still recommend 0.7 mg/L fluoride as the optimal level in community water supplies on July 1, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nNPR: [HHS will review guidance on the addition of fluoride to drinking water](https://www.npr.org/2025/04/10/g-s1-59452/hhs-rfk-fluoride-drinking-water-epa)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if the CDC's [Community Water Fluoridation Recommendations](https://www.cdc.gov/fluoridation/about/community-water-fluoridation-recommendations.html) recommends greater than or equal to 0.7 mg/L as the concentration that maximizes fluoride's oral health benefits while minimizing potential harms. If a lesser amount is recommended or if there is no longer any recommendation at all, then the question resolves as **No**.\n\nIf the page is pulled offline with no replacement, this question also resolves as **No**.\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nFlorida has become the second U.S. state, after Utah, to ban the addition of fluoride to public water supplies.

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
