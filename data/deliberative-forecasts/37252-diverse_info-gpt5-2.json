    "review": "Both forecasters compellingly emphasize South Korea’s high mobilization capacity (KCTU, Candlelight Action, counter-mobilizations) and the dense calendar of plausible triggers (May Day, the June 3 snap election, ongoing investigations). Forecaster 3 adds concrete turnout figures from Jan–Mar that demonstrate how common ≥10k events have been. However, both underweight a key constraint in the resolution criteria: the Global Protest Tracker usually catalogs movements with a single start date, and the question requires a GPT-listed protest with a start date after the question’s launch. Large rallies in Jan–Mar likely won’t count if the launch is ~May 1, and GPT may treat May/June actions as continuations of the Dec 2024 wave rather than a new entry. Forecaster 2 at least acknowledges source dependence and reporting lag; Forecaster 3 assumes GPT will either add past protests or create discrete entries, which is not guaranteed given GPT’s movement-level curation. Their probabilities (80–90%) seem too high given the start-date and curation hurdles.",
    "rationale": "Key uncertainties:\n- Timing/definition: I assume the question launched around May 1, 2025. Under that assumption, earlier large protests don’t qualify, and GPT would need to create a new South Korea entry with a start date after launch.\n- GPT behavior: Carnegie’s tracker typically records a single movement with an initial start date, not every subsequent rally. If May/June events are framed as a continuation of the Dec 2024–early 2025 crisis, they likely won’t generate a new start date.\n- Pathways to Yes: A distinct new phase (e.g., post–June 3 election protests over results/legitimacy, or a clearly framed nationwide labor/general strike movement separate from the impeachment/martial law wave) that GPT treats as a new movement, with ≥10k turnout. South Korea’s history and current tensions make such protests plausible.\n- Pathways to No: Protests continue but are folded into the existing 2024–25 movement entry; or campaign/election proceed without a contentious aftermath.\n\nWhy I update slightly upward: The next two months include multiple independent triggers (Labor Day follow-ons, potential late-May labor actions, the June 3 election, possible post-election disputes). Given South Korea’s capacity for rapid mass mobilization, the chance of a large, distinct protest phase emerging is nontrivial. Still, the gating factor is GPT creating a new entry with a fresh start date; that keeps the probability well below the raw likelihood of ≥10k protests occurring.\n\nNet: I modestly raise my estimate but remain far below 80–90% due to the start-date constraint and GPT’s movement-level curation.",
