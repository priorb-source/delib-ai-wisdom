    "review": "The deliberation revealed a strong consensus among all forecasters. Both Forecaster 2 and Forecaster 3 arrived at the same 2% probability, and their reasoning was almost identical to my own. We all identified the same critical drivers for a 'No' outcome: Libya's severe and persistent political fragmentation with rival governments, the resulting legislative paralysis, the extremely short two-month timeline, and the fact that ratifying a trade agreement is a very low priority compared to domestic issues of security and power. I found their reasoning entirely convincing as it reinforced my initial assessment. Forecaster 3 offered a slightly more nuanced scenario for a 'Yes' outcome, suggesting ratification could be a 'quick, symbolic win' for a newly-formed unity government. While this is a plausible motive, it doesn't change the forecast because the prerequisite for this scenario—a sudden political settlement—remains exceedingly unlikely within the given timeframe. No new evidence or overlooked arguments were presented that would justify a change.",
    "rationale": "After reviewing the analyses of the other forecasters, I am maintaining my forecast. The deliberation phase strongly confirmed my initial assessment. The unanimous agreement on a 2% probability, based on the same core set of reasons, increases my confidence in this forecast. The central barrier remains the profound political and institutional deadlock in Libya, which has paralyzed the legislative process for years. With only two months until the deadline, there is virtually no time to overcome this deep-seated inertia, navigate the legislative process, and deposit the instrument of ratification. The consensus highlights that this is the dominant factor. The other forecasters and I agree that while a 'black swan' event or a sudden political deal is not strictly impossible (hence a forecast above 0%), there is no current evidence to suggest such a development is underway. The status quo of non-ratification is powerful and entrenched, and the short timeline leaves little room for change. Therefore, I see no reason to update my forecast up or down.",
