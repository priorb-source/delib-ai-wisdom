  "information": "Student-led protests demanding the immediate dissolution of parliament and early elections have been ongoing in Serbia for over six months, originating from a tragic canopy collapse in Novi Sad in November 2024. Protestors threatened to escalate their actions if their demands were not met by mid-May. A survey conducted by the CRTA research center indicated that 59% of Serbian citizens support the students' actions. However, reports also suggest that the momentum of the protests has been waning and the political opposition remains fragmented.\n\nIn response to protests, government officials have maintained that there is no need for early elections. Vice-Premier Ivica Dačić stated that the ruling coalition has a 'stable majority' in parliament. Following the Prime Minister's resignation in January 2025, President Aleksandar Vučić announced that a decision would be made within ten days on whether to form a new government or hold elections. More recently, a May 14, 2025 article quoted Vučić saying the party would again decide 'within ten days' whether to form another new cabinet or go to the polls.\n\nFollowing the Prime Minister's resignation in January 2025, a constitutional deadline was triggered, requiring the formation of a new government to avoid a mandatory snap election. According to multiple wire-service reports from March and April 2025, a new government successfully won a confidence vote in the Serbian parliament in mid-April. This event removed the automatic, constitutionally-mandated trigger for snap elections before the summer.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Approximately 1.5 months, from May 15, 2025, to the deadline of July 1, 2025.",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "The newly formed Serbian government, having secured a confidence vote in April 2025, prioritizes stability. President Vučić continues to deflect calls for an election, the waning protest movement fails to regain significant momentum, and the July 1, 2025, deadline passes without an official announcement of a general election date.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "In response to a sudden escalation of protests or an unexpected internal crisis within the ruling coalition, President Vučić makes a strategic calculation that a snap election is politically advantageous to consolidate power while the opposition remains fragmented. An official announcement of an election date is made before July 1, 2025.",
    "rationale": "My forecast is heavily weighted towards a 'No' outcome primarily because the most significant driver for a snap election—the constitutional requirement following the Prime Minister's resignation—was explicitly neutralized in mid-April 2025 when a new government successfully won a confidence vote. This action demonstrates a clear preference by the ruling coalition to avoid an election and maintain the current political structure. The short timeframe of just 1.5 months until the deadline further reinforces the likelihood that the status quo will hold. While there are ongoing protests with majority public support, reports indicate their momentum is waning and the political opposition is fragmented. This reduces the pressure on President Vučić's government to concede to demands for an early election. Vučić's repeated use of the 'decision within ten days' line appears to be a political delaying tactic to manage public pressure rather than a signal of genuine intent to call a vote, especially after just forming a new cabinet. My probability is not lower than 15% because the political situation in Serbia remains fluid. A significant, unforeseen event could rapidly escalate protests or create a schism within the ruling coalition, making a snap election a viable strategic option for President Vučić to reassert control. Public discontent is a tangible factor that cannot be entirely dismissed. My probability is not higher than 15% because calling an election so soon after deliberately forming a new government to avoid one would be a major political reversal. It would require a substantial shift in the current political dynamics, for which there is currently little evidence. I would raise my forecast if we see a major, sustained resurgence in protest activity, a public split within the ruling SNS-led coalition, or credible reports that Vučić sees a clear strategic advantage in an immediate election. I would lower it if the government announces a long-term policy agenda, signaling its intent to govern for a full term.",
