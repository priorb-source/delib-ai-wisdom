  "information": "Following a phone call between the two leaders, Donald Trump stated that Xi Jinping had invited him to visit China, an invitation he accepted. Trump also extended a reciprocal invitation for Xi to visit the US. On June 11, 2025, Trump posted on social media that he and Xi had agreed to meet in person, with the date and location to be announced later. The official statement from the Chinese government mentioned that Trump was invited to visit China but did not mention Xi accepting an invitation to visit the US. In March 2025, Trump had announced that Xi would visit Washington in the 'not too distant future,' without specifying a date.\n\nUS-China trade talks resumed in London on June 9, 2025, with a US delegation that included the Treasury Secretary, Commerce Secretary, and Trade Representative. On June 11, Trump announced that a US-China trade agreement was finalized. Chinese officials characterized the outcome as a 'framework agreement.' A White House official stated that the agreement, which is subject to final approval from both leaders, allows the US to impose a 55% tariff on Chinese imports, while China would impose a 10% tariff on US imports. A 90-day pause on tariffs is set to expire on July 9, 2025, with new tariffs scheduled to take effect on July 8.\n\nDonald Trump's confirmed upcoming international travel includes the G7 Summit in Canada from June 16-18, 2025, and the NATO Summit in the Netherlands from June 24-25, 2025. Chinese President Xi Jinping is scheduled to be in Central Asia for a summit in Kazakhstan from June 16-18, 2025. Historically, US presidential visits to China involve extensive logistical and security preparations, typically beginning weeks or months in advance. As of mid-June 2025, there have been no public reports of advance teams being dispatched or security preparations being made for a potential visit by Trump to China.",

    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "About 16 days (until end of June 30, 2025)",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Trump attends G7 (Canada, Jun 16-18) and NATO (Netherlands, Jun 24-25), then either schedules a US-China leaders’ meeting for early July or opts for a third-country or virtual formalization of the trade deal; any China visit slips to July or later.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "A rapidly arranged, short China stopover for a leaders’ meeting or signing ceremony—most plausibly Jun 20-22 between G7 and NATO, or Jun 28-30 after NATO—perhaps in Beijing, Shanghai, or even Hong Kong, announced only a few days in advance.",
    "rationale": "Baseline: High-level US presidential visits to China usually require weeks of logistical/security prep and visible advance work. As of mid-June there are no public signs of advance teams or security preparations. Trump’s near-term calendar is crowded (G7 Jun 16-18; NATO Jun 24-25). Xi is in Kazakhstan Jun 16-18. That leaves two narrow windows before Jul 1: Jun 19-23 and Jun 26-30. Both are feasible in principle but atypically tight for a China visit, especially one Beijing would prefer to stage with protocol. \nSignals raising odds above near-zero: (1) An invitation from Xi that Trump says he accepted; (2) a Jun 11 statement that they agreed to meet in person “with date and location to be announced”; (3) a claimed US-China trade framework awaiting leaders’ sign-off and a tariff pause expiring Jul 9—creating pressure to meet soon. These create real incentive for a late-June leaders’ encounter. If China favors hosting and wants to seize momentum before tariffs snap back, a quick trip could happen. \nWhy not higher: Lack of visible prep, tight travel windows, China’s preference for protocol, and the possibility they meet in early July (still before the tariff deadline) or in a third country/US. The tariff timing actually slightly biases the modal meeting date to early July rather than late June. \nWhy not lower: Trump’s willingness to act on short notice, the political payoff of a signing photo-op, and China’s publicized invitation keep a non-trivial tail for a rapid, brief visit. Even a short stopover in China would count for resolution. \nWhat would move me up: Credible reports of US advance teams/security in China or Hong Kong; leak of a late-June Beijing/Shanghai/HK stop; White House or MFA guidance about a June leaders’ meeting in China; adjustments to Trump’s post-NATO schedule hinting at Asia travel. \nWhat would move me down: Firm scheduling of a US or third-country meeting in early July; explicit denials; new domestic or international events crowding Trump’s calendar; indications that leaders will finalize virtually or defer until after July 1. \nAssistant’s key inputs used: invitation and acceptance; Jun 11 agreement to meet; ongoing trade talks and ‘framework’ characterization; tariff pause expiring Jul 9; Trump’s confirmed June travel; Xi’s Jun 16-18 Kazakhstan trip; absence of public advance-team activity.",

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
