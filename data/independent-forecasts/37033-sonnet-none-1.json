    "status_quo_outcome": "No additional payment is made before June 1, 2025",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Zimbabwe faces fiscal constraints or administrative delays that prevent a second payment within the short 39-day window. Given the government just made its first compensation payment on April 9 (only 14 days ago), and this was the first payment under a 2020 agreement (5 years later), the bureaucratic and financial machinery may not move quickly enough for another disbursement in the remaining time.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Zimbabwe demonstrates strong momentum by making a second payment as part of a pre-planned series of tranches. The recent 'reaffirmation of commitment' signals genuine urgency, possibly driven by international debt restructuring incentives or pressure from creditors. The payment processing systems established for the first disbursement enable faster follow-up payments.",
    "rationale": "The critical challenge here is the extremely short timeframe. Zimbabwe made its FIRST payment under the 2020 Global Compensation Deed just 14 days ago (April 9, 2025), and we need to assess whether they'll make a SECOND payment in the remaining 39 days until June 1. Several factors weigh heavily against this: (1) The 5-year gap between the 2020 agreement and the first 2025 payment suggests payments move very slowly through Zimbabwe's system. (2) Zimbabwe has well-documented economic challenges including limited foreign reserves and fiscal constraints - the $3.1 million payment itself was significant. (3) Government bureaucracy, particularly in resource-constrained environments, typically moves slowly between disbursements. (4) No information from my research assistant suggests imminent additional payments. The positive signal is the April 10 article about Zimbabwe 'reaffirming commitment' - this could indicate genuine momentum and potentially pre-planned tranches. If the payment mechanism is now established, subsequent payments might be easier. However, 'reaffirming commitment' is often political messaging rather than indication of imminent action. For me to update higher, I would need evidence of: specific additional payments being scheduled, reports of funds being allocated, or a pattern of rapid successive payments. To update lower, I would need reports of fiscal crisis, political resistance, or explicit statements that the next payment won't occur soon. The status quo heavily favors no additional payment given the short window and historical patterns.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill the Zimbabwe, before June 1, 2025, make another payment to white farmers whose property was seized?\n\nQuestion background:\n[Zimbabwe reaffirms commitment to land compensation to spur growth, debt sustainability](https://www.thestar.com.my/news/world/2025/04/10/zimbabwe-reaffirms-commitment-to-land-compensation-to-spur-growth-debt-sustainability)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if, according to [credible sources](https://www.metaculus.com/faq/#definitions) the government of Zimbabwe after the launch of this question and before June 1, 2025 makes an additional payment to former farmers covered under the 2020 Global Compensation Deed.\n\nOn April 9, 2025, Zimbabwe [was reported](https://nehandaradio.com/2025/04/09/zimbabwe-pays-us3-1m-to-former-white-farmers-as-part-of-land-compensation-deal/) to have made its first compensation payment, of USD $3.1 million. Additional such disbursements made after the launch of this question and before June 1, 2025 would count.\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nNo additional information available.\n\nToday is 2025-04-23.\n\nBefore answering you think:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n(e) You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
