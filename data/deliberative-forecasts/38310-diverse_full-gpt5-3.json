    "review": "Both forecasters’ arguments largely align with my initial take: Zelenskyy’s explicit public commitment, host-nation security prep listing him as expected, and strong strategic incentives are persuasive. They emphasize that canceling after such a commitment would require an exceptional wartime or security shock—an argument I agree with and had already factored. The reminders about his past virtual G7 attendances (2022, 2024) reinforce residual tail risk. No new factual evidence was introduced beyond what I had considered, but Forecaster 2’s framing—cancellation requiring an exceptional event—usefully sharpens the threshold for a No outcome.",
    "rationale": "The core signals still favor attendance: a clear public “I will be,” Canada preparing for him specifically, and high diplomatic stakes (aid, sanctions coordination) that make in-person participation valuable. He is actively traveling now, showing capacity and willingness. The main risks remain wartime contingencies, targeted security threats, or acute domestic crises that could force a last-minute change. Given no new adverse indicators and no fresh confirmations (e.g., flight movements, official schedules with on-site bilats), I see no basis to materially adjust. My balance of evidence remains: strong but not near-certain, with meaningful tail risk persisting over the next ~12 days. I’m holding steady, watching for concrete travel commencement (would move me up) or signs of domestic/security deterioration (would move me down).",
