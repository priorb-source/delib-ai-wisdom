    "review": "The deliberation reveals a strong consensus. All three forecasters agree that the baseline expectation is for inflation to be at or below 2.2%, driven by a powerful disinflationary trend, weak economic data (PMI), decelerating wages, and supportive ECB policy. My initial analysis and that of Forecaster 2 are nearly identical in this regard. The most significant new contribution comes from Forecaster 3, who introduced a crucial, specific upside risk I had not explicitly considered: the timing of Easter falling in April 2025 (versus March in 2024). This provides a tangible mechanism for a temporary surge in services inflation (e.g., travel, recreation) that could complicate seasonal adjustments and push an otherwise borderline reading over the 2.2% threshold. Forecaster 3's framing that a 'Yes' outcome requires a print of at least 2.3%, a roughly +0.2 percentage point surprise versus consensus, is also a very clarifying point.",
    "rationale": "I am updating my forecast upwards. My initial 25% probability was based on the strong, fundamental disinflationary trend, with an allowance for generic monthly volatility. Forecaster 3's highly convincing argument about the 'Easter effect' provides a specific, calendar-driven reason to believe that the upside risk for April 2025 is greater than in a typical month. This seasonal factor could plausibly add 0.1 to 0.2 percentage points to the services component, which is enough to tip the headline figure from a consensus forecast of 2.1% or the previous month's 2.2% to 2.3%. While I still believe the broader macro forces of a weak economy and decelerating wages will ultimately cap inflation, the Easter effect makes a temporary upside surprise significantly more plausible. I am therefore increasing the weight I assign to this tail risk, moving my forecast from 25% to 32% to reflect this new, specific piece of evidence.",
