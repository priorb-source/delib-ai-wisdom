    "review": "The other forecasters raise important considerations. Forecaster 3 claims historical NUFORC data shows Florida leads in pilot sightings 30-35% of months, which would strongly support a forecast in that range. However, Forecaster 2 mentions Arizona as a recent hotspot with 22 Air Force pilot reports, suggesting competition beyond just California-Florida. Both forecasters emphasize small monthly sample sizes (8-12 pilot reports nationwide), creating high variance. Forecaster 3's specific historical frequency claim (30-35% for Florida) is compelling if accurate, though I cannot independently verify it. Forecaster 2's lower forecast (18%) may underweight Florida's competitive position given the small sample volatility and Florida's documented UFO reporting strength. The gap between 18% and 38% reflects genuine uncertainty about historical patterns.",
    "rationale": "After reviewing both analyses, I maintain that 30-35% is the appropriate range. Forecaster 3's claim of Florida historically leading 30-35% of months aligns with my original 30% forecast and provides some validation. The key factors supporting this range: (1) Small monthly sample sizes create substantial variance, giving Florida realistic chances even if not the historical leader; (2) Florida's documented strength in overall UFO reporting (top 3 state with 8,623 reports); (3) The March 2025 military pilot incident could modestly increase June reporting through heightened awareness; (4) Competition from California and potentially Arizona/other states prevents higher confidence. I'm updating slightly upward to 33% based on Forecaster 3's historical data claim, which suggests Florida's natural competitive position is stronger than I initially weighted. This remains conservative given uncertainty about whether that historical pattern will hold in June 2025 specifically, and acknowledges meaningful competition from other aviation-heavy states.",
