    "review": "Both forecasters make solid points about short-but-feasible timelines after licensing and the fact that Starlink can operate without a local gateway via ISLs. The Indonesia example is a useful analogue for how fast a flip can happen post-political milestone. However, I think they may overweight the headline of “final approval” without confirmed issuance of the operative BTRC licenses and terminal type approvals. They also don’t fully separate a government/enterprise pilot from general consumer availability (which is what the map’s “Available” implies). Website/map updates can lag, and Bangladesh’s payments/FX environment and customs/type-approval steps could introduce nontrivial delays. Net: their arguments move me up a bit on feasibility, but I still see the modal risk on administrative execution within ~6 weeks.",
    "rationale": "I initially leaned 40% on the basis that the window (~45 days) is tight and that “final approval” may be political rather than fully executable licensing. The other forecasters appropriately emphasize Starlink’s ability to launch quickly once paperwork is in place and cite fast turnarounds elsewhere, which raises the plausibility that Bangladesh could flip to Available in June. I still discount for: (1) need for BTRC license instruments and user terminal type approval; (2) import/logistics and local tax/billing setup; (3) the possibility that early activation is limited to government/enterprise pilots, which may not trigger the consumer-facing map; and (4) typical website-update lag risk. Given these, I move modestly upward but remain below even odds. I would move higher on evidence of formal license issuance, type approvals, or Bangladesh-specific pricing/order pages; I’d move lower if reports indicate gateway/intercept conditions or pilot-only permissions before broader commercial launch.",
