    "review": "Both forecasters emphasize the short lead time and the strong base rate against North American yellow fever advisories, which I largely agree with. Forecaster 2 adds a vector-control/infrastructure argument; I think that’s less decisive for yellow fever because sylvatic transmission hinges on nonhuman primate reservoirs and forest mosquitoes (Haemagogus/Sabethes), not urban Aedes aegypti alone. Still, the absence of established sylvatic cycles in most of Central America/Caribbean keeps the base risk low. Forecaster 3’s point about the multi-step pathway (outbreak emergence, detection, severity threshold, CDC processing) within ~5 weeks is a useful framing and pushes me slightly lower. Neither brings concrete evidence of current North American epizootics or human cases, and I don’t see indications that CDC is poised to post a proactive, region-wide yellow fever THN that would include a North American country. The most plausible candidates remain Panama (Darién spillover from Colombia) and Trinidad & Tobago (proximity to Venezuela/Guyana), but both would require a fast sequence of events. Overall, their arguments nudge me modestly downward due to the tight timeline and historically low base rate.",
    "rationale": "Status quo: no North American countries currently carry a CDC yellow fever Travel Health Notice. To resolve Yes, a NA country (Metaculus likely includes Mexico, Central America, and the Caribbean) would need confirmed local transmission or compelling epizootic evidence that prompts CDC to issue a country-specific THN by June 1 and keep it active. The PAHO alert elevates regional risk but does not indicate North American involvement. While seasonality (late spring into rainy season) could support vectors in Panama/Caribbean, the key constraint is the establishment or detection of sylvatic/urban transmission in NA within ~5 weeks. CDC can post THNs quickly once signals exist, but without current indications from PAHO/ministries of health in NA countries, the prior dominates. I slightly reduce my estimate to reflect the compressed timeline and the rarity of NA yellow fever notices, while retaining a nontrivial tail for rapid spillover and detection in Panama or Trinidad & Tobago. Triggers that would move me up: credible reports of nonhuman primate die-offs or confirmed human cases in Panama, Costa Rica, Nicaragua, or Trinidad & Tobago; MOH vaccination campaigns or PAHO alerts naming those countries; CDC pre-listing communications. Triggers down: continued confinement of cases to South America through mid-May and absence of NA epizootic reports.",
