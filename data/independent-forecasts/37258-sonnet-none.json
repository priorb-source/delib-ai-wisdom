    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Approximately 60 days (until July 1, 2025)",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No - no official announcement of a referendum date has been made",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "The Scottish government does not announce a referendum date by June 30, 2025, continuing the current pattern where independence referendum plans remain aspirational rather than scheduled. This could result from ongoing legal uncertainties, lack of Westminster cooperation, internal SNP political calculations, or simply insufficient time to organize such an announcement.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "The Scottish government, through the First Minister or Scottish Parliament, officially announces a specific date for an independence referendum before July 1, 2025. This could occur as a 'consultative' referendum that Westminster doesn't recognize as legal, emboldened by polling showing strong Yes support. The SNP might make this announcement as a political statement even knowing it faces legal challenges.",
    "rationale": "With only 60 days remaining until the resolution date, the probability of an official announcement is low. Key factors weighing against a Yes outcome: (1) The UK Supreme Court ruled in November 2022 that Scotland cannot hold a legally binding referendum without Westminster consent; (2) The UK government has consistently refused to grant the necessary Section 30 order; (3) There have been no recent signals or leaked plans suggesting an imminent announcement; (4) Even organizing a 'consultative' referendum requires substantial preparation time; (5) The SNP has historically been cautious about making announcements they cannot deliver on. However, the probability is not negligible because: (1) The question explicitly states that UK legality is irrelevant - only Scottish authority to announce matters; (2) The background poll showing an 11-point Yes lead could embolden Scottish leaders to make a symbolic announcement; (3) Political surprises can occur within a 60-day window. The status quo strongly favors No since governments and political systems change slowly. For me to update higher, I would need evidence of: imminent Scottish government announcements, leaked plans for a referendum date, or statements from Scottish leaders indicating timing. For me to update lower, explicit statements ruling out near-term announcements would be needed. My forecast reflects the strong status quo bias with a small probability for political surprise.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nBefore July 1, 2025, will the government of Scotland officially announce a date for an independence referendum?\n\nQuestion background:\nThe National: [Yes posts huge 11-point lead in new Scottish independence poll](https://www.thenational.scot/news/25089457.yes-posts-huge-11-point-lead-new-scottish-independence-poll/)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if, before July 1, 2025, a referendum on the independence of Scotland from the United Kingdom is officially scheduled. If this does not occur before that date, this question resolves as **No**.\n\nFor purposes of this question, the referendum will be considered \"officially scheduled\" when it is announced by a person or entity with the authority to do so within Scotland. Please note that broader legality, such as within the United Kingdom, will be considered irrelevant for this question, so if the federal government declared the referendum illegal, the question would still resolve as Yes.\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nNo additional information available.\n\nToday is 2025-05-02.\n\nBefore answering you think:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n(e) You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
