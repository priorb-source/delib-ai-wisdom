    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "About 39 days (until June 1, 2025)",
    "status_quo_outcome": "The HTS continues to display a +50% duty entry specifically for Lesotho (potentially marked as suspended) on June 1, 2025.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "USITC/USTR issues a technical correction or update to the HTS before June 1 that removes or revises the Lesotho-specific +50% entry so that it no longer shows 50% for Lesotho in the applicable subheading when viewed on June 1.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "No formal correction is published in time, or the agencies choose to leave the 50% line visible but suspended; either way, the HTS page still shows a +50% duty for Lesotho on June 1.",
    "rationale": "- Framing and incentives: The AP piece draws attention to an anomalous 50% listing for Lesotho. Public scrutiny can spur corrections, but HTS changes often require formal notices, interagency coordination, or a scheduled revision cycle. The question explicitly states that suspension status will not affect resolution; that suggests the likely response pathway could be to suspend rather than delete the line, which would still resolve Yes.\n- Status quo bias: In the absence of confirmed agency action, the safer base case is that the listing remains as-is through early June. Government websites and legally codified schedules tend to change more slowly than media cycles, especially if the issue requires a technical or legal correction rather than a simple editorial fix.\n- Timing: With roughly 5–6 weeks to go, a rapid correction is possible but not guaranteed. If the 50% is embedded in a Chapter 99/Additional duty note or otherwise tied to a prior proclamation or notice, altering or removing it may require a formal step that can slip past June 1.\n- Evidence constraints: My research assistant provided no additional information, so I cannot point to a concrete notice of an imminent HTS correction. Without that, I place extra weight on persistence of the current listing.\n- Why not higher: The AP spotlight could prompt quick action; USITC sometimes posts mid-cycle technical corrections. If this is recognized internally as an error, it could be fixed within weeks, pushing the probability toward No.\n- Why not lower: The question is designed so that even a suspension still yields Yes. That materially raises the chance that the listing will still meet the criterion on June 1.\n- What would change my view: Downward update if USITC posts a revision note or Federal Register/USTR notice indicating a correction removing the Lesotho 50% reference before June 1, or if the HTS online search no longer shows any 50% entry tied to Lesotho. Upward update if mid-May passes with no public sign of a correction or if agencies indicate they will address it later in the year rather than immediately.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill the US government's harmonized tarifff schedule list the tariff on Lesotho as 50% on June 1, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nAP: [How tiny Lesotho ended up with the highest US tariffs in the world](https://apnews.com/article/lesotho-us-trump-tariffs-b337efa47290e889aa076cc9ede7bc9d)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if the duty provided in the applicable subheading is + 50% for Lesotho at the American government's [harmonized tariff schedule](https://hts.usitc.gov/search?query=lesotho) when accessed by Metaculus on or after June 1, 2025.\n\nWhether the provision is listed as suspended will not affect resolution.\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nNo additional information available.\n\nToday is 2025-04-23.\n\nBefore answering you think:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n(e) You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
