    "review": "Both forecasters emphasize the extremely compressed timeline and the primacy of security drivers (terror group, arms smuggling) over commercial issues, which aligns with regional base rates showing slow reversals. The new claim I hadn’t weighed was the May 30 AFRICOM briefing suggesting a deteriorating threat environment; if accurate, that’s a meaningful negative signal for a quick reopening. I agree with their focus on the need for high-level, coordinated action to flip the status quo. I still see a non-trivial path via a controlled/partial reopening framed as enhanced checks, but the absence of public signals (joint statements, scheduled ministerial meetings, or task force announcements) makes that less likely within 31 days. Their arguments are convincing enough to trim my estimate downward from my initial view.",
    "rationale": "Base rate: In ECOWAS, security-driven border closures reopening within ~60 days happen roughly 20% of the time. This case appears primarily security-motivated, even if commercial frictions (soya exportation) are present, so the base rate is a good anchor. Upside factors: the closure is geographically limited (Kwara crossings), cross-border trade pain creates political pressure, and a ‘reopen with enhanced screening’ is a plausible compromise that could satisfy both sides. Downside factors: the short window (31 days), lack of visible diplomatic/security coordination signals to date, and the reported deterioration in the threat picture (AFRICOM brief) reduce near-term odds. Compared to my prior, I’m shading down to reflect the combination of time compression and the potential worsening security environment. Triggers to move up: credible reports of joint Nigeria–Benin security operations, a public timeline from either government, or local authorities announcing a phased reopening. Triggers to move down: additional incidents attributed to the corridor/group, formal statements signaling an extended closure, or expansion of restrictions.",
