    "review": "Both forecasters emphasize the same key mechanics I used: the tight MC spread, week-to-week noise, and the tie-resolves-No asymmetry. The additional points they bring that sharpen the case are: (1) explicit attention to MC’s integer rounding, which increases tie risk, and (2) a slightly stronger tilt toward Sheinbaum’s early-term fundamentals vs. Milei’s domestic headwinds. They also frame plausible 1–3 point moves over the next six weeks, which feels right. I find their reasoning largely convincing and broadly aligned with mine; the rounding/tie emphasis and slightly stronger weight on Sheinbaum’s honeymoon marginally push me lower than my prior 44%.",
    "rationale": "Baseline: MC had Milei 61 vs Sheinbaum 60 as of Apr 30; earlier in January it was Sheinbaum 66 vs Milei 65. Both are clustered near 60 with small movements, so single-point shifts or rounding can flip the lead. The resolution’s tie-as-No rule and MC’s integer display raise the No probability relative to an even contest. Fundamentals: Domestic Mexican polls suggest Sheinbaum remains very popular early in her term, while Argentine polling shows wear on Milei despite improving inflation. MC typically places Sheinbaum lower than domestic highs and Milei higher than domestic lows, but the directional risk over the next ~6 weeks looks a bit worse for Milei than for Sheinbaum. Status quo still shows a narrow Milei edge, so a Yes remains plausible if disinflation headlines and any legislative wins keep him ~60–61 while Sheinbaum drifts to 59–60. Weighing these, I slightly increase the penalty for tie/rounding and Sheinbaum’s relative tailwinds. I’m nudging down modestly from 44% to reflect that asymmetry while still retaining meaningful weight on the existing Milei lead and potential positive Argentine macro news.",
