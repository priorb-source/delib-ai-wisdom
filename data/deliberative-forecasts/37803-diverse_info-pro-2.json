    "review": "The other forecasters provided valuable new perspectives and evidence. Forecaster 2 introduced a critical argument I had overlooked: the possibility of a simple placeholder or redirect being implemented. This would satisfy the technical resolution criteria for the site being 'Up' without requiring a full policy reversal, representing a plausible, low-effort path to a 'Yes' outcome. Forecaster 3 strengthened the case for 'No' by providing specific, compelling evidence of the administration's ideological commitment, including direct quotes from Secretary Hegseth and the revocation of a key executive order. Both analyses were convincing and well-supported, prompting me to reconsider the narrowness of my initial assumptions.",
    "rationale": "My original forecast of 5% was predicated on the low probability of a full policy reversal. After reviewing the other analyses, I recognize this was too narrow a view. Forecaster 2's point about a simple redirect or placeholder page is the most significant factor for my update. In response to political pressure from the upcoming June hearings, the DoD could implement such a technical fix as a low-cost way to deflect criticism. This creates a more plausible pathway to a 'Yes' resolution than I had initially considered. However, Forecaster 3's evidence of a deeply entrenched ideological opposition to these programs provides a strong counterbalance, suggesting the administration may feel no compulsion to make even minor cosmetic concessions. Weighing these two points, I believe the probability of a 'Yes' outcome is higher than my initial 5%, but still low. I am updating my forecast from 5% to 12% to incorporate the possibility of a technical, non-policy-driven resolution, while still reflecting that the overwhelming political and ideological momentum favors the site remaining offline.",
