    "review": "Both forecasters provide compelling analyses that converge on significantly lower probabilities than my initial 7%. Forecaster 2 raises an important distinction I hadn't fully considered: the US typically uses terms like 'illegal presence' or 'occupation' rather than 'invasion' for existing Russian deployments in Georgia and Moldova/Transnistria. This means a new event would likely be needed rather than just a rhetorical reclassification. Forecaster 3 effectively emphasizes the absence of observable logistical preparation - a critical signal that modern invasions require extensive buildup that intelligence would likely detect. Both forecasters correctly stress the extreme brevity of the 2-month window and Russia's severe military overextension in Ukraine. Their analyses are methodical and well-reasoned. The consensus around 3-4% suggests my initial 7% overweighted tail risks relative to the overwhelming status quo constraints.",
    "rationale": "After reviewing both analyses, I'm updating downward for several reasons: (1) The 2-month timeframe is even more constraining than I initially weighted - major geopolitical events of this magnitude are extremely rare in such short windows. (2) The US rhetoric distinction matters - existing Russian deployments aren't labeled 'invasions' by US officials, so resolution would require a genuinely new event. (3) The complete absence of observable military preparation at non-Ukrainian borders is a strong negative signal. (4) Russia's military attrition and overcommitment in Ukraine creates severe operational constraints. However, I'm not going as low as 3% because: (1) Small but real tail risks exist in Moldova/Georgia where Russia has existing presence and political interests. (2) Rapid escalation scenarios, while unlikely, remain possible. (3) Historical precedent shows Russia has surprised intelligence assessments before. (4) Low-probability cross-border incidents could trigger strong US language. My updated forecast of 5% reflects stronger weight on the status quo and time constraints while maintaining a buffer for genuine tail risks.",
