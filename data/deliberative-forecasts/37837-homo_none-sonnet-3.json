    "review": "All three forecasters identified the same core challenge: lack of specific recent monthly data from NUFORC. We converged on the historical baseline of roughly 290-300 reports per month, acknowledged June's seasonal advantages, and recognized increased UAP interest in recent years. However, we weighted these factors differently. Forecaster 3's characterization of 400+ reports as 'top-tertile performance' is particularly illuminating - it frames the question as requiring a 33% increase over historical average, which is substantial. Forecaster 2's emphasis on status quo principles and typical patterns is well-taken. Both forecasters are more conservative than my initial estimate, and their caution about betting on significant deviations from historical norms without specific evidence is prudent. The key insight is that while seasonal factors and recent trends may provide modest upward pressure, we lack concrete evidence that the baseline has sustainably shifted high enough to make 400+ likely rather than merely plausible.",
    "rationale": "Upon reflection, I was insufficiently cautious in my initial forecast. While I correctly identified June's seasonal advantages and the likely upward trend in reporting due to internet accessibility and recent UAP interest, I may have overweighted these factors relative to status quo bias. The historical average of ~300/month means 400+ represents a meaningful deviation requiring approximately top-third performance. Without specific data showing recent months consistently approaching or exceeding 400, I should place more probability mass on typical outcomes. The question setter's choice of 400 as a threshold suggests it's probably close to median for recent months - a near coin-flip proposition. However, I still believe June's summer timing and sustained UAP interest provide modest support above 50-50 odds. Balancing these considerations, I'm updating downward to align more closely with the analytical consensus while maintaining slight optimism based on seasonal and trend factors.",
