    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "About 56 days (until June 30, 2025, inclusive)",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "China maintains gray-zone pressure (air/maritime incursions, exercises, economic/coercive measures) without landing PLA ground forces on Taiwan-controlled territory; the U.S. condemns provocations but avoids the specific accusation of a ground-force invasion.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "PLA conducts an amphibious/airborne landing on Taiwan proper or Taiwan-controlled outlying islands (e.g., Kinmen/Matsu/Pratas), and the U.S. government publicly declares that China has invaded Taiwan by sending ground forces without Taipei’s consent.",
    "rationale": "- Baseline and time window: With only ~8 weeks left, the base rate for a first-ever PLA ground-force entry onto Taiwan-controlled territory is very low. Major cross-strait contingencies typically feature observable preparations (amphibious mobilization, logistics staging, civilian vessel requisitions, large-scale alerting) that would likely leak or be signaled; absent such cues, near-term hazard remains small.\n- Definition threshold: The criterion requires U.S. public accusation specifically of a ground-force invasion. Many plausible escalations (air/missile strikes, blockade, coast guard/maritime militia activity) would not meet this ground-forces threshold. Even a limited seizure by non-military forces would not qualify. The U.S. also tends to use calibrated language unless facing unmistakable major aggression.\n- Outlying islands nuance: A PLA landing on Taiwan-controlled islets (Kinmen/Matsu/Pratas) could meet the letter of the criterion, but Beijing has so far favored gray-zone and coast guard pressure in such areas; a PLA ground landing would be a major step with significant risk of U.S. and regional response. The U.S. might label such an event an invasion, but Washington could also choose more measured phrasing if the incursion were limited—further lowering odds that the exact accusatory condition is met.\n- Status quo weight: The cross-strait status quo has persisted for decades despite recurrent spikes in tension. Short-horizon forecasting should overweight continuity absent strong indicators to the contrary.\n- Why not higher: No fresh, credible indications (mobilization, evacuation orders, mass amphibious staging, U.S. intel warnings) point to an imminent PLA ground operation within the next two months. The linguistic strictness (ground forces, public U.S. accusation) further reduces the probability compared to generic “conflict” risk.\n- Why not lower: Tail risks remain. A sudden crisis or miscalculation could prompt a limited PLA landing on a small Taiwan-held islet, or Beijing could opt for a surprise move. If that happened, the U.S. would very likely issue a public accusation meeting the criterion.\n- What would move me up: Clear indicators of imminent PLA action (e.g., large-scale amphibious/airborne mobilization, requisition of civilian Ro-Ro ships, fuel/medical stockpiling, unusual coastal province alerts, PRC evacuation advisories, encirclement drills shifting to sustained blockade with landing craft forward-positioned), or explicit U.S./Taiwan intelligence warnings of an impending landing.\n- What would move me down: Continued routine pattern of exercises without mobilization signatures; de-escalatory diplomatic moves; or evidence that Beijing is focusing on non-military coercion (economic, cyber, legal) over the next two months.\n- Research assistant input: No additional information available; thus I rely on base rates, known dynamics, and the stringent resolution criteria.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill the United States accuse the People's Republic of China of invading Taiwan before July 1, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nCFR: [Why China-Taiwan Relations Are So Tense](https://www.cfr.org/backgrounder/china-taiwan-relations-tension-us-policy-trump)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if, before July 1, 2025, the US government publicly accuses the People's Republic of China of invading Taiwan by sending its ground military forces into Taiwan without consent from the Taiwanese government in Taipei.\n\n\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nNo additional information available.\n\nToday is 2025-05-05.\n\nBefore answering you think:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n(e) You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
