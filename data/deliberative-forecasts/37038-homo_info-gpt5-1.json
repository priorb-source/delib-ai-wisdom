    "review": "- Forecaster 2 surfaces the key residual risks: (1) HTS presentation could rely on a Chapter 99 additional duty that might not show as an inline “+17% for Israel” at commodity subheadings; (2) an early diplomatic/political reversal before June 1. Those are the right uncertainties. However, the research assistant’s note that hts.usitc.gov already shows “+17% for Israel” and flags it as suspended materially reduces the presentation risk.\n- Forecaster 3’s analysis appears to predate or discount the April 2 announcement and subsequent HTS update. Their emphasis on the improbability of a bespoke Israel rate and the tight timeline is inconsistent with the reported fact pattern (HTS already updated; duty already codified under 9903.01.48 and merely suspended). As such, the 6% forecast seems far too low given current information.\n- Net: F2 adds a legitimate caution about how Metaculus will interpret “applicable subheading,” but given the HTS reportedly does show +17% for Israel (albeit suspended), and suspension status is explicitly irrelevant for resolution, I find the likelihood that the listing remains visible on June 1 to be high. The main path to No is a reversal and removal before June 1, which is possible but not the base case.",
    "rationale": "My prior view (82%) leaned on: (i) the tariff was announced and encoded under 9903.01.48 with an effective date of April 9; (ii) collection suspended for 90 days through July 9; (iii) the HTS site already shows “+17% for Israel,” marked suspended; and (iv) the resolution disregards suspension status. Forecaster 2’s point about display ambiguity is largely addressed by (iii). The remaining downside risk is a May reversal leading USITC to remove or materially alter the entry before June 1. While possible, that would require a rapid political/diplomatic shift and quick HTS revision. Given typical inertia and the defined suspension window carrying past June 1, I still expect the +17% listing to be present on the HTS on June 1. Accordingly, I am not changing my forecast.\n\nKey watch items: presidential/USTR proclamations or press guidance signaling rescission before June; USITC HTS change logs; any court action compelling removal. Absent such signals, the status quo (entry remains visible, suspended) should hold through June 1.",
