    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "About 2–3 months (UFC 315 is likely in early-to-mid July 2025)",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "UFC 315 takes place without Trump making an appearance—either because it’s not in a convenient location, he has a scheduling or legal conflict, security/planning concerns arise, or he simply opts to skip it.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "UFC 315 is a marquee Las Vegas International Fight Week card and Trump shows up as a VIP guest (e.g., arrives with Dana White, sits cageside or otherwise enters the venue grounds).",
    "rationale": "Baseline: Even though Trump attends UFC events more than most politicians, he still skips the majority of monthly PPVs. If he goes to roughly 2–4 UFC PPVs per year out of ~12, a base-rate probability for any single numbered event is roughly 17–33%. Adjustments: UFC’s July PPV is often International Fight Week in Las Vegas—a high-profile card Trump has been more likely to attend historically and where Dana White can easily host him. That nudges the probability up. Countervailing factors: Potential scheduling constraints, political/official duties, legal calendar, or heightened security requirements could keep him away. Also, without any concrete reporting or hints from UFC/Dana White, the default is that he does not attend. Net: Weighing the elevated likelihood for a big Las Vegas card against the fact that he still misses most events, I land modestly above the base rate but below even odds. What would move me up: - Confirmation that UFC 315 is in Las Vegas during International Fight Week. - Public hints or reports from Dana White/UFC that Trump plans to attend. - Trump’s travel schedule placing him in Nevada that weekend. What would move me down: - UFC 315 announced for a non-U.S. venue or distant city. - Confirmed schedule conflicts, health, or security/logistics constraints. - Any public rift with UFC/Dana White. Research assistant provided no additional information; forecast relies on historical attendance patterns and typical UFC scheduling.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill Donald Trump attend UFC 315?\n\nQuestion background:\nAP [Trump sits cageside at Miami UFC event in his latest appearance at a sports event](https://apnews.com/article/trump-ufc-miami-fight-sports-6461901bb3d5f2eec477674d02333a7f)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if President Donald Trump is anywhere within the grounds of the venue where [UFC 315](https://www.ufc.com/event/ufc-315) takes place. Otherwise this resolves as **No**.\n\n\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nNo additional information available.\n\nToday is 2025-04-28.\n\nBefore answering you think:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n(e) You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
