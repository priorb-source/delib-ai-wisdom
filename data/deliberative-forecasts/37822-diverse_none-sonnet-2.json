    "review": "Both forecasters raise compelling arguments I initially underweighted. Forecaster 2's emphasis on the 39-day window as 'the single largest constraint' is well-taken, as is the point about O'Rourke's three electoral losses creating political costs. Forecaster 3's crucial insight about Texas primary filing deadlines (typically December) is particularly important - there's no procedural urgency to announce by July 1 for a 2026 race. Both correctly note that credible Senate candidates often announce in late 2025 or early 2026, making a June announcement atypical rather than expected. However, I find Forecaster 2's 8% forecast too low. It seems to underweight that: (1) O'Rourke has explicitly signaled openness publicly, which distinguishes this from pure speculation, (2) 40 days is sufficient time for an announcement if a decision is made, and (3) early announcements, while uncommon, do occur. Forecaster 3's 25% seems better calibrated, acknowledging both the strong constraints (timing norms, lack of infrastructure signals) and the non-zero possibility of a rapid announcement. The absence of any reported campaign infrastructure development (staff hires, FEC activity, venue bookings) in the remaining window is indeed significant evidence favoring the status quo.",
    "rationale": "Upon reflection, I should revise downward from my initial 30%. The most persuasive new arguments are: (1) Texas primary filing deadlines around December mean there's 5+ months post-July 1 before any procedural necessity, removing urgency for an early announcement, (2) the historical pattern of Senate candidates announcing later in the cycle before a midterm election, and (3) the complete absence of visible campaign preparation signals. My initial forecast insufficiently weighted how atypical a June 2025 announcement would be for a November 2026 race. However, I don't accept Forecaster 2's very low 8% because O'Rourke's public statement does meaningfully raise the base rate above background noise, and surprise early announcements are possible for high-profile candidates with existing name recognition and donor networks. The conditional phrasing ('if Texans want him') suggests he's gauging support rather than having decided against running. Splitting the difference between too-low (8%) and my initial probably-too-high (30%), I'm converging toward Forecaster 3's range of 22-25%.",
