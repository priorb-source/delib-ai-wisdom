  "information": "GoPro's financial results for 2024 showed a full-year revenue of $801 million, a 20% decline year-over-year, with a net loss of $432 million, or $2.82 per share. As of December 31, 2024, the company held $283 million in cash reserves against $131 million in debt. The company's current ratio was reported at 0.5, and its market capitalization was approximately $90.68 million as of May 1, 2025, with a stock price of $0.58.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Less than two months. The question deadline is July 1, 2025.",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No. In the absence of a major new event, GoPro will likely continue to operate by managing its remaining cash reserves, even in a financially distressed state, surviving past the short July 1, 2025 deadline without a bankruptcy filing.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "GoPro utilizes its existing cash reserves of $283 million to cover its immediate operational expenses and obligations. The management team prioritizes survival through the short term, possibly implementing further cost-cutting measures, and successfully avoids any acute liquidity crisis that would force a bankruptcy filing before July 1, 2025.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "GoPro's high cash burn rate, combined with its inability to pay a major supplier or creditor, triggers a severe liquidity crisis. With other financing options exhausted and facing creditor lawsuits, the board of directors proactively files for Chapter 11 bankruptcy to protect the company's assets and attempt a formal restructuring.",
    "rationale": "My forecast is based on the tension between GoPro's severe financial distress and the very short timeframe for the question to resolve. The provided financials are alarming: a 20% year-over-year revenue decline, a massive $432 million net loss in 2024, and a current ratio of just 0.5, indicating current liabilities are twice the current assets. This points to a significant risk of insolvency. However, the status quo for a distressed company is often to continue operating until forced into action. With $283 million in cash reserves, GoPro likely has enough liquidity to survive the sub-two-month period until July 1, 2025, barring a specific triggering event. Bankruptcy is a drastic step, and management will likely exhaust all other options before filing. Therefore, the most probable outcome is that they will manage to stay afloat past the deadline. My probability is not lower because the financial metrics, especially the current ratio, signal that a liquidity crisis could happen at any moment. It is not higher because the available cash provides a buffer, and the timeline is too short for bankruptcy to be the most likely eventuality. I would increase my forecast on news of creditor actions or failure to meet debt obligations. I would decrease it on news of new financing or a significant asset sale.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill GoPro file for bankruptcy before July 1, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\n[GoPro Announces Fourth Quarter and 2024 Results](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1500435/000150043525000003/gpro2024-12x31exh991xer.htm)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question will resolve as **Yes** if GoPro, Inc., files any petition for bankruptcy protection in the United States, under any chapter of the United States Bankruptcy Code, before July 1, 2025. The question will resolves on the filing of such a petition, not on whether any bankruptcy protection is granted by a court. If no such petition is filed by that date, this question will resolve as **No**.\n\n\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nGoPro's financial results for 2024 showed a full-year revenue of $801 million, a 20% decline year-over-year, with a net loss of $432 million, or $2.82 per share.

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
