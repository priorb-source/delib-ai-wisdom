    "review": "Forecaster 2 rightly highlights that a PM resignation raises the hazard for snap elections and that six weeks is enough time to decide and announce. However, they overgeneralize from parliamentary norms: in majority situations, resignation often leads to a successor being appointed rather than dissolution, especially when the governing party retains control. They also don’t grapple with Serbia’s 45–60 day legal window between announcement and election day, which makes a pre–July 1 announcement point to an unattractive late-July/August polling date. A 75% estimate seems too high given those constraints.\n\nForecaster 3’s framing is closer to my view: recent elections (Dec 2023), SNS/Vučić’s control over timing, and the viability of appointing a new PM all dampen the chances. Their 45% still feels elevated because an announcement before July 1 would likely force a summer election date, which parties often avoid unless they urgently need one. Neither forecaster introduces concrete reporting of imminent dissolution or failed government formation, which would be key to justifying a higher probability.\n",
    "rationale": "I continue to emphasize the institutional mechanics and timing: the President calls elections, and the law’s 45–60 day period implies that any announcement before July 1 would lead to a summer vote. Without evidence of coalition breakdown or a deliberate strategy to capitalize on summer timing, the path of least resistance is to appoint a new PM and delay any election call. Still, a confirmed PM resignation is a genuine risk signal, and six weeks is sufficient for a political decision and announcement if SNS chooses to reset the mandate.\n\nGiven the added arguments, I’m nudging my estimate up from 14% to 20% to reflect the heightened hazard from the resignation and the non-trivial chance of a tactical snap call. I’m not moving higher because there is no corroboration of imminent dissolution, recent elections argue against quick repetition, and a pre–July 1 announcement all but commits to a summer polling date, which is a strategic negative unless urgency compels it. I would move up on credible reports of failed cabinet formation, coalition fractures, or explicit signals from Vučić about an early vote; I would move down if a successor PM is promptly nominated and supported or if leaders publicly rule out a summer election.\n",
