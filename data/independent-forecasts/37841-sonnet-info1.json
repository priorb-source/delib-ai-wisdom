  "information": "On May 21, 2025, Kneecap member Liam Óg Ó hAnnaidh (also known as Mo Chara) was charged with a terrorism-related offence under Section 13 of the Terrorism Act 2000. The charge relates to an allegation that he displayed a Hezbollah flag during a concert in London in November 2024. A court date at Westminster Magistrates' Court has been set for June 18, 2025, approximately one week before the Glastonbury festival is scheduled to begin. The band has publicly denied the charge, describing it as 'political policing'.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Approximately 32-37 days until Glastonbury 2025 (June 25-29, 2025). The outcome will be definitively known by the end of the festival period.",
    "status_quo_outcome": "Yes - Kneecap is currently listed on the official Glastonbury 2025 lineup and scheduled to perform",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Glastonbury organizers remove Kneecap from the lineup due to the terrorism charge and political pressure; or Mo Chara receives bail conditions preventing him from performing and the remaining members choose not to perform without him; or the band voluntarily withdraws citing the legal proceedings",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "The court case on June 18 results in bail conditions that allow Mo Chara to perform, or the case is adjourned; Glastonbury organizers stand by the band despite controversy given the festival's progressive history; the band performs as scheduled with all or some members under the Kneecap name",
    "rationale": "The status quo strongly favors a Yes outcome - Kneecap is currently on the official lineup. However, the May 21 terrorism charge represents a significant and very recent development that creates substantial uncertainty. The charge under Section 13 of the Terrorism Act 2000 is serious, relating to allegedly displaying a Hezbollah flag, which is a banned organization in the UK. This is notably more severe than the band's previous controversies involving profanity or political statements. The timing is critical: the court date is June 18, just one week before Glastonbury begins, leaving little buffer time. Several factors support them still performing: (1) They haven't been convicted yet, only charged; (2) Bail conditions might allow performance; (3) Glastonbury has a history of progressive politics and supporting controversial acts; (4) The resolution criteria are flexible - even if Mo Chara cannot perform, the other members could perform under the Kneecap name; (5) Festival organizers may face their own political pressure to not cave to calls for cancellation. Against this: (1) The charge is only 2 days old and political/public pressure may intensify; (2) Previous controversies have led to canceled performances at other venues; (3) Terrorism charges are taken extremely seriously in UK law; (4) Bail conditions could restrict travel or public performances. The forecast is not higher because the terrorism charge is genuinely serious and could result in restrictive bail conditions or significant pressure on organizers. It's not lower because of the strong status quo (currently scheduled), the flexible resolution criteria, and Glastonbury's political character. I would update higher if: the court case is postponed/adjourned, Glastonbury publicly backs the band, or bail conditions explicitly allow performance. I would update lower if: Glastonbury removes them from the lineup, severe bail restrictions are imposed, or political pressure significantly intensifies.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill Kneecap perform at Glastonbury 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\n[Kneecap](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kneecap_\\(band\\)) are an Irish band who have significantly risen in popularity since their formation in 2017.&#x20;\n\nThe band is a trio consisting of: \"Mo Chara\" (Liam Óg Ó hAnnaidh), \"Móglaí Bap\" (Naoise Ó Caireallain), and \"DJ Próvaí\" (J. J. Ó Dochartaigh) whose songs consist of rap in a mixture of Irish Gaelic and English giving them a unique style.\n\nNamed after a [torture technique](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kneecapping) made infamous by the Irish Republican Army, the group are no stranger to controversies. Whilst most have been minor - complaints about profanity, drug use, violence in their songs, music videos and concerts, and promotion of Irish Republicanism - the band have come under a large amount of controversy resulting in cancelled performances which initially stemmed from a Coachcella performance where the band, \"described Israel's military action in Gaza as a US-funded genocide\".&#x20;\n\nOn top of this, [two reports were made](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/cly5r4gg7l6o) to the UK Metropolitan police:\n\n> \\[...] the band allegedly call for the death of Conservative MPs. Another seems to show a band member shouting \"up Hamas, up Hezbollah\". Both groups are banned in the UK and it is a crime to express support for them.\n\n> \\[...]\n\n> They claimed that footage where they appeared to say \"the only good Tory is a dead Tory\" had been \"taken out of all context\", and apologised for the hurt caused to the families of murdered MPs Jo Cox and Sir David Amess.\n\nThe band are [due](https://www.glastonburyfestivals.co.uk/line-up/) to play at Glastonbury 2025 - the UK's largest and most prestigious music festival - however there have been [calls](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/politics/2025/04/30/kneecap-should-be-banned-full-stop-after-dead-tories-video/) for the band to be removed from the lineup.\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question will resolve as **Yes** if Kneecap officially performs at Glastonbury 2025, scheduled for June 25 to June 29, 2025.\n\n* If Glastonbury 2025 does not take place before September 1, 2025 this question will be **annulled**.\n* Officially perform is defined as a planned performance as allowed by the festival organisers.\n* Any official performance is considered sufficient for this question. If, for example, one band member is banned from the festival, the question will still resolve as **Yes** if the other member(s) perform under the name Kneecap.\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nOn May 21, 2025, Kneecap member Liam Óg Ó hAnnaidh (also known as Mo Chara) was charged with a terrorism-related offence under Section 13 of the Terrorism Act 2000. The charge relates to an allegation that he displayed a Hezbollah flag during a concert in London in November 2024. A court date at Westminster Magistrates' Court has been set for June 18, 2025, approximately one week before the Glastonbury festival is scheduled to begin. The band has publicly denied the charge, describing it as 'political policing'.\n\nToday is 2025-05-23.\n\nBefore answering you think:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n(e) You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
