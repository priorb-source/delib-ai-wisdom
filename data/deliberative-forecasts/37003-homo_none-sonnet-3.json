    "review": "All three forecasts converge remarkably at 70-75%, using nearly identical reasoning. This convergence is informative - when independent forecasters reach similar conclusions through similar logic, it validates the analytical framework. Key shared observations: (1) Vienna's 80-year SPÖ dominance creates enormous status quo bias; (2) National FPÖ strength introduces meaningful uncertainty; (3) 5-7 months allows for campaign developments; (4) Urban Vienna differs fundamentally from rural Austria. Forecaster 2 adds valuable emphasis on SPÖ's patronage networks and party infrastructure built over decades - these institutional advantages go beyond just polling and reinforce why overcoming SPÖ dominance would be historically exceptional. Forecaster 3's framing that an SPÖ loss would be 'historically unprecedented' is analytically correct and appropriately cautionary against overweighting recent national trends. No forecaster presented evidence suggesting the race is currently competitive or that SPÖ faces immediate crisis. The narrow 5-percentage-point range (70-75%) across three independent analyses suggests we've properly bounded the uncertainty.",
    "rationale": "The deliberation reinforces rather than challenges my initial reasoning. The convergence at 70-75% validates the key analytical framework: strong historical precedent versus potential for change given national trends. Forecaster 2's emphasis on institutional infrastructure (patronage networks, party machinery) strengthens the case for SPÖ resilience beyond just demographic factors. This is particularly relevant in Vienna where decades of governance create deep organizational advantages. However, no new concrete evidence emerged about current polling, candidate quality, or campaign dynamics. The unanimous acknowledgment that an SPÖ loss would require unprecedented political realignment appropriately constrains forecasts from going too low. I'm adjusting marginally upward from 72% to 73% to reflect slightly greater confidence in institutional continuity after considering the infrastructure argument, but the adjustment is modest because the uncertainty factors I initially identified remain fully valid.",
