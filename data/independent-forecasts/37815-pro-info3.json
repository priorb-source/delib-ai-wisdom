  "information": "A number of high-profile encounters between military aircraft and UAPs have been reported in North America. In an incident on January 19, 2023, a U.S. Air Force F-16 fighter jet collided with an unidentified object during a training mission over Arizona, cracking the aircraft's canopy. This event was one of 22 UAP sightings reported by Air Force pilots between October 2022 and June 2023. Arizona, particularly near military training zones, is described as a hotspot for such sightings. Some U.S. officials have suggested these objects may be advanced drones. In a separate event on September 17, 2024, an Air Force pilot reported a close encounter with a dark grey, football-sized cylindrical object over California.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "About 6 weeks. The observation period is June 2025, and the outcome will be determined on or after July 1, 2025.",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No. The National UFO Reporting Center (NUFORC) database shows that pilot reports from South America are historically very infrequent, making it unlikely for one to be filed and posted for any specific month.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "The month of June 2025 concludes without any pilots flying over South America submitting a UAP report to NUFORC. Alternatively, a pilot might have a sighting but either chooses not to report it, reports it to a different authority, or the report submitted to NUFORC is not posted by the resolution date.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "A pilot of a commercial, private, or military aircraft has a UAP encounter in the skies over a South American country during June 2025. The pilot or a crew member decides to file a report with the US-based NUFORC, and the organization publishes this report on its website in a timely manner.",
    "rationale": "My forecast is primarily based on the low base rate of the specified event. The resolution criteria are highly specific: 1) a pilot report, 2) from a South American country, 3) occurring in June 2025, and 4) posted on the NUFORC website. An analysis of the NUFORC database shows that reports meeting these combined criteria are extremely rare. The vast majority of reports are from North America, and pilot reports are a small fraction of the total. South American pilot reports are even rarer, with a historical frequency of maybe one or two per year at most. This low base rate suggests that the status quo outcome, No, is the most probable. The research assistant's report, which details U.S. military encounters in North America, is not directly relevant to civilian or military reporting patterns in South America to a specific US-based civilian website. While it indicates UAP activity is a global phenomenon, it does not alter the fundamental challenge of the low reporting rate from the specified region to the specified source. My forecast is not lower than 5% because such reports, while rare, are not impossible and do occasionally occur. A single verified report would be sufficient to resolve the question as 'Yes'. My forecast is not higher because it would disregard the strong evidence of the low historical frequency. I would increase my forecast if there were credible news reports of a major UAP sighting 'flap' over South America in early June, potentially increasing the number of reports. I would decrease it if NUFORC showed signs of inactivity or ceased updating its database.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill a pilot report of UFOs come from a country in South America in June 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nFor example, the resolution source [reports](https://nuforc.org/subndx/?id=x) a sighting in Brazil in December 2024.\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if The National UFO Reporting Center posts a pilot report of a UFO/UAP having occurred in a country on the South American continent, during the month of June 2025 at [this link](https://nuforc.org/subndx/?id=x) when accessed by Metaculus on or after July 1, 2025.\n\n\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nA number of high-profile encounters between military aircraft and UAPs have been reported in North America. In an incident on January 19, 2023, a U.S. Air Force F-16 fighter jet collided with an unidentified object during a training mission over Arizona, cracking the aircraft's canopy.

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
