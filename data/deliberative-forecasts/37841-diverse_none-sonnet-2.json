    "review": "All three forecasts cluster tightly between 77-80%, suggesting strong consensus on the key dynamics. Forecaster 2 and 3 both make excellent points I should weigh more carefully. Forecaster 3's observation about prior cancellations post-Coachella is particularly significant - it provides empirical evidence that gatekeepers DO respond to this specific controversy, not just theoretical risk. Forecaster 2's emphasis on Glastonbury's institutional history and the Eavis family's likely awareness when booking is compelling counter-evidence. Both forecasters appropriately highlight UK proscription laws as uniquely serious (criminal rather than merely political), which I noted but perhaps understated. The convergence of our forecasts increases my confidence that we're capturing the right factors, though Forecaster 3's evidence of actual cancellations elsewhere suggests slightly more downside risk than I initially weighted.",
    "rationale": "After deliberation, I'm maintaining my forecast at 78%. The tight clustering (77-80%) validates the core analysis: status quo strongly favors performance given Glastonbury's announced lineup and cultural resistance to political pressure, but genuine legal risks around UK proscription laws create meaningful downside. Forecaster 3's point about other post-Coachella cancellations is the strongest argument for lowering my forecast - it proves this controversy has bite. However, Glastonbury is uniquely resistant compared to typical venues; other cancellations might even strengthen their resolve to defend artistic freedom. The police investigation remains the critical wildcard, but with only 33 days until the festival, the window for charges and enforcement action is narrowing. Glastonbury booked them knowing their politics, suggesting organizational commitment. No new concrete information changes the fundamental equation: high probability status quo holds absent police/legal intervention, which remains possible but increasingly time-constrained.",
