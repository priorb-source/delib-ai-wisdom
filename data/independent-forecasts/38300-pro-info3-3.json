  "information": "The global economic environment shows signs of slowing. The U.S. Energy Department forecasts that global oil consumption growth will be less than 1 million barrels per day in 2025 and 2026, a significant drop from the historical average, partly due to economic slowdowns in Asia. China's manufacturing PMI for May rose to 49.5 but remained in contractionary territory for the second straight month, although sub-indexes for production and new orders improved. In the Eurozone, industrial production grew in early 2025, but the outlook is considered uncertain due to potential U.S. tariffs.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Approximately two weeks. The preliminary data for May 2025 is scheduled for release around June 15, 2025.",
    "status_quo_outcome": "The most recent available data for April 2025 showed positive year-over-year growth of 1.488%, and the Industrial Production index is reportedly at a record high. The status quo, based on this recent momentum, is continued positive year-over-year growth, leading to a 'Yes' outcome.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "A combination of slowing global demand, particularly from Asia, and unresolved trade tensions dampens US exports. This, coupled with a sharper-than-expected slowdown in domestic consumer and business spending, causes a contraction in manufacturing and mining output sufficient to push the year-over-year growth rate below zero for May.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "The US economy's domestic resilience outweighs the global headwinds. Continued strength in sectors like high-tech manufacturing and automotive production, supported by stable consumer demand, keeps industrial output on a growth trajectory. The year-over-year figure remains positive, albeit potentially modest.",
    "rationale": "My forecast is primarily anchored by the most recent data point, which shows a positive year-over-year growth of 1.488% for April 2025. Economic indicators like industrial production exhibit significant autocorrelation, meaning that one month's value is a strong predictor for the next. The fact that the index is at a record high suggests underlying momentum that is unlikely to reverse into negative territory in a single month without a significant shock. However, I have tempered my confidence based on the headwinds identified in my research assistant's report. The slowing global economic environment, evidenced by weak oil consumption growth forecasts and China's manufacturing PMI remaining in contraction, poses a significant downside risk to US export-oriented industries. Furthermore, uncertainty surrounding potential tariffs in the Eurozone could disrupt trade flows and negatively impact production. My probability of 65% reflects a base case where domestic economic strength is sufficient to maintain positive year-over-year growth, but it gives substantial weight to the possibility that these international headwinds could manifest more quickly or severely than expected. My forecast is not higher because the global risks are clear and present. China's economic health and global trade frictions represent major uncertainties. It is not lower because the US economy has shown resilience, and it would take a significant negative shock to erase the current positive growth margin in just one month. I would increase my forecast if we saw surprisingly strong domestic data (e.g., retail sales, capital goods orders) or an improvement in global manufacturing PMIs. Conversely, I would lower it upon any news of a significant supply chain disruption or a sharp downturn in US consumer confidence.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill monthly US Industrial production have positive year-over-year growth for May 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nThe Real Economy Blog: [Industrial production index hits record high amid tariffs](https://realeconomy.rsmus.com/industrial-production-index-rises-to-record-amid-tariffs/)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if the monthly number displayed at FRED [Industrial Production: Total Index (INDPRO)](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/INDPRO#) for year-over-year growth is greater than 0.0 for May 2025, when checked by Metaculus on or after June 15, 2025.\n\nWhen accessing the data, ensure settings are Units: Percent Change from Year Ago, Seasonally Adjusted and Frequency: Monthly. For example, the number for April 2025 was 1.48803 as of May 27, 2025.\n\nSince the numbers presented by FRED are expected to be preliminary numbers from the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, please note that subsequent revisions to the number will not cause this question to re-resolve.\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nThe global economic environment shows signs of slowing.

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
