  "information": "The last Major League Baseball player to finish a season with a batting average of .400 or higher was Ted Williams, who hit .406 in 1941. One analysis noted that modern players face challenges in reaching this mark, such as higher strikeout rates; early in the 2025 season, Aaron Judge had 31 strikeouts, whereas Williams had only 27 in his entire 1941 season. Another factor is Batting Average on Balls In Play (BABIP). The major league-wide BABIP in 2025 is .288, compared to .300 in 1930. In 2000, Ichiro Suzuki recorded a .387 batting average but was limited to 105 games due to an injury.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "13 days, until June 1, 2025.",
    "status_quo_outcome": "Yes. The provided background material suggests that at least one player, Aaron Judge, is currently batting at or near the .400 mark. If this high level of performance is maintained for the next two weeks, the outcome will be Yes.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "The player currently hitting near .400 experiences a natural regression to the mean. A couple of hitless games or a string of 1-for-4 performances over the next two weeks drops their batting average below the .400 threshold by the resolution date.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "A player who is currently hot, such as Aaron Judge, maintains their exceptional performance for another two weeks. They continue to get hits at a high rate, avoiding any significant slumps and keeping their average at or above .400 through June 1st.",
    "rationale": "My forecast is primarily driven by the strong statistical principle of regression to the mean, balanced against the very short timeframe for this question. The research assistant's report notes historical difficulties in hitting .400 over a full season, which, while interesting, is less relevant than short-term performance volatility. The key factor is that a player is reportedly already at or near the .400 mark. The question then becomes whether they can maintain this for just 13 days. While maintaining a .400 average is exceptionally difficult, the short duration makes it plausible. A single slump (e.g., going 2-for-15 over four games) could easily drop a player from .400 to below the threshold. This high volatility and the overwhelming statistical precedent of regression are the primary reasons my forecast is below 50%. My forecast is not lower because the timeframe is short enough that a player can maintain a hot streak, and we are starting from a point where a player is already at the target. A sustained period of high performance is less likely than a regression, but it is far from impossible over two weeks. I would increase my forecast if the player in question has a few multi-hit games early in the forecast period, providing a cushion. I would decrease it significantly if they have one or two hitless games.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill any major league baseball player have a .400 batting average on June 1, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\ntheScore: [How long can Judge's .400 batting average last?](https://www.thescore.com/mlb/news/3284701/how-long-can-judges-400-batting-average-last)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if on June 1, 2025, any Major League Baseball player in the 2025 regular season has a batting average of greater than or equal to .400 according to the [ESPN baseball stats page](https://www.espn.com/mlb/stats)\n\n\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nThe last Major League Baseball player to finish a season with a batting average of .400 or higher was Ted Williams, who hit .406 in 1941.

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
