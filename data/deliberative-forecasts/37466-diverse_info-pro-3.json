    "review": "The other forecasters introduced critical new information that was absent from my initial analysis, namely the January 2025 US presidential executive order mandating the name 'Gulf of America' and the subsequent change by Google Maps for its US users. This provides a clear causal mechanism for a potential change, making my initial forecast of 2% far too low. Forecaster 2 correctly balances this against the lack of adoption by other major publishers and international bodies. Forecaster 3 highlights the executive order but makes a key factual error, identifying WorldAtlas as a US-based company when it is Canadian, which slightly weakens their argument for why the site would feel pressured to change. Forecaster 3's point that nearly four months have passed since the order without a change on the WorldAtlas map is a very strong piece of evidence for the status quo persisting.",
    "rationale": "I am significantly increasing my forecast based on the new information provided by the other forecasters. My initial 2% probability was based on the assumption that any change would be spontaneous, underestimating the external political pressure from a US executive order and the precedent set by Google Maps changing its display for US users. This new context makes a change much more plausible. However, I am not raising my forecast as high as the other forecasters (15% and 25%). The most compelling arguments against the change are: 1) WorldAtlas is a Canadian company, which insulates it from direct pressure to comply with a US executive order and incentivizes adherence to international standards. 2) Nearly four months have passed since the order was issued, and WorldAtlas has not updated the map in question. This inaction is strong evidence that their editorial stance is to maintain the status quo. 3) The name 'Gulf of Mexico' remains the international standard, and other major publishers like Apple and National Geographic have not made the change. While a dual-label compromise ('Gulf of Mexico / Gulf of America') is possible and would satisfy the resolution criteria, the arguments for inertia and maintaining international neutrality seem stronger. I am updating my forecast from 2% to 10%, a fivefold increase to account for the new political context, while still reflecting a high probability that the status quo will hold.",
