    "review": "The other two forecasters and I are in strong agreement on the fundamental reasoning: the US legal and immigration systems are notoriously slow, and the resolution deadline of July 1, 2025, is extremely close. It is highly improbable for a contested case to be fully adjudicated and for a deportation to be executed in such a short timeframe. The other forecasters' quantification of this probability at 5% seems more accurate than my initial 10%. Their analysis didn't introduce new evidence, but their forceful and unanimous emphasis on the system's inertia and the dual requirements of both a final legal ruling and subsequent logistical execution convinced me that my initial forecast was too high. They correctly characterize a 'Yes' outcome as a remote possibility, and a 5% forecast better reflects that.",
    "rationale": "I am updating my forecast downward from 10% to 5%. The deliberation with the other forecasters solidified my view that the status quo is overwhelmingly the most likely outcome. While my initial analysis identified the correct key driver—the slow pace of the US legal system against a short deadline—I believe my 10% probability was too generous. The other forecasters rightly emphasized that a 'Yes' outcome would require not just one, but a series of low-probability events to occur in rapid succession: a swift and final court decision against Mr. Khalil, the denial of any appeals or stays, and the immediate administrative and logistical action by ICE to carry out the removal. The confluence of these events happening within the next seven weeks is extremely unlikely. The consensus view that these systemic delays make a 'Yes' outcome a remote possibility is persuasive, and I am adjusting my forecast to align with this more calibrated assessment of the low-end probability.",
