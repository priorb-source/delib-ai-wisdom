    "review": "Forecaster 2 raises an important point I initially missed: if the approval was granted a year ago (based on the article), that's substantial lead time for infrastructure preparation. However, the year-long delay is also a red flag - 'final approval' a year ago should have led to availability by now if everything was straightforward. Forecaster 3 provides valuable context about Starlink's variable deployment timelines and makes a crucial distinction between political approval and actual operational licensing. Their point about Bangladesh's 'relatively controlled' regulatory environment potentially adding friction is well-taken. Forecaster 3's middle-ground approach (42%) seems more calibrated than Forecaster 2's optimism (65%), as it balances the possibility of rapid deployment against real bureaucratic and operational hurdles. The base rate evidence that Starlink sometimes moves from approval to availability within weeks is new information I should weight more heavily than I did.",
    "rationale": "I'm updating upward from my initial 30% forecast, but remaining more cautious than Forecaster 2. The key insights from this deliberation are: (1) If the approval is indeed a year old, Starlink has had time for infrastructure preparation, making launch more plausible; (2) Historical precedent shows Starlink can move quickly in some markets post-approval; (3) However, the concerning counter-signal is that despite apparent 'final approval,' Bangladesh still doesn't show availability - suggesting either the approval wasn't truly final, or there are significant unresolved operational/regulatory issues. The status quo of non-availability after substantial time is a powerful signal. Forecaster 3's nuanced reasoning about the difference between political greenlight and operational readiness resonates. With only 6 weeks remaining and no current availability, I need to see this as unlikely but not implausible. My updated forecast of 38% reflects greater optimism about rapid deployment possibilities while maintaining skepticism given the apparent stall in progress.",
