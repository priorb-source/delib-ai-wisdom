    "review": "The other two forecasters presented convincing arguments that my initial forecast was too low. Both correctly emphasized that the resolution criteria only require an *announcement* of a date, not the referendum itself. This allows for a symbolic scheduling of a vote far in the future, which is less politically costly for a 'gradualist' government than I had initially considered. Forecaster 3's specific identification of Greenland's National Day (June 21) as a plausible focal point for such an announcement was a particularly compelling piece of reasoning I had overlooked. It provides a concrete, date-specific scenario for a 'Yes' outcome that significantly increases its likelihood beyond my initial very low estimate.",
    "rationale": "I am significantly increasing my forecast from 5% to 15%. My initial analysis was overly anchored on the 'gradualist' mandate of the new government, leading me to conclude that any referendum announcement within two months was highly improbable. The other experts' analyses convinced me that I was under-weighting the possibility of a symbolic announcement of a referendum to be held years in the future. Such an action could be framed as long-term planning, consistent with a gradualist approach, rather than a rushed decision.\n\nThe most decisive new argument was the potential for an announcement on Greenland's National Day, June 21. This date provides a perfect political opportunity for a patriotic, forward-looking statement that could include scheduling a referendum for the distant future (e.g., 2030 or later). This specific catalyst provides a much more plausible path to a 'Yes' resolution than I had previously envisioned. While I still believe the most likely outcome is 'No' due to the new government's likely focus on immediate economic and administrative priorities, the possibility of a symbolic announcement, especially on June 21, is substantial enough to warrant tripling my forecast.",
