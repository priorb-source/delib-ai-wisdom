  "information": "On May 5, 2025, Israel's security cabinet reportedly approved a plan to intensify military operations in the Gaza Strip. This follows a period of renewed violence since a ceasefire broke down in mid-March 2025. The UN has described Gaza as one of the most dangerous places in the world for humanitarian workers, with its personnel and facilities at risk from military activity. The UN's Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) has stated that humanitarian efforts are severely hindered by severe restrictions on movement within the territory. The International Red Cross also noted that the deteriorating security situation is hindering the work of its staff and partners.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "1 month, 26 days.",
    "status_quo_outcome": "Yes. The current rate of fatalities among UN staff, coupled with reports of intensifying military operations, makes it highly probable that at least five more deaths will be recorded.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "A durable ceasefire is implemented in the coming weeks, halting hostilities and preventing further casualties. Alternatively, the UN drastically reduces its operational footprint in high-risk areas to protect its staff, leading to fewer than five additional fatalities before the deadline.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "The planned intensification of military operations proceeds, leading to continued or increased danger for humanitarian workers. At least five additional UN staff members are killed in airstrikes, shelling, or ground combat during their duties before July 1, 2025.",
    "rationale": "My forecast is based on three primary factors: the low threshold required, the existing conflict environment, and intelligence suggesting an escalation. As of April 30, 2025, the reported number of UN staff killed is 295, meaning only five more fatalities are needed to meet the threshold of 300. The resolution period extends for nearly two more months, until July 1, 2025. Over the past 19 months of conflict (approx. Oct 2023 - Apr 2025), the average fatality rate has been over 15 UN staff per month. The rate required to cross the threshold is now less than three per month. The research report I received indicates that on May 5, 2025, Israel's security cabinet approved a plan to intensify military operations. This suggests that the environment for aid workers, already described by the UN as one of the most dangerous in the world, is likely to worsen, not improve. My probability is not higher because of the non-zero chance of a sudden diplomatic breakthrough leading to a durable ceasefire, or a strategic decision by the UN to suspend high-risk operations, which would reduce staff exposure. My probability is not lower because the combination of a very low number of additional fatalities needed and credible reports of military intensification makes the 'No' outcome exceptionally unlikely. For me to lower my forecast, I would need to see credible evidence of a sustained de-escalation and the implementation of effective deconfliction mechanisms that demonstrably protect aid workers.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill 300 or more UN staff be reported to be killed in Gaza according to UN's OCHA in its final impact snapshot before July 1, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nSee accompanying Humanitarian update [here](https://www.ochaopt.org/content/humanitarian-situation-update-284-gaza-strip).\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if the number of reported UN staff killed in Gaza is greater than or equal to 300 according to the most recent impact snapshot for the Gaza Strip posted [here](https://www.ochaopt.org/publications) by the United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs as of July 1, 2025. For example, a snapshot dated April 30, 2025, [reports](https://www.ochaopt.org/content/reported-impact-snapshot-gaza-strip-30-april-2025) 295 UN staff fatalities.\n\nIf OCHA stops posting new updates, this resolves as the most recent number, which as of the time of this question would be the impact snapshot posted on April 30, 2025.\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nOn May 5, 2025, Israel's security cabinet reportedly approved a plan to intensify military operations in the Gaza Strip.

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
