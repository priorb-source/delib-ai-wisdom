    "review": "All three forecasters converged remarkably on 40-52%, using similar baseline calculations and reasoning about seasonal factors, status quo bias, and the lack of recent monthly data. The most compelling new argument came from Forecaster 2, who noted that the historical average of 300/month is \"almost certainly skewed by lower reporting rates in earlier decades before widespread internet access.\" This is a crucial insight I hadn't emphasized enough. If NUFORC's 180,000 reports over 50 years includes decades from the 1970s-1990s with minimal reporting infrastructure, then the recent monthly baseline is likely substantially higher than 300. Forecaster 2's meta-reasoning that \"400 appears calibrated to be meaningful but not extreme\" also carries weight - question-setters typically choose thresholds that are reasonable benchmarks rather than trivial or impossible targets. Forecaster 3's distinction between \"exceeding\" versus \"reaching\" 400 is technically correct but practically minor. All three analyses appropriately weighted June's summer advantages and recent elevated UAP interest, though we all acknowledged these factors don't guarantee exceptional reporting.",
    "rationale": "Upon reflection, I believe my initial 40% was slightly too conservative. The historical baseline calculation of ~300/month almost certainly understates recent averages, as reporting infrastructure, internet access, and public awareness have all increased dramatically since the 1970s-1990s. The recent surge in UAP interest following government disclosures (2017 onward) likely means current monthly baselines are notably higher than the 50-year average. If recent monthly averages are actually in the 320-360 range (a reasonable estimate given these factors), then 400+ in a favorable summer month becomes more plausible than my initial assessment suggested. The convergence of all three forecasters around 45-50% provides additional confidence that this range appropriately captures the uncertainty. However, I remain anchored toward the lower end of this consensus range because: (1) status quo bias still strongly favors typical patterns absent specific catalysts; (2) \"exceeding 400\" requires not just reaching but surpassing the threshold; (3) no evidence of unusual June 2025 events exists. The meta-reasoning about 400 being a \"calibrated\" threshold suggests roughly 50-50 odds from the question-setter's perspective, but my slight skepticism about reaching that bar keeps me just below even odds.",
