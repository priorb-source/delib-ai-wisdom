    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Approximately 56 days remain until July 1, 2025",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No - Currently there is no blockade of Taiwan by China, nor any US accusation of such a blockade",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "China maintains current posture toward Taiwan without implementing a blockade, or if tensions escalate, the US refrains from making a formal public accusation of blockading. Cross-strait relations remain tense but do not cross the threshold of an actual blockade within the timeframe.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "A precipitating event (such as a Taiwan independence declaration, major diplomatic incident, or internal Chinese political pressures) leads China to implement a naval blockade of one or more Taiwanese seaports. The US government publicly and formally accuses China of this blockade action, likely accompanied by condemnation and possibly sanctions or military posturing.",
    "rationale": "This forecast requires both an extremely aggressive Chinese action AND a specific US response within just 56 days. Several factors argue for a very low probability: (1) Naval blockades are extraordinarily serious acts tantamount to acts of war and are historically rare. (2) No current crisis indicators are mentioned in the research - the absence of information suggesting imminent action is significant. (3) The cited WSJ article discusses China's capability to blockade, but capability does not equal intent or immediate action. Many such analytical pieces exist without the scenarios materializing. (4) The short timeframe (less than 2 months) makes such a dramatic escalation unlikely, as major geopolitical events typically have warning signs and build-up periods. (5) Status quo bias strongly applies - the vast majority of time periods do not see major military escalations. However, the probability is not zero because: (1) Taiwan-China tensions are genuine and ongoing. (2) China has increased military activities around Taiwan in recent years. (3) Tail-risk events do occasionally occur. (4) The question only requires a US accusation, which has a lower bar than requiring an actual comprehensive blockade. I would update higher if there were reports of unusual Chinese military mobilization, major diplomatic incidents, or intelligence suggesting imminent action. I would update lower with signs of diplomatic progress or de-escalation. The forecast balances the real but low-probability risk of a major crisis against the strong likelihood that the status quo persists.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill the United States accuse the People's Republic of China of blockading Taiwan before July 1, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nWSJ via MSN: [China Is Ready to Blockade Taiwan. Here’s How.](https://www.msn.com/en-us/news/world/china-is-ready-to-blockade-taiwan-here-s-how/ar-AA1BvnW8)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if, before July 1, 2025, the US government publicly accuses the People's Republic of China of blockading at least one of Taiwan's seaports without consent from the Taiwanese government in Taipei.\n\n\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nNo additional information available.\n\nToday is 2025-05-06.\n\nBefore answering you think:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n(e) You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
