    "review": "Both forecasters’ arguments align well with my prior view. The most useful addition is Forecaster 2’s explicit “publication-timing risk” (i.e., even if work is complete, the FSIS webpage might not flip to Closed before the cutoff). Both stress the bounded scope (single-day lot, moderate volume, experienced firm) against the countervailing risks of Class I foreign-material verification, product lingering in consumer freezers, and possible scope expansion. Neither adds new factual updates about this specific recall’s progress or expansion, so the evidence base is largely unchanged; the main refinement is highlighting the web-status update lag as a nontrivial tail risk.",
    "rationale": "We’re roughly 5 weeks post-announcement with about 7 weeks until July 1, which is within typical closure windows. Johnsonville’s prior 4–8 week closures and the 2–4 month norm for similar Class I recalls keep a Yes outcome modestly favored. However, the Class I/foreign-material context, FSIS’s freezer concern, and the possibility of scope expansion or verification delays could push closure into July. Incorporating the explicit webpage-update-lag risk raised by Forecaster 2 slightly lowers my confidence. I’m trimming my forecast from 65% to 64% to reflect that added operational risk, while keeping the overall stance that closure before July 1 remains more likely than not given the recall’s limited scope and history with the firm.",
