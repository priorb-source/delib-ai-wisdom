    "review": "Forecaster 2 raises important strategic considerations I underweighted: India's strong attendance record at recent G7 summits (2022-2024), the reset opportunity with new Canadian PM Mark Carney, and pressure from other G7 members who favor India's inclusion for China-balancing and Global South engagement. However, I find their 65% forecast overly optimistic given concrete timing constraints. Forecaster 3's analysis aligns closely with mine and adds valuable information about Sikh organizations in Canada actively lobbying against Modi's invitation, which increases domestic political costs for Canada. Both forecasters acknowledge the historical precedent, but differ sharply on whether strategic imperatives can overcome the practical reality of being 12 days out with no invitation reported. The core tension is between long-term strategic logic versus immediate logistical and political constraints. I find Forecaster 3's weighting of current concrete facts more convincing than Forecaster 2's emphasis on strategic possibilities.",
    "rationale": "Reviewing all arguments, I acknowledge the historical precedent is stronger than I initially considered—India's consistent attendance at recent G7 summits (2022, 2023, 2024) does establish a meaningful base rate. The strategic case for inclusion (G7 interests in Indo-Pacific, China balancing) and potential pressure from other G7 members are real factors. However, these strategic considerations must contend with hard constraints: we are 12 days from the summit with multiple credible media sources confirming no invitation has been issued, no advance preparations are underway in India, and Canada faces domestic opposition from Sikh organizations. High-level diplomatic visits of this nature require weeks of security coordination and logistical planning—compressing this into less than two weeks would be highly irregular. The Nijjar assassination remains a serious bilateral irritant. While I should increase my forecast slightly to account for the stronger historical precedent and theoretical possibility of last-minute diplomatic breakthrough, the concrete facts remain determinative. The timing constraint is simply too tight for normal diplomatic protocols.",
