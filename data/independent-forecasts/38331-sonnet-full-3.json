  "information": "In May 2025, Pakistan restored access to X (formerly Twitter) after a 15-month ban that was first enforced in February 2024. Internet monitoring organization NetBlocks confirmed that access was restored, allowing citizens to use the platform without a VPN. In a separate development, X blocked access to 126 accounts in Turkey in February 2025 following a court order citing the need for 'protection of national security and public order.' The blocked accounts included those of journalists and activists. In April 2025, a court in Ankara issued further access block decisions for several popular Turkish news accounts on the platform.\n\nThe Indian government ordered X to block access to over 8,000 accounts in May 2025, citing a crackdown on 'anti-India content' and violations of local regulations. The blocked accounts included those of several Turkish and Chinese media organizations, as well as independent media outlets and journalists. X stated its disagreement with the orders, noting that 'blocking entire accounts is not only unnecessary, it amounts to censorship... and is contrary to the fundamental right of free speech,' but indicated it would comply while investigating legal options.\n\nIn early June 2025, the government of Tanzania blocked access to X. The country's information minister stated the ban was due to the platform hosting explicit sexual material, including pornographic and LGBTQ+ content, which he said was 'contrary to the East African state's laws, culture, customs, and traditions.' The move followed a recent change in X's policy to allow 'consensually produced and distributed' adult content. The Legal and Human Rights Centre (LHRC), a local rights group, described the action as part of a 'troubling pattern of digital repression' ahead of scheduled elections in October.",

    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Approximately 26 days. The question resolves when Wikipedia is accessed by Metaculus admins on or after July 1, 2025 (today is June 5, 2025).",
    "status_quo_outcome": "Yes - all seven countries (China, Iran, Myanmar, North Korea, Russia, Turkmenistan, and Venezuela) continue to be listed as currently blocking X on Wikipedia.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "One or more of the seven specified countries lifts its ban on X (formerly Twitter) before July 1, 2025, and Wikipedia's article is updated to reflect this change, removing that country from the 'currently blocked' list. This could also occur if Wikipedia editors dispute the blocking status of one of these countries and update the article accordingly.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "All seven countries maintain their current X blocking policies through the end of June 2025, and Wikipedia continues to list all of them as currently blocking the platform. Given the authoritarian nature of these governments and their long-standing social media restrictions, no policy changes occur in the brief 26-day window.",
    "rationale": "The status quo heavily favors a Yes outcome. The seven countries listed - China, Iran, Myanmar, North Korea, Russia, Turkmenistan, and Venezuela - are all authoritarian or highly controlled regimes with long-standing social media restrictions. China has blocked Twitter since 2009, Iran since around 2009-2013, North Korea has virtually no internet access, Russia blocked X in March 2022, and the others maintain tight digital controls. These are not countries that typically reverse such policies quickly.\n\nThe research assistant's report provides useful context but doesn't directly impact this forecast - the countries mentioned (Pakistan, Turkey, India, Tanzania) are not among the seven being tracked. Pakistan's recent unblocking shows some countries do change policy, but Pakistan was never comparable to the more authoritarian regimes on this list.\n\nThe main risk factors for a No outcome are: (1) Wikipedia article editing issues or errors, though admins have discretion to handle edit wars; (2) an unexpected policy reversal by one of the countries, most likely Myanmar or Venezuela as they're somewhat less stable; (3) a technical or definitional change in how Wikipedia categorizes these blocks.\n\nThe 26-day timeframe is crucial - this is too short for major policy shifts in these countries. However, I'm not going higher than 93% because: Wikipedia articles can change unexpectedly, Venezuela's situation under Maduro can be volatile, and Myanmar's military junta governance is less predictable than established authoritarian states like China or Iran. I'm not going lower because the strong status quo bias, the authoritarian nature of all seven regimes, and the very short timeframe make changes highly unlikely. I would update higher if we got closer to July 1 with no changes, or lower if any of these countries showed signs of policy liberalization.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nAt the end of June 2025, will Wikipedia still list all these countries as \"currently\" blocking access to X (formerly Twitter)?\n\nQuestion background:\nAccording to the resolution source, \"Censorship of Twitter refers to Internet censorship by governments that block access to Twitter (officially known as X since July 2023). Twitter censorship also includes governmental notice and take down requests to Twitter, which it enforces in accordance with its Terms of Service when a government or authority submits a valid removal request to Twitter indicating that specific content published on the platform is illegal in their jurisdiction.\"\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if Wikipedia still lists X (formerly known as Twitter) as currently blocked in China, Iran, Myanmar, North Korea, Russia, Turkmenistan and Venezuela at [this link](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Censorship_of_Twitter#Current) when accessed by Metaculus on or after July 1, 2025. If the Wikipedia article does not list X as currently being blocked in any of those countries, this question resolves as **No**.\n\nThe question will resolve as soon as the page is accessed by Metaculus Admins on the resolution date. However, if there are issues accessing the page, then resolution will wait up to July 7, 2025, at which point if Metaculus has still not been able to access the resolution source, this question will be **annulled**. Admins will also use their discretion if there appears to be an [edit war](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Edit_warring) or lack of Wikipedia [consensus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Consensus) and may annul the question in such a case; however, Admins will also strive to resolve the question as definitively Yes or No, and such an edge case should be considered a rare outcome.\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nIn May 2025, Pakistan restored access to X (formerly Twitter) after a 15-month ban that was first enforced in February 2024.

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
