  "information": "On March 13, 2025, the government of Chad officially granted Starlink an operating license. The stated goal is to enhance internet connectivity, particularly in remote areas where the existing 6,000 km of fiber optic infrastructure is insufficient, and to support educational and healthcare institutions. Government officials have stated that negotiations were conducted to ensure affordable pricing for the service.\n\nThe time between Starlink receiving a license and its service becoming 'Available' on its map varies in other African nations. For the Democratic Republic of Congo, the process took approximately 10 weeks in 2025. For Malawi and Zambia, it was about 16 weeks, and for Benin, it was 24 weeks. Niger's service was officially launched on March 13, 2025, the same day Chad's license was announced. In May 2025, a pan-African partnership between SpaceX and Airtel was announced to potentially accelerate kit distribution.\n\nStarlink's expansion faces both technical advantages and logistical challenges. The use of optical inter-satellite links reduces the need for local ground stations in every country. However, high demand has led to service pauses and waiting lists in other regions, including some African countries like Nigeria and Kenya. For Chad specifically, potential obstacles include its landlocked geography, limited retail infrastructure, and the need to finalize details such as import rules and spectrum fees.",

    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "46 days",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No – the map continues to show Chad as Coming Soon (not Available) through June 30, 2025.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Operational details lag after the March 13 license: import/classification of terminals and spectrum fee/payment mechanics take longer than expected; retail/distribution and local payments are not ready; Starlink defers flipping the map to Available until July or later, keeping Chad labeled Coming Soon or Waitlist.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Following the March 13 license, SpaceX finalizes customs/type approvals and pricing, leverages the new Airtel Africa partnership to stand up distribution in Chad, enables orders/shipping, and flips at least some cells in Chad to Available on the Starlink map by mid-to-late June.",
    "rationale": "Timeframe: We have 46 days until June 30 inclusive. Chad’s license was granted March 13, 2025; by July 1 that will be ~16 weeks post-license.\n\nComparables (from the assistant’s report):\n- DRC: ~10 weeks from license to Available in 2025.\n- Malawi/Zambia: ~16 weeks.\n- Benin: ~24 weeks.\n- Niger: launched on the same day as announcement (March 13, 2025).\n\nInterpretation: The small sample suggests a broad 0–24 week window, with a cluster around 10–16 weeks and one slower outlier at 24 weeks. Given we are already ~9 weeks post-license and not yet Available, the immediate-launch scenario (0–10 weeks) seems unlikely. Conditioning on that, the remaining benchmarks are 16 weeks (on the cutoff) and 24 weeks (well after). The median of these comparables is about 16 weeks, which aligns almost exactly with our deadline, implying a knife-edge timing.\n\nForces toward Yes:\n- License already granted, public statements on affordability, and policy alignment suggest regulatory hurdles are largely cleared.\n- Starlink’s inter-satellite links reduce dependency on in-country gateways, so technical backhaul is not a blocker.\n- The May 2025 Airtel Africa partnership could accelerate kit distribution and retail readiness in Chad, where Airtel operates.\n- The resolution only needs any area in Chad to display as Available, not nationwide coverage.\n\nForces toward No:\n- Administrative and logistical friction in a landlocked, lower-infrastructure market: customs classification, import/VAT handling, spectrum fee implementation, and local payments integration can each slip timelines by weeks.\n- Starlink has paused sales or used waitlists in some African markets due to demand/capacity. If they opt to open with Waitlist rather than Available in initial cells, that would not satisfy the criterion.\n- Recent history includes a 24-week case (Benin), indicating genuine tail risk of a multi-month delay even post-license.\n\nWhy not higher: The deadline coincides with the common 16-week go-live pattern; any modest slippage in distribution/logistics or a decision to open as Waitlist first would miss the cutoff by days to weeks. Chad’s retail/payment setup could lag even with Airtel’s help.\n\nWhy not lower: The license is secured, technical constraints are modest due to ISLs, Airtel partnership is a fresh accelerant, and comparable countries often flipped within 10–16 weeks. Only partial-country availability is needed.\n\nUpdate signals:\n- Upward: Evidence of type approval/import clearance finalized; local pricing posted; preorders accepted; Airtel/retail partners advertising imminent sales; Starlink map shows Scheduled Service dates in June for specific Chadian cells.\n- Downward: Reports of customs/tax disputes, spectrum fee or payment integration delays, or Starlink capacity-driven pauses in adjacent markets; continued lack of local pricing or partner activity by early June.",

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
