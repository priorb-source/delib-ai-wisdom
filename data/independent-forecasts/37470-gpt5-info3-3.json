  "information": "Analysis of the International Traditional Karate Federation (ITKF) indicates a pattern of announcing World Championship hosts 24 to 36 months prior to the event. As of mid-May 2025, there is no mention of Egypt's 2026 bid, nor any related bid documentation, on the ITKF's official website. There have been no public reports of other nations submitting competing bids for the 2026 championship. Egypt previously hosted an ITKF event in 2014.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "About 54 days (until June 30, 2025)",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No – no official ITKF announcement naming Egypt as 2026 host by the deadline",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "ITKF makes no host announcement before July 1, 2025, or indicates the 2026 host later than the deadline, or names a different country.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "ITKF publishes an official announcement (website, verified social channels, or formal communiqué) before July 1, 2025 explicitly stating Egypt has been chosen to host the 2026 Traditional Karate World Championship.",
    "rationale": "The status quo is no announcement. The research assistant notes ITKF typically announces World Championship hosts 24–36 months before the event; for a 2026 championship, that window implies 2023–2024, making a new host announcement in the next ~7 weeks late relative to precedent. As of mid-May 2025, the ITKF website lacks any mention of Egypt’s 2026 bid or host selection, and there are no public reports of competing bids. A local Egyptian report indicates discussions with the ITKF President about hosting, which shows interest and government support but falls well short of a federation-level decision. Small federations can be late and ad hoc, so a late-breaking decision is possible, and Egypt has prior ITKF hosting experience (2014), which lowers execution risk if selected. However, the combination of (a) no official bid/selection signals on ITKF channels this close to the deadline, (b) typical earlier award timing, and (c) the need for an explicit ITKF announcement (not just Egyptian press) makes a Yes outcome less likely than not within the timeframe. Not higher: Because we lack any concrete ITKF process signals (e.g., an agenda for a near-term Congress, a shortlist, or a pending vote) and are late relative to historical timing. Not lower: Because there is visible interest from Egypt and the federation is small enough that an expedited decision and announcement could occur, and there appear to be no widely reported competing bids. Upward updates: Credible reports of an imminent ITKF Executive Committee/Congress decision; ITKF posting a 2026 host decision timetable; official ITKF teasers mentioning Egypt; Egyptian federation stating an ITKF decision date. Downward updates: ITKF hints at postponing the 2026 event, announces another host, or remains silent past mid-June with no meeting on calendar.",

These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if, before July 1, 2025, the International Traditional Karate Federation announces that Egypt has been chosen to host the 2026 Traditional Karate World Championship.\n\n\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nAnalysis of the International Traditional Karate Federation (ITKF) indicates a pattern of announcing World Championship hosts 24 to 36 months prior to the event.

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
