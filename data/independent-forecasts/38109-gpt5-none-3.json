    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "About 30 days (through June 30, 2025; outcome clear by July 1, 2025)",
    "status_quo_outcome": "Moderately likely Yes: absent a regulatory or operational disruption, Kalshi continues listing at least one MLB game market each day in June.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "- CFTC or another regulator pressures Kalshi to halt sports markets in June, leading to a pause or delisting for part of the month.\n- Kalshi decides to scale back or experiment with limited sports offerings and skips one or more days for MLB.\n- A technical/operational outage results in no MLB markets being posted on at least one June day.\n- MLB has a rare day with no games and Kalshi does not list any forward-dated MLB market tied to that calendar day’s games (the criterion requires a game being played that day).",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "- Kalshi maintains a standing process to auto-list at least one MLB game market daily and does so consistently all month.\n- No new rule, injunction, or cease-and-desist affecting sports markets takes effect in June.\n- Even with thin liquidity on some days, Kalshi ensures at least one MLB matchup market is live each calendar day with MLB games.",
    "rationale": "- Evidence and status quo: The link structure suggests Kalshi has an active Sports/Baseball category. If sports markets are already up by late May, the default is continuation. MLB has games essentially every day in June (unlike the All-Star break in July), so demand and opportunity exist daily.\n- Feasibility: Auto-generating a single Yes/No market per day for one MLB game is trivial operationally and consistent with Kalshi’s broader cadence of daily event listings.\n- Key risks pulling the forecast down:\n  1) Regulatory overhang: The CFTC has scrutinized certain event contracts (elections, possibly sports). A sudden policy move or legal action in June could force Kalshi to pause sports. The LV Review-Journal item underscores active litigation/regulatory dynamics (albeit more centered on political markets), reminding us the regime could shift quickly.\n  2) Consistency requirement: The question resolves No if even one day is missed. Even high per-day reliability (e.g., 98–99%) compounds to a meaningful monthly failure chance.\n  3) Strategic or operational choices: Kalshi might prioritize select marquee games or other sports (NBA Finals) and inadvertently skip an MLB day, or face a brief outage.\n- Why not higher: The “every single day” bar plus correlated regulatory risk makes a clean 30-for-30 streak less than highly likely.\n- Why not lower: They already appear to run sports/baseball markets; MLB runs daily; the marginal cost to list one market per day is small. No public indication of an imminent June ban.\n- What would move me up: Confirmed observation of MLB markets listed on consecutive early-June days; a statement from Kalshi committing to daily MLB coverage; signs of regulatory quiet through June.\n- What would move me down: Any announcement/rulemaking or court development restricting sports event contracts; an observed missed day early in June; prolonged site or listing outages.\n- Research assistant summary: No additional information was provided beyond the background link; hence I rely on general knowledge of Kalshi’s product cadence and the regulatory context.",

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
