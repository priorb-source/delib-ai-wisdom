  "information": "On April 29, 2025, Egypt's Minister of Youth and Sports, Dr. Ashraf Sobhy, met with Gilberto Gartner, a Brazilian national who is the President of the International Traditional Karate Federation (ITKF). The purpose of the meeting was to discuss Egypt's bid to host the 2026 World Traditional Karate Championship. Dr. Sobhy stated that Egypt has organized over 440 sports events in recent years, citing its modern sports infrastructure. President Gartner expressed confidence in Egypt's ability to host the championship successfully, noting he had witnessed a high level of organization at the World Gymnastics Championship in Egypt and that the country has a large base of karate practitioners.",

    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "About 54 days (until July 1, 2025)",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No announcement before the deadline (question resolves No)",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "ITKF continues discussions and internal approvals into late summer or fall 2025, or evaluates multiple bids, delaying the host decision or announcement until after July 1.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "ITKF’s executive committee or board formally approves Egypt’s bid in May/June and issues an official announcement (website, press release, or verified social channels) naming Egypt as 2026 host before July 1.",
    "rationale": "- Evidence to date: On Apr 29, 2025, Egypt’s sports minister met ITKF President Gilberto Gartner to discuss Egypt hosting the 2026 World Traditional Karate Championship. Gartner was publicly positive about Egypt’s capabilities. However, no official ITKF announcement has been made yet.\n- Timing considerations: With roughly eight weeks remaining, a decision is possible if ITKF is small and can act via an executive vote without waiting for a large congress. Conversely, many federations schedule host awards to coincide with congresses or major events later in the year, making a pre–July 1 announcement less likely.\n- Status quo weight: The default in international event bidding is that decisions take months; absent explicit signals of an imminent board meeting or sole-bidder status, the base case is no announcement by July 1.\n- Why not higher: We lack confirmation of a scheduled ITKF decision window before July, and there could be competing bids or governance steps (site inspections, financial guarantees) that push the timeline past July 1.\n- Why not lower: High-level political backing, Egypt’s strong hosting track record, and the ITKF President’s positive statements all increase the chance of a relatively quick green light, especially if the field of bidders is thin and financing is secure.\n- What would move this up: Evidence that Egypt is the only qualified bidder; an ITKF executive board meeting set in May/June to decide 2026 host; reports of a signed hosting agreement or MoU pending announcement; credible media leaks naming Egypt as chosen host.\n- What would move this down: News of competing bids advancing; ITKF indicating the decision will be made at a later congress (e.g., Q3/Q4 2025); signs of logistical or financial hurdles in Egypt’s bid.",

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
