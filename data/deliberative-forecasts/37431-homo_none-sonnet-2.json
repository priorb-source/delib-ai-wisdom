    "review": "All three forecasters reached remarkably similar conclusions (30%, 30%, 38%), which provides confidence in the analytical framework. We agree on key points: the 68-day window is short by historical standards, status quo favors Active status, and typical closures take 3-6+ months. Forecaster 3's slightly higher estimate (38%) emphasizes that allergen recalls receive priority attention as Class I recalls, suggesting potential for faster processing. This is a valid consideration I did acknowledge but perhaps underweighted. However, I remain skeptical that 'urgency' in initiating recalls translates proportionally to faster closure timelines, as closure requires systematic verification steps: product recovery from distribution channels, company reporting, FSIS effectiveness verification, and final documentation. These bureaucratic processes are time-consuming even with priority handling. The 65,000-pound scope and moderate size could support either faster (manageable) or slower (still substantial) recovery. Without specific data showing allergen recalls close significantly faster than other recall types, or evidence of limited distribution/rapid recovery progress in this specific case, I see limited basis for meaningful upward revision from the 30% baseline.",
    "rationale": "After reviewing the other analyses, I maintain that the base rate evidence strongly supports a conservative forecast. While Forecaster 3's point about Class I priority for allergen recalls has merit, the fundamental constraint remains: systematic verification processes take time regardless of urgency. A 68-day closure window represents roughly 40-75% of typical 3-6 month timelines, which would require exceptional circumstances. The convergence around 30-38% across independent analyses suggests this range appropriately captures the uncertainty. I'll make a modest upward adjustment to 33% to acknowledge the potential expediting effect of allergen recall priority while maintaining that the probability remains substantially below 50% given the tight timeline and lack of evidence suggesting this case is progressing unusually quickly.",
