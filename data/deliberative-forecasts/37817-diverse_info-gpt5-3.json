    "review": "Forecaster 2’s emphasis on the short timeline and the distinction between scheduled service and charters aligns with how flightsfrom.com counts routes. Their claim that there are currently four scheduled destinations (with a possible fifth as charter-only) is plausible and, if correct, implies we’d need two new scheduled destinations to clear the >5 threshold—very unlikely within ~6 weeks. I find this reasoning solid, though I’d want a source for the exact current count.\n\nForecaster 3’s analysis hinges on two factual claims I have not seen corroborated and that seem unlikely: Qantas launching Brisbane–Koror in Feb 2025, and United starting Narita–Koror in Oct 2025. Qantas operating BNE–ROR would be a surprising network move; United launching NRT–ROR also seems inconsistent with their current Pacific strategy, and in any case would be after the resolution date. If the Qantas claim were true, it would materially raise the base count, but absent evidence it looks doubtful. Overall, F3’s 45% seems too high given the need to reach six destinations and the short runway for new starts.\n",
    "rationale": "My prior was that ROR likely has 2–4 scheduled destinations active for S25 (very likely TPE and GUM; YAP and one of ICN/HKG are uncertain). To resolve Yes, we’d need at least six scheduled destinations listed on flightsfrom.com on/after July 1. With roughly 40 days to go, most summer schedules are already filed; adding two new international routes on this timeline is rare without prior announcements. Demand signals from Korea and China/Hong Kong remain soft, and Japan service has mostly been charters since 2018. Charters wouldn’t count under the resolver’s source.\n\nForecaster 2’s point that there are currently four scheduled destinations (plus a charter that likely won’t count) strengthens the ‘No’ case: you’d need two incremental scheduled routes before July 1. Forecaster 3’s asserted Qantas Brisbane route, if real, would change the math, but I find it improbable without corroboration and therefore don’t incorporate it. Given the status quo and timing, I move my estimate down modestly to reflect the apparent current-count information while retaining a small chance of one or more scheduled resumptions already filed but not widely publicized.\n",
