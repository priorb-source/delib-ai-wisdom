    "review": "Forecaster 2 raises critical new information claiming there are May 2025 reports that Circle has paused its IPO due to market volatility. This is notably absent from my research assistant's report, which only stated the deal is 'filed but not yet active.' If true, this pause would dramatically lower the probability, as resuming a paused IPO, completing SEC review, roadshow, and listing in 6.5 weeks would be extremely unlikely. However, I cannot independently verify this claim. Forecaster 3's 59% forecast appears overly optimistic and doesn't address the potential pause or the concerning lack of progress since April 1. Their reasoning about operational feasibility assumes normal progression, but we have no evidence things are progressing normally. The exchange-specific risk they mention (NYSE vs Nasdaq) is a valid point I hadn't fully considered - even if Circle IPOs in time, it must specifically be on NYSE. Forecaster 3's confidence seems misplaced given zero concrete indicators of advancement toward a June listing.",
    "rationale": "After reviewing both analyses, I'm updating downward from my original 20%. The key considerations are: (1) Forecaster 2's claim about a May pause, while unverified in my materials, aligns with the complete absence of progress signals since the April 1 filing. (2) We're now at mid-May with no SEC effectiveness declaration, no roadshow announcement, no pricing range - all critical milestones that should be visible if a late June listing were on track. (3) The Forbes article from early April suggesting 2025 as 'the year of stablecoins' doesn't necessarily mean Circle will meet the July 1 deadline specifically. (4) Even if a pause isn't formally confirmed, the lack of any forward movement for 6+ weeks strongly suggests the process has stalled. (5) The NYSE-specific requirement adds another layer of risk beyond just 'will they IPO in time.' I'm not going as low as Forecaster 2's 10% because: pauses can theoretically be reversed quickly with the right market conditions, the IPO infrastructure (underwriters, filings) is in place, and unexpected accelerations do occasionally happen in financial markets. However, the weight of evidence suggests significant delays or obstacles.",
