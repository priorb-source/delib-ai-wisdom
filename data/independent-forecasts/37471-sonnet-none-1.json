    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Approximately 3-4 weeks. The May 2025 data will be reported by FRED in late June 2025.",
    "status_quo_outcome": "NO - maintaining levels near the February 2025 figure of 500,000",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Inventory stabilizes or grows modestly from the 500,000 level reported in February 2025, remaining below 550,000. This could occur if builder activity moderates, sales pick up to absorb inventory, or typical seasonal patterns result in less dramatic increases than needed to reach the 550,000 threshold.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Inventory continues its strong upward trajectory, adding 50,000+ homes from the February level to exceed 550,000. This would occur if builders maintain aggressive construction schedules, buyer demand remains weak due to high prices and mortgage rates, and seasonal spring inventory additions push the total over the threshold.",
    "rationale": "The most recent data point indicates 500,000 homes in February 2025, already at historically high levels not seen since November 2007. To exceed 550,000 in May requires adding more than 50,000 units (a 10% increase) in just three months, or approximately 17,000 units per month. While the long-term trend has been strongly upward (tripling over 13 years), such a rapid increase in an already elevated market seems ambitious. The status quo bias suggests the market is more likely to stabilize or grow modestly rather than surge another 10% in a short period. Spring seasonal patterns could support some inventory growth, but starting from such a high base makes the 550,000 threshold challenging. The probability is not higher because the required increase is substantial and markets tend to stabilize at extremes. It's not lower because the recent momentum has been strong and supply-demand imbalances could persist. I would update higher if data shows March-April inventory continued growing at 15,000+ units per month, or lower if data shows stabilization or decline from the February peak.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill the number of new single family homes for sale in the US exceed 550 thousand in May 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\n[The Kobeissi Letter](https://x.com/KobeissiLetter/status/1912142359577403619): \"BREAKING: The number of new single-family homes for sale has surged to 500,000 in February, the highest since November 2007.\n\nThe number of new homes on the market has more than TRIPLED over the last 13 years, from a low of 142,000.\n\nExcluding the 2006 housing bubble this is, by far, the largest supply of new homes in history.\"\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if the number of New One Family Homes for Sale in the United States reported for May 2025 is greater than 550 thousand, according to what is presented by [FRED](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/HNFSEPUSSA).\n\nEnsure units is set to \"Thousands of Units, Seasonally Adjusted\" and frequency is set to \"Monthly, End of Month\". Question resolves based on the number presented by FRED, and no other resolution source will be considered.\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nNo additional information available.\n\nToday is 2025-05-08.\n\nBefore answering you think:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n(e) You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
