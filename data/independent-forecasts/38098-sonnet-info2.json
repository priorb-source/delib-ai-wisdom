  "information": "According to news reports from February and March 2025, U.S. Representative Ralph Norman is \"seriously considering\" a run for Governor of South Carolina in 2026, when the incumbent will be term-limited. Several outlets, including The State, Roll Call, and Politico, have noted that Norman's office has denied any plans for a Senate run. Norman has officially filed for his own House re-election.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "32 days (from May 30, 2025 to July 1, 2025)",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No - Norman does not declare candidacy for US Senate",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Norman continues on his current trajectory, maintaining his focus on either a potential Governor's race or his House re-election. His office's denial of Senate plans holds, and no announcement is made before the July 1 deadline passes.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Norman reverses course in the remaining 32 days due to pressure from conservative activists, changing political circumstances in South Carolina, or strategic recalculation. He announces a Senate primary challenge to Lindsey Graham before July 1, 2025.",
    "rationale": "The evidence strongly favors a No outcome. My research assistant reports that as recently as February-March 2025, Norman's office explicitly denied plans for a Senate run across multiple news outlets (The State, Roll Call, Politico). More tellingly, Norman has officially filed for his own House re-election and is reportedly considering a Governor's race instead - both incompatible with a near-term Senate announcement. With only 32 days remaining until the deadline, there is very little time for a major strategic pivot. The status quo principle is particularly strong here: politicians who have publicly denied running for office and filed for re-election rarely reverse course within a month absent extraordinary circumstances. The 2023 Axios article shows Norman was once discussed as a potential challenger, but the trajectory since then has moved away from a Senate run. My forecast is not lower (closer to 1-2%) because politicians occasionally do change positions, and unexpected political developments could theoretically occur in a month. My forecast is not higher because the combination of explicit denials, House re-election filing, Governor race consideration, and extremely short timeframe make an announcement highly unlikely. I would update upward only if credible reporting emerged of Norman reconsidering or if major political events created pressure for him to run.",

These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if Will Ralph Norman declares his candidacy for the US Senate race in South Carolina before July 1, 2025. If no such announcement has been made before that date, the question resolves as **No**.\n\n\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nAccording to news reports from February and March 2025, U.S. Representative Ralph Norman is \"seriously considering\" a run for Governor of South Carolina in 2026, when the incumbent will be term-limited.

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
