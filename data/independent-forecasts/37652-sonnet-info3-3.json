  "information": "Polling data from the period leading up to the April 28, 2025, snap election showed a significant shift in public opinion. After trailing by more than 20 points at the start of the year, the Liberal party under Mark Carney experienced a major comeback. A March 23 Ipsos poll reported Carney's approval rating at 48% with 30% disapproval, while Conservative leader Pierre Poilievre had 35% approval and 52% disapproval. Some outlets cited the same poll as showing Carney with a 71% approval rating. An Abacus Data poll from March 24 found the Conservatives with a national lead of 39% to 36% over the Liberals, but found Carney was the preferred choice for Prime Minister over Poilievre, 38% to 34%. The same poll reported that 77% of Canadians held a negative view of U.S. President Donald Trump.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Approximately 47 days (July 1, 2025 is 6.5 weeks away from May 15, 2025)",
    "status_quo_outcome": "Yes - Carney likely has higher approval than Trump",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Carney's honeymoon period ends prematurely due to policy missteps or scandal in his first months as PM, or Trump's approval rating surges significantly, or Morning Consult does not yet have approval data for Carney as he only recently became PM, resulting in a No resolution",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Carney maintains his post-election honeymoon period through July 1, continuing the strong approval ratings (48-71%) shown in pre-election polls, while Trump maintains his historically lower approval ratings typical of his presidency, especially given the 77% negative Canadian view of Trump reported in March",
    "rationale": "The question presupposes Mark Carney is Prime Minister, suggesting he won the April 28, 2025 snap election. Key evidence supporting a Yes outcome: (1) Pre-election polls showed Carney with 48% approval (or 71% by some measures) versus 30% disapproval in March 2025; (2) New government leaders typically enjoy a honeymoon period lasting 3-6 months, and July 1 would be only 2 months post-election; (3) 77% of Canadians held negative views of Trump in March, suggesting strong contrast effects; (4) Morning Consult data historically shows Trump with approval in the low-40s range, lower than most Western leaders; (5) Carney was preferred over Poilievre as PM choice 38% to 34% pre-election, indicating public support. Factors preventing a higher forecast: We lack current May 2025 data for either leader; honeymoon periods can end abruptly with early governing mistakes; Morning Consult may not yet track Carney if he's a brand new PM, which could technically resolve as No; 6.5 weeks allows time for significant events. Factors preventing a lower forecast: The structural advantages are strong - new leader honeymoon effect, Trump's consistent low approval, Canadian anti-Trump sentiment, and Carney's demonstrated electoral victory. I would update higher with evidence of: sustained Carney approval polling above 55%, Trump approval remaining below 45%, or confirmation Morning Consult is tracking Carney. I would update lower with evidence of: early Carney governing problems, Trump approval surge, or Carney approval declining to Trump's level.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney have a higher approval rating than US President Donald Trump on July 1, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nResolution source updates monthly. According to Morning Consult for January 2025: \"The latest approval ratings are based on data collected from Jan. 21-27, 2025. Ratings reflect a trailing seven-day simple moving average of views among adults in each country surveyed.\"\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if Mark Carney has a higher approval rating than US President Donald Trump according to [Morning Consult](https://pro.morningconsult.com/trackers/global-leader-approval) when checked by Metaculus on or after July 1, 2025. If this not the case (including due to a tie), this resolves as **No**.\n\n\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nPolling data from the period leading up to the April 28, 2025, snap election showed a significant shift in public opinion.

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
