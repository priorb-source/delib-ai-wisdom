    "review": "Forecaster 2’s Poisson-based 12% using per-company removals is a useful cross-check I hadn’t explicitly quantified; however, it likely overstates near-term odds because removals cluster within single “events.” The list of recent big daily stock moves is not, by itself, a strong catalyst for DJIA changes. Forecaster 3’s event-based framing (≈0.4 events/year → ~7% over this horizon) aligns closely with my prior. Both emphasize the lack of concrete, time-bound catalysts and the committee’s preference for stability after the 2024 refresh, which I find convincing.",
    "rationale": "Time window is short (~0.18 years). Two reasonable base-rate anchors: (a) event-level rate ≈0.4/year (2015, 2018, 2020, 2024) → P≥1 ≈ 7%; (b) per-removal rate ≈0.7/year (7 removals in 10 years) → P≥1 ≈ 12%. Because changes cluster within events and there are no evident imminent catalysts (mergers, splits, sector gaps), I weight closer to the event-level rate. A modest upward nudge is warranted to acknowledge that any single change would resolve Yes and the committee can act without notice. Plausible but low-probability triggers before July 1 include: a major corporate action among constituents (e.g., Boeing, 3M, Verizon, Disney), reputational or operational shock that makes a component untenable, or a representation-driven desire to add a large name (e.g., Alphabet) coupled with a suitable removal. Absent such signals, near-term hazard remains low. Updating slightly from 8% to 9% to reflect the per-removal base-rate argument while still discounting for clustering and the lack of catalysts.",
