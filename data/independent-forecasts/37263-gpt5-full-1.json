  "information": "In April 2025, the Ministry of Tourism in the Turks and Caicos Islands (TCI) warned tourism stakeholders against promoting or facilitating the use of illegal taxis, with businesses facing a $1000 fine for such referrals. The government has emphasized that operating an unlicensed taxi is a serious offense, with penalties for drivers including a fine and disqualification from driving. The country, with a resident population of approximately 45,000, has also implemented a new \"Rate Your Ride\" framework. As of May 2025, two locally-based ride-hailing services are confirmed to be operating: GetMe Ride, which launched in 2019, and Conch Cab, which began service in May 2025.\n\nUber's recent expansion strategy has focused on major international markets and technological partnerships. In December 2024, the company launched an \"Uber Taxi\" service in Curitiba, Brazil, integrating licensed local taxi drivers onto its platform through a partnership with mobility company Stuo. In the U.S., Uber partnered with autonomous vehicle developer May Mobility in May 2025, with plans to deploy self-driving taxis in Arlington, Texas, by late 2025 and expand to other cities in 2026. Reports indicate that Uber's historical pattern in the Caribbean has been to prioritize larger markets over smaller island jurisdictions.\n\nTourism in the Turks and Caicos Islands grew significantly in 2024, with the islands welcoming nearly two million visitors across air and cruise travel. This total represents a 10.66% increase in air arrivals and a 30.48% increase in cruise passengers compared to the previous year. New airline routes have been added to accommodate the demand, including a nonstop American Airlines service from Miami to South Caicos launched in March 2025. Concurrently, the U.S. Department of State maintains a Level 2 \"exercise increased caution\" travel advisory for TCI, first issued in July 2023, citing crime levels and reminding travelers of the islands' strict laws against firearms and ammunition.",

    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Approximately 60 days (until July 1, 2025)",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No — Uber is not currently available in Turks and Caicos and there are no credible indications of an imminent launch.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "The TCI government maintains its crackdown on unlicensed taxis and continues to emphasize licensed, local options. Existing local ride-hailing services (GetMe Ride, Conch Cab) meet demand. Uber does not announce, list, or activate service in TCI on its website/app by July 1, 2025.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Uber rapidly launches an “Uber Taxi” model in TCI by partnering with licensed taxi operators and securing regulatory acceptance. Uber updates its website/app to list Turks and Caicos and local media/government announce the launch before July 1, 2025.",
    "rationale": "Weight on the status quo: As of early May 2025, Uber is not operating in Turks and Caicos, and there are no public signals of a near-term launch. In small, highly regulated island markets, change tends to be slow, and taxi lobbies are influential.\nKey evidence from the research assistant:\n- The TCI government (April 2025) warned against illegal taxis and set fines for businesses that refer them, emphasizing strict licensing. This posture is typically unfavorable to quick, unlicensed ride-hail entries.\n- Two local ride-hailing services operate: GetMe Ride (since 2019) and Conch Cab (launched May 2025). This suggests the government and market already have regulated, locally anchored solutions.\n- Uber’s recent expansion emphasis has been on larger markets and specific partnerships (e.g., Uber Taxi in Curitiba, Brazil; AV partnerships in the U.S.). Uber historically prioritizes larger Caribbean markets; TCI’s population (~45k residents) and small road network make it a low-priority target relative to the opportunity cost of deploying resources elsewhere.\n- Tourism is growing strongly, which increases demand, but the presence of local apps aligned with licensed drivers offers an immediate, lower-friction path for the government to channel demand without inviting a global platform that could disrupt local stakeholders.\nWhy not higher: The time window is short (~2 months); regulatory stance is strict; market size is small; and there are no credible pre-launch signals (press, hiring, regulatory consultations) typically preceding an Uber launch. Taxi industry resistance in similar Caribbean jurisdictions has historically delayed or blocked Uber.\nWhy not lower: Uber can, in principle, flip on an “Uber Taxi” integration quickly if it partners with licensed drivers and gets tacit or explicit regulatory approval. Rapid launches have occurred elsewhere. Strong tourist demand could make a pilot attractive if a local taxi association and government invite Uber to improve service quality and oversight.\nWhat would move me upward: Any credible report of (1) a government policy shift or MOU enabling ride-hail platforms using licensed drivers, (2) Uber partnership announcements with TCI taxi associations or regulators, (3) Uber adding TCI on its website/city list or app geofence tests, (4) local media leaks or job postings indicating imminent launch.\nWhat would move me downward: Continued government statements reinforcing local-only solutions, resistance from taxi groups, or lack of any Uber-related signals by mid-June 2025.",

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any).
