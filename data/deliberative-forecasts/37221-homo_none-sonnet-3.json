    "review": "Both forecasters make compelling points that largely align with my original analysis. The most important emphasis they both made - which I underweighted - is the temporal proximity to the data release. We're on April 28, and European inflation data is typically released mid-month for the prior month, meaning we may be within days of the actual publication. The outcome has essentially already occurred; we're just awaiting official reporting. Both forecasters independently converged on 38%, using similar reasoning: the February downward revisions signal continued disinflationary momentum, the 2.2% threshold is very close to the ECB's 2% target (just 20 basis points), and while monthly volatility exists, the trend favors readings at or slightly below target rather than above. Their reasoning is sound and well-calibrated. The narrow range of our forecasts (35-38%) suggests we're all capturing the same fundamental dynamics: a disinflationary trend that makes exceeding 2.2% less likely, but enough uncertainty from monthly volatility and lack of preliminary April data to prevent assigning very low probabilities.",
    "rationale": "Upon deliberation, I find the consensus emerging around 37-38% to be well-justified. The key considerations are: (1) The downward revision trend from February strongly suggests continued disinflationary pressure, (2) The 2.2% threshold is only marginally above the ECB's 2% target, making it a relatively specific bar, (3) Without March data or April preliminary estimates, there's genuine uncertainty, but the base case favors the continuation of the observed trend, (4) Monthly volatility in inflation data means surprises are possible, but systematic factors point to readings closer to 2% than above 2.2%. The convergence of forecasts around 37-38% reflects appropriate weighting of these factors. I'm updating slightly from my original 35% to 37% to acknowledge the consensus while maintaining that the disinflationary trend warrants staying on the lower end of this narrow range rather than moving to 38%. The difference is marginal, and all three forecasts essentially agree on the core dynamics and uncertainty levels.",
