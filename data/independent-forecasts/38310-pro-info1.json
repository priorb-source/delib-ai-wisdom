  "information": "Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney formally invited Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy to the G7 summit scheduled for June 15-17, 2025, in Kananaskis, Alberta. The invitation was extended in March 2025. On May 27, 2025, Zelenskyy confirmed his intention to go, stating to Ukrainian journalists, \"G7: I was invited by the Canadian Prime Minister Carney. And I will be.\" Canadian security planning documents list Zelenskyy among the expected attendees, prompting preparations including a no-fly-zone over the area.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Approximately 12 days, as the summit is scheduled for June 15-17, 2025.",
    "status_quo_outcome": "Yes. President Zelenskyy has publicly accepted the invitation and Canadian authorities are making security preparations for his arrival, indicating all current plans are for him to attend.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "A sudden, major military escalation in Ukraine, such as a new Russian offensive targeting Kyiv or another key city, forces President Zelenskyy to cancel his travel plans at the last minute to remain in the country and manage the crisis.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "The situation in Ukraine remains stable enough to permit travel, and President Zelenskyy's plans proceed as announced. He travels to Kananaskis, Alberta, and attends the G7 summit in person.",
    "rationale": "The forecast is heavily weighted towards 'Yes' based on multiple strong, recent pieces of evidence. The host country, Canada, extended a formal invitation. Most importantly, President Zelenskyy publicly and unequivocally confirmed his intention to attend on May 27, 2025, stating 'I will be.' Furthermore, Canadian security planning documents reportedly include him, prompting specific preparations like a no-fly-zone. These actions indicate a high degree of certainty from both the guest and the host nation just two weeks before the event. The status quo is a clear path to his attendance. \n\nThe probability is not higher than 95% because, as the leader of a nation at war, President Zelenskyy's ability to travel is always contingent on a permissive security and military situation. A sudden, major battlefield crisis is the primary risk that could force a last-minute cancellation. While he has traveled abroad before during the war, the possibility of an acute emergency can never be completely discounted.\n\nThe probability is not lower because all available public information points to his attendance. His public statement creates a strong commitment, and the logistical and security preparations by a G7 nation are significant undertakings that would not proceed without a high level of confidence. Barring a major, unforeseen event, all preparations are in place for the visit to happen.\n\nI would update my forecast upwards upon confirmation of his departure from Ukraine or arrival in North America. I would update my forecast downwards upon credible reports of a significant new Russian offensive or an official announcement from either the Ukrainian or Canadian governments about a change in plans.",

These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if Ukrainian President Volodymyr Oleksandrovych Zelenskyy attends in person a G7 summit held in June 2025.\n\n\"In person\" is defined as occupying the same physical space closely enough at the G7 Summit that he can see and hear other heads of state through direct un-intermediated exchange of photons and sound waves.\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nCanadian Prime Minister Mark Carney formally invited Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy to the G7 summit scheduled for June 15-17, 2025, in Kananaskis, Alberta.

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
