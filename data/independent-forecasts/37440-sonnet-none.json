    "status_quo_outcome": "No - the legislation has not yet been enacted and remains in the legislative process",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "HB 831 or similar legislation fails to advance through both chambers of the Florida legislature before July 1, 2025. This could occur if the regular legislative session ends without passage, the bill stalls in committee, faces unexpected opposition, or simply doesn't reach a vote before the deadline. No special session is called to address the matter.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "HB 831 or similar legislation requiring enhanced proof of US citizenship for voters successfully passes both chambers of the Florida legislature in the remaining weeks of the session (or in a special session), and Governor DeSantis signs it into law before July 1, 2025.",
    "rationale": "The critical factor is timing. Florida's regular legislative session typically runs from March to early May, meaning we are at or past the end of the regular session as of May 6, 2025. The article from April 2 described this as legislation that 'may' be required, indicating it was proposed but uncertain. For enactment by July 1, the bill must pass both chambers and receive the governor's signature within 56 days.\n\nFavoring passage: Florida has unified Republican control, and this legislation aligns with Trump and Republican priorities on election integrity. Florida has been proactive on election-related legislation in recent years. The article's mention of specific bill HB 831 shows concrete legislative action was initiated.\n\nWorking against passage: The extremely tight timeline is the primary obstacle. If the regular session has ended without passage, it would require calling a special session specifically for this purpose, which is less certain. The research assistant provided no information on the bill's current status, committee assignments, or advancement through the legislative process. Most legislation fails to pass even in favorable political environments.\n\nGood forecasting favors status quo absent strong evidence of change. While the political environment is conducive, legislative action in such a compressed timeframe without confirmed momentum is difficult.\n\nI would update higher (40-50%) if evidence emerged that: the bill has already passed one chamber, a special session is scheduled, or there's explicit prioritization from leadership. I would update lower (10-15%) if the regular session definitively ended without passage and no special session is planned.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nBefore July 1, 2025, will Florida enact legislation expanding its verification requirements of a voter's citizenship?\n\nQuestion background:\nTallahassee Democrat: [Florida may require proof of citizenship to vote under new legislation echoing Trump](https://www.tallahassee.com/story/news/local/state/2025/04/02/got-id-proof-of-citizenship-may-soon-be-needed-to-vote-in-florida/82756919007/)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if, before July 1, 2025, the state of Florida enacts legislation requiring voters to provide proof of US citizenship beyond the requirements at the time of this question, according to [credible sources](https://www.metaculus.com/faq/#definitions).\n\nAny subset of voters being required to provide such proof would count (for example if it only applied to first-time voter registrants or creating a new requirement for mail-in voters). An example of a bill that would count is [HB 831](https://www.flsenate.gov/Session/Bill/2025/831). This question resolves upon enactment; therefore other questions such as when the legislation takes effect or whether it survives court challenges and is implemented is immaterial to this question's resolution.\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nNo additional information available.\n\nToday is 2025-05-06.\n\nBefore answering you think:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n(e) You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
