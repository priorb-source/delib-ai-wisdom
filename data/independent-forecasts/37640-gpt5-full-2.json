  "information": "According to statements from Paul Gunning, the EPA's Director of the Office of Atmospheric Protection, the Energy Star program and other climate-related work are being 'de-prioritized and eliminated.' Gunning's office, along with the EPA's climate change division and climate protection partnership division, are slated for closure as part of a broader agency reorganization. The stated goal of the restructuring is to bring the agency to 'Reagan-era staffing levels,' aiming for a savings of $300 million a year by 2026.\n\nThe Energy Star program was launched in 1992 as a voluntary public-private partnership to certify energy-efficient products. Over its 33-year history, government figures and expert analyses estimate the program has saved consumers over $500 billion in energy costs and prevented 4 billion metric tons of greenhouse gas emissions. The program's annual cost is approximately $32 million, while it is credited with saving the average household around $450 per year.\n\nDecommissioning a federal .gov domain typically requires a process lasting several months for internal approvals, security reviews, and coordination with the General Services Administration (GSA). Federal laws, including the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) and record-retention statutes overseen by the National Archives and Records Administration (NARA), mandate archiving procedures. Historically, websites for discontinued federal programs have often remained online as static archives or with placeholder notices for years after the program ended. When other EPA climate-related webpages were targeted for removal in 2017, the outcome was a redirect or a static page, not a complete shutdown of the domain.",

    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "About 48 days (until July 1, 2025)",
    "status_quo_outcome": "Yes — EnergyStar.gov remains online (even if as a static/archival or notice page).",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "EPA leadership orders an expedited takedown and IT disables the domain or web service before July 1, or misconfigurations/firewalls make the site unreachable so IsItDownRightNow reports it as down.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "The program is wound down but the website stays up with a notice/archival content or a redirect (which still counts as reachable), consistent with federal archiving and past practice.",
    "rationale": "- Status quo/inertia: As of May 7, the site is up. Government web infrastructure typically changes slowly; even discontinued programs’ sites often persist for months or years as static archives or with notices. The check used for resolution (IsItDownRightNow) only requires the domain to respond, not to host active program content. A simple redirect or placeholder would still register as UP.\n- Process frictions: The research assistant notes decommissioning a .gov site usually takes months due to internal approvals, archiving (NARA), and FOIA obligations. This argues strongly against a hard shutdown within ~7 weeks.\n- Precedent: In 2017, EPA climate pages were not fully taken offline; they were redirected or replaced with notices. That pattern suggests continuity of reachability even if content is removed.\n- Timing/budget: July 1 is still within FY2025. Even if the administration moves to eliminate the program, full operational wind-down and web decommission by that date is less likely than after Sept 30.\n- Why not higher: There is real, targeted pressure to eliminate the program. A directive to take down the site quickly for symbolic reasons, or an aggressive IT change (DNS cutover, firewalling), could render the domain unreachable to IsItDownRightNow. There’s also small background risk of outages/misconfigurations on the specific check date.\n- Why not lower: Energy Star is widely recognized and co-branded across products; even a discontinuation will likely involve a transition period. Legal/records requirements and the common practice of maintaining archives mean a reachable page is the default outcome in the near term.\n- What would move me up: Explicit indications from EPA/GSA that the domain will be retained/archived, or visible changes to the site showing an archival notice or redirect (demonstrating continued reachability). Congressional signals maintaining the program or its web presence.\n- What would move me down: Credible reports or official memos ordering an immediate shutdown of the domain, DNS changes pointing to NXDOMAIN, extended outages, or IT migration notices scheduling decommission before July 1.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill the EPA's EnergyStar.gov still be online on July 1, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nAccording to the [New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/06/climate/epa-energy-star-eliminated.html), \"'The Energy Star program and all the other climate work, outside of what’s required by statute, is being de-prioritized and eliminated,' Paul Gunning, the director of the E.P.A. Office of Atmospheric Protection, told employees during the meeting, according to the recording obtained by The New York Times. Mr. Gunning’s office itself is also slated for elimination.\n\nFor the past 33 years, Energy Star has been known for its recognizable blue label, which shows that an appliance has met energy efficiency standards set by the federal government.\"\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if EnergyStar.gov is online according to [Is It Down Right Now?](https://www.isitdownrightnow.com/energystar.gov.html) when accessed by Metaculus on or after July 1, 2025.\n\nAs of May 7, 2025, the resolution source returns the message, \"Energystar.gov is UP and reachable by us.\"\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nAccording to statements from Paul Gunning, the EPA's Director of the Office of Atmospheric Protection, the Energy Star program and other climate-related work are being 'de-prioritized and eliminated.'

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
