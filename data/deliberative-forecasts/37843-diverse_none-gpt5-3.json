    "review": "- Forecaster 2 rightly treats named underwriters as a strong signal of genuine intent, but I think they overstate how necessary a pre–July 1 public S-1 is for a 2025 listing. The typical cadence for a fall IPO is a public S-1 in late summer, not June. 75% seems too high given the narrow resolution pathways (public S-1 or a specific blog post) and the short window.\n- Forecaster 3’s 40% is closer to my view. They weigh the tension between credible preparation and timeline slippage. I agree that the lack of movement two months after the March report is a mild negative for a June announcement. \n- New consideration I’m adding: companies sometimes issue a press release announcing a confidential S-1 submission (“subject to market conditions”). If Discord posted that on its own news/blog, it would qualify. However, many issuers either don’t announce confidential submissions or house the release on a separate press site that may not meet this question’s “news section” criterion. That nuance keeps me below 40%.",
    "rationale": "Time left is ~5.5 weeks. Status quo is No. The primary Yes paths are: (1) a public S-1 in June, or (2) a Discord blog/news post announcing a planned IPO (e.g., a confidential S-1 submission). The first is less likely given typical tech IPO timing (public S-1s for fall listings often arrive late August/early September) and the quarter-end refresh issue—filing in June could force a quick financial update after June 30. The second is plausible but uncertain because many companies choose not to publicly announce confidential submissions on their own blog, and the resolution requires the company’s news page or a public S-1 specifically. Named banks and credible 2025-IPO reporting do raise the baseline odds, but the narrow resolution criteria and timing patterns still favor No before July 1. I’m nudging up slightly from my prior to reflect the realistic chance of a “confidential submission” style blog post in June, while still discounting a June public S-1. I would move higher on any leak of imminent filing or a company-posted statement; lower on any report of a slip to late summer/fall or if late June passes quietly.",
