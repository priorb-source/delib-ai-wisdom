    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "32 days (from May 30, 2025 to July 1, 2025)",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No - James Comey remains free and is not arrested",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "The Secret Service investigation into Comey's seashells social media post concludes without finding evidence of credible threat or criminal intent. The post is determined to be protected political speech or satire. The investigation either closes or continues past July 1 without sufficient evidence to warrant an arrest.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "The Secret Service investigation escalates rapidly, uncovering additional evidence of intent to threaten the president. Federal prosecutors determine there is probable cause for arrest on charges related to threatening a federal official or president. Alternatively, Comey is arrested for an unrelated matter that surfaces during this timeframe.",
    "rationale": "The base rate for arrests of former FBI directors is extraordinarily low - essentially zero in modern U.S. history. While the Secret Service investigation mentioned in the May 16 article adds some risk, the fact that nearly two weeks have passed since that article without an arrest is significant. Secret Service takes potential presidential threats very seriously and acts quickly when credible threats exist. The lack of immediate action suggests the investigation is not finding grounds for arrest. The legal bar for arresting someone over social media posts is high due to First Amendment protections. Ambiguous political statements like seashells spelling '86 47' would be difficult to prosecute as direct threats. The broad definition of arrest (anywhere, for any reason) slightly increases probability, but former high-ranking officials with legal expertise and resources are unlikely to be arrested without substantial cause. The 32-day timeframe is quite short for an investigation-to-arrest cycle in cases involving protected speech and high-profile individuals. My forecast is not lower because there IS an active federal investigation, and unexpected developments could occur. It's not higher because all available evidence points toward a low-probability outcome: no current indications of imminent arrest, strong legal protections, extremely low base rates, and sufficient time has passed since the investigation began without action.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill James Comey be arrested before July 1, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\n[Secret Service Is Asking Comey About a Photo of Seashells Spelling ‘86 47’](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/16/us/politics/secret-service-comey-social-media-trump.html)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if former FBI director James Comey is arrested before July 1, 2025, according to [credible sources](https://www.metaculus.com/faq/#definitions).\n\nIn order to streamline this question's resolution, please note that an arrest anywhere in the world, for any reason, will resolve this question as Yes. For purposes of this question, we define \"arrest\" using the definition [posted at Nolo](https://www.nolo.com/legal-encyclopedia/justifies-arrest-probable-cause.html): \"An arrest requires taking someone into custody, against that person's will, in order to prosecute or interrogate. It involves a physical application of force, or submission to an officer's show of force. In sum, the arrestee must not be free to leave. Whether the act by the police is termed an arrest under state law is not relevant. When deciding whether someone has been arrested, courts apply the 'reasonable man' standard. This means asking whether a reasonable person, in the shoes of the defendant, would have concluded that he or she was not free to leave.\"\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nNo additional information available.\n\nToday is 2025-05-30.\n\nBefore answering you think:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n(e) You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
