    "review": "The other forecasters present highly convergent analyses with mine, all landing in the 3-4% range. Their reasoning mirrors my own on key points: the extremely short timeframe (8 weeks), absence of current crisis indicators, historical rarity of such dramatic escalations, and the distinction between capability and intent. Forecaster 2 usefully frames this as requiring three sequential steps (Chinese decision, implementation, US accusation) all within the tight timeframe. Forecaster 3 raises an interesting nuance about gray-zone operations potentially being characterized as blockades, which could marginally increase the probability. However, this point seems already reflected in my consideration that the question only requires a US accusation rather than a verified comprehensive blockade. All three analyses appropriately weight status quo bias and note that major military actions typically have preceding warning signs that are currently absent. The clustering of forecasts at 3-4% with nearly identical reasoning provides validation that this is the appropriate range.",
    "rationale": "After reviewing the other forecasters' analyses, I find no compelling new evidence or arguments that warrant changing my forecast. The convergence around 3-4% with highly similar reasoning strengthens my confidence in this range. All three analyses appropriately balance the genuine but low-probability tail risk of a Taiwan crisis against the strong likelihood of status quo persistence. The gray-zone operations point raised by Forecaster 3 is interesting but already partially captured in my analysis of the lower bar for US accusations versus actual blockades. No forecaster identified current crisis indicators, unusual military movements, or other evidence suggesting elevated immediate risk. The short timeframe remains the dominant constraint - major geopolitical escalations of this magnitude typically require months of buildup. While I acknowledge 4% is equally defensible, I see no strong reason to move from my initial 3% assessment.",
