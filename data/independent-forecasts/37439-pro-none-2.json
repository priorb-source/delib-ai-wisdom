    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "The question resolves by June 15, 2025, which is approximately 40 days from today's date of May 6, 2025.",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No. Direct phone calls between the leaders of the United States and Russia are infrequent and typically require significant diplomatic groundwork and a compelling reason. The default course of events is that such a call does not take place within a specific one-month window.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "No specific crisis or diplomatic opportunity materializes between May 12 and June 15 that both Washington and Moscow agree necessitates a leader-level phone call. Communication continues through established, lower-level diplomatic and military channels.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "A significant development occurs, such as a major battlefield event in Ukraine, a critical juncture in a prisoner-swap negotiation, or a dangerous military incident involving US/NATO and Russian forces. This prompts a direct call, likely initiated by Trump, to de-escalate or negotiate. Both sides then formally acknowledge the call occurred.",
    "rationale": "My forecast is 30%. The baseline probability for a call between a US and Russian president in any given 34-day window is low, making 'No' the status quo outcome. Such calls are not routine; they are significant diplomatic events requiring a strong impetus. However, several factors modify this base rate. Donald Trump's documented preference for personal, leader-to-leader diplomacy makes him more likely than a conventional president to seek a direct call. Furthermore, the (assumed) ongoing war in Ukraine provides a persistent and volatile context where a sudden crisis or opportunity could necessitate immediate high-level communication. Conversely, a key piece of information significantly lowers the probability. The background context, referencing a 'February 2025 Putin–Trump call', suggests a call may have already taken place just three months prior. If an initial contact has already occurred, the justification for a follow-up call so soon would need to be particularly strong, as the diplomatic 'low-hanging fruit' would have been picked. My 30% estimate balances the higher potential for a call due to Trump's style against the reduced likelihood of one occurring in this specific, narrow timeframe, especially following a recent prior call. My forecast is not higher because the recency of the potential February call creates a significant hurdle. It is not lower because the combination of a major international crisis and an unconventional US president keeps a call as a distinct possibility. I would raise my probability on news of escalating direct tensions or credible reports of back-channel talks. I would lower it if both sides publicly downplayed the prospects of talks.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill Donald Trump and Vladimir Putin speak on the phone with each other before June 15, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nWikipedia: [February 2025 Putin–Trump call](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/February_2025_Putin%E2%80%93Trump_call)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if, after May 12, 2025 and before June 15, 2025, Donald Trump and Vladimir Putin speak on the phone with each other, according to [credible sources](https://www.metaculus.com/faq/#definitions).\n\nBoth sides must acknowledge the phone call took place for it to count. \"Speak on the phone with each other\" is defined as both Trump and Putin, from different physical spaces, orally uttering words intended for the other individual into a telephone or equivalent device, those words being converted into electrical or digital signals in real time, and then transferred to the other individual via telecommunications links, where they are reconverted into sound waves at the other individual's listening device.\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nNo additional information available.\n\nToday is 2025-05-06.\n\nBefore answering you think:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n(e) You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
