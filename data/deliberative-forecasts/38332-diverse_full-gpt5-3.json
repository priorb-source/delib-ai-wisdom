    "review": "Both forecasters emphasize two risks: (1) the tight Seville (Jun 30–Jul 3) to Rio (Jul 6–7) turnaround and (2) the lack of any official confirmation after three months. I don’t find the logistics themselves prohibitive for a head of state—Seville-to-Rio with a two-day buffer is feasible. However, they raised a point I hadn’t fully priced: the July 1 cutoff interacts awkwardly with typical government communications. If Uruguay tends to publish July travel schedules on/after July 1 or waits until after the UN conference starts to finalize/announce, this market could resolve No even if Orsi ultimately attends. Their “status quo”/inaction argument and the possibility that Uruguay opts to send a minister instead are also reasonable downward pulls. I’m less convinced by portraying Seville→Rio as a hard constraint, but I accept the timing/announcement-risk as meaningful.",
    "rationale": "Positives remain: Orsi’s stated openness to multilateralism, Lula’s personal invite, and the low political cost of attending as a guest. The travel window is workable. But as of early June, Uruguay still signals “undecided,” and this question resolves on an announcement before July 1. That cutoff now looks like the critical hurdle: if Montevideo issues July agendas on/after July 1 or delays a decision until the UN conference is underway, this resolves No regardless of eventual attendance. Balancing these, I trim my probability from 46% to 40%—still above the other forecasts because I think a late-June confirmation is plausible and diplomatically attractive, but lower to reflect the nontrivial announcement-timing risk and persistent silence. I would move up on any June-dated presidential/foreign ministry note listing Orsi’s early-July travel or quoting that he “will attend.” I would move down if Uruguay hints at minister-level representation or stays silent past the last week of June.",
