    "review": "Both forecasters provide valuable additional context I hadn't fully considered. Forecaster 2 importantly notes Pyfer's strong recent record (6 of last 7 wins, 4-1 in UFC) and his recent first-round KO bonus over Barriault, which suggests good form and finishing ability. Forecaster 3 adds that Gastelum is coming off a win and emphasizes the significance of this bout already being cancelled once. However, I notice a critical timing discrepancy: Forecaster 2 refers to 'roughly three months away,' but the question states today is May 26 and UFC 316 is June 7—that's only 12 days out, not three months. This dramatically changes the cancellation risk assessment. Both forecasters estimate 15-25% cancellation risk, which seems appropriate for fights months out but far too high for a main card bout just 12 days away. At this stage, both fighters would be deep into final preparations and weight cuts. The combination of being so close to fight night, already being a rebooked fight (suggesting high organizational commitment), and being on the main card should push cancellation risk down to 5-10% rather than 15-25%. On the conditional win probability, the additional context about Pyfer's recent finishing form and 6-1 record strengthens the case for him being a modest favorite, though the Hermansson loss and Gastelum's experience keep this from being overwhelming.",
    "rationale": "Updating my analysis with the new information: Pyfer's strong recent record (6-1 in last 7, including a first-round KO bonus) provides stronger evidence for his form than I initially weighted. The fact that we're only 12 days out rather than months out is crucial—at this stage, cancellation risk is much lower than the 15-25% range the other forecasters suggested. With the fight on the main card, already rebooked, and both fighters presumably deep in camp, I estimate only 5-8% cancellation risk. For the conditional win probability, the additional context supports Pyfer as a modest favorite around 58-60%. His physical advantages (grappling, reach), recent finishing ability, and momentum are meaningful. However, Gastelum's experience, southpaw stance, and the cautionary tale of Pyfer's loss to Hermansson prevent this from being a strong favorite situation. Combining revised probabilities: P(fight occurs) = ~93% × P(Pyfer wins | fights) = ~58% = 54%. I'm updating from my initial 50% to 54%, primarily due to the reduced cancellation risk at 12 days out and the stronger evidence of Pyfer's recent form.",
