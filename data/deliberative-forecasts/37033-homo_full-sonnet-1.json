    "review": "Both forecasters raise compelling points that warrant careful consideration. Forecaster 2's emphasis on typical government behavior patterns - that governments space large payments for cash flow and political management - is particularly insightful. The observation that it took years to make the FIRST payment suggests institutional caution is deeply embedded. Forecaster 3's higher forecast (48%) rests on the argument that institutional processes are now in place and small payment amounts enable multiple disbursements. This is plausible but may be overly optimistic given the timeframe. A key piece of evidence I underweighted is the February 2025 payment to European farmers - this demonstrates broader momentum beyond just the April payment. This pattern of two payments in two months (February and April) is more significant than I initially credited. However, I find Forecaster 2's structural argument about government payment pacing more convincing than Forecaster 3's optimism about rapid successive disbursements. The absence of any announced payment schedule or timeline remains critical. If Zimbabwe intended another payment within 38 days, we would likely see preparatory signals.",
    "rationale": "After deliberation, I'm updating my forecast upward but remaining closer to Forecaster 2's position. The February payment to European farmers provides stronger evidence of sustained momentum than I initially considered - two payments in two months suggests active implementation rather than symbolic one-offs. The $6.9M in remaining allocated funds and established institutional processes support feasibility. However, three factors keep me from moving to Forecaster 3's 48%: (1) Only 14 days have elapsed since the April 9 payment, making another payment within 38 days quite rapid by government standards; (2) The historical pattern of extreme delay (years to make the first payment) suggests deeply cautious institutional behavior; (3) No public statements or announcements indicate imminent additional payments. The severe economic crisis, drought, and competing priorities create real constraints. While the strategic importance for debt relief and sanctions is genuine, absent any announced schedule or timeline, the base case remains that governments space payments rather than cluster them. I'm updating from 32% to 36% to reflect the February payment momentum and established processes, while maintaining skepticism about rapid successive disbursements.",
