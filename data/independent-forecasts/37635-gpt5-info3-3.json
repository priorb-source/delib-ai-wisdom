  "information": "An international survey by Morning Consult conducted between January 21 and 27, 2025, placed Claudia Sheinbaum's approval rating at 66% and Javier Milei's at 65%. A later report from April 30, 2025, citing Morning Consult data, showed Milei's approval at 61% and Sheinbaum's at 60%. In the January survey, Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi had the highest approval rating at 75%.",

    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "About 45 days (until June 28, 2025)",
    "status_quo_outcome": "Yes — Milei leads Sheinbaum 61% to 60% in the latest cited Morning Consult reading (Apr 30, 2025).",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Sheinbaum’s approval ticks up to match or exceed Milei’s (e.g., 61–62% while Milei holds ~60–61%), or both round to the same displayed percentage on Morning Consult (a tie resolves No).",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Milei maintains or slightly widens his current edge (e.g., 61% vs 59–60%) due to continued improvement in Argentina’s inflation and any legislative wins, while Sheinbaum’s early-term honeymoon gradually softens or plateaus around ~60%.",
    "rationale": "- Evidence so far: The research assistant notes Morning Consult had Sheinbaum 66% vs Milei 65% in late January, but by April 30 Milei led 61% vs 60%. That’s a small but notable swing toward Milei over Q1–Q2 2025. \n- Status quo/inertia: With roughly six weeks left and a 1-point Milei lead, the base case is that the ordering persists. Morning Consult’s weekly leader approvals typically drift slowly, with week-to-week moves often 1–2 points and strong autocorrelation. \n- Volatility and tie penalty: The margin is slim and Morning Consult displays whole-number approvals, so ties are common at round figures like 60–61. Because a tie resolves No, this mechanically lowers the chance of Yes relative to a simple “who is higher” without tie penalty. \n- Fundamentals: Sheinbaum is still early in her term and has remained high but has eased from a honeymoon peak (66% in January to ~60% by late April). Milei’s approval has been relatively resilient around 60–65 despite austerity; improving inflation and any legislative progress into June could support him. Conversely, Argentina remains volatile; setbacks (protests, legislative defeats, economic disappointments) could trim his approval by a point or two, which would flip the ordering. Mexico’s approval dynamics appear somewhat steadier near ~60. \n- Why not higher: The lead is only 1 point, the measurement is noisy, and a tie counts as No. Sheinbaum’s level is still strong and could rebound a point, easily erasing Milei’s edge. \n- Why not lower: The most recent comparative data has Milei ahead; Sheinbaum’s trend since January has been gently downward; macro sentiment in Argentina has plausible room to improve into late June. \n- What would move me up: Multiple consecutive Morning Consult updates before late June showing Milei ≥2 points ahead; clear positive Argentine macro or legislative headlines with no offsetting controversies. \n- What would move me down: New readings showing Sheinbaum back ahead, or a string of weeks with both at the same rounded value; Argentine political/economic shocks that push Milei down a point or two; notable positive news in Mexico that nudges Sheinbaum back to 61–62%.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill Javier Milei have a higher approval rating than Claudia Sheinbaum on June 28, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nAt the time of this question, Sheinbaum is at 60% as compared with Milei at 61%.\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if Javier Milei has a higher approval rating than Claudia Sheinbaum at [Morning Consult](https://pro.morningconsult.com/trackers/global-leader-approval) when checked by Metaculus on or after June 28, 2025. A tie or a lead by Sheinbaum resolves the question as **No**.\n\n\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nAn international survey by Morning Consult conducted between January 21 and 27, 2025, placed Claudia Sheinbaum's approval rating at 66% and Javier Milei's at 65%. A later report from April 30, 2025, citing Morning Consult data, showed Milei's approval at 61% and Sheinbaum's at 60%.

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
