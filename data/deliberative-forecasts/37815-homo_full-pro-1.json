    "review": "All three forecasters converged on the same core logic: the forecast is driven by the low historical base rate of 1-2 South American pilot reports per year on the NUFORC database. We all identified the same key factors: the low absolute number of events makes a 'Yes' outcome unlikely in any given month, and significant reporting friction (the platform being US-based and in English) likely suppresses reports from the region. The main difference between the forecasts was a minor one of degree (8% vs. 10%). Forecaster 3 introduced the most compelling new argument by applying a Poisson distribution to model the probability of a rare event. This provided a formal mathematical justification for the 8% forecast, showing that for a rate of one event per year, the probability of at least one event in a month is roughly 8%. This quantitative rigor strengthens the case for the lower end of the probability range we all identified.",
    "rationale": "After reviewing my peers' analyses, I am maintaining my forecast of 8%. The deliberation process has reinforced my confidence in this figure. The core reasoning remains unchanged: the probability is anchored by the very low historical frequency of the specified event (1-2 reports per year from South America), making the status quo outcome 'No'. My initial assessment of 8% was at the low end of the simple monthly probability range (8.3% - 16.7%). Forecaster 3's application of the Poisson distribution provides a more rigorous model that validates this specific number. Assuming the more conservative (and arguably more realistic, given reporting friction) rate of 1 event per year, the probability of one or more reports in a given month (1 - e^-(1/12)) is almost exactly 8%. This adds a strong quantitative foundation to my initial reasoning. While Forecaster 2's 10% is within a reasonable range, the 8% figure is more directly supported by a formal model of rare event probability. Therefore, I see no reason to adjust my forecast.",
