  "information": "The Texas Legislature's regular session is scheduled to end on May 26, 2025, leaving a narrow window for new legislation to pass through all required procedural steps in both chambers and be signed by the governor. While Lieutenant Governor Dan Patrick has threatened to force a special session, only Governor Greg Abbott can officially call one and set its agenda. As of mid-May, Governor Abbott's stated public priorities for the session did not include a THC ban. Public opinion appears to favor more access; a University of Houston survey found that 62% of Texans support marijuana legalization and 79% support a comprehensive medical marijuana program. Veterans' groups have also testified in opposition to a ban, citing THC products as an alternative to opioids.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Approximately 6.5 weeks until July 1, 2025",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No - Texas does not currently have a full ban on THC sales, and maintaining the status quo means no ban is enacted",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "The Texas Legislature's regular session ends on May 26, 2025 without passing a comprehensive THC ban. Governor Abbott either does not call a special session before July 1, or calls one but does not include a THC ban on the agenda. Even if a special session addresses THC, the bill fails to pass both chambers and receive the governor's signature before the deadline due to political resistance from veterans groups, public opposition, and procedural hurdles.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "In the next 12 days of the regular session, both the Texas House and Senate rapidly pass a bill fully prohibiting THC sales, and Governor Abbott signs it into law. Alternatively, Abbott calls a special session immediately after May 26, places a THC ban on the official agenda, and the legislature passes it with Abbott's signature before July 1, overcoming public opposition due to strong conservative legislative support.",
    "rationale": "The status quo strongly favors NO, and several substantial barriers exist to enacting a THC ban. First, the timeline is extremely compressed - only 12 days remain in the regular legislative session, requiring rapid passage through both chambers and gubernatorial signature. Complex or controversial legislation rarely moves this quickly. Second, and most critically, Governor Abbott has not included a THC ban in his stated public priorities for the session. While Lt. Gov. Patrick has advocated for action, only Abbott can call a special session and set its agenda. Without gubernatorial buy-in, the path forward is unclear. Third, public opinion strongly opposes a ban - 62% of Texans support marijuana legalization and 79% support comprehensive medical marijuana programs. Veterans groups have actively testified against bans, citing THC as an opioid alternative. This creates significant political headwinds. However, the probability is not negligible because: Texas has a conservative legislature that could be receptive to restrictions; Patrick's advocacy indicates some legislative support exists; and technically there is still time for either rapid passage in the current session or a special session before July 1. My forecast is not higher because Abbott's lack of prioritization is decisive - without his agenda-setting power, even Patrick's enthusiasm cannot force action. The public opposition and tight timeline create additional barriers. My forecast is not lower because there remains a non-trivial possibility of rapid legislative action in the final days of session or an unexpected special session announcement. I would update higher if Abbott suddenly announces support for a ban or calls a special session with THC on the agenda. I would update lower when the regular session ends without progress and no special session is announced.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill the state of Texas ban THC before July 1, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nBeaumont Enterprise: [Will THC see its final death blow in Texas this session?](https://www.beaumontenterprise.com/news/article/texas-senate-bill-aims-ban-thc-activists-call-20279801.php)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if before July 1, 2025, Texas enacts a law prohibiting the sale of THC. If no new prohibitions on the sale of THC become law in Texas before that date, this question resolves as No.\n\nFor it to count, a law must fully prohibit the sale of THC within the state. This question resolves upon a ban being signed into law, rather than when it is implemented. An enacted law being later overturned will not cause the question to re-resolve. Partial bans (for example laws prohibiting the sale of THC to persons under 21 years of age) will not count. This question pertains to the sale of THC within the state, not to the purchase of it by individuals.\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nThe Texas Legislature's regular session is scheduled to end on May 26, 2025, leaving a narrow window for new legislation to pass through all required procedural steps in both chambers and be signed by the governor.

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
