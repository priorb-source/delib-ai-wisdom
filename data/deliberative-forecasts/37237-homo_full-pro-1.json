    "review": "All three forecasters, including myself, have reached the same directional conclusion: the outcome will almost certainly be 'No'. There is a strong consensus on the primary causal factors: the chilling effect of the new 'Liberation Day' tariffs, the pull-forward of demand evident in the record March import figures (front-loading), and the chorus of real-time data from shipping and logistics sources indicating a dramatic contraction in April. The main point of deliberation is the precise level of confidence, with forecasts ranging from 2% to 10%. \n\nForecaster 2 introduced a highly compelling quantitative plausibility check using the reported $16.5 billion in April tariff revenue. Their calculation, which shows that import values would have to be well below the threshold even under optimistic assumptions about the average tariff rate, provides the strongest anchor for a very low probability. \n\nForecaster 3 provided a useful 'Value = Price x Volume' framework, correctly arguing the reported volume drop is too large to be offset by price increases. However, their justification for a higher 10% probability seems less convincing; their point about tariffs increasing the valuation of goods may misunderstand Census methodology (which excludes U.S. import duties), and the potential for a surge from Mexico appears quantitatively insufficient to offset the massive drop from China and elsewhere.",
    "rationale": "After reviewing the other analyses, I am lowering my forecast from 5% to 3%. The core reasoning for a 'No' outcome, shared by all, has been strengthened. The deliberation process, particularly Forecaster 2's analysis, convinced me that the quantitative evidence is even stronger than I had initially weighted it. The calculation based on the $16.5 billion in tariff revenue collected is a powerful piece of evidence. For the resolution threshold of ~$338.5 billion to be met, the average tariff rate across all imports would need to be under 5%. This seems extremely implausible given the policy is a 10% baseline tariff on most goods, with even higher rates on some categories. This single data point makes a 'Yes' outcome exceptionally unlikely. Forecaster 3's arguments for a higher (10%) probability, while worth considering, are not strong enough to counter this. The reported volume declines of 30-40% are simply too large for price effects or substitution from countries like Mexico to overcome. I am not lowering my forecast to 2% because I want to retain a slightly larger margin for the possibility that the preliminary real-time data, including the Treasury's revenue figure, contains significant errors. However, my conviction in a 'No' outcome has increased.",
