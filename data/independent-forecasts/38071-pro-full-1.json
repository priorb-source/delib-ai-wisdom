  "information": "Six Democrats are running in the June 17 primary for Virginia lieutenant governor: Alex Bastani, State Sen. Ghazala F. Hashmi, Babur B. Lateef, State Sen. Aaron R. Rouse, Victor Salgado, and former Richmond Mayor Levar Stoney. While the candidates agree on many core policies, such as repealing Virginia's right-to-work law and increasing the minimum wage, they differ on specific issues like gaming and education. Rouse, a former Virginia Beach City Council member, has sponsored legislation to strengthen protections for renters and to create a regulatory framework for the state's recreational cannabis market. Stoney has positioned himself as both business-friendly and committed to helping families. Hashmi, a former professor, highlights her six years of experience in the Senate.\n\nAccording to campaign finance records reported around May 1, 2025, Levar Stoney led the six-candidate field in fundraising, having raised approximately $1.4 million. State Senators Aaron Rouse and Ghazala Hashmi were also among the fundraising leaders. In late May, Carl Eggleston, a former candidate for lieutenant governor and the first African American to be elected to the Farmville Town Council, endorsed Levar Stoney, citing his executive experience. Reports also indicate Stoney has the backing of several Richmond-area elected officials, while Rouse has support from labor and progressive-issue groups.\n\nAn internal poll conducted for the Levar Stoney campaign in March 2025 showed Stoney leading the primary field with 16% support, followed by Aaron Rouse at 10%, and Ghazala Hashmi at 8%; 63% of voters were undecided. Geographically, Rouse's political base is in the Hampton Roads area (Virginia Beach/Norfolk), while Stoney's is in the Richmond metro area. Northern Virginia represents the largest voting bloc in the primary but does not have a candidate from the region.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Approximately 3 weeks, with the primary scheduled for June 17, 2025.",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No. Based on current polling and fundraising data, Levar Stoney is the slight frontrunner, making a Rouse loss the status quo outcome.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Levar Stoney leverages his lead in fundraising in the final weeks to blanket the airwaves, particularly in the undecided-rich Northern Virginia media market. His endorsements from established party figures help him consolidate support, and he wins the primary with a comfortable plurality.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Aaron Rouse's support from labor and progressive groups translates into a superior get-out-the-vote operation that outperforms polling expectations. He energizes his base in Hampton Roads while the large bloc of undecided voters breaks his way, allowing him to narrowly win a crowded, six-way primary with a plurality of the vote.",
    "rationale": "My forecast of 30% is based on Aaron Rouse being a top-tier contender in a crowded and fluid primary, but not the current frontrunner. The key data point is the March 2025 internal poll for the Stoney campaign, which, despite its potential bias and age, is the only quantitative data available. It showed Stoney at 16%, Rouse at 10%, and a massive 63% of voters undecided. This large undecided bloc makes the race highly volatile. Levar Stoney's lead in fundraising (around $1.4 million as of early May) provides him with a significant structural advantage in the final, critical weeks of the campaign for media buys and get-out-the-vote efforts. He also has secured key endorsements. These factors position Stoney as the marginal favorite, making 'No' the more likely outcome. My probability is not lower than 30% because the race is far from decided. The poll is two months old, and Rouse is also a strong fundraiser with a solid base in Hampton Roads and institutional support from labor and progressive groups. In a six-way race, a winning plurality could be as low as 25-30%, which is well within reach for a candidate in Rouse's position. My probability is not higher than 30% because I must weigh the objective data we have, which shows Stoney in the lead on both polling and fundraising. To forecast a higher probability for Rouse, I would need to see new, independent polling showing him closing the gap or leading, or evidence of a significant shift in momentum, such as a major endorsement in Northern Virginia or a stumble by the Stoney campaign.",
