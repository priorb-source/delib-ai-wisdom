    "review": "My review of the other forecasters' analyses reveals a shared understanding of the core conflict: high-level political will for change versus significant bureaucratic inertia. Both Forecaster 2 and Forecaster 3 rightly emphasized a point I had perhaps understated: a 'No' resolution does not require a lengthy scientific review to establish a new recommendation, but can be achieved through a rapid, administratively simple action like removing the webpage or posting a withdrawal notice. Forecaster 2's argument that the HHS Secretary's statement represents a 'politically-driven directive' rather than a 'routine scientific review' is a compelling framing that heightens the probability of such an action. Forecaster 3's analysis provided a well-reasoned balance, acknowledging the plausibility of this rapid action while still weighing inertia as the more probable force over the short term. I found their reasoning convincing in that I likely overestimated the power of institutional inertia to withstand a direct, high-level political order, especially one that can be satisfied with a simple website update.",
    "rationale": "I am updating my forecast downward from 85% to 70%. My initial analysis was heavily weighted towards institutional inertia, arguing that the standard processes for changing a public health recommendation are far too slow to be completed by the July 1, 2025 deadline. The other forecasters persuasively argued that I was underweighting the potential for an *non-standard*, purely political action. The HHS Secretary's explicit directive to the CDC could foreseeably result in the immediate removal of the recommendation page 'pending review,' which would resolve this question as 'No.' This is an administratively trivial act that bypasses the lengthy scientific process. Therefore, I have increased my estimated probability of a 'No' outcome from 15% to 30% to account for this significant risk. I am not lowering my forecast further, to the levels of Forecaster 3 (60%) or Forecaster 2 (25%), because I maintain that the extremely short timeline of just over a month remains the single most important factor. Even politically-motivated directives can get caught in procedural or legal snags, and the default action for any bureaucracy on such a short timeline is inaction. Therefore, I believe the status quo holding remains the most likely outcome, but with substantially more risk than I initially calculated.",
