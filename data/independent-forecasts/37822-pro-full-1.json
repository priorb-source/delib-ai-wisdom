  "information": "In late April 2025, during a series of town hall meetings, Beto O'Rourke stated that he would consider running for the U.S. Senate if it aligns with the desires of Texas voters. Quoted in multiple outlets such as Fox News, The Hill, and Yahoo, he said, 'If it comes to pass that this is what the people of Texas want, that it's the highest and best use of what I can give to you, then yes, I will.' As of late May 2025, O'Rourke had not filed any formal candidacy papers with the FEC and no campaign infrastructure or exploratory committee was visible. He continues his work with the voter mobilization organization 'Powered by People,' which he founded in 2019.\n\nThe 2026 Texas U.S. Senate election features incumbent Republican Senator John Cornyn seeking a fifth term. Cornyn faces a primary challenge from Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton, who has already announced his campaign. On the Democratic side, while O'Rourke is publicly considering a run, other figures like former Congressman Colin Allred have also been mentioned as potential candidates, though none had formally entered the race as of late May 2025.\n\nHistorical timelines for major Texas campaigns show variation. For the 2024 Senate race, Democrat Colin Allred announced his candidacy in May 2023, 17 months before the election. Beto O'Rourke's own record includes announcing his 2018 Senate bid 20 months early (March 2017) and his 2022 gubernatorial run 12 months early (November 2021). The question's deadline of July 1, 2025, is approximately 16 months prior to the November 2026 general election.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Approximately 1 month and 1 week.",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No. As of today, Beto O'Rourke has not announced his candidacy for the US Senate.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Beto O'Rourke continues his work with his voter mobilization group and makes public appearances, but decides to wait until later in the summer or fall of 2025 to make a final decision, thus missing the July 1st deadline. He may be waiting for more favorable polling or for the Republican primary field to become clearer before committing.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Capitalizing on recent media attention from his conditional statements, and consistent with his history of early campaign launches, O'Rourke makes a formal announcement via a social media video and press tour in mid-June 2025 to consolidate Democratic support and begin fundraising early.",
    "rationale": "My forecast is based on a conflict between Beto O'Rourke's past behavior and his current observable actions. The strongest argument for a 'Yes' outcome is his history of early announcements for major statewide races. He announced his 2018 Senate bid 20 months early and his 2022 gubernatorial bid 12 months early. The July 1, 2025 deadline is approximately 16 months before the November 2026 election, placing it squarely within his established pattern. His recent public statements that he would run 'if...Texans want' confirm he is actively considering it. However, the status quo is 'No,' and there is significant evidence supporting that this will continue for the next ~40 days. As of late May 2025, there is no visible campaign infrastructure: no FEC filings, no exploratory committee, and no reports of key staff being hired. Launching a statewide campaign in Texas is a massive logistical undertaking, and the lack of such groundwork makes an announcement within the short timeframe of the next month less probable, though not impossible. He has also suffered two consecutive high-profile statewide losses, which may lead to a more cautious and deliberative approach this time. While an announcement could come suddenly, the lack of concrete preparatory steps is a strong signal that a launch is not imminent. Therefore, I weigh the current lack of activity more heavily than his past tendencies, leading to a forecast below 50%. My forecast is not lower because his history and public statements make a pre-July 1 announcement a very plausible scenario. My forecast is not higher due to the significant, concrete evidence that a campaign is not yet ready to launch. I would increase my probability upon seeing FEC filings or credible reports of staff hiring. I would decrease it if another major Democrat announced their candidacy first or if O'Rourke indicated he would decide 'later in the year'.",
