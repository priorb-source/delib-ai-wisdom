    "review": "Both forecasters provide well-reasoned analyses that converge on essentially the same evidence and reach similar conclusions (5%, 10%). Forecaster 2 makes a particularly compelling argument about the gap between political rhetoric and concrete action - the Trade Minister's April commitment is not backed by any observable legislative steps, no bill has been scheduled, and there's no budget preparation. This is a critical insight. Forecaster 3's detailed breakdown of the three-step ratification process (Assembly passage, presidential assent, AND deposit with AU that must be recorded before July 1) effectively highlights how tight the timeline actually is. Both forecasters appropriately emphasize that the May-June legislative calendar contains no trade-related bills, which is perhaps the single most determinative piece of evidence against ratification. The late April 2025 arrests (occurring less than a week before our analysis date) represent extremely fresh political instability that I may have underweighted in my initial analysis.",
    "rationale": "Upon reflection, I believe I should adjust downward slightly. The evidence is overwhelming: (1) No trade bills scheduled in the published May-June calendar - this is a procedural showstopper absent an extraordinary intervention; (2) The Trade Minister's April statement, while recent, represents rhetoric without accompanying action; (3) The late April arrests are not just background context but an active, ongoing political crisis occurring in the final 60-day window; (4) Zero budget preparation for AfCFTA obligations indicates this is not a priority being actively prepared. Forecaster 2's framing around the rhetoric-action gap is particularly persuasive. However, I'm not moving all the way to 5% because: (1) The EAC trade committee established in February represents tangible institutional infrastructure, not just words; (2) We're only days removed from the political crisis, and stabilization remains possible; (3) Emergency legislative procedures could theoretically compress the timeline if political will emerged. The probability should account for a very small but non-negligible chance of a surprise fast-track effort driven by external pressure or unexpected political prioritization. My revised forecast of 6% reflects greater pessimism about the rhetoric-action gap while preserving a minimal probability for rapid political mobilization.",
