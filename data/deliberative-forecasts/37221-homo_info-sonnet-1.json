    "review": "The other forecasters raised critical new information that strengthens the case for a No outcome. Most importantly, Forecaster 2 revealed that March 2025 inflation was exactly 2.2% (down from February's 2.3%), and consensus forecasts from Bloomberg/Reuters are at 2.1% for April. This concrete data confirms the downward trend I identified. Forecaster 2's breakdown showing energy prices contributing -0.10pp while services remain sticky at +1.56pp provides helpful granularity. Their point about standard error (0.2-0.4pp) on inflation forecasts is a valid reminder about forecast uncertainty. Forecaster 3's insight that we're on April 28 - meaning the month is complete and data is just awaiting compilation - is excellent and reduces uncertainty about what might happen during April. Their additional evidence about ten consecutive months of PMI below 50 and decelerating wage growth reinforces the disinflationary environment. However, I note that even with 0.2-0.4pp forecast error, starting from a 2.1% consensus, an upside miss would need to be substantial to exceed 2.2%. The requirement being strictly ABOVE 2.2% (not at or above) is also important.",
    "rationale": "The new information reinforces my initial view while providing more precision. With March at exactly 2.2% and showing a clear downward trajectory, consensus at 2.1%, persistent weak economic conditions (PMI below 50 for 10 months), and the ECB confidently continuing rate cuts, the evidence for inflation remaining at or below 2.2% is compelling. The key upside risk remains services inflation stickiness and the inherent volatility in monthly data. However, the fact that April is complete (just awaiting official compilation) reduces uncertainty about unexpected developments during the month. While forecast errors do occur, the combination of downward trend momentum, weak growth environment, and the specific threshold requirement (strictly above 2.2%) suggests the probability of a Yes outcome should be low. I'm adjusting my forecast slightly lower from 22% to 20% given the concrete March data and consensus figures, while maintaining some probability for month-to-month volatility or measurement surprises.",
