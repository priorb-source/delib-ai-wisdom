    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "16 days.",
    "status_quo_outcome": "Chris Stapleton is a dominant and highly decorated artist in country music with a strong history of winning at major award shows. Given his multiple nominations, the status quo outcome is that he wins at least one award.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Despite receiving five nominations, Chris Stapleton is shut out in all categories. This could occur if a single artist, like Luke Combs or Morgan Wallen, has a particularly dominant year and sweeps the major awards, or if different artists win each of the categories for which Stapleton is nominated, leaving him without a trophy.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Chris Stapleton wins in at least one of the five categories for which he is nominated. For example, he could win Male Artist of the Year, an award he has won multiple times, or his latest album could win Album of the Year, securing a 'Yes' resolution.",
    "rationale": "My forecast is based on Chris Stapleton's established position as one of country music's most critically acclaimed and commercially successful artists, his significant history of winning at the ACM Awards (17 wins prior to this event), and the probabilistic advantage of having five separate opportunities to win. The status quo is that superstars with multiple nominations usually do not go home empty-handed. My research assistant provided no specific information, so this forecast relies on historical precedent and general industry dynamics. The probability is not higher because winning is never a certainty, and the country music field is highly competitive with other major stars who are also likely nominated in the same categories. Voter preferences can shift, and another artist could have a career-defining year that overshadows Stapleton's work. The probability is not lower because a complete shutout across five categories for an artist of his stature is a statistically unlikely event. He is a consistent favorite among voters. I would increase my forecast if early industry buzz or betting odds moved significantly in his favor for a specific category. Conversely, I would lower my forecast if a groundswell of support emerged for a competitor in the days leading up to the awards.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill Chris Stapleton win an award at the 60th Academy of Country Music Awards?\n\nQuestion background:\nThe awards are scheduled to be held on May 8, 2025. Stapleton has 5 nominations.\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if Chris Stapleton wins an award at the [60th Academy of Country Music Awards](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/60th_Academy_of_Country_Music_Awards).\n\n\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nNo additional information available.\n\nToday is 2025-04-22.\n\nBefore answering you think:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n(e) You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
