  "information": "Historical results show the Liberal Party won 160 seats in the 2021 federal election and 157 seats in the 2019 federal election. The last time the Liberal Party won a majority government was in the 2015 election, when they secured 184 seats.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Approximately 6 months (election expected on or before Oct 20, 2025; result known on election night).",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No — current polling and projections have the Liberals far from majority territory, with the Conservatives leading nationally.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "The Conservatives maintain a double‑digit national lead into the writ, win the Ontario 905 decisively, hold/grow the Bloc in Quebec at Liberal expense, keep the NDP competitive enough to split centre-left votes in Ontario/BC, and the Liberals finish well under 172 seats (likely below 120).",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "A late-cycle realignment: the Liberals change leader to a broadly popular figure (or Trudeau’s approvals rebound), the NDP support collapses as progressive voters consolidate behind the Liberals, the Bloc weakens in Quebec, and the Liberals dominate Ontario’s 905/416, recover in Atlantic Canada, and post strong urban/suburban wins in BC and the Prairies—yielding roughly Ontario 80+ seats, Quebec 35–45, Atlantic 25–30, BC 15–20, and 10+ in the Prairies/territories to reach ≥172 (a bare majority in the expanded 343-seat House).",
    "rationale": "Baseline: Canada’s next House is expected to have 343 seats after redistribution; a majority is 172. Historical context from the assistant: Liberals last won a majority in 2015 (184 seats) and have since won 157 (2019) and 160 (2021). Since mid‑2023, national polling averages and aggregators (e.g., 338Canada) have consistently shown the Conservatives with a large lead and the Liberals well below majority levels. Incumbency fatigue after ~10 years, low PM approval, and structural hurdles (Bloc strength in Quebec; NDP persistence in ON/BC) make a Liberal majority especially hard. Status quo therefore strongly favors No. Tail paths exist: Canadian elections have seen late swings (2011, 2015). A leadership change to a high‑salience, broadly acceptable figure or a major CPC stumble could compress the race, and rate cuts/soft‑landing could improve government standing. But reaching 172 requires not just closing a gap; it requires creating a broad, cross‑regional wave—particularly sweeping Ontario and materially improving in Quebec despite Bloc competition—which is a high bar. Why not higher: current fundamentals and regional math make a Liberal majority very unlikely from today’s vantage. Why not lower: rare but plausible tail events (leadership change, scandal, dramatic vote consolidation) have precedent in Canada and could produce outsized swings. What would move me up: (1) sustained Liberal national polling lead for 4+ weeks, especially a 5–7 point lead in Ontario and clear gains in Quebec; (2) leadership change to a more popular leader with immediate, durable polling improvement; (3) NDP dropping below ~12–13% nationally with clear Liberal consolidation; (4) credible seat models showing a Liberal median projection ≥150 seats. What would move me down: (1) Conservative lead widens or remains double‑digit through summer; (2) Bloc/NDP polling strengthens; (3) continued Liberal weakness in the Ontario 905 and Montreal suburbs; (4) 338Canada and peers projecting Liberals <100 seats into late summer.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill the Liberal Party win 172 or more seats in the 2025 Canadian federal election?\n\nQuestion background:\n[338Canada Federal Projection](https://338canada.com/federal.htm): \"The 338Canada project is a statistical model of electoral projections based on opinion polls, electoral history, and demographic data.

These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if the Liberal Party of Canada wins greater than or equal to 172 seats in the [2025 Canadian federal election](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2025_Canadian_federal_election).\n\n\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nHistorical results show the Liberal Party won 160 seats in the 2021 federal election and 157 seats in the 2019 federal election.

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower.
