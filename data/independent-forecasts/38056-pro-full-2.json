  "information": "According to reports in mid-April 2025 from sources including uol.com.br and Sports.ru, Johnny Walker was scheduled to fight the undefeated Azamat Murzakanov at UFC 316 on June 7-8 in Newark, New Jersey. At the time of the announcement, Murzakanov held a professional record of 14-0 and was noted for winning three of his four UFC bouts by knockout or technical knockout. He was returning from an 180-day suspension for an anti-doping violation, which was set to end on May 1, 2025. Walker's record was cited as 21-9, and he was entering the fight on a two-fight losing streak.\n\nMultiple news outlets, including RotoWire on May 6, 2025, and MMA Fighting on May 9, 2025, reported that Johnny Walker had withdrawn from his scheduled bout against Azamat Murzakanov at UFC 316. The reason provided for the withdrawal was an injury. Walker's official Wikipedia page was also updated to reflect his withdrawal from the event.\n\nFollowing Johnny Walker's withdrawal, it was announced that Azamat Murzakanov would remain on the UFC 316 card against a new opponent. As reported by MMA Fighting and Championat.com around May 7-9, 2025, Brendson Ribeiro was signed as the replacement fighter. Ribeiro entered the fight with a professional record of 15-7. The updated UFC 316 bout sheet officially listed the light heavyweight clash as Azamat Murzakanov vs. Brendson Ribeiro.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Approximately two weeks, as UFC 316 is scheduled for June 7-8, 2025.",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No, as Johnny Walker has officially withdrawn from the fight and has been replaced by another opponent.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Johnny Walker remains withdrawn from the UFC 316 card due to his injury. Azamat Murzakanov fights the replacement opponent, Brendson Ribeiro, as scheduled. This directly satisfies the resolution criterion that if Walker does not fight Murzakanov at UFC 316, the question resolves as No.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "In a highly improbable series of events, the replacement fighter Brendson Ribeiro withdraws, Johnny Walker makes a miraculous recovery from his injury, is medically cleared, and the UFC re-books the original Walker vs. Murzakanov fight for the UFC 316 card. Walker would then need to win this fight.",
    "rationale": "My forecast is overwhelmingly based on the confirmed reports from multiple reliable media outlets, including MMA Fighting and RotoWire, stating that Johnny Walker has withdrawn from his fight against Azamat Murzakanov at UFC 316 due to an injury. The resolution criteria explicitly state that if Walker does not fight Murzakanov at this event, the question resolves as 'No'. The status quo is that not only has Walker withdrawn, but a replacement fighter, Brendson Ribeiro, has already been officially scheduled to face Murzakanov. This makes the 'No' outcome a near certainty. The probability is not zero to account for the infinitesimally small chance of a bizarre, last-minute turn of events where the replacement fighter pulls out and a miraculously healed Walker steps back in to fight and win. For my forecast to increase, there would need to be official announcements that Ribeiro is out, Walker is medically cleared, and the original fight is back on. Conversely, as we get closer to the event date with the Murzakanov vs. Ribeiro bout still scheduled, this forecast would trend even closer to zero.",
