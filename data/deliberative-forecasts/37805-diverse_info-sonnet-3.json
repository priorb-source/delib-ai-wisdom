    "review": "Forecaster 2 raises a crucial methodological point I underweighted: FlightsFrom lists all scheduled routes over the next 12 months, not just flights operating specifically on July 1. This means routes scheduled to begin in fall/winter 2025 could already be loaded in airline systems by July 1, even if not yet operating. This significantly increases the probability relative to requiring active service on that specific date. Forecaster 2 also provides the most detailed route analysis, identifying likely destinations (GUM, ICN, NRT, PUS, HKG) and noting specific evidence like United's NRT-SPN promotion and Hong Kong Airlines listing Saipan.\n\nForecaster 3's emphasis on 'struggles to revive tourism amid flight suspensions' from the background material is valid and supports caution. However, their 15% forecast seems overly pessimistic given: (1) the 12-month listing window, (2) strong Korean tourism momentum with 70% visitor share, (3) active government marketing campaigns, and (4) multiple plausible route candidates. Their focus on the difficulty of launching entirely new routes in 6 weeks is correct but misses that existing seasonal routes could simply be scheduled/filed by July 1 for later operation.\n\nThe convergence of two forecasts at 42% (including mine) versus one at 15% suggests reasonable confidence in the moderate probability range. The key insight from Forecaster 2 about the 12-month window validates rather than dramatically changes my estimate, as it explains why 40-45% is appropriate rather than something lower.",
    "rationale": "After reviewing both analyses, I maintain that 42-45% is the appropriate range. The critical factors are:\n\n1. **Methodology clarification**: The 12-month listing window means routes scheduled for later in 2025 count if filed by July 1. This supporting factor was implicit in my original reasoning but deserves explicit weight.\n\n2. **Likely current status**: The most probable baseline is 3-4 destinations (Guam, Seoul/Incheon, Tokyo/Narita, possibly Busan). Achieving >4 requires either: (a) maintaining 4 current routes plus adding one more, or (b) already having 5+ routes scheduled.\n\n3. **Balance of evidence**: Strong Korean tourism (70% of visitors) and active promotional campaigns support maintaining current routes and possibly adding secondary Korean or Hong Kong service. However, 'struggles' language and 'flight suspensions' background suggest structural challenges.\n\n4. **Timeline reality**: While new permanent routes are unlikely in 6 weeks, seasonal routes for summer/fall 2025 could already be in airline booking systems, and the 12-month window captures these.\n\n5. **Key swing factors**: Hong Kong Airlines service (suggested but not confirmed) and secondary Korean cities (Busan, etc.) are the most plausible additions. Japanese routes face headwinds from weak yen.\n\nI'm adjusting slightly upward to 44% to reflect the 12-month window insight more explicitly, while maintaining that the base case (3-4 destinations) and short timeline for meaningful network expansion support staying in the 40-45% range rather than moving higher.",
