    "review": "The other two forecasters provide excellent, well-reasoned analyses that temper my initial optimism. Both correctly emphasize the strong baseline probability of a 'Yes' outcome due to Prime Minister Carney's post-election 'honeymoon period' compared to President Trump's historically stable and relatively low approval ratings. However, they both introduced crucial points of caution that I had previously understated. Forecaster 2 rightly points out that the six-and-a-half-week timeframe, while short, is still long enough for significant political shifts or scandals to occur. Forecaster 3's analysis was particularly convincing by introducing two specific and highly relevant risks I had overlooked: 1) The 'honeymoon' could be fragile if the US-Canada tariff dispute begins to cause tangible economic pain for Canadians, turning a popular policy stance into a liability. 2) The resolution criterion states that a tie resolves as 'No'. Given that Morning Consult often reports rounded numbers, a scenario where both leaders are in the mid-40s could easily result in a tie (e.g., 45% vs 45%), even if Carney has a slight unrounded lead. This technicality adds a distinct probability of a 'No' outcome. These arguments collectively suggest my initial forecast was overconfident.",
    "rationale": "After reviewing my peers' analyses, I am revising my forecast downwards from 85% to 75%. The core of my reasoning remains unchanged: a newly elected leader, Mark Carney, is highly likely to enjoy a 'honeymoon period' of elevated approval ratings. His specific platform of defending Canadian sovereignty against an unpopular US president (77% of Canadians view Trump negatively) provides a strong tailwind for his popularity in the short term. President Trump's approval rating, by contrast, has historically been inelastic and resides in the low-to-mid 40s. The combination of these factors strongly favors a 'Yes' outcome. \n\nHowever, the other forecasters convinced me that I had underestimated several key risks, prompting the 10-point reduction. The primary new considerations are:\n\n1.  **Economic Risk:** Carney's tough stance on tariffs is popular now, but if it leads to noticeable price increases or job losses in Canada before July 1, public opinion could sour quickly, eroding his honeymoon boost.\n2.  **Resolution Mechanism:** The 'tie resolves as No' clause is a critical detail. This means Carney needs a clear, unambiguous lead. If both leaders' approval ratings are close, in the mid-40s for instance, there is a non-trivial chance that Morning Consult's rounded figures will show a tie, flipping the outcome to 'No'.\n3.  **Fragility of Support:** Carney's support is currently based on promises (like a tax cut) rather than delivered results. This support is more fragile and susceptible to erosion from early governing missteps or unforced errors than I initially assessed.\n\nMy updated forecast of 75% still indicates a high likelihood of a 'Yes' outcome, but it now incorporates a greater probability for these downside scenarios. I remain slightly more optimistic than my peers (70-72%) because I believe the nationalistic sentiment fueled by the trade dispute will provide Carney with a particularly robust honeymoon effect that is less susceptible to minor issues in the first two months.",
