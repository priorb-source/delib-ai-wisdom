    "review": "All three forecasters, including myself, identified the same core drivers for this question: the powerful force of institutional inertia within public health agencies and the extremely short timeline between the announcement of the review (April 10, 2025) and the resolution date (July 1, 2025). We all agree that a full scientific and policy review leading to a new recommendation is nearly impossible in this timeframe. The primary point of divergence was the weight given to the possibility of a politically-driven, non-standard outcome, such as an interim directive to change the guidance or simply removing the webpage pending review, which would resolve as 'No'. My initial forecast of 85% allocated a higher probability (15%) to this disruptive outcome than the other two forecasters, who both landed at 90% (a 10% probability of disruption).",
    "rationale": "I found the reasoning of the other two forecasters convincing. Their analyses reinforced that the default outcome for any bureaucratic process over such a short horizon is inaction. While I had considered the possibility of an interim change (e.g., taking the page offline), the other forecasters' confidence made me reconsider the probability I assigned to it. They correctly emphasized that even a small action like altering or removing a guidance page requires overcoming inertia, a process that is often slower than one might expect. The political pressure prompted the review, but that may be the full extent of its immediate impact; the review itself proceeds on a standard, lengthy timeline. I believe my initial forecast was slightly overweighting the potential for a rapid political intervention to disrupt the status quo. The consensus view that ~90% is the correct probability for 'Yes' is well-supported by the dominance of procedural timelines over political haste in this context. Therefore, I am updating my forecast upwards to align with this consensus.",
