  "information": "United Airlines has announced a new year-round, twice-weekly direct flight from Narita, Japan, to Koror, Palau, which will commence on October 29, 2025. The route will be operated by a Boeing 737-800 aircraft, and tickets are already available for purchase. Separately, in February 2025, Qantas launched a new direct route from Brisbane to Koror, named the 'Palau Paradise Express.' This service is supported by the Australian Government.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Approximately 40 days until July 1, 2025",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No - there are likely 5 or fewer direct flight destinations currently",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Palau continues to have limited connectivity with only its core routes operational: Taipei, Seoul/Incheon, Guam, Manila, and Brisbane (the new Qantas route). This results in exactly 5 destinations, not exceeding the threshold.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "In addition to the core routes (Taipei, Seoul, Guam, Manila, Brisbane), at least one or two additional routes have resumed or been added by July 1st, such as a Japanese airport connection, Hong Kong, or another regional destination, bringing the total to 6 or more destinations.",
    "rationale": "With only 40 days until the resolution date, major changes to Palau's flight network are unlikely. The background information indicates tourism and flights have not recovered to pre-pandemic levels, suggesting limited connectivity. The research assistant's report provides two key data points: (1) Qantas launched a Brisbane-Koror route in February 2025, which should be operational by July 1st, and (2) United Airlines will start Narita-Koror service on October 29, 2025 - this is after the resolution date and won't count. Pre-pandemic, Palau typically had connections to Taiwan (Taipei), South Korea (Seoul), Guam, Japan, Philippines (Manila), and possibly others. Given the slow recovery, I estimate current operations likely include: Taipei, Seoul, Guam, Manila, and the newly added Brisbane - totaling 5 destinations. The question asks if there will be GREATER than 5, meaning we need at least 6. For a 'Yes' outcome, at least one additional route beyond these five would need to be operating. This could be a Japanese connection, Hong Kong, or another regional destination. However, given the stated slow recovery and the fact that the major new United Airlines service hasn't started yet, it's more likely we're at or just below the threshold. The probability is not higher because the background emphasizes limited flight recovery and the major new route (United-Narita) starts after July 1st. It's not lower because the Qantas Brisbane route is confirmed operational and there's a 40-day window for potential minor additions or resumptions of service. An update higher would require evidence of additional route announcements or resumptions before July 1st; an update lower would require confirmation of route cancellations or evidence that fewer than 5 routes are currently operating.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill there be greater than 5 direct flight destinations from Koror, Palau on July 1, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nMarketplace: [Why hasn’t tourism recovered in Palau?

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
