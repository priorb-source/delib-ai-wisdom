  "information": "As of late May 2025, no definitive proxy statement (DEF 14A) filed by GameStop with the SEC for its 2025 annual meeting has been located. According to SEC rules, such a filing is required ahead of a shareholder meeting. Business information aggregators present conflicting information: Computershare, GameStop's transfer agent, lists the meeting for June 2, 2025, while sources like Business Insider and Bloomberg terminals list June 12, 2025. The Business Insider entry also contains an apparent error regarding a dividend payment.",

    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "About 16 days (by June 13, 2025, we should know if it completed on June 12)",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "GameStop either files its DEF 14A with a different meeting date (late June/July) or does not file in time for a June 12 meeting; or it attempts to hold the meeting on June 12 but, due to technical or other issues, adjourns/continues it to a later date, meaning it does not fully complete on June 12.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Within days, GameStop files a definitive proxy (DEF 14A) specifying June 12, 2025 as the meeting date, provides valid notice, and the (likely virtual) meeting proceeds and fully completes on June 12 without adjournment.",
    "rationale": "As of May 27, 2025, no DEF 14A for GameStop’s 2025 annual meeting appears to be on file. That is a strong negative signal for a June 12 meeting date, since large issuers typically file weeks in advance. If GameStop uses SEC Notice-and-Access, the proxy materials must generally be made available at least 40 days before the meeting, which is already impossible for June 12. While they could still meet the minimum Delaware notice period (often as short as 10 days) by filing imminently and using full-set delivery, that would be unusual for a company of GameStop’s profile and scale.\n\nBusiness information aggregators conflict: Computershare reportedly lists June 2 (implausible without a proxy) while Business Insider and Bloomberg list June 12. The BI entry also contains a dividend error, undermining confidence. Bloomberg’s listing lends some weight to June 12 being contemplated, but without a DEF 14A it remains unconfirmed. The 2024 meeting experienced severe server issues and an adjournment; given renewed meme-stock interest in May 2025, the risk of high attendance and potential technical problems is elevated. Because this market typically changes slowly, I put extra weight on the status quo: no official proxy date implies the most likely outcome is that June 12 does not end up being the completed meeting date.\n\nWhy not higher: (1) No DEF 14A as of May 27, (2) timing constraints for notice/logistics, (3) elevated adjournment risk even if June 12 is scheduled. Why not lower: (1) Multiple sources list June 12 and it is a plausible historical cadence (a Thursday in mid-June), (2) it remains legally feasible if they file immediately and avoid Notice-and-Access timing.\n\nWhat would move me up: A DEF 14A or company/transfer agent announcement explicitly setting June 12 and detailing robust virtual meeting capacity; evidence of mailed/posted proxy materials and record date aligned for June 12. What would move me down: Any filing or IR/TA update naming a different date; continued lack of a proxy by June 1; indications of technical or legal issues likely to force adjournment.",

These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if Gamestop's 2025 Annual Meeting of Stockholders is held on June 12, 2025.\n\nThe meeting is considered to have been held when it fully completed. For example, if the meeting begins but is then postponed due to server issues, the question resolves as **No**.\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nAs of late May 2025, no definitive proxy statement (DEF 14A) filed by GameStop with the SEC for its 2025 annual meeting has been located.

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
