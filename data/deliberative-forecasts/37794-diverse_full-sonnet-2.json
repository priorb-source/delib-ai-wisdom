    "review": "The other forecasters make several compelling points that warrant careful consideration. Forecaster 3's precise mathematical breakdown is particularly valuable - showing Judge needs roughly .354-.396 over his next 48 AB depending on his exact current average. Forecaster 2 correctly emphasizes regression to the mean as a powerful force. However, I believe both forecasters are overweighting the historical precedent of no .400 season finish since 1941, when the question only asks about June 1st, not end-of-season. Forecaster 3's own mention that Arraez achieved .400 by early June in 2023 actually suggests this is more achievable than the 25-35% range implies.\n\nThe key insight from Forecaster 3 that Judge needs to hit .350-.390 over the next ~48 AB is crucial - this is an 'elite hot stretch' but not impossibly high for someone currently at .414. Both forecasters appropriately highlight Judge's volatility (power profile, 31 strikeouts) and modern structural headwinds (lower BABIP, higher K rates). Forecaster 3's point about ESPN qualification rules is valid but likely not decisive given the short timeframe.\n\nWhere I disagree: The 25-35% range seems to underweight the substantial 14-point cushion Judge has above .400 and the very short 13-day window. However, their emphasis on regression and volatility does suggest my 72% was too optimistic about Judge maintaining an elite stretch.",
    "rationale": "After deliberation, I'm adjusting downward but not to the 25-35% range. The critical factors:\n\n**Supporting higher probability (55-65%):**\n- Judge has a 14-point cushion (.414 vs .400 threshold)\n- Only ~40-50 AB remaining over 13 days - small sample where current momentum matters\n- Mathematical requirement: Judge needs roughly .350-.380 hitting over remainder, which while above league average, is achievable for an elite player on a hot streak\n- Walks reduce AB and help preserve average\n- Recent precedent (Arraez 2023) shows .400 in early June occurs occasionally\n\n**Supporting lower probability (50-60%):**\n- Regression to mean is powerful - Judge's true talent is likely .320-.350, not .414\n- Judge's power profile (31 K already) creates volatility - a single 0-for-12 stretch over 3 games could drop him to .390-.395\n- Modern structural factors (lower BABIP, higher K rates) work against sustained .400\n- Even needing .350-.380 represents maintaining an elite level that's difficult to sustain\n\n**My revision:** While my original 72% overestimated the likelihood of Judge maintaining his hot streak, the other forecasters' 25-35% range underestimates his substantial cushion and the brevity of the remaining window. The math shows he can afford some regression and still succeed. I'm settling at 60% - acknowledging real regression risk while recognizing the favorable setup.",
