    "review": "Both forecasters arrived at identical conclusions (12%) using essentially the same analytical framework I employed. This convergence is striking and informative. Forecaster 3 explicitly mentioned that 'spring/summer typically sees seasonal inventory increases,' which is a valid point, though the data is seasonally adjusted so this shouldn't materially impact the forecast. Both forecasters emphasize the supply-side constraints (declining starts and permits) even more forcefully than I did, which reinforces the case that the construction pipeline is slowing rather than accelerating. All three analyses independently identified the same critical factors: the 8x acceleration requirement, declining housing starts (-14.2%), weak builder confidence, healthy sales absorption, and the historical rarity of 550k+ levels. No forecaster introduced genuinely new data or arguments that weren't already implicit in my analysis. The fact that three independent forecasters converged on 12% using similar reasoning actually increases my confidence in this estimate rather than suggesting I should update.",
    "rationale": "The convergence of three independent analyses on 12% is significant evidence that this forecast is well-calibrated. The core reasoning remains compelling: reaching 550k requires a 9.3% inventory jump in two months when recent growth was only 0.6% month-over-month. Supply indicators uniformly point to deceleration (housing starts down 14.2%, permits down 2%, builder confidence at 42), while demand remains reasonably healthy (sales up 6% YoY at 724k annual rate). The only credible path to Yes requires a severe and sudden demand shock occurring in April-May that freezes buyer activity while a backlog of completions floods the market - but there's no evidence of such an imminent shock or significant backlog. The 12% probability appropriately captures: (1) the extreme unlikelihood of the required acceleration given current fundamentals, (2) residual uncertainty about potential economic shocks in a volatile housing market, and (3) the fact that current levels (503k) are already historically elevated. No new information from the other forecasters warrants revising this estimate.",
