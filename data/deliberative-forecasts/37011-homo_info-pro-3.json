    "review": "The other forecasters provided compelling arguments that I had under-weighted. Their core arguments centered on the immense structural barriers facing Reform UK, which I had acknowledged but not fully appreciated the scale of. Forecaster 2's specific data point that the Conservatives notionally hold 57 of 64 seats under the new boundaries provides a stark mathematical reality of the challenge, making my initial forecast seem far too high. Both forecasters rightly emphasized that there is no historical precedent for a new party going from zero seats to winning the most seats on a county council in a single election cycle. This historical context is a powerful anchor. Forecaster 3's mention of specific local issues, such as candidate vetting controversies, adds a qualitative weight to the argument that Reform lacks the local infrastructure and organizational maturity needed to mount a winning campaign across dozens of individual seats. Their reasoning, grounded more in electoral mechanics and historical data than in volatile national polling, is highly convincing.",
    "rationale": "After reviewing my peers' analyses, I conclude that my initial forecast of 8% was materially too high. I placed excessive weight on Reform UK's strong national polling numbers and did not sufficiently discount this for the realities of a First-Past-The-Post local election. The arguments from the other forecasters, particularly the notional starting point of 57 Conservative seats and the complete lack of historical precedent for such a political upset, are decisive. Winning the 'most seats' is an exceptionally high bar, requiring not just a collapse in the Conservative vote but also for that vote to transfer efficiently and geographically concentratedly to Reform, all while fending off Labour in other areas. This is a multi-part bank shot that is extremely unlikely. The other forecasters correctly frame this as a 'political earthquake' or 'black swan' event. My initial 8% treated it as a plausible, if unlikely, outcome. I am therefore revising my forecast down significantly to align with this assessment. An outcome this historically unprecedented should have a probability in the low single digits.",
