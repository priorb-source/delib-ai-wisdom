    "review": "The other forecasters' analyses are remarkably thorough and converge strongly with my own reasoning. All three of us identified the same critical factors: the House's demonstrated opposition through concrete legislative actions (HB 46 passing 118-16, substitute SB 3), the extremely tight 12-day timeline, Governor Abbott's lack of public prioritization, strong economic and public opinion headwinds, and the procedural requirement that only Abbott can call a special session. Forecaster 2 arrived at exactly my forecast of 18%, while Forecaster 3 landed at 15% - a very tight range indicating strong agreement on the fundamentals. No forecaster presented new information I hadn't considered. The slight variance between 15-18% appears to reflect minor differences in how we weight the Senate's strong passage (25-6) and Lt. Gov. Patrick's commitment against the structural barriers. Forecaster 3's slightly lower forecast may reflect a marginally more pessimistic view of the special session pathway, but the difference is minimal. This convergence actually increases my confidence that the analysis is sound and well-calibrated.",
    "rationale": "After reviewing the other forecasts, I find strong validation of my original reasoning. Two forecasters landed at 18% and one at 15%, indicating robust agreement. No new evidence or arguments were presented that would warrant adjusting my forecast. The convergence on 15-18% suggests this range accurately captures the probability given the evidence. The key factors remain: (1) House institutional opposition demonstrated through concrete actions, not mere rhetoric; (2) prohibitively short timeline of 12 days for reconciling fundamental chamber disagreements; (3) Governor Abbott's lack of public prioritization of this issue; (4) strong economic and political headwinds. The 18% forecast appropriately accounts for the Senate's decisive passage and Patrick's strong commitment while recognizing the multiple structural barriers to enactment. The pathway to Yes requires either an unlikely House reversal in 12 days or an uncertain special session that Abbott hasn't signaled he'll call. My confidence in the 18% forecast is strengthened by the independent convergence of expert opinion.",
