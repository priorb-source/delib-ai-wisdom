  "information": "In multiple public statements and interviews with news outlets such as the Financial Times and Yonhap in late April 2025, Han Duck-soo has consistently maintained that he 'has not yet decided' on a presidential run. His stated immediate priority is the US-South Korea trade negotiations scheduled for April 24. No visible campaign infrastructure or preparations for a presidential bid have been observed.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "About 13 days (until May 5, 2025)",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No — no announcement by May 5",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Han continues to say he is undecided, prioritizes near-term duties (e.g., the April 24 US–ROK trade talks), and delays any decision. PPP discussions continue, but any formal move occurs after May 5 (or he ultimately declines).",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Following the April 24 talks, PPP leaders coalesce around drafting him and set a fast nomination timetable. Han schedules a press event between late April and May 4, visible campaign staffing begins, and he formally declares before May 5.",
    "rationale": "Time is short and the status quo favors inaction. Per the research assistant, Han has repeatedly said he has not yet decided, is focused on the April 24 trade negotiations, and shows no visible campaign infrastructure. With roughly 13 days left, that combination points to a lower likelihood of a near-term announcement. In South Korea, formal candidate registration typically happens only a few weeks before election day, so even if a June election is looming, he does not need to announce before May 5 to remain viable. That reduces the incentive to commit in the next two weeks and supports the status quo outcome (No) receiving extra weight.\n\nWhy not higher: There is no observed campaign build-out, he is publicly noncommittal, and he has an immediate policy agenda that could justify continued delay. If he intends to run, he can credibly wait until after May 5 and still meet party/registration timelines, making a pre–May 5 announcement less necessary.\n\nWhy not lower: The reported uptick in PPP enthusiasm to draft him increases the chance of a rapid pivot, especially if party leaders judge that an early declaration is needed to consolidate support or preempt rivals. A post–April 24 window offers a plausible moment for a quick decision.\n\nWhat would move me up: Credible reports of (a) staff hires or a campaign office, (b) scheduling a major press conference or national address framed around ‘the future’ or ‘a new mandate,’ (c) PPP setting an accelerated nomination schedule that implicitly requires a declaration by early May, or (d) polling or events that make him the consensus standard-bearer.\n\nWhat would move me down: Continued ‘undecided’ statements into early May, lack of any campaign signals, PPP coalescing around another figure, or indications he intends to remain focused on governing rather than campaigning.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill Han Duck-soo announce his candidacy for South Korean president before May 5, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nThe Chosun Daily: [Support grows in PPP to draft Acting President Han for June election](https://www.koreaherald.com/article/10464554)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if Han Duck-soo announces his candidacy for president of South Korea before May 5, 2025. If no such announcement has been made before that date, the question resolves as **No**.\n\n\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nIn multiple public statements and interviews with news outlets such as the Financial Times and Yonhap in late April 2025, Han Duck-soo has consistently maintained that he 'has not yet decided' on a presidential run. His stated immediate priority is the US-South Korea trade negotiations scheduled for April 24. No visible campaign infrastructure or preparations for a presidential bid have been observed.\n\nToday is 2025-04-22.\n\nBefore answering you think:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n(e) You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
