    "review": "The other forecasters raise several compelling points. Forecaster 3 makes an excellent observation I overlooked: the article's discussion of 'exploring Addis Ababa's rich culture' and contemplating tourism suggests the current situation is far from Level 4 crisis conditions. This is strong evidence against imminent escalation. Forecaster 3 also correctly notes the Tigray conflict ended in 2022, implying some stabilization trend rather than deterioration. Both forecasters appropriately emphasize the rarity of Level 4 designations and rapid escalations. Forecaster 2's point about not knowing the current advisory level is valid uncertainty. However, I think Forecaster 3's 8% may be slightly overconfident given the explicit mention of 'new travel warnings in 2025,' which suggests some recent deterioration. My original 12% now seems slightly high in light of the tourism-viability argument, but not dramatically so.",
    "rationale": "After reviewing the other analyses, I'm modestly updating downward. The strongest new argument is that the article discusses tourism and cultural exploration as viable activities, which would be inconceivable if Ethiopia were near Level 4 status or trending sharply in that direction. This suggests current conditions are likely Level 2 or 3 with regional concerns rather than country-wide crisis. The Tigray conflict's 2022 conclusion also suggests some stabilization trend. However, I'm not dropping as low as 8% because: (1) the 'new travel warnings' language indicates ongoing or recently elevated concerns, (2) multiple security flashpoints exist in Ethiopia's regions, (3) while rare, 2-month escalations are possible, and (4) the Horn of Africa can experience rapid changes. The 8-15% range all forecasters occupy reflects appropriate uncertainty about a low-probability but not impossible event. I'm settling at 10% as a reasonable middle ground that acknowledges the tourism-viability evidence while maintaining appropriate caution about potential rapid deterioration.",
