  "information": "As of late May 2025, the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) publicly claims total estimated savings of approximately $175 billion on its official tracker website. This figure represents a series of increases throughout early 2025. In late February, the claimed savings were $55 billion, which grew to $115 billion by mid-March. The claimed savings have been attributed to the cancellation of over 25,000 federal contracts and grants. According to DOGE, the most significant savings have been achieved at the Department of Health and Human Services, the General Services Administration, and the Education Department.\n\nElon Musk, who led the DOGE initiative, has departed from his public-facing role but will remain an advisor. The project's work is transitioning to the White House Office of Management and Budget (OMB), under the direction of Russell Vought. The US Treasury Secretary has stated that several members of the DOGE team will be integrated into the Treasury to apply its cost-saving principles on a long-term basis. Both Musk and President Trump have publicly expressed confidence that savings will continue to grow, with Musk suggesting a long-term goal of $1 trillion.\n\nMultiple external analyses and news reports have questioned the accuracy of DOGE's savings claims. A report by watchdog group Open The Books found that only 42% of the terminated contracts and 27% of the grants cited by DOGE could be publicly tracked. Media investigations, including one by The New York Times, have alleged numerous errors in DOGE's accounting, such as double-counting, including contracts that had already expired, and taking credit for 'zombie contracts' that never existed. An estimate by The Atlantic suggested actual verified savings may only amount to $2 billion. Furthermore, a CNN analysis projected that the effort could ultimately cost the government $135 billion due to the expense of retraining and rehiring workers who were let go.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Approximately 1 month.",
    "status_quo_outcome": "The claimed savings figure will continue to increase at a pace similar to the last few months, narrowly surpassing the $200 billion threshold before the July 1, 2025 deadline due to strong political incentives.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Intense media and watchdog scrutiny over accounting methods, combined with bureaucratic friction from the transition to the Office of Management and Budget, causes the rate of new claimed savings to slow to a crawl. The total figure stagnates just below the $200 billion mark by the resolution date.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Driven by the political goal of reaching a significant milestone, the administration prioritizes and accelerates the identification of further cost-saving measures. The Department of Government Efficiency announces it has crossed the $200 billion threshold in late June, a figure which is then displayed on its official tracker website.",
    "rationale": "My forecast is based primarily on the powerful political incentives at play and the proximity to the target. As of late May 2025, the claimed savings stand at $175 billion, leaving a gap of only $25 billion to be closed in approximately one month. The rate of increase has slowed from its initial surge, with about $60 billion added over the last 2.5 months (an average of $24 billion per month). A simple extrapolation of this recent trend places the final figure very close to the $200 billion target, making the outcome highly sensitive to small variations in the reporting pace. However, the most critical factor is that the resolution depends on the *claimed* figure on the DOGE website, not on externally verified savings. The administration has a strong motivation to reach a round, headline-grabbing number like $200 billion to portray the initiative as a major success. Therefore, it is highly probable that the necessary push will be made to find and claim the remaining $25 billion. The external criticism regarding the accuracy of these claims, while noteworthy, is unlikely to prevent the administration from publishing its desired number. My probability is not higher because the demonstrated slowdown in claimed savings is real and could be exacerbated by the project's transition to the more procedurally-bound OMB, creating a non-trivial risk of falling short. My probability is not lower because the target is well within reach, and the political will to achieve it appears to be the dominant variable. I would increase my forecast if a significant new source of savings were announced in early June. I would decrease it if the claimed total remains static for several weeks or if officials announce a new, more rigorous and time-consuming validation process for claims.",
