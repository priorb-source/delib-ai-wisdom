    "review": "My initial forecast of 55% was higher than the other two forecasters, who both converged at 48%. The primary point of divergence was the conditional probability of Joe Pyfer winning the fight, assuming it happens. I had initially estimated this at 65%, while both other forecasters placed it in the 50-57% range. Their reasoning was quite convincing. They correctly emphasized that Kelvin Gastelum, despite a poor recent record, is an experienced, durable veteran who has consistently faced top-tier competition. This makes the fight far closer to a pick'em than the 'moderate favorite' status I had assigned to Pyfer. My initial analysis likely overweighted Pyfer's potential and momentum while underweighting Gastelum's proven toughness and experience. The consensus view that this is a very competitive matchup is a strong argument for lowering my win-probability estimate. Furthermore, Forecaster 3 made an excellent point about a draw or No Contest resolving as 'No', which is a small but valid factor that dampens the overall probability.",
    "rationale": "After reviewing the other forecasts, I am lowering my probability from 55% to 50%. The key driver for this change is a revised assessment of the fight's competitiveness. The other analysts persuaded me that my initial 65% conditional win probability for Pyfer was too high. While Pyfer has power and is on an upward trajectory, Kelvin Gastelum is a significant step up in terms of experience and durability. His history against the division's elite makes him a very dangerous and 'live' opponent. I now believe the fight is much closer to a 55/45 affair, not the 65/35 I initially envisioned.\n\nMy updated forecast is now based on two revised components:\n1.  **P(Fight Happens):** I am slightly adjusting my estimate from 85% to 88%. This aligns with the consensus range of 85-90% and reflects that major pay-per-view fights, while still subject to cancellation, are slightly more stable than average.\n2.  **P(Pyfer Wins | Fight Happens):** I am significantly reducing this from 65% to 57%. This new number reflects the consensus view that the fight is highly competitive and that Gastelum is a formidable and durable opponent.\n\nCombining these revised probabilities (0.88 * 0.57) results in a new forecast of approximately 50%. This 5-point reduction brings my forecast much closer to my colleagues' and represents a more balanced view of the risks involved, particularly the risk of Pyfer simply losing a competitive fight.",
