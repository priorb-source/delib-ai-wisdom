  "information": "As of mid-May 2025, the Colorado Rockies held a record of 8-38, equivalent to a .174 winning percentage. Their run differential was -128. The team's pitching staff ranked last in the league with a 5.80 ERA and a 1.599 WHIP. Offensively, they had the league's worst On-base Plus Slugging (OPS), the most strikeouts at 418, a low walk rate of 7.7%, and a low home run rate of 2.3%. The next-worst team in the league at the time, the Chicago White Sox, had a winning percentage approximately 112 points higher at .286.\n\nThe Rockies' 7-36 record through their first 43 games marked one of the worst starts in Major League Baseball's modern era. The team was on pace to finish the season with a 26-136 record, which would surpass the record for most losses in a season set by the 2024 Chicago White Sox (121 losses). Notable losses included a 21-0 defeat to the San Diego Padres, part of a three-game stretch where they allowed 55 runs, the most by any MLB team in a similar span since 1950. This followed seasons with 103 losses in 2023 and 101 in 2024. Pre-season PECOTA projections had forecast a .343 winning percentage for the Rockies in 2025.\n\nDuring the season, the Rockies' manager Bud Black was fired and replaced by Warren Schaeffer. Hitting coach Jordan Pacheco was also part of the new staff. On May 18, 2025, the team achieved a 14-12 comeback win against the Arizona Diamondbacks, which was their first victory under Schaeffer. A key contributor to this win was shortstop Ezequiel Tovar, who had recently returned from injury and went 5-for-5 with his first home run of the season. The team's upcoming schedule before June 15 included games against several high-performing teams.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "~27 days (through June 15, 2025)",
    "status_quo_outcome": "Yes — the Rockies remain in sole (or tied) last in MLB winning percentage when the standings are checked on/after June 15.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "The Rockies get unusually hot (e.g., go 15-10 or better over the next ~25 games), while at least one current bottom-tier team (e.g., White Sox, Marlins, Angels, A’s) suffers an extreme 25-game collapse (e.g., 0-25 to 3-22) that drops their cumulative winning percentage below Colorado’s by June 15. Alternatively, multiple teams inch down while Colorado rises enough to climb out of last, or a resolution quirk if ties were treated as not having “the lowest.”",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Colorado continues anything close to its current pace (or even improves modestly), and no other team posts a historically bad month. Given the current 100+ point gap in winning percentage, even a small Rockies rebound still leaves them last on June 15.",
    "rationale": "- Baseline: As of mid-May 2025, the Rockies are 8-38 (.174), with a run differential of -128 and league-worst pitching (5.80 ERA, 1.599 WHIP) and offense (worst OPS, most Ks, low BB% and HR%). The next-worst team is around .286 — a massive 112-point gap.\n- Time horizon: Roughly 25 games until June 15. Over that span, normal variance rarely overturns a gap this large in cumulative winning percentage.\n- Quick math: If Colorado goes 8-17, they’d be 16-55 (.225). For a team currently at ~.286 (e.g., 14-35) to finish below .225 by mid-June, they’d need roughly 0–2 wins in their next 25 games — an extremely low-probability event. Even if Colorado improves to ~.240–.260 overall by June 15, competitors would still need a historically awful month to drop below them.\n- Schedule/context: Rockies face several strong teams; a managerial change might offer a short-term bump, but roster/talent and underlying metrics point to sustained struggles. Preseason PECOTA (.343) suggests some regression up from .174, but not enough over a month to erase a 0.112 gap without an extreme opposing collapse.\n- Status-quo weighting: The current state (worst by far) plus a short time window strongly favors persistence. Baseball volatility exists, but the combination of a huge cushion and limited time makes a flip unlikely.\n- Why not higher: Baseball can be weird over 25 games; an injury-fueled collapse by another cellar team or a surprise Rockies heater could narrow the gap quickly. There’s also a small resolution/timing risk (e.g., day-of snapshot, tie interpretation), though ties typically still count as having the lowest.\n- What would move me: I would lower my probability if by early June the gap shrinks to within ~3 games due to a Rockies surge and/or a catastrophic slide by another bottom team, or if Colorado’s underlying indicators (run differential, rotation health, bullpen) markedly improve. I would raise my probability if the Rockies continue ~.200–.300 ball while closest competitors play ~.350+ and injuries/trades further weaken those competitors.",
