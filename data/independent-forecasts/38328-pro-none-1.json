    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "The outcome will be known by July 1, 2025, which is in 26 days.",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No. In the absence of specific events, Members of the European Parliament (MEPs) are expected to serve out their terms, and a resignation within a specific three-week window would be an exception to the norm.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Despite the ongoing Huawei lobbying scandal, no definitive evidence emerges that forces an implicated MEP to resign within the short timeframe. All MEPs continue their mandates through the resolution date of July 1, 2025.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Pressure from the Huawei lobbying scandal intensifies, leading at least one implicated MEP to announce their resignation to limit damage to their political party. Alternatively, an MEP resigns for unrelated personal or health reasons, or to accept a different post.",
    "rationale": "My forecast is based on the interplay between the low base rate of MEP resignations and the significant specific risk introduced by the ongoing Huawei lobbying scandal. The status quo favors a 'No' outcome. With 720 MEPs, resignations are infrequent, and the chance of a 'random' resignation for personal or health reasons in any given 22-day window is low, likely in the 25-30% range. However, this is not a random period. The active lobbying scandal, reported on May 21, provides a powerful and specific catalyst for a 'Yes' outcome. The question's timeframe, starting a few weeks after the story broke, is a critical window where political pressure often peaks, potentially forcing a resignation to control the political damage. The scandal significantly elevates the probability above the baseline. My forecast is not higher because politicians often attempt to ride out scandals, and the processes to formally remove them can take longer than the few weeks available. There is a substantial chance the situation remains unresolved by July 1. My forecast is not lower because that would underweight the combined probability of a scandal-driven resignation and a random resignation from a pool of 720 individuals. The scandal makes a resignation a plausible, slightly more-likely-than-not outcome. I would increase my probability if a specific MEP is formally named or if their party leadership calls for a resignation. I would decrease it if official investigations are announced with timelines extending well past July 1.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill any members of the European Parliament resign before July 1, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nEuro News: [Lobbying scandal related to Huawei: What we know so far](https://www.euronews.com/my-europe/2025/05/21/lobbying-scandal-related-to-huawei-what-we-know-so-far)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if a member of the European Parliament announces their resignation after June 9, 2025 and before July 1, 2025.\n\n\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nNo additional information available.\n\nToday is 2025-06-05.\n\nBefore answering you think:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n(e) You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
