    "review": "The other forecasters provided valuable counterarguments to my initial high degree of confidence. Forecaster 3's analysis was particularly compelling, highlighting two factors I had underweighted: the significant logistical challenges of organizing a 10,000+ person protest within a very short two-month window, and the potential for state deterrents like surveillance to suppress turnout. Forecaster 2 also correctly emphasized the short timeframe as a primary reason for caution. While I disagree with their specific concern about reporting lags from the Global Protest Tracker (as the resolution criteria hinges on the protest's *start date*, not the date of the report), their collective focus on the inherent uncertainties and frictions involved in mass mobilization was persuasive and provided a necessary check on my initial assessment.",
    "rationale": "After reviewing my peers' analyses, I have updated my forecast downward from 80% to 75%. The arguments raised by the other forecasters, particularly concerning the constraints of the short timeframe and the impact of state suppression, convinced me that my initial forecast was slightly overconfident. These factors introduce significant friction that could delay or diminish planned mobilizations, making a 'No' outcome more plausible than I had originally judged. However, I am not lowering my forecast further because I continue to place significant weight on the strong evidence for a 'Yes' outcome. The high base rate of large protests in India, coupled with multiple active and potent triggers like the land law controversy, creates a very favorable environment for unrest. Most importantly, the research assistant's report of a *planned* march by 10,000 farmers is a specific, concrete data point that directly aligns with the resolution criteria. My revised forecast of 75% better balances the high probability derived from these drivers against the real-world uncertainties and logistical hurdles pointed out by my colleagues.",
