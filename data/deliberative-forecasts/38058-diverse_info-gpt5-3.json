    "review": "New arguments I hadn’t explicitly weighed: (1) a specific July 9 EU-tariff deadline that could sustain salience through June, and (2) WSJ’s “What’s News” digest potentially carrying near-daily tariff mentions. Both push toward a lower Yes probability. However, I find the implied daily-omission rates behind 15%–30% too low. A 15% Yes over the remaining ~35 days implies only ~0.5% chance per day that both front pages omit “tariff(s),” and 30% implies ~1%—levels that seem implausibly low given normal topic rotation, synonym use (“duties,” “levies,” “trade measures”), and the finite space on front pages. The July 9 date increases relevance but doesn’t guarantee editors will use the exact word “tariff(s)” every single day. WSJ often recycles themes in “What’s News,” but typically when there’s a fresh development; absent one, they may use broader trade framing or omit entirely on some days. I’m persuaded to shade down modestly from my prior view due to the breadth of qualifying sections and the plausibility that WSJ’s digest sustains frequent mentions, but not to the 15%–30% range.",
    "rationale": "Setup: We need at least one day from now through June 30 where neither NYT’s Today’s Paper front page nor WSJ’s print-edition front page contains the exact word “tariff”/“tariffs.” With ~35 days left, even small per-day chances of simultaneous omission accumulate. My prior 65% implied about a 2.9% per-day both-omit probability; the 15%–30% forecasts imply just 0.5%–1.0% per day, which seems too low given: (a) editors’ tendency not to repeat identical framing without new developments; (b) use of substitutes like “duties/levies” that wouldn’t count; (c) competing major news (e.g., late-June Supreme Court decisions) that often dominate front pages; and (d) weekends/slow cycles. Downward pressures: the broad resolution (anywhere on the front page, including digests) and an active policy calendar (EU deadline July 9; implementation chatter; foreign responses) that can keep the term in play, particularly at WSJ. Net: I trim my probability to reflect WSJ’s likely higher baseline mention rate and ongoing salience, but still judge that at least one clean day across both outlets over ~five weeks is more likely than not.",
