    "review": "- Forecaster 2: Strong emphasis on bureaucratic inertia and the federal standard being broad is persuasive. The point that state waivers don’t justify changing federal guidance strengthens the Yes case. The main caveat they cite—a cosmetic wording tweak for optics—is real, but I think 95% is a bit overconfident given the nontrivial chance of an editorial change unrelated to formal policy.\n- Forecaster 3: Raises a new consideration (potential late-May USDA reorg) that could increase website churn risk. That’s a plausible pathway to a wording or layout change that drops the exact phrase even without policy change. However, their “what would move” section seems internally inverted. Importantly, they also note that even if reforms advance, the page could retain the phrase with clarifications—this supports a higher probability for Yes.\nNet: I buy F2’s inertia argument and F3’s note that the phrase could persist even amid changes. I discount F3’s lower forecast as too pessimistic for a 6-week window. I modestly tick up my forecast, but not to F2’s level, to account for residual editorial/optics and reorg risks.",
    "rationale": "- Status quo: The page explicitly lists “snack foods.” Historically stable phrasing; federal eligibility remains broad (“any food … for human consumption”).\n- Path to No: Fast, non-substantive web edit that replaces “snack foods” with a synonym or reworks the examples list; site restructure tied to a reorg; or optics-driven content tweak. These require no rulemaking and could happen quickly, but agencies typically avoid edits that could be construed as misleading.\n- Path to Yes: No action; or even with announced reforms, the page keeps the exact phrase while adding caveats/links to forthcoming changes.\n- Process/timing: True policy change by July 1 is highly unlikely due to rulemaking/legislative timelines. The only meaningful risk window is a cosmetic wording or page restructure. With ~6 weeks left, that risk is present but not large.\n- Update vs prior: Forecaster 3’s reorg point increases churn risk slightly; Forecaster 2’s waiver/federal-standard point reduces my concern that national guidance would be altered quickly. Net effect: small upward adjustment from my prior 88% to reflect the likelihood the exact phrase persists even amid any near-term announcements, while still reserving ~10% for editorial/optics/reorg changes.",
