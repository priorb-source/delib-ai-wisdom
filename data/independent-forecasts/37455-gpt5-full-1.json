  "information": "On April 14, 2025, the Lesotho Communications Authority (LCA) granted Starlink Lesotho a 10-year license to operate a satellite network and provide broadband services nationwide. Starlink Lesotho Pty Ltd, owned by Starlink Holdings Netherlands B.V., had submitted its application on January 24, 2025. The LCA had previously rejected a request from Starlink due to concerns over the company's lack of local ownership. The approval followed the imposition of a 50% US tariff on Lesotho in early April 2025. No official timeline for the service launch was provided at the time of the license grant.\n\nStarlink's service rollout timelines in other African nations have varied. In the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC), a license was granted around May 3-5, 2025, and service availability was announced by May 5, with the launch expected within days. The company also received a license from Somalia in April 2025. However, Starlink has faced regulatory challenges in other countries; it lacks a full operating license in South Africa, and authorities in Zimbabwe have asked the company to disconnect kits operating illegally in the country.\n\nStarlink's parent company, SpaceX, has a regional partnership with Airtel Africa to provide high-speed internet services to its customers across the continent. Geographically, Lesotho is a landlocked country, entirely surrounded by South Africa, where Starlink is not yet licensed to operate. The country has a small area of approximately 30,355 km² and is characterized by mountainous terrain.",

    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "About 54 days (until June 30, 2025 local time)",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No — the Starlink map currently does not show Lesotho as Available, and absent a change it will remain Coming Soon by July 1.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Post-licensing operational steps (local entity setup, taxation/VAT, import/logistics, distributor arrangements) take longer than expected, or Starlink deprioritizes a small market. Concern about spillover use in unlicensed South Africa leads to extra geofencing/compliance work, pushing activation past July.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Starlink flips Lesotho cells to Available in late May or June, using ISL backhaul and either direct shipping to Maseru or a regional partner (e.g., Airtel Africa). The availability map updates countrywide or in parts, satisfying the criterion before July 1.",
    "rationale": "Lesotho’s regulator granted Starlink a 10-year license on April 14, 2025. In some recent African cases (e.g., DRC, licensed ~May 3–5 and announced available by May 5), Starlink has moved from license to availability within days, suggesting the technical and regulatory pipeline can be fast. Starlink’s global ISL capability reduces dependence on nearby ground stations, lowering technical barriers to activation in landlocked Lesotho. Geofencing precision has been demonstrated elsewhere, so enabling Lesotho without enabling South Africa is feasible.\n\nCountervailing factors: Lesotho is a small market and is fully surrounded by South Africa, where Starlink remains unlicensed and has faced clampdowns in neighboring Zimbabwe. Starlink may be cautious about cross-border misuse and may need to finalize local compliance, taxation, payments, and distribution before flipping the map. Some African markets historically took months from license to availability (e.g., early 2023 rollouts), though Starlink appears to have accelerated timelines in 2024–2025. It has already been over three weeks since Lesotho’s license, which slightly tempers the immediate-launch precedent from DRC.\n\nSummary of assistant-provided info influencing this forecast: (1) License granted Apr 14 with no timeline. (2) Very fast activation in DRC after licensing. (3) Somalia licensed in April. (4) Regulatory frictions in South Africa and Zimbabwe. (5) Airtel Africa partnership exists. (6) Lesotho’s geography (enclave within SA) could complicate logistics but doesn’t preclude service.\n\nWhy not higher: No official Starlink timeline or teaser yet; small market prioritization risk; potential administrative and customs steps could take >6 weeks; care to avoid enabling SA users may slow activation.\n\nWhy not lower: The key regulatory hurdle (license) is cleared; recent precedent (DRC) shows rapid activation is possible; Starlink’s ISL and geofencing reduce technical blockers; 54 days remain—ample time for a map flip even if operational setup takes several weeks.\n\nWhat would move me up: Starlink or LCA communications hinting at imminent launch; Starlink store adding Lesotho to the country selector or pricing pages; sightings of Lesotho cells turning from Coming Soon to Available on the map; local distributor announcements or Airtel Africa activation notes.\n\nWhat would move me down: Signals of additional regulatory conditions, taxation or spectrum coordination delays; South Africa regulator actions that cause Starlink to delay Lesotho; lack of any progress signals by mid-June.",

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
