    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "42 days (from May 20, 2025 to July 1, 2025)",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No - historically, .400 batting averages decline as sample sizes increase throughout the season",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "All players currently batting near .400 experience regression to the mean as their at-bat totals increase from ~200 in May to ~350 by July 1. Even elite hitters go through slumps, and the statistical likelihood of maintaining such an extreme batting average decreases significantly with each additional at-bat. By July 1, all MLB players have batting averages below .400.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "An elite hitter like Aaron Judge or another superstar maintains an exceptional hot streak through May and June. With approximately 300-350 at-bats by July 1, they sustain a .400 or higher average through a combination of skill, favorable matchups, and some statistical luck. Alternatively, multiple players stay hot enough that at least one crosses the threshold on that specific date.",
    "rationale": "Historical precedent strongly suggests that .400 batting averages are extremely rare past the first few weeks of the season. Ted Williams was the last player to finish a season above .400 in 1941. While it's not uncommon for players to exceed .400 in April or early May when sample sizes are small (100-150 at-bats), maintaining this through July 1 with 300-350 at-bats is substantially more difficult due to regression to the mean. The article reference about Judge having a .400 average suggests this was noteworthy, likely occurring early in a season. By July 1, players will have accumulated enough plate appearances that statistical variance becomes less dominant and true talent levels emerge. However, July 1 is still relatively early in the season (pre-All-Star break), so there's a non-trivial chance that at least one exceptional hitter could maintain .400. My forecast is not higher because: (1) historical data shows this is rare even by early July, (2) regression to the mean is a powerful force, and (3) even the best modern hitters typically bat .300-.350. My forecast is not lower because: (1) we're only ~6 weeks from the evaluation date, (2) multiple players could be candidates, increasing overall probability, and (3) exceptional short-term performances do occur. I would update higher if I had current data showing multiple players already at .400+ in mid-May. I would update lower if data showed no players currently above .380.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill any major league baseball player have a .400 batting average on July 1, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\ntheScore: [How long can Judge's .400 batting average last?](https://www.thescore.com/mlb/news/3284701/how-long-can-judges-400-batting-average-last)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if on July 1, 2025, any Major League Baseball player in the 2025 regular season has a batting average of greater than or equal to .400 according to the [ESPN baseball stats page](https://www.espn.com/mlb/stats)\n\n\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nNo additional information available.\n\nToday is 2025-05-20.\n\nBefore answering you think:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n(e) You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
