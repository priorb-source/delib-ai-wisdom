    "review": "Both forecasters largely agree with the core logic: the Rockies’ starting gap (~.112 in win%) plus a short window (~23–27 games) makes a flip highly unlikely. Forecaster 2’s threshold math is crisp and helpful: even if Colorado improves modestly (e.g., 8–17 to .225 overall), a competitor would need a near-historic 0–2 wins in ~25 games to fall below them by the check date. That’s a strong argument for a very high Yes. Forecaster 3 adds useful caution on MLB volatility and the possibility of a Rockies hot streak plus a competitor freefall (e.g., 5–20), as well as a note about tie-handling. The tie point is the only new potential resolution wrinkle, but the wording (“have the lowest winning percentage”) generally includes ties, reducing that concern. Overall, F2’s quantitative thresholds strengthen the case for a higher probability; F3’s caution is reasonable but seems overweighted at 85% given the size of the current gap and the short runway.",
    "rationale": "Core update: The threshold framing clarifies how extreme a competitor’s collapse must be for a No outcome, given plausible Rockies performance. Using the White Sox example (~14–35, .286) and a 25-game window: \n- If COL goes 8–17, they’re 16–55 (.225). For a competitor to finish below .225 over 74 games: (14 + y)/74 < .225 ⇒ y ≤ 2 wins in 25 games (≤2–23). That’s extraordinarily unlikely.\n- If COL goes 10–15 (.400), they’d be 18–53 (.254). For a competitor to finish below .254: (14 + y)/74 < .254 ⇒ y ≤ 4 wins (≤4–21). Still a very low-probability tail.\nGiven Colorado’s underlying performance (worst pitching/hitting metrics, -128 RD) and a tough slate, their most likely range by June 15 keeps them at or near the bottom. The only realistic path to No requires a simultaneous Rockies uptick and a competitor’s extreme freefall. Tie-handling likely counts ties as “having the lowest,” so resolution risk from ties is small. Timing-of-snapshot risk exists but is minor. \nNet effect: Forecaster 2’s thresholds modestly increase confidence relative to my prior 92%. I nudge up to reflect how extreme the rival collapse must be, while retaining a small allowance for MLB volatility and snapshot/tie noise.",
