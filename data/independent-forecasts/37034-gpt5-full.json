  "information": "According to Baker Hughes data from mid-April 2025, the total number of active drilling rigs in the U.S. rose by 2 to 585. This followed a 7-rig dip in the prior week. The count of oil rigs rose by 1 to 481, and gas rigs also increased by 1 to 98. The total rig count is down by 34 compared to the same period in the previous year. Drilling activity in the Permian basin was steady at 289 rigs, which is 29 fewer than the previous year. The Frac Spread Count, which estimates the number of crews completing wells, fell by 10 to 195.\n\nAs of late April 2025, West Texas Intermediate (WTI) oil prices were around $64-$65 per barrel, after the American Petroleum Institute reported a decrease of 4.565 million barrels in U.S. crude oil inventories for the week ending April 18. This price is near the breakeven point for many drilling operations, which is estimated to be around $65 per barrel. A Dallas Fed survey of 130 energy firms in Texas, New Mexico, and Louisiana indicated that firms are dealing with increased costs, reduced rig counts, and layoffs. The survey's company outlook index decreased by 12 points, while the outlook uncertainty index increased by 21 points, with executives citing tariffs on steel (25%) as increasing costs for casing and tubing.\n\nSeveral major energy and service companies reported on their performance in Q1 2025. Halliburton reported declining profits in North America due to decreased drilling activity. Baker Hughes' oilfield services division saw a 10% sequential drop in revenue. In contrast, Occidental Petroleum announced a capital expenditures plan of $7 billion to $7.2 billion for 2025, with $3.7 billion allocated to the Permian Basin. The company plans to operate 24 gross drilling rigs and bring 500 to 550 new wells online in the Permian during the year.",

    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "About 37 days (roughly 5 weeks and 2 days) until the May 30, 2025 Baker Hughes report.",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No. The latest reported U.S. total is ~585; if activity simply holds around current levels, the count stays at or above 583.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "WTI firms to ~$70+ and sentiment stabilizes; oil rigs hold near ~480 or tick up, gas rigs stop falling as prices/hedges improve; Permian activity steady; weekly noise keeps the total ≥583 by May 30.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "WTI remains near/below mid-$60s and gas remains weak; gas-focused basins (e.g., Haynesville) cut a few more rigs and oil adds small reductions; the total drifts down a net 3–8 rigs over the next six weeks, landing <583.",
    "rationale": "Starting point: mid-April Baker Hughes shows 585 total U.S. rigs (oil 481, gas 98), down 34 y/y. That’s just 2 rigs above the threshold, so only a small net decline is needed for a Yes. Near-term signals lean mildly soft: WTI ~$64–65 (near breakeven for many), a 10-crew drop in the frac spread count to 195, weaker North America results at Halliburton and Baker Hughes, and a negative Dallas Fed energy survey citing cost pressures. These support a gradual down-drift. Countervailing factors include capital discipline that keeps activity relatively stable, offshore/inland waters being steady, and plans like Occidental’s (24 Permian rigs) that anchor some baseline. Weekly rig changes are noisy (often ±3–7), and six reports remain. A simple trajectory from 585 with a modest expected decline of ~0.5–1 rig per week implies an end-May expectation around 580–583, with substantial uncertainty. That yields a slight edge to landing below 583 but not by much. Why not higher: recent softness (WTI near $65, frac spreads down, survey weakness) and ongoing y/y decline suggest a small downward bias. Why not lower: the threshold is very close, U.S. oil activity can hold steady if prices firm, and a single weekly uptick could keep the count ≥583. What would move me up (toward Yes): continued drops in frac spreads, further gas price weakness or shut-ins in gas basins, or WTI slipping below ~$62 for multiple weeks. What would move me down (toward No): a sustained WTI rally above ~$70, explicit operator guidance of near-term rig additions, or a stabilization/uptick in gas rigs as prices/hedging improve.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill the number of active US drilling rigs be less than 583 for the week ending May 30, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nSeekingAlpha: [U.S. rig count falls for third straight week, Baker Hughes says](https://seekingalpha.com/news/4430543-u-s-rig-count-falls-for-third-straight-week-baker-hughes-says)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if the last count of active US drilling rigs for the week ending May 30, 2025, according to the [Baker Hughes North America Rig Count](https://rigcount.bakerhughes.com/na-rig-count), is less than 583. Specifically, it will resolve based on the number listed as the United States Total for the most recent week in the May 30, 2025 North America Rig Count Report. This is the number of active drilling rigs and includes the total of those classified as gas, oil and miscellaneous, in every US location including inland waters, land and offshore.\n\nIf no report dated May 30, 2025, is released before June 1, 2025, Eastern Time, Metaculus may resolve this question using the most recent report available dated between May 23, 2025, and June 1, 2025, inclusive.

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
