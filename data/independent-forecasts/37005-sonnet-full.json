  "information": "According to the 338Canada statistical model, the Liberal Party is projected to win between 188 and 196 seats. National polling data indicates Liberal support is at 40-45%, compared to 37-38% for the Conservative Party. Polls also show strong performance for the Liberals in Ontario and Quebec, which together account for 199 of the 338 seats in Parliament.\n\nHistorical results show the Liberal Party won 160 seats in the 2021 federal election and 157 seats in the 2019 federal election. The last time the Liberal Party won a majority government was in the 2015 election, when they secured 184 seats.\n\nIn Canada's 338-seat House of Commons, 170 seats are required for a majority government. The analysis was conducted with 8 days remaining before the election resolution date. At that time, advance voting was underway, with reports indicating a 36% increase in turnout compared to the 2021 election.",

    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Approximately 1 week or less until election day, based on advance voting being underway",
    "status_quo_outcome": "Yes - the Liberal Party wins 172 or more seats",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "The Liberals fall short of 172 seats due to systematic polling errors underestimating Conservative support, unexpected late swing in voter sentiment, or poor seat efficiency where Liberal votes don't translate effectively into seat wins despite decent vote share",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "The current polling and 338Canada projections hold through election day, with the Liberals maintaining their 40-45% support and strong performance in Ontario and Quebec, resulting in the projected 188-196 seats",
    "rationale": "The 338Canada statistical model projects the Liberal Party to win between 188-196 seats, which provides a substantial 16-24 seat buffer above the 172-seat threshold. National polling shows Liberals at 40-45% versus Conservatives at 37-38%, and the Liberals are performing strongly in Ontario and Quebec which together represent 199 of 338 total seats. With only days remaining until the election and advance voting already underway, there is limited time for dramatic shifts in voter sentiment. As a good forecaster, I weight the status quo heavily - all current indicators point to a Liberal victory exceeding 172 seats. However, I'm not forecasting higher than 78% because: (1) polling can have systematic errors as we've seen in previous elections, (2) statistical models have inherent uncertainty even when well-constructed, (3) the 36% increase in advance voting turnout suggests unusual voter engagement that could signal unexpected dynamics, and (4) historical precedent shows the Liberals won 160 and 157 seats in the previous two elections, so 172+ would represent improvement that isn't guaranteed. I'm not forecasting lower because the projected range is comfortably above the threshold, multiple data sources align, and there's insufficient time for major campaign shifts. I would update upward with exit polls showing Liberal strength or downward with late polling showing Conservative momentum or evidence of regional swings away from Liberals in key provinces",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill the Liberal Party win 172 or more seats in the 2025 Canadian federal election?\n\nQuestion background:\n[338Canada Federal Projection](https://338canada.com/federal.htm): \"The 338Canada project is a statistical model of electoral projections based on opinion polls, electoral history, and demographic data. This web site is a creation of Philippe J. Fournier, physics and astrophysics professor at Cégep de Saint-Laurent in Montreal.\"\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if the Liberal Party of Canada wins greater than or equal to 172 seats in the [2025 Canadian federal election](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2025_Canadian_federal_election).\n\n\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nAccording to the 338Canada statistical model, the Liberal Party is projected to win between 188 and 196 seats.

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
