    "review": "The deliberation revealed a critical new piece of information I had missed: a 10% US tariff on bananas effective April 5, 2025, as highlighted by Forecaster 3. This is a much stronger and more direct piece of evidence for upward price pressure than the general cost increases in my initial analysis. Forecaster 2's analysis was also valuable, providing the specific March 2025 BLS data point of $0.625/lb. This establishes that the price is extremely close to the threshold, making the outcome highly sensitive to small changes. Forecaster 2 argues that inertia and the proximity to the deadline favor a 'Yes' outcome, as prices were below the threshold in March and tend to move slowly. However, I find Forecaster 3's reasoning more compelling because a new tariff is precisely the kind of shock event that can break a historical trend. The central question becomes the speed and magnitude of the tariff's pass-through to retail prices. Given the tariff was in place for the entirety of April and May, it is highly probable that at least some of this cost increase, even just a fraction of a cent, would be reflected in the May average.",
    "rationale": "I am updating my forecast downward, from 35% to 25%. My initial reasoning correctly identified upward cost pressures but lacked the specific, high-impact catalyst provided by Forecaster 3's information about the new 10% tariff. This tariff, implemented in April 2025, creates a strong, direct causal mechanism for a price increase in May. While Forecaster 2 correctly notes the starting price in March ($0.625) is below the threshold and that prices are historically stable, a new tariff is an external shock that makes simple trend extrapolation less reliable. The price only needs to increase by $0.005 to flip the outcome to 'No'. A 10% tariff on wholesale prices, even with only partial and delayed pass-through due to bananas' role as a 'loss leader', makes a half-cent increase at the retail level seem more likely than not. I am not lowering my forecast further because the pass-through effect is uncertain and could be delayed or absorbed by retailers, which remains the most plausible scenario for a 'Yes' outcome. However, the tariff significantly strengthens the case for 'No'.",
