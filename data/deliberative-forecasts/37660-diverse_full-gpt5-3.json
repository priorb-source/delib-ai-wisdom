    "review": "Both forecasters largely align with my priors: licensing/tariffs and TRCSL’s earlier optimism are positives, but the lawful-intercept hold and missed April target are meaningful negatives. Forecaster 2’s 40% feels balanced: acknowledges a plausible quick flip if a political decision is made, but weights the execution risk and short time left. Forecaster 3 adds emphasis that LI/security negotiations often overrun and that “preliminary” status in late March is a bearish signal; they also flag the dashboard delay. I agree with these points, though 30% seems a bit low given license, tariff approval, and regional momentum (e.g., Bangladesh) that suggests Starlink has a template for compliance in South Asia. Neither introduces new hard evidence, but they sharpen the negative signal from the slipped April timeline and the likely pace of security sign-offs.",
    "rationale": "Key facts remain: (1) Sri Lanka granted a license and approved tariffs; (2) TRCSL expected operations in April pending a dashboard/monitoring system; (3) a government hold requires lawful-intercept assurances, with talks marked as preliminary in late March; (4) it’s now mid-May with no go-live. The missed April expectation is a clear negative update, and LI/dashboard integrations often take longer than anticipated, especially with defense ministries involved. Against that, the remaining ~6 weeks leaves room for a quick switch to Available if an agreement is finalized, and Bangladesh’s rapid progress indicates Starlink can satisfy similar regional requirements relatively quickly. Weighing these, the status quo still leans No, but the probability of a late-breaking clearance isn’t trivial. I’m nudging down slightly from my prior to reflect the mounting time pressure and the lack of any reported breakthrough since March, while still keeping a meaningful upside if a political decision resolves LI terms swiftly.",
