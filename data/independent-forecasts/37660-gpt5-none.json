    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "~45 days (until end of June 30, 2025, local time)",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Despite the 2024 license, Starlink’s site keeps Sri Lanka as Coming Soon through June due to remaining operational steps: terminal import/type approvals, billing/tax setup, local partner/distribution, or final regulatory clearances (e.g., spectrum/landing-rights conditions, security sign‑offs). Website and service activation slip into July or later.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Starlink flips Sri Lanka to Available on at least one product tier (e.g., Standard/Priority fixed or Mobile Regional) following a soft launch or enterprise rollout in/around Colombo, after completing compliance and logistics. The availability map updates accordingly before July 1.",
    "rationale": "- Timing: There are roughly 45 days left. As of today the criterion is not yet met, so the status quo points to No unless a specific activation occurs soon.\n- Regulatory baseline: Reuters reported Sri Lanka granted a Starlink license in Aug 2024. That materially reduces barriers versus countries without approvals. However, licenses often precede commercial availability by months as Starlink finalizes device approvals, taxation/billing, import logistics, and sometimes local gateways/landing permissions—even with laser backhaul.\n- Track record: In some markets (e.g., Indonesia) availability followed licensing relatively quickly; in others (e.g., India), approvals and commercial launch have been protracted. Sri Lanka is smaller and seemingly supportive, but the lag from Aug 2024 to mid‑May 2025 without the map showing availability suggests remaining hurdles.\n- Short window: With only ~1.5 months left, any slip in operational readiness easily pushes past July 1. Conversely, once ready, Starlink can flip a country to Available with a simple website change, so a late‑June activation is plausible.\n- Why not higher: It has been ~9–10 months since licensing with no visible map change; that persistence suggests unresolved steps. The short remaining window and tendency for last‑mile regulatory/logistics issues in South Asia keep odds below 50%.\n- Why not lower: A license already exists, reducing the risk of outright prohibition. Starlink often batches website/map updates; a limited or enterprise-first activation could qualify the map as “Available” in at least part of Sri Lanka. Only a small operational push is needed.\n- What would move me up: Evidence of preorders/shipping to Sri Lankan addresses; TRCSL or Starlink announcements of service commencement; third‑party reports of active terminals in Sri Lanka; Sri Lanka appearing in Starlink’s country dropdowns/pricing; map toggles (e.g., Mobile/Regional) turning Available in neighboring markets with similar status.\n- What would move me down: Reports of new restrictions, import/type‑approval delays for user terminals, currency/billing roadblocks, or Starlink deprioritizing South Asian rollouts this quarter.\n- Research assistant: No extra information provided beyond the prior Reuters licensing report; hence, I lean on general rollout patterns and the current (not yet met) criterion state.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill Starlink's website show Sri Lanka as a country with Starlink availability before July 1, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nReuters: [Musk's Starlink wins Sri Lanka licence](https://www.reuters.com/business/media-telecom/sri-lanka-regulator-grants-licence-musks-starlink-satellite-broadband-2024-08-13/)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if, before July 1, 2025, the [Starlink Availability Map](https://www.starlink.com/us/map) has anywhere in Sri Lanka listed as \"Available.\"\n\n\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nNo additional information available.\n\nToday is 2025-05-16.\n\nBefore answering you think:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n(e) You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
