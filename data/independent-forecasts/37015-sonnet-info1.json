  "information": "Han Duck-soo is required by law to resign from his post as acting president by May 4, 2025, to be eligible for the presidential election. He has already missed the April 15 deadline to register for the People Power Party (PPP) primary. Consequently, PPP leadership has publicly stated he will not be included in their primary process. South Korean constitutional norms and historical precedent discourage caretaker heads of state from running for office.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "13 days until May 5, 2025",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No announcement. Han Duck-soo continues as acting president without declaring candidacy",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Han Duck-soo remains in his role as acting president through May 4, respecting constitutional norms and the PPP's decision to exclude him from their primary. He does not announce an independent candidacy, and the deadline passes without any declaration",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Despite missing the PPP primary deadline and party opposition, Han Duck-soo decides to announce his candidacy as an independent candidate before May 5. He would need to resign from his acting president role by May 4 to meet legal eligibility requirements, then make a formal announcement",
    "rationale": "The evidence strongly suggests Han will not announce his candidacy. First, he has already missed the critical April 15 deadline for PPP primary registration, and party leadership has explicitly stated he will not be included. This closes the most natural pathway to candidacy. Second, he faces a legal requirement to resign by May 4 to be eligible, creating a very tight 13-day window. Third, South Korean constitutional norms and historical precedent discourage caretaker heads of state from seeking office - a significant cultural and political barrier. Fourth, with only 13 days remaining, there has been no indication of preparation for such an announcement. The Chosun Daily article mentions growing support, but support and actual candidacy are very different things. Political momentum typically builds over weeks or months, not days. My forecast is not higher because all structural barriers point toward no announcement: missed deadlines, party opposition, constitutional norms, and time constraints. My forecast is not lower (not near 0%) because politics can move rapidly in crisis situations, and the article suggests some political faction desires his candidacy. For me to update higher, I would need to see: Han resigning from acting president role, public statements from Han about considering candidacy, or clear legal pathways emerging for independent candidacy. For me to update lower, I would need confirmation that Han definitively rules out running or time simply running out without movement",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill Han Duck-soo announce his candidacy for South Korean president before May 5, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nThe Chosun Daily: [Support grows in PPP to draft Acting President Han for June election](https://www.koreaherald.com/article/10464554)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if Han Duck-soo announces his candidacy for president of South Korea before May 5, 2025. If no such announcement has been made before that date, the question resolves as **No**.\n\n\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nHan Duck-soo is required by law to resign from his post as acting president by May 4, 2025, to be eligible for the presidential election. He has already missed the April 15 deadline to register for the People Power Party (PPP) primary. Consequently, PPP leadership has publicly stated he will not be included in their primary process. South Korean constitutional norms and historical precedent discourage caretaker heads of state from running for office.\n\nToday is 2025-04-22.\n\nBefore answering you think:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n(e) You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
