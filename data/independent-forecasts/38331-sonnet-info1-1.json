  "information": "In May 2025, Pakistan restored access to X (formerly Twitter) after a 15-month ban that was first enforced in February 2024. Internet monitoring organization NetBlocks confirmed that access was restored, allowing citizens to use the platform without a VPN. In a separate development, X blocked access to 126 accounts in Turkey in February 2025 following a court order citing the need for 'protection of national security and public order.' The blocked accounts included those of journalists and activists. In April 2025, a court in Ankara issued further access block decisions for several popular Turkish news accounts on the platform.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Approximately 26 days until the resolution date of July 1, 2025",
    "status_quo_outcome": "Yes - all seven countries (China, Iran, Myanmar, North Korea, Russia, Turkmenistan, and Venezuela) continue to be listed on Wikipedia as currently blocking X",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "At least one of the seven countries lifts its ban on X and Wikipedia updates its page to reflect this change before July 1, 2025. The most likely candidates for this would be Venezuela or Myanmar due to their relatively more volatile political situations compared to the other five countries.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "All seven countries maintain their existing blocks on X through the end of June 2025, and Wikipedia continues to list all of them under the 'current' blocking section. No policy changes occur in the remaining 26 days, which is highly probable given these are established authoritarian regimes with long-standing censorship policies.",
    "rationale": "The status quo strongly favors a Yes outcome for several compelling reasons. First, the timeframe is extremely short - only 26 days remain until resolution. Policy changes regarding internet censorship in authoritarian regimes typically do not occur on such short timescales, as demonstrated by the research assistant's example of Pakistan taking 15 months to reverse its ban. Second, the nature of the countries in question supports the status quo: China, North Korea, Iran, and Turkmenistan operate some of the world's most restrictive internet censorship regimes and have blocked Twitter/X for years with no indication of policy shifts. Russia blocked X as part of its broader information control following the Ukraine invasion and shows no signs of reversing course given ongoing geopolitical tensions. Myanmar's military junta maintains blocks on social media platforms. Venezuela, while politically volatile, has maintained its block and is unlikely to change policy in such a short window. The research assistant's information about Pakistan and Turkey, while interesting, does not affect this forecast as neither country is in the resolution criteria. For a No outcome, we would need: (1) at least one country to lift its ban, AND (2) Wikipedia to update its page to reflect this change - both within 26 days. This double requirement further favors the status quo. I'm not forecasting higher (closer to 99%) because there remains some small uncertainty: Venezuela or Myanmar could make unexpected quick policy shifts, Wikipedia could have edit wars or errors, or there's always tail risk of unexpected events. I'm not forecasting lower because the extremely short timeframe, the entrenched nature of these blocks, the lack of any current signals suggesting policy changes, and the historical stickiness of these decisions all point strongly toward continuation of the status quo. I would update my forecast higher if governments issued explicit statements affirming continued blocks, or lower if there were news of any country considering lifting restrictions or significant political changes in Myanmar or Venezuela.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nAt the end of June 2025, will Wikipedia still list all these countries as \"currently\" blocking access to X (formerly Twitter)?\n\nQuestion background:\nAccording to the resolution source, \"Censorship of Twitter refers to Internet censorship by governments that block access to Twitter (officially known as X since July 2023). Twitter censorship also includes governmental notice and take down requests to Twitter, which it enforces in accordance with its Terms of Service when a government or authority submits a valid removal request to Twitter indicating that specific content published on the platform is illegal in their jurisdiction.\"\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if Wikipedia still lists X (formerly known as Twitter) as currently blocked in China, Iran, Myanmar, North Korea, Russia, Turkmenistan and Venezuela at [this link](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Censorship_of_Twitter#Current) when accessed by Metaculus on or after July 1, 2025. If the Wikipedia article does not list X as currently being blocked in any of those countries, this question resolves as **No**.\n\nThe question will resolve as soon as the page is accessed by Metaculus Admins on the resolution date. However, if there are issues accessing the page, then resolution will wait up to July 7, 2025, at which point if Metaculus has still not been able to access the resolution source, this question will be **annulled**. Admins will also use their discretion if there appears to be an [edit war](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Edit_warring) or lack of Wikipedia [consensus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Consensus) and may annul the question in such a case; however, Admins will also strive to resolve the question as definitively Yes or No, and such an edge case should be considered a rare outcome.\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nIn May 2025, Pakistan restored access to X (formerly Twitter) after a 15-month ban that was first enforced in February 2024.

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
