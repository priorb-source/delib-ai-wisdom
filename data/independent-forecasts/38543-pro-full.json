  "information": "Following a phone call between the two leaders, Donald Trump stated that Xi Jinping had invited him to visit China, an invitation he accepted. Trump also extended a reciprocal invitation for Xi to visit the US. On June 11, 2025, Trump posted on social media that he and Xi had agreed to meet in person, with the date and location to be announced later. The official statement from the Chinese government mentioned that Trump was invited to visit China but did not mention Xi accepting an invitation to visit the US. In March 2025, Trump had announced that Xi would visit Washington in the 'not too distant future,' without specifying a date.\n\nUS-China trade talks resumed in London on June 9, 2025, with a US delegation that included the Treasury Secretary, Commerce Secretary, and Trade Representative. On June 11, Trump announced that a US-China trade agreement was finalized. Chinese officials characterized the outcome as a 'framework agreement.' A White House official stated that the agreement, which is subject to final approval from both leaders, allows the US to impose a 55% tariff on Chinese imports, while China would impose a 10% tariff on US imports. A 90-day pause on tariffs is set to expire on July 9, 2025, with new tariffs scheduled to take effect on July 8.\n\nDonald Trump's confirmed upcoming international travel includes the G7 Summit in Canada from June 16-18, 2025, and the NATO Summit in the Netherlands from June 24-25, 2025. Chinese President Xi Jinping is scheduled to be in Central Asia for a summit in Kazakhstan from June 16-18, 2025. Historically, US presidential visits to China involve extensive logistical and security preparations, typically beginning weeks or months in advance. As of mid-June 2025, there have been no public reports of advance teams being dispatched or security preparations being made for a potential visit by Trump to China.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "15 days. The question resolves on July 1, 2025.",
    "status_quo_outcome": "Donald Trump does not visit China before the deadline. Presidential visits of this nature require extensive advance planning, and with no preparations publicly underway and a very short timeframe, the default outcome is that the visit will not occur.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Logistical and scheduling constraints prevent the visit. Donald Trump's confirmed attendance at the G7 and NATO summits, combined with the weeks of security and diplomatic preparations typically required for a presidential visit to China, prove insurmountable in the 15-day window. Both leaders opt to finalize the trade deal through diplomatic channels before scheduling a visit later in the year.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Driven by a desire to personally sign the newly announced trade agreement before the July 9 tariff deadline, Donald Trump makes a surprise, short-notice visit to China. The trip is hastily arranged to take place immediately following the NATO summit in the Netherlands (June 24-25), with Trump flying directly to Beijing for a brief meeting and signing ceremony before the July 1 deadline.",
    "rationale": "My forecast is based primarily on the significant logistical and scheduling impediments to a presidential visit occurring within the next 15 days. The status quo, in which such a visit is not planned, is heavily favored. The research indicates that US presidential visits to China involve extensive preparations that begin weeks or months in advance; there are currently no public reports of any such preparations. Furthermore, President Trump's schedule is already occupied with major international summits: the G7 in Canada (June 16-18) and the NATO summit in the Netherlands (June 24-25). President Xi is also scheduled to be in Kazakhstan from June 16-18. This leaves a very narrow and impractical window for a long-haul trip to China.\n\nThe probability is not lower than 5% because of President Trump's known preference for personal, high-profile diplomacy and his unpredictability. The announcement of a 'finalized' trade agreement from the US side and the looming tariff deadline provide a strong incentive for him to push for a dramatic, last-minute meeting to secure a political victory. The fact that an invitation has been extended by President Xi and accepted by President Trump makes a visit plausible in theory.\n\nThe probability is not higher than 5% because the practical barriers are formidable. The absence of publicly known logistical preparations (e.g., advance teams for security and communications) is the single most critical factor weighing against a visit. It is highly improbable, though not impossible, that such a complex operation could be organized and executed in secret on such an accelerated timeline.\n\nI would increase my forecast significantly upon any credible reports of US advance teams arriving in China or an official announcement from either country confirming a travel date. I would decrease my forecast if President Trump's post-NATO schedule becomes filled with other engagements or if officials from either side explicitly state that a meeting will occur at a later date.",
