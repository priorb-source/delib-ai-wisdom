    "no_outcome_scenario": "Protests in South Korea continue at routine levels without coalescing into a new, distinct nationwide movement; no new entry meeting the 10,000+ threshold with a qualifying start date is added to the Global Protest Tracker before July 1, 2025.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "A major anti-government protest wave begins in May/June 2025 (e.g., sparked by a political crisis, labor confrontation, or contentious policy), draws 10,000+ participants, and is added by Carnegie’s Global Protest Tracker as a new entry with a qualifying start date before July 1, 2025.",
    "rationale": "- Time left is short, and the Global Protest Tracker (GPT) is selective, typically adding only sizable, distinct protest movements rather than one-off large rallies. Even in countries with frequent demonstrations, GPT updates are relatively infrequent and tend to reflect sustained movements.\n- South Korea’s base rate of very large protests is non-trivial (robust civil society; Seoul can see 10k+ rallies), but the conversion from a large rally to a new GPT entry is not guaranteed. GPT often lists only the most salient waves (e.g., the 2016–2017 candlelight protests). The bar is high.\n- The provided ACLED note suggests heightened contention at some point, but we lack corroborating detail and timing, and the assistant report adds nothing new. The question also requires the GPT entry’s start date to fall after the question’s launch; as of today the criteria are “not yet satisfied,” implying no qualifying entry exists so far.\n- Why not higher: Short runway (≈2 months), GPT’s curation standards, and no identified imminent trigger reduce odds.\n- Why not lower: South Korea can rapidly mobilize 10k+ participants; a sudden political scandal, labor showdown, or heavy-handed state action could catalyze a recognized movement. If GPT decides to cover a new wave, it could be added quickly.\n- What would move me up: Credible reports of multi-city mass rallies (10k+), calls for nationwide strikes, or a government action prompting sustained protests; signs that GPT is adding similar 2025 movements in other countries promptly. What would move me down: Continued routine protest activity without scale-up; absence of major flashpoints; no signs of GPT adding new entries for comparable events elsewhere.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill the Global Protest Tracker report any protests in South Korea with 10,000+ participants, before July 1, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nACLED December 2024: [South Korea: Anti-government protests surge following martial law declaration](https://acleddata.com/2025/01/15/asia-pacific-overview-january-2025/#keytrends6)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if the [Global Protest Tracker](https://carnegieendowment.org/features/global-protest-tracker?lang=en) reports a protest in South Korea with 10,000 or more participants with a start date after the launch of this question and before July 1, 2025.\n\n\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nNo additional information available.\n\nToday is 2025-05-01.\n\nBefore answering you think:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n(e) You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
