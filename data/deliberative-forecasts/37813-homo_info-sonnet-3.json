    "review": "All three forecasts cluster tightly between 60-68%, suggesting strong convergence on the core analytical framework. Forecaster 3 provides a useful quantitative anchor by calculating NUFORC's average processing rate (~300 reports/month based on 180,000 reports over 50 years), which helps contextualize December 2024's 6 cube-shaped sightings as representing roughly 2% of monthly reports. However, this calculation doesn't resolve our central uncertainty: was December 2024 a massive outlier (suggesting typical months have 0-1 cube sightings) or merely elevated (suggesting typical months have 2-3)? All three analyses correctly identify that the low threshold (only 1 sighting needed) works strongly in favor of a Yes outcome, even with mean reversion from December's elevated level. The emphasis on 'rare in the history of NUFORC' is concerning and suggests we shouldn't assume cube sightings occur in most months. The tight clustering of forecasts indicates we're all working from the same limited information and reaching similar conclusions about the uncertainty.",
    "rationale": "After reviewing the other forecasters' analyses, I find my initial reasoning holds up well. The key insight all three of us share is that December 2024's 6 cube-shaped sightings, while described as 'rare,' establishes that (a) cube sightings do get reported to NUFORC and (b) they can occur multiple times per month. The critical question remains: what is the typical monthly rate? If we model this as a Poisson process where December's 6 represents roughly 3-6x the typical rate (since it's described as rare), the typical rate might be 1-2 per month. Under a Poisson distribution with lambda=1, the probability of zero occurrences is ~37%, giving us a ~63% chance of at least one. With lambda=1.5, we'd get ~78% for at least one. However, the 'rare' descriptor suggests December was genuinely unusual, possibly placing typical rates closer to 0.5-1.0 per month. This supports a forecast in the 55-65% range. I see no compelling reason to move significantly from my initial 60% forecast, though Forecaster 3's slightly higher 68% is defensible if one assumes December wasn't an extreme outlier.",
