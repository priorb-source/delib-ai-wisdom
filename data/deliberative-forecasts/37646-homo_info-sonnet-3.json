    "review": "Forecaster 3 provides the most critical new evidence: base rate data showing African Starlink deployments typically take 4-8 months from licensing to 'Available' status, with Nigeria and Rwanda each taking approximately 4 months. With only 6.5 weeks remaining, this would require deployment roughly 3-4x faster than the African median. However, Forecaster 3 also notes that Bangladesh achieved availability in just 2 weeks in May 2025, which is extremely recent and demonstrates rapid deployment is technically feasible when prioritized. Forecaster 2 makes an excellent observation that I had underweighted: 4+ weeks have passed since the April 13 announcement with apparently no map update, suggesting deployment may not be moving rapidly. This status quo evidence is concerning. Both forecasters acknowledge the uncertainty about when actual licensing occurred versus when it was announced, which could affect available deployment time. The Bangladesh precedent prevents this from being an extremely low probability event, but the base rate data and lack of visible progress after 4+ weeks are compelling arguments for lowering my forecast.",
    "rationale": "I'm updating my forecast down from 40% to 28% based on three key factors. First, the base rate evidence is powerful - African deployments typically take 4-8 months, and we need this to happen in approximately 1.5 months total (or 6.5 weeks remaining). This represents deployment 3-4x faster than historical African median. Second, the observation that 4+ weeks have passed since the public announcement without apparent map updates suggests deployment isn't proceeding at the breakneck pace required. Third, Somalia's challenging security and infrastructure environment likely makes it harder, not easier, than typical deployments. However, I'm not going as low as 20% because: (1) the Bangladesh 2-week precedent from May 2025 proves ultra-rapid deployment is within Starlink's technical capabilities when prioritized, (2) the regulatory hurdle is already cleared, (3) we have genuine uncertainty about whether licensing occurred before the announcement giving more preparation time, and (4) U.S. government diplomatic support might prioritize this deployment. My 28% forecast reflects that this would require exceptional execution speed, but remains possible given recent precedent and strong institutional support.",
