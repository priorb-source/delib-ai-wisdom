    "review": "Forecaster 2 raises the NBU's 8.7% year-end forecast, but this argument is weak - a Q2 peak at 15%+ could easily decline to average 8.7% by year-end, making the forecasts compatible. The 'warning signals' argument is also problematic: we ARE seeing signals in the data itself (14.6% in March, accelerating monthly rates). Forecaster 2 appears to overweight institutional projections while underweighting actual observed momentum.\n\nForecaster 3's analysis is more compelling. The 18-19% Easter food basket inflation and the observation that we're late in April (most price data already determined) are valuable points. The 62% forecast reasonably balances the strong upward trend against countervailing factors like NBU policy and demand weakness.\n\nHowever, both forecasters may be underweighting the strength of the trend and proximity to threshold. The momentum is undeniable: three consecutive months of acceleration, with March reaching 14.6% - just 0.4 percentage points short. Monthly inflation jumped from 0.8% to 1.5%, and critical categories (food 17.4%, utilities 20.2%) show sustained pressure.",
    "rationale": "Upon reflection, I'm slightly moderating my forecast while maintaining that crossing 15.0% is probable. The strongest evidence remains: (1) clear acceleration pattern over three months, (2) only 0.4pp gap to threshold, (3) we're April 22 so data is mostly determined, (4) high inflation in major CPI components. \n\nHowever, Forecaster 2's point about NBU institutional knowledge deserves some weight - while central banks can miss peaks, the 8.7% year-end forecast combined with restrictive monetary policy suggests some confidence in containing inflation. Forecaster 3's acknowledgment of countervailing forces (demand weakness, NBU policy) is also valid.\n\nThe key insight: we need only 0.27% monthly inflation in April to reach 15.0% annually (simple approximation). Given March had 1.5% monthly inflation and strong food/utility pressures persist, this seems quite achievable. But NBU interventions and base effects create uncertainty.\n\nI'm revising down slightly to 72% to acknowledge: (1) possible policy effects not yet visible, (2) institutional forecasters don't anticipate 15%, (3) demand weakness could moderate price increases. But I'm not going lower because the momentum is too strong and the gap too small to ignore.",
