    "review": "Forecaster 2 and I align closely (15% vs my 22%) in heavily weighting the status quo - that the emergency ends as scheduled on April 29. Forecaster 3 at 35% raises several compelling points I hadn't fully considered: (1) Historical precedent - Samoa has used rolling monthly extensions in past emergencies (COVID), showing institutional comfort with extensions; (2) Practical reality - commissioning timelines for infrastructure 'often slip,' which is empirically true for generator installations; (3) Low administrative cost - extending is procedurally simple; (4) Government may prefer buffer period during the transition to maintain emergency powers. These are valid arguments. However, I find Forecaster 2's disciplined approach to status quo bias appropriately cautious. The key fact remains: with only 8-9 days until the scheduled end date, no extension has been announced or hinted at. The April 15 NEOC update reaffirmed the April 29 end date. While Forecaster 3's points about slippage and buffer preferences are theoretically sound, we need some signal of extension intent by now if it were likely. The government publicly committed to a 30-day timeline that aligns with temporary generator deployment. Deviating would require either a policy announcement or evidence of failure, neither of which we've seen.",
    "rationale": "After reviewing both analyses, I'm updating slightly upward from 22% to 26%. Forecaster 3's arguments about commissioning delays being common and Samoa's historical comfort with extensions (COVID precedent) are compelling and introduce meaningful uncertainty I underweighted. Infrastructure projects do frequently slip, and governments often prefer buffer periods. However, I'm not moving as high as 35% because: (1) The lack of any extension signal with just 8 days remaining is a strong indicator; (2) The government has been consistent about the April 29 end date; (3) Temporary generators being operational by end of April remains the baseline expectation; (4) There's political value in ending on schedule if conditions permit. The 26% forecast reflects increased uncertainty about potential commissioning delays while still giving substantial weight to the officially stated timeline. I would move higher if we see reports of generator delays or continued severe outages in the final week of April. I would move lower if generators are confirmed operational or the government explicitly reaffirms the April 29 end.",
