    "review": "The most striking feature of this deliberation is the strong consensus. All three forecasters arrived independently at the same 15% probability, based on very similar core reasoning: the immense barriers of diplomatic inertia and Sheikh Hasina's personal legal risk heavily outweigh the low-probability catalysts for her return in the short, seven-week timeframe. \n\nForecaster 3 raised an excellent counter-argument regarding the return of Khaleda Zia that I had not fully appreciated. I viewed Zia's return as a factor that might pressure Hasina to return to maintain political relevance. Forecaster 3 astutely noted that Zia's return also solidifies the anti-Hasina political forces, making Bangladesh a more dangerous and hostile environment for her, thus *disincentivizing* a voluntary return. This is a very convincing point that weakens one of the key scenarios for a 'Yes' outcome.\n\nAdditionally, Forecaster 2's point that a formal international arrest warrant from the ICT might *complicate and slow* an extradition process by India, rather than accelerate it, is a valuable nuance that adds weight to the diplomatic inertia argument. These perspectives, while not introducing entirely new evidence, refine the analysis and strengthen the case for the 'No' outcome.",
    "rationale": "After reviewing the other experts' analyses, I am lowering my forecast. The core logic of my initial forecast remains unchanged, but the arguments presented have convinced me that I was slightly overestimating the probability of a 'Yes' outcome. \n\nForecaster 3's argument that Khaleda Zia's return makes the political environment in Bangladesh more dangerous for Sheikh Hasina is particularly impactful. It provides a strong counter to the idea that Hasina might be pressured into a voluntary return to stay politically relevant. The increased personal risk likely negates any political motivation to return. This significantly weakens one of the primary, albeit unlikely, pathways to a 'Yes' resolution. My initial 15% accounted for this possibility, and I now believe it deserves less weight.\n\nTherefore, I am adjusting my forecast down by 5 points. A 10% probability better reflects a situation where a return is not impossible—as it could still be driven by a sudden, unexpected shift in Indian diplomatic strategy or a desperate personal gamble by Hasina—but is even more of a long shot than I first assessed. The barriers are immense, and the arguments from my peers have reinforced their strength.",
