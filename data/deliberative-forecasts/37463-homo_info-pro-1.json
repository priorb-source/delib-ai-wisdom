    "review": "The other forecasters presented a crucial piece of evidence that I had missed and that fundamentally changes the entire forecast: Berkshire Hathaway's position has been exactly 10,000,000 shares for six years. My original analysis was based on incorrect data from my research assistant suggesting the holding was ~10.7 million shares. This correction completely flips the status quo. Instead of a 'Yes' being the outcome of inaction, inaction now results in a 'No'. A 'Yes' outcome now requires an active purchase. Both forecasters correctly identified this. I find Forecaster 2's reasoning, which heavily weights this six-year history of inaction as evidence for continued inertia, to be the most compelling. Forecaster 3's arguments for a potential purchase are plausible but are not specific to Q1 2025 and are outweighed by the strong historical base rate of no change.",
    "rationale": "My initial forecast of 75% was predicated on faulty information that Berkshire's holding was already above the 10,000,000 share threshold. The deliberation with other forecasters corrected this critical fact: the holding has been stable at exactly 10,000,000 shares since 2019. This means the status quo outcome is 'No', and a 'Yes' requires a new, active purchase.\n\nThe most powerful evidence is now the 24-quarter streak of inaction on this specific holding. This creates an extremely strong base rate suggesting no change is the most likely outcome. Furthermore, the details from my initial research report—that Berkshire was a net seller of equities in Q1 2025, increased its cash hoard, and focused new investments in energy and Japan—actively contradict the idea that they would be adding to a US large-cap tech position during this period.\n\nTherefore, I must completely reverse my position and dramatically lower my forecast. The probability of Berkshire breaking a six-year pattern of inaction, during a quarter where their stated actions were moving in the opposite direction, is very low. I am updating my forecast from 75% to 15%. This 15% probability acknowledges the arguments made by Forecaster 3 that Berkshire has immense cash reserves and the investment managers have the autonomy to make opportunistic purchases, but it is heavily anchored in the much stronger evidence of historical inertia and Berkshire's broader portfolio strategy in Q1 2025.",
