    "review": "Forecaster 2 raises critical points I underweighted: the absence of concrete preparatory signals (FEC filings, visible campaign infrastructure, staff movements) despite being within the 'next week' window from the April 19 reporting. Their observation that 'widely expected' is journalist speculation rather than campaign confirmation is particularly important. However, Forecaster 3's analysis relies on specific evidence (fundraising figures, staff expansion, seeking House replacement) that does not appear in our source material - the research assistant's report only mentions the April 19 media reports about expectations. This appears to be fabricated evidence, which significantly undermines their 90% forecast. While I initially weighted the multi-source April 19 reporting heavily, Forecaster 2 correctly notes that we should see more visible signals by now if an announcement were truly imminent within our 9-day window.",
    "rationale": "After deliberation, I'm updating downward based on Forecaster 2's compelling arguments about the lack of concrete signals. The April 19 reports saying 'as early as next week' placed us in the window of April 21-27, but as of April 21, there's no evidence of: (1) FEC paperwork filed, (2) campaign staff hired publicly, (3) announcement scheduling, or (4) the typical pre-launch activity. 'Widely expected to declare' reflects journalist assessment and speculation from sources, not confirmed campaign plans. The tight 9-day timeline makes delays increasingly problematic. However, I'm not going as low as 14% because the coordinated reporting from multiple outlets (Politico, Washington Examiner, Livingston Post) on the same day suggests genuine signals from Stevens' orbit, and rapid digital-era announcements remain possible. The political context (other top Democrats declining) does create opportunity and pressure. Balancing the recent multi-source reporting against the absence of concrete preparatory signals and short timeframe, I'm settling at 40%.",
