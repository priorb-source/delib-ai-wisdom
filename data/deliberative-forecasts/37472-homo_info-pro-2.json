    "review": "The other forecasters presented compelling arguments that I had not fully weighted. Forecaster 2 provided crucial new information regarding the specific and imminent legal jeopardy Sheikh Hasina faces: a report on crimes against humanity expected in May and a contempt of court deadline of May 15. This transforms the risk from a general political threat into a concrete, high-stakes legal certainty. Forecaster 3’s analysis of the diplomatic and legal complexity of extradition, and India's apparent reluctance to act, convincingly argues that an involuntary return within the short resolution timeframe is highly improbable. Both forecasts find my initial assessment of the political pressure from Khaleda Zia's return as a sufficient driver for Hasina's own return to be an overestimation in the face of such severe personal risks.",
    "rationale": "I am significantly updating my forecast downwards based on the deliberation. My initial 40% forecast was based on a perceived balance between high political pressure to return and high personal risk. The other forecasters have convinced me that this balance is heavily skewed towards risk. The specific details about the impending legal cases, with deadlines within the next week, make a voluntary return before July 1 not just risky, but a near-certain path to immediate arrest and prosecution for severe crimes. This is a much stronger deterrent than I had initially assumed. Furthermore, Forecaster 3's points on the impracticality of a swift extradition process effectively closes the path for an involuntary return in the given timeframe. The question therefore rests almost entirely on a high-risk voluntary return. While the political pressure created by Khaleda Zia's return is real, it is insufficient to compel a rational actor to face almost certain imprisonment. Sheikh Hasina's vows to return are more credibly interpreted as political posturing, as Forecaster 2 suggested. I am therefore reducing my forecast from 40% to 10%, reflecting the overwhelming legal disincentives against her return in this specific window, while still allowing for the small possibility of a high-risk, unpredictable political gambit.",
