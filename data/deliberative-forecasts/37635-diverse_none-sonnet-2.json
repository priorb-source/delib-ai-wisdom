    "review": "Both forecasters raise important points I should weigh more heavily. Forecaster 2 correctly emphasizes that the tie resolution criterion (tie = No) creates a structural bias against Yes outcomes when starting from such a narrow lead. Forecaster 3 makes an excellent observation about rounding effects - if Morning Consult displays whole numbers, a true 0.5-point lead could show as a tie (e.g., 60.4% vs 60.3% both appearing as 60%). This is a measurement precision issue I underweighted. Both also note appropriately that Milei's volatility is higher than Sheinbaum's stability, making his narrow lead more fragile. However, I find Forecaster 2's 52% slightly too pessimistic given the short timeframe and current status quo. The 1.5-month horizon really does constrain how much can change, and we start with Milei ahead. While volatility exists, it doesn't have a clear directional bias. The rounding and tie-resolution arguments are compelling enough to move me down from 57%, but not all the way to 50-52%.",
    "rationale": "After reviewing the other analyses, I'm updating downward to account for two factors I insufficiently weighted: (1) the tie resolution rule that breaks any parity toward No, and (2) rounding effects that could eliminate displayed leads even if real differences exist. Starting from a 1-point lead with typical week-to-week noise of 1-2pp means the outcome is highly sensitive to measurement precision and small fluctuations. The status quo still matters over 6 weeks - approval ratings don't typically shift dramatically in such short periods absent major shocks. However, the combination of Milei's higher volatility, the negligible current margin, and the resolution mechanics that favor No in ambiguous cases all push against confidence in a Yes outcome. I'm settling at 54% to reflect: modest status quo advantage from current lead, balanced against tie-breaking rules and measurement uncertainty that slightly favor No when margins are razor-thin.",
