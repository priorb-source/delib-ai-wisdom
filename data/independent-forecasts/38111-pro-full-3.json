  "information": "A high-level international conference on the two-state solution is scheduled for June 17-20, 2025, at the UN headquarters in New York. The conference is co-chaired by France and Saudi Arabia and is based on a UN General Assembly resolution from December 2024. Its stated aim is to generate momentum for more countries to recognize a Palestinian state. Supporting this effort, the Arab Group at the UN has urged member countries to recognize Palestine as a step toward lasting peace. Additionally, the 'Madrid+' group, comprising Spain, Ireland, Slovenia, and Norway, has called for Palestine's full UN membership, describing it as a \"political and diplomatic necessity.\"\n\nFrench President Emmanuel Macron has stated that recognizing a Palestinian state is a \"moral and political obligation\" and has indicated that France may officially grant recognition during the June UN conference, although he has also tied the move to certain conditions. In May 2025, the UK announced it had joined France's initiative for the recognition of a Palestinian state. According to a report by Axios, Malta is also preparing to declare Palestine's independence at the summit on June 20. Five Arab countries—Egypt, Jordan, Qatar, the UAE, and Saudi Arabia—have announced their active participation in organizing the conference.\n\nAs of May 2025, 147 out of 193 UN member states officially recognize the State of Palestine, while 46 members do not. The non-recognizing states include most Western European nations, the United States, Canada, Australia, Japan, and South Korea. In 2024, five countries newly recognized Palestine: Norway, Ireland, Spain, Slovenia, and Armenia. The Israeli government strongly opposes the international recognition effort. An Israeli official stated the country \"will not cooperate\" with such measures and warned of potential further annexation of the West Bank. The United States and several other G7 members also continue to withhold official recognition.",

    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "1 month",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No new UN member country recognizes Palestine in June 2025, and the number of recognizing states remains unchanged from May 31, 2025.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "The high-level UN conference in June concludes with declarations of support for Palestinian statehood but no new formal recognitions. Key countries, such as France and Malta, decide to postpone their announcements due to intense diplomatic pressure from the United States and Israel, or because internal conditions they have set for recognition are not met.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "During the UN conference scheduled for June 17-20, at least one country, likely Malta or France, formally announces its recognition of the State of Palestine. This action is framed as a necessary step to advance the two-state solution and is catalyzed by the diplomatic momentum generated by the conference.",
    "rationale": "The forecast leans strongly towards a 'Yes' outcome due to a convergence of factors creating significant momentum for new recognitions in June 2025. The primary driver is the UN conference on the two-state solution, scheduled for June 17-20. This event serves as an action-forcing mechanism, providing a specific time and international platform for countries to make announcements. The credibility of this event is high, being co-chaired by France and Saudi Arabia. There is specific, credible reporting from Axios that Malta is preparing to recognize Palestine at this summit, which alone would resolve the question. Furthermore, France's President Macron has publicly stated that recognition is a 'moral and political obligation,' and with the UK now backing its initiative, France is a very strong candidate to act in June. This follows the trend set in 2024 when several European nations (Spain, Ireland, Norway, Slovenia) recognized Palestine, demonstrating a shifting consensus in Europe. \n\nThe probability is not higher than 80% because there are significant countervailing forces. The United States and Israel are strongly opposed and will exert considerable diplomatic pressure to prevent or delay new recognitions. President Macron's statements have also included unspecified conditions, which may provide a pretext for delay if they are not met. Intentions can change quickly in international diplomacy. \n\nThe probability is not lower than 80% because the momentum appears too strong to result in zero recognitions. The combination of a dedicated international conference and specific intelligence about Malta's plans makes the 'No' scenario less likely. For the outcome to be 'No', both Malta and France would need to reverse their stated intentions despite the major diplomatic effort they are leading. \n\nI would increase my forecast if either Malta or France officially confirmed their intent to announce recognition at the conference. I would decrease it if the conference were canceled, or if reliable reports emerged that key European states had agreed to a delay under US pressure.",
