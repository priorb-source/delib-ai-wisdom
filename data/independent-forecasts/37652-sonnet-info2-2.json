  "information": "The relationship with the United States under President Donald Trump was a central theme of the recent Canadian election. Trump had made public remarks about absorbing Canada into the U.S. and imposed tariffs on Canadian goods. In response, Prime Minister Carney stated his government would 'relentlessly' protect Canadian sovereignty and work to define a new economic and security relationship with Washington. After the election, Carney met with Trump but did not secure a removal of the U.S. tariffs. Carney has stated he will maintain Canadian tariffs on U.S. products as long as American tariffs remain in place. The new Canadian cabinet has been explicitly tasked with focusing on Canada-U.S. relations and resolving trade disputes.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Approximately 47 days until July 1, 2025",
    "status_quo_outcome": "If current approval patterns continue, Carney likely has higher approval than Trump",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Trump's approval rises significantly due to economic improvements or foreign policy successes while Carney's approval falls due to economic pain from the tariff dispute or other unpopular domestic policies, leading to Trump matching or exceeding Carney's rating",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Carney maintains elevated approval ratings from his post-election honeymoon period while being viewed favorably for defending Canadian sovereignty, while Trump continues with his historically lower approval ratings in the low-to-mid 40s range typical of his presidency",
    "rationale": "Several key factors inform this forecast. First, Carney appears to have recently won an election and new leaders typically experience a honeymoon period with elevated approval ratings that can last several months. With only 1.5 months until resolution, he's likely still benefiting from this effect. Second, Trump historically has maintained relatively low approval ratings compared to other presidents, often in the 40-45% range, due to his polarizing nature. Third, the tariff dispute could work in Carney's favor domestically - Canadians may view his firm stance on sovereignty positively, though economic pain from tariffs presents a downside risk. The principle that the world changes slowly favors the status quo continuing, which appears to be Carney having higher approval. However, I'm not forecasting higher because: (1) we lack specific current approval data as of mid-May 2025, creating uncertainty; (2) 1.5 months provides enough time for significant events to shift public opinion; (3) the ongoing tariff situation is dynamic and could evolve unpredictably. I'm not forecasting lower because: (1) the short timeframe limits how much ratings typically move; (2) honeymoon periods for new leaders are robust; (3) Trump's approval ceiling has historically been constrained. I would revise upward if polling data showed Carney with a 10+ point lead currently, or downward if the gap were narrow or if major economic indicators turned sharply negative for Canada.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney have a higher approval rating than US President Donald Trump on July 1, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nResolution source updates monthly. According to Morning Consult for January 2025: \"The latest approval ratings are based on data collected from Jan. 21-27, 2025. Ratings reflect a trailing seven-day simple moving average of views among adults in each country surveyed.\"\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if Mark Carney has a higher approval rating than US President Donald Trump according to [Morning Consult](https://pro.morningconsult.com/trackers/global-leader-approval) when checked by Metaculus on or after July 1, 2025. If this not the case (including due to a tie), this resolves as **No**.\n\n\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nThe relationship with the United States under President Donald Trump was a central theme of the recent Canadian election.

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
