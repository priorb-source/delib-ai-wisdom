    "review": "Forecaster 2’s argument is disciplined and anchored in the short window and historically low cadence of DJIA changes. I agree with their emphasis on the need for a clear catalyst (M&A, spin, crisis) to move the committee within ~2 months. Forecaster 3’s overall conclusion is similar to mine, but they appear to misstate that a change already occurred in 2025; the notable two-name refresh was in February 2024. Also, their claim that monitoring 30 companies increases the odds risks double-counting—the base rate of a “Dow change event” already reflects the index-level surface area. Both mention Boeing/3M/Verizon as plausible weak links, which I also flagged; however, history suggests the committee tolerates prolonged turbulence (e.g., Boeing) without immediate removal absent a structural change. Net, I find Forecaster 2’s lower estimate better aligned with base rates in such a short window, and Forecaster 3’s 15–20% two-month base rate feels high before they adjust down.",
    "rationale": "Reassessing the base-rate math and recent context nudges me slightly lower. Over the last ~12 years, there have been ~5 change events (2013, 2015, 2018, 2020, 2024), implying ~0.42 events/year. A 2‑month Poisson approximation gives about 6.7% for any change event—a good proxy for “Yes,” since any event entails at least one current constituent being dropped. The February 2024 two-name refresh likely reduces near-term hazard further (committees tend to avoid serial adjustments absent force majeure). Potential catalysts exist (Boeing regulatory/legal escalations, abrupt M&A/spin announcements, or an index-balance-driven swap to admit another mega-cap), but none is clearly brewing now. Given the short remaining window (~67 days) and the committee’s bias for stability, I trim my prior 8% to 7%. I would move up only on credible reports of a DJIA action or a major, sudden corporate event affecting a current component; I would drift lower as quiet time accrues into mid‑June.",
