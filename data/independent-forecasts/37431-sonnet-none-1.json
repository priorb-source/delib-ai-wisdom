    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "57 days from today (May 5, 2025) until July 1, 2025. The recall was issued 11 days ago on April 24, 2025, giving a total window of approximately 68 days from recall issuance to the resolution date.",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No - the recall remains Active past July 1, 2025",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "ACC Central Kitchen LLC's recall remains in Active status through July 1, 2025 because the company is still implementing corrective actions, FSIS is still verifying compliance with food safety regulations, or the investigation and product removal process takes longer than the 68-day window from recall issuance to the resolution date.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "The recall is closed before July 1, 2025 because ACC Central Kitchen LLC quickly implements all required corrective actions (such as improved labeling procedures and allergen controls), successfully removes affected products from commerce, FSIS completes its verification process efficiently, and the agency updates the recall status to Closed within the 68-day timeframe.",
    "rationale": "This question requires forecasting whether a USDA food recall will be closed within approximately 68 days of its issuance. The recall was posted on April 24, 2025, and we need to determine if it will be closed by July 1, 2025. As of today (May 5), 11 days have elapsed and 57 days remain. The recall involves 65,000 pounds of pork bun products with undeclared allergens (misbranding issue). Based on typical USDA/FSIS recall patterns, most recalls remain active for several months, often 3-6 months or longer, as they require product removal verification, investigation completion, corrective action implementation, and regulatory verification. Allergen/misbranding recalls can sometimes resolve more quickly than contamination cases since the corrective actions may be more straightforward (improved labeling and allergen control procedures). However, a 68-day closure window is relatively short by historical standards. The status quo strongly favors the recall remaining active, as regulatory processes are typically slow and thorough. For my forecast to be higher, I would need evidence that ACC Central Kitchen LLC is unusually responsive, that FSIS is expediting this case, or that similar allergen recalls commonly close within 2-3 months. For my forecast to be lower, I would need evidence of complications, company non-compliance, or typical closure times exceeding 3 months. Given the strong status quo bias toward recalls remaining active for extended periods and limited contrary evidence, I estimate approximately a 30% probability of closure before July 1.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill the USDA-posted recall by ACC Central Kitchen LLC of pork bun products issued April 24, 2025 be closed before July 1, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nConsumerAffairs: [Nearly 65,000 pounds of pork buns recalled for undeclared allergen](https://www.consumeraffairs.com/news/nearly-65000-pounds-of-pork-buns-recalled-for-undeclared-allergen-042525.html)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if the status of the recall posted by the U.S. Department of Agriculture’s Food Safety and Inspection Service (FSIS) is changed from Active to Closed on [this page](https://www.fsis.usda.gov/recalls-alerts/acc-central-kitchen-llc-recalls-pork-bun-products-due-misbranding-and-undeclared) before July 1, 2025. If the recall is still shown as Active when the link is accessed by Metaculus on or after July 1, 2025, this question resolves as **No**.\n\n\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nNo additional information available.\n\nToday is 2025-05-05.\n\nBefore answering you think:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n(e) You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
