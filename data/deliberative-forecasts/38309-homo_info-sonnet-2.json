    "review": "The other forecasters raised two critical pieces of information I had missed: (1) Jones ran statewide for AG in 2021, giving him existing name recognition and campaign infrastructure for this exact office, and (2) Jones secured major establishment endorsements from former Governors McAuliffe and Northam plus Rep. Bobby Scott. These are significant factors that compound the fundraising advantage I identified. Interestingly, Forecaster 2 explicitly stated they lacked fundraising data, and Forecaster 3 didn't cite specific numbers, suggesting they may not have had access to the same financial information I did. Their forecasts of 62% and 67% are notably more conservative than my 72%, despite having some information I initially lacked. This suggests either: (a) they appropriately weighted the uncertainty from lack of polling more heavily than I did, or (b) they would have updated higher had they known about Jones's substantial fundraising edge.",
    "rationale": "Integrating all available information creates a stronger case for Jones than I initially assessed. The combination of (1) a 2-to-1 fundraising advantage ($1.8M vs $1M raised, with $1.4M cash on hand), (2) previous 2021 statewide campaign experience for this exact office, (3) major establishment endorsements from two former Democratic governors plus a congressman, and (4) only 14 days remaining until the primary, collectively suggests Jones has built significant structural advantages. Each factor independently provides value, but they also compound: fundraising enables advertising and ground game, the 2021 run provided name recognition that makes that advertising more efficient, and establishment endorsements signal organizational strength and likely correlate with GOTV infrastructure. However, the complete absence of polling data remains a significant limitation—we're inferring voter preferences from structural factors rather than measuring them directly. Taylor's $1M+ fundraising and prosecutorial credentials indicate she's a credible opponent, not a token challenger. Given that the other forecasters had complementary information but arrived at more conservative estimates, I'm updating upward modestly rather than dramatically. My increase from 72% to 75% reflects incorporating the 2021 campaign history and endorsements while respecting the uncertainty highlighted by the other analysts' more conservative positions.",
