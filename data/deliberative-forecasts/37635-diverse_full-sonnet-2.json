    "review": "Forecaster 3 raises the most compelling new argument: the tie-as-No resolution criterion mechanically tilts the probability below 50% when the margin is only 1 point. With normal polling variance (±1-3 pp over 6 weeks per Forecaster 3), there's meaningful probability mass on both a tie and Sheinbaum pulling ahead. This is a critical point I underweighted in my initial analysis.\n\nForecaster 2's reasoning closely mirrors mine, emphasizing status quo persistence over short horizons and the weight of the most recent MC data. Their 55% forecast represents reasonable optimism that the current lead holds.\n\nHowever, I find Forecaster 3's directional trend analysis more persuasive: Milei's domestic polling is genuinely dire (44%/52% net negative), while Sheinbaum's is exceptional (76-82%). Even though MC rates Milei systematically higher than domestic polls, the fundamental political momentum seems against him. Forecaster 3 also correctly notes that both leaders trended down Jan-Apr, creating volatility.\n\nThe key tension: MC's most recent data shows Milei ahead, but the margin is razor-thin, ties count as No, and the underlying political fundamentals favor Sheinbaum. I initially treated this as roughly 50/50, but the tie-as-No rule should push me below 50%.",
    "rationale": "Upon reflection, I'm updating downward from 52% to 48%. The decisive factors:\n\n1. **Tie-as-No rule**: With a 1-point margin and typical MC variance of 1-3 pp, the probability of a tie or Sheinbaum lead is meaningfully above 50%. I initially treated this as a symmetric coin flip, but ties breaking toward No creates asymmetry.\n\n2. **Underlying political trajectories**: Milei faces domestic headwinds (net negative approval, economic dissatisfaction) while Sheinbaum enjoys strong domestic support. Even if MC doesn't fully reflect domestic polling, trends matter.\n\n3. **Historical volatility**: Both leaders moved substantially between January and April (Milei -4pp, Sheinbaum -6pp), showing neither rating is sticky.\n\nI'm not going as low as 43% because: (a) the current MC data - our actual resolution source - has Milei ahead, (b) MC has historically rated Milei higher than domestic polls, suggesting methodological differences that may persist, and (c) six weeks is short enough that dramatic reversals require catalysts.\n\nThis forecast acknowledges the current lead while properly accounting for the resolution rule and underlying momentum.",
