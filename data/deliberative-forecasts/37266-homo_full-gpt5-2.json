    "review": "Both forecasters’ arguments align closely with my prior reasoning: Level 4 is usually reserved for war zones or pervasive instability, and Mozambique’s risks remain geographically concentrated in the north with episodic spillover. They add a few useful nuances: (1) explicit triggers like an embassy ordered departure or a successful attack on a provincial capital; (2) the example of countries where State uses regional Level 4s under a national Level 3 (e.g., Bangladesh); (3) the note that cyclone season is waning, slightly reducing some hazard vectors; and (4) the potential impact of security force posture shifts (Rwanda/SADC). I find their reasoning sound and consistent with State Department practice. The main incremental takeaway is a clearer articulation of rapid‑escalation pathways that could push a quick upgrade, which slightly increases tail risk over the next ~60 days, though not enough to make a Level 4 likely.",
    "rationale": "The status quo is Level 3 with regional Level 4 cautions in the north. Recent Niassa incidents and embassy alerts indicate some geographic spread, but current signals still look localized rather than nationwide. The State Department’s pattern in such cases is to expand or refine regional Level 4 areas, not to issue a countrywide Level 4 absent sustained multi‑province deterioration, major urban incidents, direct targeting/kidnappings of foreigners, or embassy drawdown/ordered departure. Partner advisories (UK/Canada) remain regionally focused, and protests to date have not produced nationwide paralysis. The other forecasters’ points about specific triggers (provincial capital attacks, kidnappings of foreigners, ordered departure) make the tail risk paths more concrete, nudging me slightly upward from 8% to 10%. Countervailing is the waning cyclone season and strong precedent for keeping Mozambique at Level 3 with regional Do‑Not‑Travel guidance. Overall, a Level 4 before July 1 remains unlikely but not impossible.",
