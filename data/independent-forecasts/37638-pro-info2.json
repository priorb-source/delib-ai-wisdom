  "information": "The Texas House of Representatives has shown resistance to a full THC ban, instead advancing measures to expand medical cannabis access. House Bill 46 (HB 46), which broadens the state's Compassionate Use Program, was approved by the House with a vote of 118-16. This bill expands the list of qualifying medical conditions, increases the number of licensed dispensaries to 11, and gives military veterans special access to low-dose THC treatments. Furthermore, a House committee adopted a substitute version of the Senate's SB 3 that is not a full ban, but would allow certain low-THC beverages and tinctures while prohibiting vapes and synthetics. The Texas hemp industry, estimated to be worth $8 billion, and Agriculture Commissioner Sid Miller have expressed concerns that a total ban would shutter thousands of businesses.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "A little over one and a half months, with the deadline being July 1, 2025.",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No. The current legal framework in Texas, which permits the sale of certain hemp-derived THC products under state and federal law, will remain in place.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "The Texas House and Senate fail to reconcile their significantly different approaches to THC. The House's preference for regulation and expansion of medical cannabis prevails over the Senate's push for a full ban. The legislative session concludes without a bill enacting a full prohibition being passed by both chambers and signed by the governor before the July 1, 2025 deadline.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "In a last-minute political maneuver before the legislative session ends, a conference committee reaches a surprise compromise that attaches a full THC ban to an unrelated, must-pass bill. Under intense pressure from the Governor and Senate leadership, key House members agree to the ban in exchange for major political concessions, and the bill is rushed through and signed into law before July 1, 2025.",
    "rationale": "The probability of Texas enacting a full ban on THC sales before the deadline is very low. The primary reason for this is the strong and demonstrated opposition within the Texas House of Representatives. The research indicates the House is not only resisting a ban but actively moving to expand cannabis access, as shown by its overwhelming 118-16 vote to pass HB 46, which broadens the state's medical cannabis program. Furthermore, the House has already diluted a Senate bill aiming for a ban, rewriting it to be a regulatory measure instead. This deep ideological divide between the House and the more conservative Senate makes a compromise on a total prohibition highly improbable within the short remaining timeframe. Secondly, there is significant economic opposition from the $8 billion Texas hemp industry, supported by the state's Agriculture Commissioner. This creates a powerful lobby against such a disruptive ban. The status quo is for these products to be legal, and overcoming legislative inertia and powerful interest groups to pass a full ban is a formidable challenge.\n\nThe probability is not zero because last-minute, unpredictable deals can occur at the end of a legislative session. However, given the clear and recent actions by the House, the path to a full ban is almost completely blocked. I would update my forecast higher if there were credible reports of a major compromise emerging from a conference committee. I would update lower as the legislative session clock runs out without such a deal materializing.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill the state of Texas ban THC before July 1, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nBeaumont Enterprise: [Will THC see its final death blow in Texas this session?](https://www.beaumontenterprise.com/news/article/texas-senate-bill-aims-ban-thc-activists-call-20279801.php)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if before July 1, 2025, Texas enacts a law prohibiting the sale of THC. If no new prohibitions on the sale of THC become law in Texas before that date, this question resolves as No.\n\nFor it to count, a law must fully prohibit the sale of THC within the state. This question resolves upon a ban being signed into law, rather than when it is implemented. An enacted law being later overturned will not cause the question to re-resolve. Partial bans (for example laws prohibiting the sale of THC to persons under 21 years of age) will not count. This question pertains to the sale of THC within the state, not to the purchase of it by individuals.\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nThe Texas House of Representatives has shown resistance to a full THC ban, instead advancing measures to expand medical cannabis access.

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
