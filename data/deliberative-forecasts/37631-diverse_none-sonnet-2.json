    "review": "The other forecasters provide valuable additional analytical depth. Forecaster 3's quantitative volatility framework (Tesla ~20% vs Walmart ~7% standard deviation over 45 days) is particularly compelling and more sophisticated than my initial analysis. Both forecasters also offer more specific assessments of current positioning - Forecaster 2 indicates Tesla is slightly ahead (status quo 'No'), while Forecaster 3 suggests Walmart is already ahead or neck-and-neck. This discrepancy highlights important uncertainty about the exact current state. Forecaster 3's observation about catalyst timing is excellent - Walmart's mid-May earnings could widen any lead immediately, while Tesla's Q2 deliveries catalyst comes after the resolution date. This temporal sequencing favors Walmart. Forecaster 2's caution about Tesla's ability to rally quickly on positive news is well-taken and prevents overconfidence. The tight clustering of forecasts (55-62%) suggests reasonable convergence on a near-even but slightly Walmart-favoring outcome.",
    "rationale": "After reviewing the other analyses, I'm updating my forecast modestly upward. The key factors influencing my update are: (1) Forecaster 3's volatility-based framework provides quantitative support for why a lower-volatility stock (Walmart) should maintain any current lead over a short horizon; (2) The catalyst timing argument is compelling - Walmart's imminent earnings event (mid-May, essentially now) could strengthen its position before resolution, while Tesla's main catalyst (Q2 deliveries) comes after June 27; (3) Both forecasters suggest the companies are very close or Walmart may already be ahead, which combined with the short 6.5-week timeframe and volatility differential, slightly favors persistence of current ordering. However, I'm not updating dramatically because: (a) uncertainty remains about exact current positioning, (b) Tesla's demonstrated ability to rally quickly on positive news or narrative shifts remains a real factor, and (c) the outcome genuinely is close to a coin flip with meaningful two-way risk. My forecast of 61% (up from 60%) reflects these considerations while remaining within the reasonable consensus range of 55-62%.",
