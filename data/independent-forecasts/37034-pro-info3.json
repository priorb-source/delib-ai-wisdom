  "information": "Several major energy and service companies reported on their performance in Q1 2025. Halliburton reported declining profits in North America due to decreased drilling activity. Baker Hughes' oilfield services division saw a 10% sequential drop in revenue. In contrast, Occidental Petroleum announced a capital expenditures plan of $7 billion to $7.2 billion for 2025, with $3.7 billion allocated to the Permian Basin. The company plans to operate 24 gross drilling rigs and bring 500 to 550 new wells online in the Permian during the year.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Approximately 5 weeks.",
    "status_quo_outcome": "The current trend of declining or stagnant drilling activity continues, leading to the rig count remaining below the 583 threshold. This would result in a 'Yes' outcome.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "A significant and sustained rally in oil and gas prices, potentially triggered by a major geopolitical supply disruption, incentivizes producers to rapidly deploy rigs. This reversal of the recent downward trend pushes the active rig count to 583 or higher by the end of May.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Capital discipline among producers persists, and drilling efficiencies continue to limit the need for new rigs. The slowdown in North American activity reported by service companies in Q1 2025 continues through Q2, causing the rig count to fall or stagnate, ultimately remaining below 583.",
    "rationale": "My forecast is primarily based on the most recent available data, which are the Q1 2025 reports from major oilfield service companies. Both Halliburton and Baker Hughes reported declining activity and revenue in North America, which is a strong leading indicator for the rig count. This suggests that E&P companies are reducing drilling programs, likely due to a combination of capital discipline, focus on shareholder returns, and moderate commodity prices. This recent trend supports the continuation of a stagnant or declining rig count, making it likely to be below the 583 threshold. While Occidental Petroleum's significant investment in the Permian is a bullish counterpoint, it represents the strategy of a single large producer and appears insufficient to counteract the broader industry-wide slowdown. The timeframe of just five weeks until the resolution date also favors the status quo, as it would require a significant market catalyst to reverse the current momentum and add a substantial number of rigs. My probability is not higher because energy markets are volatile and a sudden geopolitical event could spike prices and incentivize a rapid increase in drilling. It is not lower because the evidence from the service companies, which are at the heart of drilling operations, is compelling and points clearly towards a current slowdown. I would lower my probability of a 'Yes' outcome if there were a sustained oil price increase above $95/bbl or if multiple large producers announced revised, higher drilling budgets. I would raise my probability if oil prices fell or if subsequent weekly rig count reports showed further declines.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill the number of active US drilling rigs be less than 583 for the week ending May 30, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nSeekingAlpha: [U.S. rig count falls for third straight week, Baker Hughes says](https://seekingalpha.com/news/4430543-u-s-rig-count-falls-for-third-straight-week-baker-hughes-says)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if the last count of active US drilling rigs for the week ending May 30, 2025, according to the [Baker Hughes North America Rig Count](https://rigcount.bakerhughes.com/na-rig-count), is less than 583. Specifically, it will resolve based on the number listed as the United States Total for the most recent week in the May 30, 2025 North America Rig Count Report. This is the number of active drilling rigs and includes the total of those classified as gas, oil and miscellaneous, in every US location including inland waters, land and offshore.\n\nIf no report dated May 30, 2025, is released before June 1, 2025, Eastern Time, Metaculus may resolve this question using the most recent report available dated between May 23, 2025, and June 1, 2025, inclusive. If no such report exists, this question will be annulled.\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nSeveral major energy and service companies reported on their performance in Q1 2025.

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
