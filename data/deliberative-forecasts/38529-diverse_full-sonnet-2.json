    "review": "All three forecasts converge remarkably in the 77-88% range, differing by only 11 percentage points despite independent analysis. This tight clustering validates that 80% is likely well-calibrated. Forecaster 2 makes a compelling argument I hadn't fully emphasized: Cuomo's near-universal name recognition and resource advantage create a 'high floor' of support that makes collapse unlikely, and overcoming a 16-point deficit in just two weeks requires extraordinary circumstances. Forecaster 3 raises valid counterconcerns about anti-Cuomo consolidation in RCV and progressive turnout potential, but may be overweighting these given that the Marist RCV simulation already accounts for ranked-choice dynamics and still shows Cuomo winning with over 50%. The key empirical point from Forecaster 3 about Cuomo's coalition (older, moderate Democrats, Latino and Orthodox communities) being historically reliable in NYC primaries is strong evidence for stability rather than volatility.",
    "rationale": "After reviewing both analyses, I find Forecaster 2's emphasis on the practical difficulty of late movement particularly persuasive. In US primary elections, 16-point deficits are rarely overcome in the final two weeks, especially when the leader has Cuomo's advantages. His $2.5 million in outside spending, established coalition support, and high name recognition create structural barriers to a rapid Mamdani surge. Early voting begins imminently, which will lock in a substantial portion of votes before any potential late developments. While I acknowledge Forecaster 3's concerns about RCV consolidation and progressive turnout, the Marist simulation already modeled ranked-choice dynamics and showed Cuomo clearing 50% by round five. This suggests the anti-Cuomo vote would need to consolidate even more dramatically than the simulation assumed. The narrowing from May (Cuomo +32) to late May (Cuomo +16) shows Mamdani momentum, but he's still far behind with time running out. My original 80% forecast appropriately balances Forecaster 2's structural arguments for stability against Forecaster 3's legitimate uncertainty factors. The tight expert consensus around 77-88% confirms this is the right range.",
