    "review": "Both forecasters make essentially the same core points I did: DV is statutory, short horizon favors continuity, and the main downside risks are technical (URL/slug change without a redirect, strict interpretation of “at this location,” or transient downtime). Forecaster 2 and 3 both explicitly flag the “moment-of-check” risk and the ambiguity about whether a 301/302 counts—good clarifications. They also note that even if policy changed, agencies often retain the URL, which further reduces policy-driven risk before July 1. I don’t see new evidence that materially shifts the balance; rather, their analyses reinforce a high but not near-certain probability.",
    "rationale": "The key drivers remain: (1) DV program persistence and the need for congressional action to eliminate it; (2) State’s tendency to keep stable URLs/redirects; and (3) very short time until resolution. Residual risk stems from: a CMS reorg or slug change that drops or misroutes this exact path; a strict reading of “at this location” that might not accept a redirect; and small chance of an outage at the time Metaculus checks. Netting these, the probability stays in the low-to-mid 90s. The peers’ points align with mine; the only nuance that could move the needle is the one-shot access attempt risk, which I had already factored. With no new concrete signals of an imminent site migration or policy change, I’m holding my estimate.",
