    "review": "The other forecasters and I share a strong consensus that cancellation is unlikely. We all correctly identify the primary barriers: the extremely short timeframe (less than a month), Bulgaria's massive outstanding debt (~€2 billion), and the fact that recent talks a month ago focused on renegotiation rather than termination. Forecaster 3 raised a particularly compelling point that I had not fully articulated: Turkey has a strong incentive to keep the contract legally active to preserve its leverage and its claim on the accumulated debt, rather than moving the dispute into a more complex international arbitration. Forecaster 2 also provides a useful frame by describing Bulgaria's diversification efforts as long-term strategic positioning, correctly pointing out they do not enable an imminent cancellation. Both analyses reinforce the view that the structural and financial barriers to cancellation are immense.",
    "rationale": "After reviewing my peers' analyses, I am reinforcing my initial assessment. My original forecast of 15% was based on the powerful financial and legal constraints preventing cancellation, balanced against the small but non-zero chance of a desperate, unilateral political move by Bulgaria due to the crippling daily costs. The argument raised by Forecaster 3, highlighting Turkey's own incentive to keep the contract alive to maintain leverage over the debt, is highly convincing and reduces the overall probability of a 'Yes' resolution. It makes a Turkish-initiated termination very improbable, leaving a legally-precarious Bulgarian unilateral cancellation as the primary, and very unlikely, path to a 'Yes'. The combined weight of the arguments—the debt acting as an anchor, Turkey's incentive to not cancel, and the extremely short timeline—justifies a slight downward adjustment of my forecast. I am lowering my probability from 15% to 13% to reflect a stronger conviction that the status quo will hold through the end of the month.",
