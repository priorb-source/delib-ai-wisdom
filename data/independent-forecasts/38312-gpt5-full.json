  "information": "As of early June 2025, India has not received an official invitation to the G7 summit scheduled to take place in Canada from June 15-17. Multiple media outlets, including The Tribune and the Hindustan Times, have reported this, citing official sources. These reports indicate that no advance preparations for a high-level visit from India are underway. This is contrary to the protocol for such trips, which are typically planned weeks in advance for security and logistical coordination. Canada has extended invitations to other non-G7 countries, including Australia, Ukraine, South Africa, and Brazil.\n\nDiplomatic relations between India and Canada were impacted following the killing of Khalistani separatist leader Hardeep Singh Nijjar in Canada in June 2023. The previous Canadian government under Justin Trudeau had made allegations regarding Indian government involvement, which India denied. Following a change in government, new Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney and Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi exchanged messages expressing a desire to strengthen bilateral ties. However, Indian officials have stated concerns regarding the activities of Khalistani elements in Canada and expect Ottawa to guarantee the safety of Indian diplomats.\n\nSikh organizations in Canada, including the 'Sikh Federation' and the 'World Sikh Organization', have publicly demanded that the Canadian government not invite Prime Minister Modi to the G7 summit. They have cited the Indian government's alleged involvement in the murder of Hardeep Singh Nijjar and other human rights concerns. In a letter to Prime Minister Mark Carney, the World Sikh Organization of Canada stated that inviting the Indian Prime Minister would be an 'irresponsible decision' and would signal that Canada is willing to ignore foreign interference.",

    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "About 12–14 days, until the G7 Summit concludes (June 15–17, 2025).",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Canada never issues an invitation to India or does so too late for security/logistics; India is represented by the External Affairs Minister or Sherpa instead; Modi remains in India or travels elsewhere.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "A late diplomatic thaw leads Canada to extend an outreach invitation within days; India rapidly accepts; security and logistics are expedited; Modi flies to the summit venue and joins at least one leaders’ session in person.",
    "rationale": "Weighting the status quo heavily: As of June 3, multiple outlets report no official invitation to India, and no visible advance preparations for a PM-level trip—both atypical this close to a G7 leaders’ summit. Canada has already invited several non-G7 partners (Australia, Ukraine, South Africa, Brazil), suggesting the outreach list may be close to set. India–Canada ties remain sensitive post-Nijjar, and Canadian domestic pressure from Sikh groups argues against inviting Modi. Security/logistics for a G7 attendance are complex and usually locked in weeks ahead; adding a high-profile principal on 10–12 days’ notice is possible but unlikely. Precedent also permits a Canada-hosted G7 without India (e.g., 2018 outreach did not include India). Countervailing considerations that keep the probability above zero: a potential political desire by new PM Mark Carney to signal a reset with India; the G7’s interest in engaging major Global South actors; India’s willingness to accept late invitations for high-visibility multilateral platforms; and the theoretical feasibility of a compressed program where Modi appears for a single in-person session that meets the resolution criteria. What would move me up: an official Canadian invitation; MEA/PMO advance notices; reports of Indian security/advance teams deploying to the venue; Canada posting an agenda listing India among outreach leaders; credible flight-watch or NOTAMs consistent with a PM visit. What would move me down: Canada publishing a final guest list without India; MEA signaling India will be represented below PM level; explicit reporting that no invitation will be extended or that India declined.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill India's PM Narendra Modi attend the G7 Summit in June 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nTimes of India: [Canada invites Australia, Ukraine for G7 meet but no call for India yet](https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/canada-invites-australia-ukraine-for-g7-meet-but-no-call-for-india-yet/articleshow/121398906.cms)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below.

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
