    "review": "The other two forecasters reached remarkably similar conclusions to my own, indicating a strong consensus. We all identify the core dynamic as a contest between the PNM's incumbency advantage and the historically close nature of Trinidad and Tobago elections, which gives the opposition UNC a substantial chance of victory. Forecaster 3's analysis and 62% probability are almost identical to my initial assessment. Forecaster 2 arrives at a slightly lower 58%, giving a little more weight to the incumbent's specific vulnerabilities like crime and cost of living. This was a valuable emphasis, as it gives more texture to the general risk I had identified. However, no new evidence or fundamentally different line of reasoning was presented that I had not already considered. The deliberation process primarily served to reinforce the key variables and the general level of uncertainty.",
    "rationale": "After reviewing the other analyses, I will maintain my original forecast of 62%. The reasoning provided by the other forecasters strongly aligns with my own. The consensus is that in a stable, competitive two-party system with no new polling data or major event-driven news, the incumbent party (PNM) should be considered the modest favorite. My 62% forecast already accounts for the significant possibility of a UNC victory, which is driven by the narrow 22-19 seat margin from the 2020 election and persistent national issues that create anti-incumbent sentiment, as highlighted by Forecaster 2. A very small swing in a few marginal seats could easily change the outcome. The other forecasts did not introduce any new information that would compel me to adjust the weights I placed on these competing factors. The narrow spread of forecasts (58%-62%) suggests we are all interpreting the low-information environment in a similar way, and my initial probability remains a well-reasoned position within that consensus.",
