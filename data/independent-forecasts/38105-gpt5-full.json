  "information": "As of late May 2025, an International Monetary Fund (IMF) mission is in Beirut for formal negotiations with the Lebanese government. The first negotiating session took place on May 29-30, with a second round scheduled for June 10. According to officials, a draft 46-month Extended Fund Facility (EFF) worth approximately US$3 billion is being discussed. Lebanon's Finance Minister, Yassine Jaber, stated that there has been progress in the talks, describing them as being on a 'good track.' He also affirmed that the government's plan involves better collection of existing taxes rather than imposing new ones. The Lebanese negotiating team includes the Minister of Economy, the Governor of the Central Bank, and other experts, meeting with the IMF delegation led by Ernesto Rigo.\n\nThe IMF has conditioned an agreement on the implementation of several key reforms. While Lebanon has completed some prior actions, including passing amendments to the bank-secrecy law and establishing an electricity-tariff framework, significant obstacles remain. The passage of a bank-restructuring law and measures to control the cash economy are described as unresolved and politically contentious issues. The IMF has publicly characterized the progress in talks as 'slow' and has expressed specific concerns about provisions in the proposed banking reform law, including the composition of a 'Higher Banking Authority' and the scope of its powers.\n\nSeveral international actors are involved in Lebanon's economic recovery efforts. The European Union has announced that a 500 million euro aid payment is conditional on Lebanon restructuring its banking sector and securing an agreement with the IMF. Separately, the World Bank is in active discussions with Lebanese officials regarding a 'Lebanon Emergency Assistance Project' (LEAP) aimed at reconstruction. A meeting to present this project to donor countries and international institutions is scheduled for June 10. On the domestic front, Lebanese President Joseph Aoun has publicly emphasized the importance of reaching an agreement with the IMF before the summer of 2025.",

    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "About 32 days (until July 1, 2025)",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No agreement announced and signed with IMF Board approval by July 1, 2025",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Talks yield, at best, a staff-level agreement in mid-to-late June, but Lebanon does not complete IMF prior actions (notably a credible bank-restructuring law and cash-economy controls) in time. Without completed prior actions, the IMF staff cannot finalize the Board paper, and no Executive Board approval is scheduled before July 1. Alternatively, negotiations slip past June, or domestic politics stall needed legislation.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Lebanon rapidly passes an IMF-compliant bank-restructuring law and other prior actions by mid-June; an SLA is reached around June 10–15; the LOI/MEFP are finalized and transmitted; IMF staff completes the report and circulates it quickly; the Executive Board schedules and approves a 46‑month EFF (or an emergency RFI) by the final days of June, with an announcement that the IMF is providing financing.",
    "rationale": "- Summary of current state (from research assistant): An IMF mission is in Beirut, with first negotiating session May 29–30 and a second round on June 10. A 46‑month EFF (~$3B) is under discussion. Officials say talks are on a “good track,” but the IMF characterizes progress as slow and has specific concerns about the bank-restructuring law and governance arrangements. EU aid (EUR 500m) is conditional on banking reform and an IMF agreement. A donor presentation (World Bank’s LEAP) is set for June 10. Lebanese leadership is publicly pressing for a deal before summer 2025.\n- What the resolution requires: An announced, signed agreement in which the IMF agrees to provide money. In practice, that implies IMF Executive Board approval of a financing arrangement (e.g., EFF, RFI). A staff-level agreement alone does not constitute the IMF agreeing to provide money.\n- Timing mechanics: Even in a best-case scenario, after a June 10 round, Lebanon would need to complete prior actions (notably a contentious bank-restructuring law), finalize the LOI/MEFP, allow staff to draft and clear the Board paper, circulate it (typically at least a week), and secure a Board meeting and approval—all before July 1. That sequencing is tight and historically challenging for Lebanon, which has already seen a 2022 SLA languish without Board approval.\n- Status quo weight: Lebanon’s reform track record and IMF’s own statements (“slow” progress; concerns with the draft law) suggest inertia favors slippage beyond July. Passing politically sensitive reforms in weeks is unlikely.\n- Why not higher: 1) Significant unresolved prior actions; 2) IMF governance cautions about the bank-restructuring framework; 3) Board scheduling/logistics within June; 4) Lebanon’s history of delay since the 2022 SLA.\n- Why not lower: 1) Active mission and defined negotiating calendar (June 10 round); 2) Strong external incentives (EU conditionality; donor engagement); 3) Political signaling to close before summer; 4) A small chance of an emergency window (e.g., RFI) if conditions deteriorate and the IMF opts for rapid support.\n- What would move me up: Parliament passes an IMF-compliant bank-restructuring law within days; credible completion of other prior actions; IMF press releases indicating a staff-level agreement plus explicit intent to take the program to the Board in June; appearance of a specific Board date on IMF calendars; or news of a fast-tracked emergency facility consideration.\n- What would move me down: Reports that talks are extended beyond mid-June; IMF signals that prior actions won’t be completed in time; parliamentary delays/alterations unacceptable to IMF; or the mission departs without an SLA or with vague timelines.",

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
