  "information": "A historical analysis of the National UFO Reporting Center (NUFORC) database from 2015 to 2024 identified between four and six pilot reports originating from Africa over the ten-year period. The specific countries mentioned for these past reports include South Africa, Egypt, Nigeria, Kenya, and Rwanda. Globally, pilot reports typically account for approximately 1% of the 5,000 to 6,000 total UFO sightings logged by NUFORC annually.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Approximately 40 days. The outcome will be known on or after July 1, 2025, when Metaculus checks the NUFORC database for any pilot reports from African countries during June 2025.",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No - historically, pilot reports from Africa to NUFORC are extremely rare.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "June 2025 passes without any pilots flying over African airspace observing unusual aerial phenomena, or if they do observe something, they either don't report it to NUFORC or the report is submitted after June or not posted by the time of verification.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "A commercial or private pilot flying anywhere over the African continent in June 2025 observes a UFO/UAP, submits a report to NUFORC during or shortly after June, and NUFORC posts this report to their database before Metaculus verifies on July 1 or shortly thereafter.",
    "rationale": "The research assistant's data shows 4-6 pilot reports from Africa over 10 years (2015-2024), which equals 0.4-0.6 reports per year, or approximately 0.033-0.05 reports per month. Using the midpoint of 5 reports over 120 months yields a baseline probability of approximately 4.2% for any given month. The status quo strongly favors a No outcome - these reports are exceptionally rare across the entire African continent. While the January 2025 Rwanda sighting shows recent activity, this doesn't establish a trend since we'd expect occasional reports at the historical rate. Key considerations: (1) The sample size is very small, creating high uncertainty, (2) No special circumstances suggest June 2025 would differ from historical patterns, (3) Pilot reports depend on multiple factors - actual observations, willingness to report, and NUFORC's posting timing. My forecast is not higher because the historical base rate is very low and I'm applying appropriate status quo bias - the world changes slowly. It's not lower because the historical data, while sparse, does confirm these reports occasionally occur, and we're looking at all 54 African countries over a 30-day period. To update higher, I'd need evidence of increased UFO activity in Africa, more pilots filing reports generally, or specific June events likely to generate sightings. To update lower, I'd need evidence that NUFORC reporting from Africa has declined or that the historical reports were anomalous.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill a pilot report of UFOs come from a country in Africa in June 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nFor example, the resolution source [reports](https://nuforc.org/sighting/?id=186297) a 4 craft inline formation of UFOs having been sighted on January 1, 2025 in Rwanda.\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if The National UFO Reporting Center posts a pilot report of a UFO/UAP having occurred in a country on the African continent, during the month of June 2025 at [this link](https://nuforc.org/subndx/?id=x) when accessed by Metaculus on or after July 1, 2025.\n\n\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nA historical analysis of the National UFO Reporting Center (NUFORC) database from 2015 to 2024 identified between four and six pilot reports originating from Africa over the ten-year period. The specific countries mentioned for these past reports include South Africa, Egypt, Nigeria, Kenya, and Rwanda. Globally, pilot reports typically account for approximately 1% of the 5,000 to 6,000 total UFO sightings logged by NUFORC annually.\n\nToday is 2025-05-22.\n\nBefore answering you think:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n(e) You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
