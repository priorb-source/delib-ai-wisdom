    "review": "All three forecasts appropriately cluster in the 42-55% range, reflecting the significant uncertainty from lacking baseline data. Forecaster 2's analysis (48%) closely mirrors my original reasoning, emphasizing near-maximum uncertainty with slight caution favoring Erdoğan's historical resilience. Forecaster 3's higher forecast (55%) introduces a compelling structural argument I underweighted: Turkey's persistent economic challenges (inflation, currency depreciation) likely create sustained headwinds for Erdoğan's approval ratings. This is a valid point - economic performance strongly correlates with leader approval, and while Erdoğan has shown electoral resilience, approval ratings tend to be more volatile than vote shares. Forecaster 3 also correctly notes that long-serving leaders often experience 'approval fatigue.' However, I remain somewhat skeptical of going as high as 55% because: (1) Erdoğan has demonstrated remarkable resilience despite economic challenges throughout his tenure, (2) the one-month timeframe strongly favors status quo persistence, and (3) without actual baseline data, we're operating in near-total darkness about current standings. All three analyses would benefit tremendously from the January 2025 data that supposedly exists but wasn't provided.",
    "rationale": "After reviewing the other forecasters' analyses, I'm updating my forecast modestly upward. Forecaster 3's argument about Turkey's structural economic problems creating sustained headwinds for Erdoğan's approval is persuasive and represents concrete reasoning I should weight more heavily. High inflation and currency issues typically depress leader approval ratings significantly. Spain, while facing its own challenges with coalition government dynamics, operates in a more economically stable environment. However, I'm not updating as high as 55% because: (1) Erdoğan has consistently defied expectations about how economic troubles would impact his support, (2) the extremely short timeframe (33 days) makes dramatic rating shifts unlikely regardless of underlying conditions, and (3) the complete lack of baseline data means we don't know if Sánchez is currently ahead, behind, or tied with Erdoğan. My updated forecast of 46% represents a modest increase from 42%, acknowledging the validity of the structural economic argument while maintaining appropriate caution given the information vacuum and short resolution timeframe.",
