    "review": "The other forecasters raised several critical points I had underweighted or missed:\n\n1. **Sample size constraint**: Forecaster 3's observation that pilot reports nationwide average only 8-12 per month is crucial. With such small numbers, we're essentially asking whether Florida gets 2-3 reports while all other states get fewer - a much tighter probability space than I initially considered.\n\n2. **Tie resolution rule**: Both forecasters emphasized that ties resolve as No, which substantially reduces the Yes probability. With low counts, ties become highly probable.\n\n3. **Competition from other states**: Forecaster 2 highlighted Arizona's elevated pilot/military UAP activity in government datasets, which I hadn't considered. Forecaster 3 emphasized California's historical dominance. This suggests Florida faces strong competition from multiple states.\n\n4. **Question ambiguity**: Forecaster 2 correctly noted the title mentions March but resolution criteria specify June 2025. I forecasted for June but didn't explicitly address this discrepancy.\n\nHowever, I find some of my original reasoning still holds:\n- Florida's aviation density, military presence, and Space Coast activity remain valid factors\n- The March 2025 military incident, while 2-3 months old by June, represents a concrete data point\n- My 28% wasn't dramatically different from Forecaster 3's 25%\n\nThe most compelling new argument is the sample size constraint combined with tie risk. This suggests my original forecast was somewhat too optimistic.",
    "rationale": "Updating my analysis with the critical insight about sample sizes: if there are truly only 8-12 pilot reports nationwide per month, Florida needs to secure 2-3 reports while every other state gets fewer. This is a much narrower path to Yes than I initially modeled.\n\nThe tie-resolves-as-No rule is particularly punishing in low-count scenarios. If FL, CA, and AZ each get 1 report, that's a No. If FL gets 2 but CA also gets 2, that's a No. The combinatorics heavily favor No outcomes.\n\nHowever, I'm not dropping to 18% because:\n1. Florida genuinely has high aviation activity and recent incident history\n2. The March military encounter could sustain elevated reporting through June\n3. A single multi-crew event (say, multiple pilots reporting the same phenomenon over the Gulf) could generate 2+ Florida reports in one incident\n4. Florida's year-round operations and launch activity create multiple pathways to clustering\n\nBalancing the strong base-rate arguments for lower probability (small samples, tie risk, competition) against Florida's legitimate structural advantages, I'm updating downward but not dramatically. The 18-25% range suggested by other forecasters seems reasonable, and I'll position in the middle of that range.",
