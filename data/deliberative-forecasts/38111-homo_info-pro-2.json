    "review": "Forecaster 2's analysis is compelling and well-reasoned. The key insight I hadn't fully weighted is the distinction between a political declaration of intent at the June conference versus a formal, official announcement of recognition that would satisfy the resolution criteria. This highlights a very plausible failure mode where the diplomatic push is successful in spirit, but the official act slips past the June 30 deadline. Forecaster 3's analysis, while rightly pointing out the powerful forces of inertia and external pressure, seems to underweight the specificity and strength of the current evidence. The combination of a G7-led initiative (France/UK), a designated action-forcing event (the June UN conference), and specific intelligence (Axios report on Malta) represents a significant deviation from the status quo that a 35% forecast does not, in my view, adequately capture.",
    "rationale": "My initial forecast of 85% was based on the strong confluence of evidence pointing to a coordinated diplomatic action in June. This includes public statements from France, the UK joining the initiative, and a planned UN conference specifically for this purpose. However, after reviewing my colleagues' analyses, I am lowering my forecast. The most persuasive argument came from Forecaster 2, who highlighted the risk that countries might issue a political declaration of intent at the conference, but delay the formal, legally-binding act of recognition until after June. This is a common occurrence in diplomacy and represents the most significant risk of this question resolving 'No' despite the clear political momentum. This nuance makes my initial 85% appear overconfident. I am not decreasing my forecast further, as I believe Forecaster 3 underestimates the power of this concerted, high-profile push and the fact that the 'dam has broken' with the 2024 recognitions, making it easier for others to follow. My updated forecast of 78% reflects a continued belief that recognition in June is the most likely outcome, while incorporating a greater probability for procedural or strategic delays that push the formal announcement into July or later.",
