    "review": "My initial forecast of 68% 'Yes' was based on historical precedent and voter commitment data. However, the other forecasters introduced crucial new evidence that reshaped my assessment. Forecaster 2 presented recent, multi-source polling data from April 2025 showing a consistent and significant Liberal lead of 4.9 to 7.4 percentage points. This is a powerful, concrete piece of evidence I had not considered. Forecaster 3 argued for a 'Yes' outcome based on long-term polling trends showing Conservative strength over the past year, suggesting a fundamental desire for change. I found Forecaster 2's reasoning most convincing. Their evidence is more recent and specific, and therefore a better indicator of the current state of the race. It fundamentally changes the 'status quo' from a tight race to a clear Liberal lead. While Forecaster 3's points about underlying voter discontent are valid and suggest a Conservative comeback is possible, that possibility must be weighed against the hard data of the present moment.",
    "rationale": "I am making a significant update to my forecast, lowering the probability of a 'Yes' outcome from 68% to 22%. This dramatic change is driven entirely by the new polling data introduced by Forecaster 2. My initial analysis, which relied on voter enthusiasm and the precedent of the 2019 and 2021 elections, is superseded by concrete polling that shows the Conservatives are not leading, but are in fact trailing by a significant margin of 5-7 points. For the Conservatives to win the popular vote, they would now need to engineer a substantial turnaround in public opinion over the next six months. While not impossible, especially given the long-term trends Forecaster 3 noted, a party with a lead of this magnitude is the clear favorite. My updated forecast of 22% reflects that a Conservative victory is now the less likely scenario. The probability is not lower because six months is a long time in politics, and a comeback is plausible. However, based on the current evidence, the Liberal Party is in a commanding position to win the popular vote.",
