    "review": "Both forecasters highlight similar facts and base rates I used, but they stress a 1–4 month closure window and the product’s very short shelf life, arguing for a decent chance of a May close-out. They also note FSIS admin/verification lag risk. I agree with their process framing and that practical risk is low, but they don’t fully account for the resolution depending on FSIS updating the webpage before June 1—even if the close-out decision occurs earlier, a posting lag would still resolve No. That keeps me below their 57%.",
    "rationale": "I still see inertia as the dominant force: it’s Active on May 8 with ~23 days left. For a small, single-state, vending-machine recall with expired product and straightforward corrective action, eventual closure is highly likely, but timing is the hurdle. FSIS effectiveness checks and corrective-action verification, plus any administrative backlog, commonly push closures beyond arbitrary dates. The added risk that the webpage update may lag past June 1 further biases toward No. That said, the small scope and the approaching three-month mark do meaningfully raise the chance of closure within May. Balancing these, I’m nudging up slightly from 44% to 48%, reflecting a modestly higher hazard of a mid-to-late May close while still keeping a slight lean to No due to status quo and update-lag risk.",
