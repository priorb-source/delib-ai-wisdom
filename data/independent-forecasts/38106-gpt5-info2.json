  "information": "In February 2025, there was media speculation, particularly from French sources, about a potential visit by Donald Trump to Moscow for the Victory Day celebrations on May 9, 2025. Former Russian Prime Minister Sergey Stepanov commented at the time that such a visit would be a 'big sensation.' On February 12, 2025, Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin held a 1.5-hour phone call during which they agreed to a personal meeting and extended mutual invitations to Washington and Moscow. The speculated May 9 visit did not occur.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "About 32 days (until July 1, 2025)",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "No trip to Russia is announced or executed in June; any Trump–Putin interaction is deferred, held in a third country, or planned for after July 1.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "A rapidly arranged, publicly announced June visit to Moscow or St. Petersburg (e.g., a bilateral summit, ceasefire talks, or an appearance around SPIEF) with Trump physically on Russian soil before July 1.",
    "rationale": "Baseline: The world changes slowly and presidential foreign trips are usually signposted. With roughly a month left, there is no credible, public reporting of a June Russia visit. The previously speculated May 9 Moscow trip did not occur. While Trump and Putin reportedly agreed in February to meet and exchanged invitations, such a meeting has many venues besides Russia. Constraints: Visiting Russia during the ongoing war would be highly controversial domestically, complex diplomatically, and logistically demanding (advance teams, security, airspace/route coordination). Surprise, clandestine travel to Russia by a U.S. president is atypical; Russia would likely want to publicize any visit. Typical lead times and political signaling are absent as of May 30. Why not higher: Lack of concrete preparatory signals; high political costs; multiple lower-cost alternatives (neutral-site summit or later timing). Why not lower: Trump’s unpredictability, the February mutual invitations, and a plausible hook (e.g., SPIEF in early June or a sudden diplomatic initiative like a ceasefire/prisoner exchange) keep a small tail risk. Update signals upward: Credible reports from the White House/Kremlin of a planned June visit; sightings of U.S. advance teams in Russia; official schedule placeholders; U.S. participation signals around SPIEF; NOTAMs/flight movements consistent with a presidential trip. Update downward: Firm public scheduling that precludes a Russia trip, clear statements ruling out travel, or deteriorating conditions that make such travel infeasible.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill Donald Trump visit Russia before July 1, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nWikipedia: [List of international presidential trips made by Donald Trump](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_international_presidential_trips_made_by_Donald_Trump)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if, after May 19, 2025 and before July 1, 2025, President Donald Trump personally visits Russia.\n\n\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nIn February 2025, there was media speculation, particularly from French sources, about a potential visit by Donald Trump to Moscow for the Victory Day celebrations on May 9, 2025.

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
