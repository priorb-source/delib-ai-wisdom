  "information": "The government of Benin closed its land border crossings with Nigeria's Kwara state around May 6-8, 2025. The specific crossing mentioned is between Taberu village in Baruten Local Government Area, Kwara State, and the neighboring Tanu village in Benin. On May 9, 2025, Benin extended its border security operations to the Sèmè and Owode borders in Lagos State. Stated reasons for the closure include concerns over arms smuggling, the emergence of a new militant group known as 'Mahmuda', and unregulated exportation of agricultural products like soya beans and cashews. Reports mentioned intelligence regarding the illegal importation of arms and ammunition from Parakou, Benin, into Nigeria.\n\nOn May 14, 2025, the Nigerian House of Representatives passed a resolution urging the Federal Government to engage in dialogue with the Republic of Benin to resolve the blockade. The motion highlighted the strain on bilateral relations and the disruption to seasonal trade critical to the livelihood of border communities. As of late May 2025, neither the Nigerian nor the Beninese government had issued any public statements suggesting an imminent reopening. On May 30, an AFRICOM briefing noted a deteriorating security threat environment along the Benin-Nigeria frontier.\n\nHistorical data on similar situations in West Africa show that border closures motivated by security concerns often persist for many months. For example, Nigeria's border closure with Benin in 2019-2020 lasted for about 16 months. Similarly, Benin's border with Niger, closed after the 2023 coup, remained shut many months later. A review of 15 security-related border closures in the ECOWAS region since 2015 indicates that approximately 20% were reopened within 60 days. Reopenings within two months are more common when the reasons are purely commercial or administrative, rather than related to terrorism or arms smuggling.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "31 days (until July 1, 2025)",
    "status_quo_outcome": "The border remains closed through July 1, 2025",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "The security concerns regarding arms smuggling and the Mahmuda militant group persist, diplomatic negotiations between Nigeria and Benin move slowly or stall, and Benin maintains its border closure policy to address both security and agricultural export regulation issues. No agreement is reached by July 1.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Intensive diplomatic engagement between Nigeria and Benin yields a breakthrough agreement. Nigeria provides credible security assurances to address arms smuggling concerns, both nations establish monitoring mechanisms for agricultural exports, and political pressure from affected border communities accelerates negotiations, leading to border reopening before July 1.",
    "rationale": "The border has been closed for approximately 23 days with only 31 days remaining until the resolution deadline. Historical precedent strongly favors continued closure: only 20% of security-related border closures in ECOWAS reopened within 60 days, and past Nigeria-Benin closures have lasted many months (16 months in 2019-2020). The closure involves multiple serious concerns - arms smuggling, a new militant group (Mahmuda), and agricultural export regulation - making it more complex than purely commercial disputes. The May 30 AFRICOM briefing noted a deteriorating security environment, not improvement. While Nigeria's House of Representatives initiated diplomatic engagement on May 14, neither government has issued statements suggesting imminent reopening. The status quo strongly favors continued closure given the security nature of the concerns and the short timeframe remaining. However, the probability is not negligible because diplomatic pressure exists, economic disruption creates incentives for resolution, and 31 days theoretically allows time for an agreement. I'm forecasting well below the 20% historical base rate because we're already nearly halfway through the time window with no signs of progress and a recent report of deteriorating conditions. A forecast of 12% reflects the low but non-zero possibility of rapid diplomatic breakthrough.",

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any).
