    "review": "Both forecasters provide sound analyses that reinforce key aspects of my original reasoning. Forecaster 2 usefully confirms that Niger is specifically NOT among the 21 countries with Level 4 advisories and emphasizes that the State Department has deliberately maintained this distinction from Mali and Burkina Faso, suggesting a conscious policy choice rather than oversight. Forecaster 3's South Sudan example (March 2025 ordered departure triggering Level 4) provides valuable recent precedent showing that acute deterioration, not just ongoing poor conditions, typically drives upgrades. Both correctly emphasize the 'sticky' nature of bureaucratic systems and the short 2-month timeframe. The key insight I somewhat underweighted is the distinction between ongoing poor conditions (already reflected in Level 3) versus the acute triggering event needed for Level 4. My concern about the outdated advisory (pre-coup) remains valid, but the deliberate maintenance of Niger's lower status compared to neighbors suggests institutional inertia is strong. The forecasts cluster tightly (18%, 20%, 28%), indicating reasonable consensus that status quo is most likely but non-trivial risk exists.",
    "rationale": "After reviewing the other forecasters' analyses, I maintain that status quo is the most likely outcome, but I'm adjusting slightly upward. Key factors supporting a modest increase: (1) The South Sudan precedent shows Level 4 upgrades can happen quickly when acute events occur (ordered departure), and Niger's security environment makes such events plausible within 2 months; (2) The post-coup environment with withdrawn Western security partnerships creates elevated baseline risk; (3) While the State Department has maintained Niger at Level 3 despite poor conditions, this could change with a triggering event. However, I'm not moving to 28% because: (1) The deliberate policy choice to distinguish Niger from Mali/Burkina Faso suggests institutional resistance to upgrading; (2) No current signals indicate imminent policy review; (3) Level 4 requires acute deterioration, not just persistent poor conditions; (4) Two months remains a short window for major policy shifts in bureaucratic systems. The evidence suggests approximately 1-in-5 chance of an acute triggering event or policy reassessment leading to Level 4, balanced against strong status quo inertia.",
