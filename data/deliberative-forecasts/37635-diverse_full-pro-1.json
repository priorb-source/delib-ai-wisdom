    "review": "My initial forecast of 55% was too anchored to the status quo (Milei's 1-point lead in the latest poll). I found the arguments from the other two forecasters, particularly Forecaster 3, to be highly convincing. Forecaster 3 raised an essential point I had not adequately weighed: the 'tie resolves as No' rule. This is not a trivial detail; it mechanically disadvantages the 'Yes' position when the margin is so slim. Any scenario where Milei's lead disappears, even if he doesn't fall behind, results in a 'No'. Forecaster 3 also made a stronger case that the divergent domestic polling (very strong for Sheinbaum, negative for Milei) is a powerful leading indicator for where the Morning Consult numbers are likely to head, suggesting Milei's support is more fragile. Forecaster 2's point about recent volatility also reinforces that the 1-point lead is far from stable. Collectively, their arguments convinced me that my focus on the short time horizon favoring the status quo was misplaced given the clear headwinds for Milei and the structural advantage for the 'No' side.",
    "rationale": "After reviewing my peers' analyses, I am substantially updating my forecast downwards. My initial 55% forecast over-indexed on the status quo from the most recent Morning Consult (MC) data, where Milei led Sheinbaum 61% to 60%. The deliberations highlighted three critical factors I had underappreciated:\n\n1.  **The 'Tie Resolves as No' Rule:** This is the most important factor I missed. For a 'Yes' outcome, Milei must be *strictly* ahead. A tie is a 'No'. Given the 1-point margin, any relative a 1-point gain by Sheinbaum or a 1-point loss by Milei could lead to a tie, flipping the outcome. This structural detail makes the 'Yes' position significantly more fragile than a simple reading of the 61-60 poll suggests.\n\n2.  **Divergent Domestic Trends:** While MC is the resolution source, it is measuring an underlying reality that domestic polls also capture. The evidence is strong that Sheinbaum is in a honeymoon period with exceptionally high domestic approval (76%+), whereas Milei faces growing discontent and net-negative ratings (44% positive / 52% negative). Over the remaining ~6 weeks, it is more likely that these powerful domestic trends will cause Milei's MC rating to erode and Sheinbaum's to strengthen or hold, rather than the other way around.\n\n3.  **Recent Volatility:** As Forecaster 2 noted, both leaders' ratings have moved by several points in recent months, demonstrating that the current 1-point lead is not a stable equilibrium and can easily be erased.\n\nConsidering these points together, the path to a 'No' outcome (Sheinbaum ties or takes the lead) appears more probable than the path to a 'Yes' outcome (Milei maintains or extends his lead). I am therefore shifting my forecast from slightly favoring 'Yes' to modestly favoring 'No'.",
