  "information": "Several jurisdictions on the FATF grey list are actively seeking removal. The Nigerian government is working to exit the list by the end of May 2025, with its Minister of Interior emphasizing the administration's commitment to improving financial transparency. South Africa's National Treasury has stated that the country has addressed or largely addressed 20 of its 22 action items and aims to resolve the remaining two by June 2025, for a potential exit from the list by October 2025. Mozambique completed its technical reforms, and an FATF on-site visit, which is a prerequisite for removal, reportedly took place in April 2025 with positive feedback.\n\nThere are potential new additions to the grey list. The British Virgin Islands underwent a mutual-evaluation follow-up that found major gaps, and its grace period for remediation expired in February 2025; the UK has signalled it will not block a listing. Separately, India is preparing to submit new intelligence to the FATF concerning Pakistan's terror infrastructure, aiming to have Pakistan re-listed after its removal in October 2022. The most recent changes to the list occurred in February 2025, when Laos and Nepal were added and the Philippines was removed.\n\nHistorical data on FATF plenaries shows consistent changes to the grey list. Since the current monitoring process was adopted in 2018, there have been 17 plenary meetings up to February 2025. Of these 17 meetings, only one—the October 2020 plenary—concluded without any additions or removals. That session was a virtual meeting delayed by the COVID-19 pandemic and was noted to have focused on policy work rather than country evaluations. For a country to be removed, it must complete its action plan and then undergo a successful on-site visit to verify the implementation of reforms.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Approximately 3-4 weeks until the June 2025 FATF Plenary meeting concludes, with the outcome likely known by late June or early July 2025 when official announcements are made.",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No - the grey list remains unchanged with the same 25 jurisdictions that were on the list following the February 2025 plenary.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "The June 2025 plenary concludes without any jurisdictions being added or removed from the grey list. Countries seeking removal (like Mozambique, Nigeria, or South Africa) either haven't completed their required action plans, fail their on-site verification visits, or are deferred to a later plenary. Potential additions like British Virgin Islands or Pakistan are not acted upon, perhaps due to procedural delays or awaiting additional evaluation processes.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "At least one jurisdiction is either added or removed from the grey list. Most likely, Mozambique is removed after its positive April 2025 on-site visit, and/or British Virgin Islands is added following the expiry of its grace period in February 2025 and the UK's willingness to support listing. Additional removals or additions from other candidate countries could also occur.",
    "rationale": "The historical evidence is compelling: out of 17 FATF plenary meetings since 2018, only one (October 2020, during COVID-19) concluded without changes to the grey list - a 94% rate of changes occurring. This strong base rate is the primary driver of my forecast.\n\nSeveral specific factors support a high probability of changes at the June 2025 plenary:\n\n**Strong removal candidate**: Mozambique appears particularly likely - it has completed technical reforms and underwent an on-site visit in April 2025 with positive feedback. Since on-site visits are a prerequisite for removal and the timing aligns well with the June plenary, this represents a concrete path to at least one change.\n\n**Strong addition candidate**: British Virgin Islands has had major gaps identified, its grace period expired in February 2025, and the UK has signaled it won't block listing. This creates a plausible path for an addition.\n\n**Other possibilities**: While Nigeria aims to exit by end of May and South Africa has made substantial progress, South Africa's own projection suggests an October 2025 exit timeline, making June less certain. Pakistan's potential re-listing depends on India's intelligence submission and FATF's response.\n\nThe fact that the February 2025 plenary just made changes (3 months ago) could slightly reduce the likelihood of June changes, but the historical pattern shows that FATF regularly makes changes at consecutive meetings.\n\n**Why not higher**: The 94% historical rate already accounts for the October 2020 exception. While the evidence is strong, there's inherent uncertainty about whether specific countries will complete their processes in time for the June meeting. On-site visits could be delayed, action plans might not be fully verified, or procedural issues could arise. A 5-15% chance of no changes seems appropriate given these possibilities.\n\n**Why not lower**: The historical base rate is extremely strong, and we have multiple concrete candidates for both additions and removals. The mechanisms are in place, the timelines align reasonably well, and FATF has demonstrated consistent activity in updating the list.\n\n**To update higher**: Confirmed news that Mozambique or another country has officially completed all requirements and is scheduled for announcement at the June plenary, or official confirmation that British Virgin Islands will be added.\n\n**To update lower**: Reports that key candidate countries have failed their on-site visits, postponed evaluations, or that the June plenary agenda doesn't include grey list updates.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill any jurisdictions be added to or removed from the FATF \"grey list\" following the FATF Plenary meeting in June 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nAML Intelligence (February 2025) [UPDATE: Philippines removed from FATF ‘grey list’ as Laos, Nepal added to watchlist](https://www.amlintelligence.com/2025/02/breaking-fatf-grey-list-update-laos-and-nepal-added-the-philippines-removed/)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below.
