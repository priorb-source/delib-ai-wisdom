    "review": "Forecaster 2 and 3 raise several important points I should consider. Forecaster 3's emphasis on the Bank of Japan's April regional report maintaining a 'recovering' assessment and highlighting continued AI-related semiconductor demand through mid-2025 is valuable forward-looking information I hadn't incorporated. Forecaster 2's detailed regional business indicators (19.2% expecting profit increases at 3-year low, 32.5% YoY bankruptcy increase) provide important context about underlying weakness I hadn't considered. However, I believe both forecasters are underweighting the significance of the nationwide April Industrial Production Index showing an actual 0.9% decline. This is not conjecture or mean-reversion theory—it's concrete April data showing industrial weakness during the exact month we're forecasting. While regional data can diverge from national trends, the nationwide decline is a strong anchor. Forecaster 3's Golden Week concern is somewhat misplaced—it occurs in early May, not April, so it doesn't directly affect April production. The semiconductor/AI strength argument is compelling, but must be weighed against actual nationwide April weakness and the tendency for mean-reversion after March's exceptional 7.6% jump.",
    "rationale": "After reviewing the other forecasters' analyses, I'm updating my forecast modestly upward from 38% to 43%. The key new information supporting an increase includes: (1) the Bank of Japan's April regional report maintaining its 'recovering' assessment with specific strength in AI-related semiconductors expected through mid-2025, (2) the clarification that Golden Week doesn't impact April production (only May), and (3) weak yen dynamics supporting exporters. These factors suggest some underlying momentum that could sustain growth. However, I'm not moving as high as Forecasters 2 (46%) or 3 (55%) because the nationwide preliminary Industrial Production Index for April 2025 showing a 0.9% decline is actual April data—not speculation—and provides a strong empirical anchor. Combined with the mean-reversion tendency after March's outsized 7.6% increase and the weak regional business sentiment indicators (3-year low profit expectations, rising bankruptcies), the balance of evidence still leans toward decline. The semiconductor strength is real but may not be sufficient to overcome broader industrial weakness and statistical mean-reversion. My 43% forecast reflects modest optimism from the sectoral drivers while maintaining appropriate weight on the concrete April national decline.",
