  "information": "Y Combinator (YC) is launching its inaugural AI Startup School in San Francisco on June 16-17, 2025. The event is a free conference intended for 2,000 top AI students, researchers, and recent graduates, with YC offering up to $500 for travel expenses. The program's goal is to shape the next generation of AI startups by focusing on entrepreneurship, product building, and fundraising. YC has announced that Sam Altman and Elon Musk are among the event's headline speakers.\n\nSam Altman and Elon Musk co-founded OpenAI in 2015 as a non-profit foundation, with Musk providing significant initial funding. Musk left the organization in 2018 citing disagreements with Altman and the company's direction. After OpenAI was re-launched as a for-profit entity, Musk filed a lawsuit alleging a violation of the original non-profit principles. Their public rivalry has also included a hostile, unsolicited $97.4 billion takeover bid for OpenAI led by Musk, which Altman publicly dismissed, and reported competition for influence over U.S. government AI projects.\n\nIn May 2025, news reports indicated that Sam Altman had made conciliatory gestures towards Elon Musk. Altman reportedly wrote to Musk proposing a collaboration on the development of artificial general intelligence (AGI) and extended an 'olive branch.' While Musk had not publicly responded to the written offer, reports mentioned that informal contacts had occurred between the technical teams of their respective organizations. Separately, Altman publicly posted on social media to Musk, stating, 'AGI is too important, can't let petty grudges get in the way.'",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "The event occurs June 16-17, 2025, which is approximately 20 days from today (May 27, 2025). The resolution deadline is July 1, 2025, giving us 35 days until the outcome is definitively known.",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No - they speak at the event separately without sharing a stage",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Both Altman and Musk deliver their speeches in separate time slots or sessions at AI Startup School, never appearing on stage simultaneously. Conference organizers schedule them at different times to avoid potential conflict and awkwardness, which is standard practice for speakers with known tensions.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Y Combinator orchestrates a special joint session, panel, or fireside chat featuring both Altman and Musk together on stage. This could be positioned as a historic reconciliation conversation about AI's future, capitalizing on Altman's recent conciliatory gestures and leveraging YC's relationship with both individuals to create a marquee moment for the conference.",
    "rationale": "Several factors inform this forecast. First, both Altman and Musk are confirmed as headline speakers, making a joint appearance physically possible. However, their relationship is deeply adversarial - active lawsuits over OpenAI's direction, Musk's hostile $97.4B takeover bid for OpenAI, and public competition for government AI influence create strong headwinds against collaboration.\n\nThe recent May 2025 conciliatory gestures from Altman are notable: he reportedly wrote to Musk proposing AGI collaboration and publicly posted about not letting 'petty grudges' interfere. However, Musk has not publicly responded, and only 'informal contacts between technical teams' are reported - not personal reconciliation. This suggests preliminary thawing at best.\n\nThe base rate strongly favors separate appearances. Even at conferences featuring rival executives, joint stage appearances are exceptionally rare. Conference organizers typically schedule contentious speakers separately to avoid conflict. With only 20 days until the event, if YC had planned a historic joint session, we would likely have seen promotional announcements by now.\n\nY Combinator's connections to both (Altman was YC president) theoretically give them unique leverage to broker such an appearance, which prevents the probability from being lower. The conciliatory gestures also suggest non-zero possibility. However, unreciprocated olive branches, active litigation, and conference logistics norms heavily favor the status quo of separate appearances.\n\nFor the probability to increase significantly, I would need to see: YC announcement of a joint session, public acceptance by Musk of reconciliation efforts, or evidence of direct meetings. For it to decrease, further escalation of their rivalry or either dropping out as a speaker would be key signals.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill Sam Altman and Elon Musk be on the stage together at YC AI Startup School?\n\nQuestion background:\nY Combinator is an American venture capital firm known for launching over 5,000 companies including Airbnb, Stripe, and Reddit. In 2025, Y Combinator announced AI Startup School, a conference in San Francisco held on June 16–17, aimed at 2,000 final-year students and recent graduates in computer science, artificial intelligence, and related fields.&#x20;\n\nY Combinator has announced that both Sam Altman and Elon Musk are among the headline speakers at the AI Startup School, but it is unknown whether they will appear on stage together at the same time.\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question will resolve as Yes if Sam Altman and Elon Musk share a stage together at YC AI Startup School after 7:59 AM, June 16, 2025, and before 00:00 AM, June 18, 2025. Otherwise, this question will resolve as No.\n\nSharing a stage is defined as both individuals being physically present on the same platform at the same time.&#x20;\n\nThis question will resolve according to a preponderance of evidence. If there is no clear evidence of this occurring before July 1, 2025, this question will resolve as No.\n\nAll times for this question are in Pacific Daylight Time (PDT).  &#x20;\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nY Combinator (YC) is launching its inaugural AI Startup School in San Francisco on June 16-17, 2025.

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
