    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Approximately 5 weeks.",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No. Currently, no North American country is listed by the CDC as having a yellow fever travel advisory.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "The increased yellow fever activity mentioned in the PAHO alert remains confined to the known endemic regions in South America. Surveillance and vector control in North American countries successfully prevent any local transmission, and thus no CDC travel advisory is issued for any country on the continent by the resolution date.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "A small, localized urban transmission cycle of yellow fever is established in a southern part of North America (e.g., a Caribbean island, Panama, or southern Mexico) after being introduced by a traveler from an endemic South American country. The outbreak is detected by local health authorities and deemed significant enough for the CDC to issue a Level 1 travel health notice as a precaution.",
    "rationale": "My forecast is heavily based on the strong status quo and base rate. Yellow fever is not endemic in any North American country, and there have been no sustained local outbreaks for over a century. For the outcome to be 'Yes', a chain of low-probability events must occur within a very short timeframe of just over one month: an infected traveler must introduce the virus to a competent mosquito population, a local transmission cycle must be established, this outbreak must be detected, and it must be deemed significant enough by the CDC to warrant a travel advisory. While the PAHO alert from late March 2025 indicates heightened regional activity, this activity is concentrated in established endemic zones in South America. This alert likely increases surveillance in at-risk North American areas, potentially making a sustained outbreak less likely. The most plausible, though still highly improbable, path to a 'Yes' vote would be a small outbreak in a Central American or Caribbean nation geographically proximate to South America. My probability is not lower than 2% because the PAHO alert confirms elevated regional risk, and the vectors for transmission exist in parts of North America. A single, confirmed local transmission could trigger a precautionary CDC notice. My probability is not higher because the historical precedent is overwhelmingly strong, and the timeline for an outbreak to establish and be officially recognized with a travel advisory is extremely short. I would increase my forecast if there were credible reports of confirmed local (non-travel-related) yellow fever cases in any North American country. I would decrease it if PAHO were to report that the South American outbreaks were successfully contained.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill any North American country be listed as having a CDC yellow fever travel advisory on June 1, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\n[PAHO issues new epidemiological alert amid rising yellow fever cases in the Americas](https://www.paho.org/en/news/31-3-2025-paho-issues-new-epidemiological-alert-amid-rising-yellow-fever-cases-americas)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if a country in North America is listed as having a travel advisory by the Centers for Disease Control at its [Travel Health Notices](https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/travel/notices) page when checked by Metaculus on or after June 1, 2025.\n\n\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nNo additional information available.\n\nToday is 2025-04-24.\n\nBefore answering you think:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n(e) You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
