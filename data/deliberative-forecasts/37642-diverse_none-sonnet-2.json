    "review": "Both forecasters provide compelling arguments that I underweighted the constraints. Forecaster 3's specific identification of the June 17-18 meeting date is particularly valuable - with only about 5 weeks of additional data (April/May) before the decision, the window for sustained evidence is even tighter than I initially considered. Both emphasize that the Fed's recent pause signals a materially higher bar for near-term cuts, not just a temporary hold. Forecaster 3's middle-ground approach (18%) seems most calibrated - acknowledging legitimate possibilities (data-dependent Fed, SEP providing cover for pivots, potential adverse shocks) while properly weighting the constraints. Forecaster 2's 10% may slightly underweight the Fed's demonstrated ability to respond to incoming data, but their emphasis on the 'very high bar' given recent communications is well-taken. The most persuasive new argument is that moving from 'recently paused cuts' to 'cutting again at the very next meeting' requires exceptional circumstances - either a clear multi-indicator deterioration or a crisis - and my 30% didn't sufficiently account for this institutional inertia and the Fed's stated need for 'greater confidence' before resuming cuts.",
    "rationale": "Upon reflection, I was too generous at 30%. The combination of (1) exactly one scheduled meeting before the deadline, (2) only 4-5 weeks of new data available before that meeting, (3) the Fed's explicit recent decision to pause cuts signaling current policy is appropriate, and (4) the Fed's stated requirement for 'greater confidence' on inflation creates a materially higher bar than I initially assessed. My forecast wasn't sufficiently anchored to the status quo. While I correctly identified that economic shocks or significant data deterioration could prompt action, I overestimated the probability of such developments materializing and being processed into policy within this compressed timeframe. The institutional reality is that central banks require sustained evidence before reversing recent decisions, and 'sustained' is difficult to demonstrate with one month of data. I'm updating down to 18%, aligning with Forecaster 3's reasoning. This still allows for meaningful probability that incoming data could justify a cut (soft inflation prints, labor market cooling) or that an adverse shock could prompt action, but properly weights the significant constraints and the Fed's demonstrated caution.",
