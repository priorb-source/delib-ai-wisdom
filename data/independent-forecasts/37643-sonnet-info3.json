  "information": "The Public Service Loan Forgiveness program is established by federal statute, specifically Section 455(m) of the Higher Education Act (codified at 20 U.S.C. §1087e(m)). Consequently, terminating the program is generally understood to require a new act of Congress. Unilateral executive action to end the program is considered to have uncertain legal standing and would require, at a minimum, a formal notice-of-proposed-rulemaking process, including a public comment period, before any changes could be finalized.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Approximately 47 days until July 1, 2025",
    "status_quo_outcome": "The objective remains marked as 'in progress' and does not get marked as 'complete' by July 1, 2025, resulting in a No resolution",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "No legislation terminating PSLF passes Congress and is signed into law, and any executive actions taken either remain incomplete or are not deemed sufficient by the Keep_Track subreddit maintainers to mark the objective as 'complete' by July 1, 2025",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Congress rapidly passes legislation terminating PSLF, OR the administration takes executive action (such as issuing a final rule or directive) that the Keep_Track subreddit maintainers determine constitutes completion of the objective to terminate the program, and this occurs before July 1, 2025",
    "rationale": "The extremely short timeframe of 47 days is the primary constraint here. My research assistant confirms that PSLF is established by federal statute, meaning proper termination requires Congressional action. Even in a unified government, passing significant legislation typically takes many months, not weeks. Executive action faces similar timing challenges - a notice of proposed rulemaking must go through public comment periods that typically span 60-90 days minimum, making completion before July 1 highly improbable. The fact that the tracker currently marks this as 'in progress' rather than 'complete' suggests the maintainers are waiting for finalized, concrete actions rather than merely proposed or initiated steps. For the forecast to be higher, I would need evidence of: legislation already far advanced in the Congressional process, emergency rulemaking procedures being invoked, or the tracker maintainers having a very low bar for 'completion.' For the forecast to be lower, I would need absolute certainty that no mechanism exists for rapid action, but small probability remains for unexpected developments or actions already in motion that aren't publicly visible yet. The status quo strongly favors inertia - government processes are designed to move slowly, and transforming 'in progress' to 'complete' in 47 days for a statutory program termination is exceptionally unlikely.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill the Project 2025 Tracker spreadsheet have the objective of terminating the Public Service Loan Forgiveness program marked as complete before July 1, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nAt the time of this question, the objective was marked as \"in progress.\" The 2025 Tracker is a project of the Keep_Track subreddit and is explained [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/Keep_Track/comments/1ii7tbr/project_2025_tracker_is_now_live/).\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if the Project 2025 objective to \"terminate the Public Service Loan Forgiveness program\" is marked as complete according to [this spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1QGG6wNHna-1tt91yXNkOauAJJ7snobFjfEnmxlmzhl4/edit?gid=0#gid=0) before July 1, 2025. If it is anything other than complete (such as \"in progress\") when accessed by Metaculus on or after July 1, 2025, then the question resolves as **No**.\n\n\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nThe Public Service Loan Forgiveness program is established by federal statute, specifically Section 455(m) of the Higher Education Act (codified at 20 U.S.C. §1087e(m)). Consequently, terminating the program is generally understood to require a new act of Congress. Unilateral executive action to end the program is considered to have uncertain legal standing and would require, at a minimum, a formal notice-of-proposed-rulemaking process, including a public comment period, before any changes could be finalized.\n\nToday is 2025-05-14.\n\nBefore answering you think:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n(e) You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
