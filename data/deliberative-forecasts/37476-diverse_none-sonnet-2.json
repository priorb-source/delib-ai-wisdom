    "review": "Forecaster 2 provides the most critical new information: GoPro reported $217 million in cash and crucially NO DEBT in their Q4 2024 results. This is decisive evidence I hadn't considered. Bankruptcy filings are overwhelmingly driven by debt servicing failures - a company with zero debt and substantial cash has essentially removed the primary mechanism for near-term insolvency. Forecaster 3's analysis aligns with mine on base rates and timing but maintains slightly higher probability, possibly not fully weighting the no-debt factor. All three analyses converge on the same fundamental conclusion: with 53 days remaining, no visible distress signals, and (per Forecaster 2) a debt-free balance sheet with significant cash, the probability is very low. The range of 1-4% reflects minor differences in tail risk assessment rather than fundamental disagreement.",
    "rationale": "I am revising my forecast downward based on Forecaster 2's specific financial data. A company with no debt obligations and $217 million in cash faces a fundamentally different bankruptcy risk profile than one with debt service requirements. The primary path to Chapter 11 filing - inability to meet debt obligations - is simply not present. For bankruptcy to occur in the next 53 days would require an extreme black swan event: massive undisclosed fraud, catastrophic legal judgment, or similar shock that instantly vaporizes cash reserves. These remain theoretically possible but highly improbable. The short timeframe, recent SEC filing activity indicating going concern status, and absence of any public distress signals all support a very low probability. I'm settling at 2% rather than Forecaster 2's 1% to maintain a small buffer for unforeseen tail risks, but I acknowledge the evidence strongly supports the lower end of our forecast range.",
