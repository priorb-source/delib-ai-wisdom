    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Approximately 32 days until July 1, 2025",
    "status_quo_outcome": "Without current approval rating data for either leader, the status quo cannot be definitively established. However, the outcome will depend on whether the current relative positioning of the two leaders' approval ratings persists through early July.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Keir Starmer faces domestic political challenges in June 2025 such as controversial policy implementations, economic difficulties, or cabinet disagreements that erode his approval rating. Meanwhile, Shigeru Ishiba maintains steady or improving approval in Japan, or any existing unfavorable gap closes, resulting in Ishiba having equal or higher approval than Starmer on July 1.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Keir Starmer maintains stable approval ratings or benefits from positive developments in the UK such as economic improvements or successful policy announcements. Concurrently, Ishiba faces challenges in Japan - potential political scandals, unpopular decisions, or declining honeymoon period effects - that suppress his approval rating relative to Starmer's by July 1.",
    "rationale": "This forecast faces significant uncertainty due to the absence of current approval rating data from Morning Consult for either leader. The research assistant provided no additional information about recent ratings or trends. Key factors to consider: (1) Keir Starmer has been PM since July 2024 (approximately 11 months), likely past any initial honeymoon period. (2) Shigeru Ishiba became PM in October 2024 (approximately 7 months), potentially still benefiting from newness. (3) The timeframe is short - only 32 days - meaning dramatic shifts are unlikely absent major events. (4) Both UK and Japanese politics can be volatile, but month-to-month changes in approval ratings tend to be modest. Without baseline data showing who currently leads and by what margin, or any information about recent trends, this forecast must reflect maximum uncertainty. The probability cannot be pushed meaningfully higher without evidence that Starmer currently leads or has favorable momentum. It cannot be pushed lower without evidence of Ishiba's current advantage. To update this forecast, I would need: current Morning Consult approval ratings for both leaders, recent trend data (last 3-6 months), and information about upcoming major political events in either country during June 2025.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer have a higher approval rating than Japanese Prime Minister Shiguru Ishiba on July 1, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nResolution source updates monthly. According to Morning Consult for January 2025: \"The latest approval ratings are based on data collected from Jan. 21-27, 2025. Ratings reflect a trailing seven-day simple moving average of views among adults in each country surveyed.\"\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if Keir Starmer has a higher approval rating than Shiguru Ishiba according to [Morning Consult](https://pro.morningconsult.com/trackers/global-leader-approval) when checked by Metaculus on or after July 1, 2025. If this not the case (including due to a tie), this resolves as **No**.\n\n\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nNo additional information available.\n\nToday is 2025-05-30.\n\nBefore answering you think:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n(e) You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
