  "information": "In response to its financial performance, Beyond Meat has implemented several operational changes, including a 17% workforce reduction for non-production staff and a suspension of its operations in China. Management stated its strategic priorities include restoring product distribution within the U.S. market and improving consumer perception through new marketing campaigns. The stated long-term goal for the company is to achieve EBITDA-positive operations by the end of 2026.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "54 days (from May 8, 2025 to July 1, 2025)",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No - Beyond Meat has not filed for bankruptcy and continues operations",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Beyond Meat manages its cash position through the implemented cost-cutting measures (workforce reduction, China exit), maintains access to existing credit facilities or secures bridge financing, and continues operations through July 1, 2025 while working toward its stated goal of EBITDA-positive operations by end of 2026",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Beyond Meat faces an immediate liquidity crisis within the next 54 days due to inability to meet debt obligations, supplier payment requirements, or operational expenses, forcing management to file for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection before July 1, 2025",
    "rationale": "The extremely short timeframe of 54 days is the dominant factor in this forecast. Bankruptcy filings typically occur only when companies are in immediate financial distress with no other options remaining. While Beyond Meat's financials are concerning ($38M quarterly operating loss), several factors suggest they are not in imminent crisis: (1) Management has proactively implemented restructuring measures including 17% workforce reduction and China exit, indicating they have time and options to manage the situation; (2) They have articulated a long-term strategic plan targeting EBITDA-positive by end of 2026, which suggests confidence in their runway; (3) There are no public reports of debt defaults, creditor actions, or inability to pay suppliers that would typically precede a bankruptcy filing. The status quo heavily favors continuation of operations given this short window. For my forecast to move higher, I would need evidence of: immediate cash shortage, covenant violations, creditor demands, or management statements suggesting imminent insolvency. For it to move lower, I would need confirmation of recent financing secured, improved revenue trends, or explicit statements about adequate liquidity for 2025. The 8% probability reflects that while bankruptcy is unlikely in this narrow window, the company's structural financial challenges create non-trivial tail risk that an unforeseen liquidity event could trigger a filing.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill Beyond Meat file for bankruptcy before July 1, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nBeyond Meat has had several years of losses and in the most recent quarter it [posted](https://investors.beyondmeat.com/news-releases/news-release-details/beyond-meatr-reports-fourth-quarter-and-full-year-2024-financial) a loss from operations of almost $38 million.\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question will resolve as **Yes** if Beyond Meat, Inc., files any petition for bankruptcy protection in the United States, under any chapter of the United States Bankruptcy Code, before July 1, 2025. The question will resolves on the filing of such a petition, not on whether any bankruptcy protection is granted by a court. If no such petition is filed by that date, this question will resolve as **No**.\n\n\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nIn response to its financial performance, Beyond Meat has implemented several operational changes, including a 17% workforce reduction for non-production staff and a suspension of its operations in China. Management stated its strategic priorities include restoring product distribution within the U.S. market and improving consumer perception through new marketing campaigns. The stated long-term goal for the company is to achieve EBITDA-positive operations by the end of 2026.\n\nToday is 2025-05-08.\n\nBefore answering you think:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n(e) You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
