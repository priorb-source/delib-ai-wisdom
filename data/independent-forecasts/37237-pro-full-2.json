  "information": "According to the US Census Bureau, U.S. imports reached a record high of $342.7 billion in March 2025, a 5% increase from February. This surge was attributed to businesses front-running impending tariffs. The import of consumer goods rose 55.5% year-over-year to $102.8 billion, and automotive vehicle imports also jumped. This activity led to the U.S. trade deficit for goods increasing by 9.6% to a record $162 billion in March. A similar, though smaller, surge was observed in January 2025, when imports reached $320 billion, with notable increases in shipments from China, Canada, and Mexico.\n\nNew tariffs, referred to as the 'Liberation Day' tariffs, took effect in April 2025. These included a 10% baseline tariff on most imports, with higher rates on certain categories like automobiles and specific Chinese products, where tariffs reached up to 145%. Following the implementation, early reports in April indicated a 64% collapse in new U.S. import orders. Real-time data showed significant drops in trade activity, including a 35% fall in scheduled container arrivals at the port of Los Angeles, a 30% plunge in U.S.-China imports according to Project 44, and a 40% decline in overall imports reported by Drewry. The S&P Global PMI also indicated a slowdown in U.S. business activity in April. Despite these indicators, the U.S. Treasury collected $16.5 billion in tariff revenue between April 1 and April 28.\n\nData from the shipping and logistics sector in April 2025 reflected the impact of new tariffs. Freightos and Hillebrand data showed that Asia-U.S. container rates had fallen by 5%. Shipping lines reported an increase in 'blank sailings' (cancelled voyages) and vessels from China that were only half-full. In 2024, China accounted for approximately 36% of U.S. imports, with its share being higher at key ports like Los Angeles (51%) and Long Beach (61%). Port data indicated that the number of ships scheduled to arrive in May 2025 had decreased significantly. Separately, Mexico had become the U.S.'s top trading partner in early 2025, with its exports to the U.S. growing 9.6% in January to a record $41.68 billion.",

    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Approximately 1-2 months, when the official U.S. Census Bureau report for April 2025 is released around early June 2025.",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No. The new status quo established in April 2025 includes massive new tariffs. All leading indicators suggest these tariffs will cause a sharp decrease in imports compared to the previous year, placing the total value well below the threshold.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "The 'Liberation Day' tariffs implemented in April 2025 drastically reduce import volumes. Businesses, having front-loaded their inventories in March to avoid the tariffs, slash new orders. Real-time shipping and port data showing a 30-40% drop in activity prove accurate, and the final Census Bureau figure for April's imports falls significantly below the $338.483 billion threshold.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Despite the tariffs and falling import volumes for many goods, the total *value* of imports remains high. This could be due to a massive price spike in inelastic, high-value imports like energy or critical industrial components, or because long-term, high-value contracts were fulfilled in April, insulating a large portion of the import value from the immediate tariff shock. In this scenario, the drop in volume is offset by an increase in price, pushing the total nominal value above the threshold.",
    "rationale": "The forecast is based on the overwhelming evidence of a sharp contraction in US imports following the implementation of the 'Liberation Day' tariffs in April 2025. The core of my reasoning rests on three pillars:\n\n1.  **Tariff Impact and Front-Loading:** The implementation of a 10% baseline tariff, with much higher rates on certain goods, creates a powerful disincentive to import. This effect is magnified by the record-high imports in March ($342.7 billion), which were explicitly driven by businesses front-running these tariffs. This has created a demand vacuum and high inventory levels, leading to a sharp drop in new orders for April.\n\n2.  **Corroborating Real-Time Data:** Multiple, independent real-time indicators point towards a severe decline. These include a reported 64% collapse in new import orders, a 30-40% plunge in container volumes from various shipping analytics firms (Project 44, Drewry), and a 35% fall in scheduled arrivals at the port of Los Angeles. Such a broad-based and significant downturn in activity makes it highly improbable that the final import value will exceed the prior year's level.\n\n3.  **Quantitative Plausibility Check:** The $16.5 billion in tariff revenue collected in April provides a rough guide. Even assuming a very low average tariff rate of 5% across all goods (the baseline is 10%), this would imply a total import value of approximately $330 billion, which is already below the threshold. A more realistic average tariff rate would imply a much lower total import value.\n\nMy probability is not 0 because official aggregate data can sometimes diverge from early indicators, and a sudden, sharp inflation in the price of certain high-value, inelastic goods could theoretically offset some of the volume decline. My probability is not higher than 2% because the qualitative and quantitative evidence for a major decline is consistent, strong, and comes from multiple sources. For me to raise this forecast, I would need to see evidence that the real-time shipping data was fundamentally flawed or evidence of a massive, unreported surge in the price of key commodities.",
