    "review": "- Forecaster 2 usefully highlights appointment-driven exits as a key path to resignations, but their premise that the window is in the immediate post-EP-election churn looks off by a year; the EP elections were June 2024, not June 2025. Without a known wave of national cabinet formations slated for late June 2025, that argument seems overstated. Still, the general mechanism (appointments to national posts or EU bodies) is valid and contributes to the background risk.\n- Forecaster 3’s base-rate framing (5–15 resignations/year; Poisson leading to roughly 25–58% for a 21-day window) is methodologically sound and broadly in line with my initial hazard-rate approach. They use 705 MEPs (pre-2024 number) rather than 720, but that doesn’t materially change the order of magnitude. Their caution about scandals not yielding rapid resignations is appropriate.\n- Net: I find F3’s reasoning more persuasive than F2’s, given the timing nuance. The Huawei-lobbying story marginally elevates risk but, absent named MEPs under acute pressure, likely adds only a few points above base. I slightly discount F2’s higher estimate due to the mis-timed election-churn assumption.",
    "rationale": "I started at 45%, derived from a base attrition rate (roughly 7–15 resignations/year across ~720 MEPs) implying a 21-day probability in the 35–55% band, then modestly upweighted for a live scandal. After deliberation:\n- I downweight the election-related churn argument for June 2025—major EU-level turnover occurred in 2024. While national appointments can still happen, there’s no evidence of a concentrated wave in late June 2025.\n- I retain a small uplift for the Huawei lobbying story but keep it modest given lack of specific, named MEPs with clear signals of imminent resignation.\n- Overall, that nudges me slightly below my initial midpoint, but still within the base-rate band where a single resignation in a 21-day window is plausibly near coin-flip.\nAccordingly, I trim my estimate a bit from 45% to 43%. I would move higher on credible reporting of an MEP poised to take a national post or concrete resignation pressure tied to the Huawei story; lower if the scandal visibly cools or if we approach the window with no developing signals.",
