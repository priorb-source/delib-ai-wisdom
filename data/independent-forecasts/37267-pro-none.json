    "status_quo_outcome": "No. The current country-wide travel advisory for Ethiopia is Level 3, 'Reconsider Travel,' with specific regions already designated as Level 4. If the current security situation and advisory level persist, the outcome will be No.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "The security situation in Ethiopia remains at its current level of volatility or sees minor improvements. The ongoing regional conflicts, particularly in Amhara and Oromia, do not escalate to a point that threatens the stability of the capital, Addis Ababa, or other major national infrastructure. The US State Department continues to use regional Level 4 advisories for the most dangerous areas while maintaining a Level 3 for the country as a whole.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "A significant and rapid deterioration of the security situation occurs. This could involve the expansion of regional conflicts to threaten Addis Ababa directly, the eruption of a new large-scale conflict, a coup d'état, or widespread political instability that leads the US State Department to conclude that no part of the country is safe for travel.",
    "rationale": "The current US State Department travel advisory for Ethiopia is 'Level 3: Reconsider Travel' for the country as a whole, but it already designates specific conflict-affected regions such as Tigray, Amhara, and parts of Oromia as 'Level 4: Do Not Travel.' This nuanced approach suggests a high threshold for elevating the entire country to Level 4. Such a designation is typically reserved for countries with widespread, uncontrolled conflict or a near-total breakdown of state authority. The status quo is a powerful force, and government agencies are often slow to make such drastic changes unless forced by a sudden, undeniable crisis.\n\nThe timeframe for this question is very short—less than two months. For a 'Yes' outcome, a major destabilizing event would need to occur rapidly. While Ethiopia faces serious internal security challenges, the capital has remained relatively insulated from the worst of the regional violence. A country-wide elevation to Level 4 appears unlikely in this short period without a dramatic escalation.\n\nMy forecast is not lower than 18% because Ethiopia's political and security situation is highly volatile. The ongoing conflicts are unpredictable and have the potential for rapid escalation. A major offensive by non-state actors or a severe government crackdown could quickly change the calculus for the State Department.\n\nMy forecast is not higher than 18% because the bar for a country-wide Level 4 advisory is extremely high, and the State Department's current use of regional Level 4 warnings provides a granular tool that avoids this blunt measure. Barring a catastrophic collapse, it is more probable that the current advisory structure will remain in place through the short forecast period.\n\nI would increase my probability forecast upon receiving credible reports of fighting moving closer to Addis Ababa, a nationwide state of emergency being declared, or a coup attempt. I would decrease my forecast if significant peace talks or ceasefire agreements were announced and appeared to be holding.",

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
