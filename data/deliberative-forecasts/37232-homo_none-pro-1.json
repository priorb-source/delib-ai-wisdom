    "review": "All three forecasters, including myself, have identified the same critical factor: Virgin Galactic's status as a publicly-traded company and its regular cadence of quarterly earnings reports. We all agree that the historical pattern of releasing Q1 earnings in early May creates a very strong forcing function for a news post during the resolution period, making a 'No' outcome highly probable. The arguments raised by the other two forecasters were not new, but they reinforced the core logic of my own initial analysis. The primary point of divergence is the precise probability, with both other forecasters assigning a 10% chance to the 'Yes' outcome, compared to my initial 7%. This suggests they place slightly more weight on the small but real possibilities of a reporting delay into June or a change in the company's communication strategy. Their reasoning is convincing and highlights a strong consensus on the fundamentals of the forecast.",
    "rationale": "My core reasoning remains unchanged. The most predictable event for a public company is its quarterly earnings report. Historically, Virgin Galactic reports its Q1 results in early May, which falls squarely within the resolution window. This event is almost certain to be accompanied by a press release posted to their News page, which would resolve the question as 'No'. The current three-month silence on the news page is a weak signal compared to the institutional imperative of financial reporting. However, the deliberation with my peers has prompted me to reconsider the weight I assigned to the tail risks. Both other forecasters arrived at 10%, slightly higher than my initial 7%. While our reasoning is identical, their consensus at a slightly more cautious number suggests I may have been slightly overconfident in the precise timing of the announcement. To reflect this, I am slightly increasing my forecast. I am adjusting my probability from 7% to 9% to better account for the small chance that the Q1 earnings release is scheduled just outside the May window (e.g., on April 30th or in early June) or that the company deviates from its standard practice of posting the release to its main news page. The fundamental analysis is the same, but this small update reflects the value of peer review in calibrating confidence levels.",
