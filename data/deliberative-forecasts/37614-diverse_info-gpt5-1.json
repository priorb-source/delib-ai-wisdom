    "review": "Forecaster 2 adds a useful and concrete point I hadn’t explicitly weighed: in a sub-400–active-voter town, a certified recall petition itself is a strong signal of organized, motivated opposition. In such a tiny electorate, the number of signatures required can be a sizable share of likely turnout, making certification a meaningful leading indicator. That strengthens the case against Metz retaining.\n\nForecaster 3’s invocation of a ~60% removal base rate (i.e., ~40% survival) is broadly consistent with what I had in mind, and the adjustment downward for an unusually severe, emotionally charged allegation is reasonable. The reference to recent recalls in other small Colorado towns is suggestive but only weakly probative by itself; I wouldn’t weight “state climate” much without more systematic evidence.\n\nOverall, both analyses reinforce the direction of my initial take (recall more likely than not) and nudge me modestly lower than my prior due to the petition-certification-as-signal point in such a small electorate.",
    "rationale": "- Time left: 8 days, and ballots may already be in voters’ hands or partly returned, limiting scope for late opinion shifts.\n- Baseline: Local recalls that reach the ballot tend to remove officials more often than not (~60% removal; ~40% survival). \n- Case severity: An allegation of shooting a teen in the face, coupled with the sheriff’s statement that there was no apparent crime by the teen, is especially damaging and likely mobilizes recall supporters.\n- Small-electorate dynamics: In a <400–active-voter town, certification of the recall petition implies a sizable, organized bloc of “remove” voters that can dominate a low-salience special election. This is the most persuasive incremental signal from the deliberation.\n- Countervailing uncertainty: Tiny electorates are noisy; personal networks, due-process norms, and potential sympathy for waiting on court outcomes could preserve a nontrivial pro-Metz vote. Colorado’s mail-ballot norms can broaden participation beyond the most activated voters, adding variance.\n\nNet: I still see recall as the favorite, and I’m adjusting my survival probability slightly downward from 32% to 28% to reflect the strength of the petition signal in a very small electorate and the uniquely negative salience of the allegation. I would revise upward if credible exculpatory developments or prominent local endorsements for Metz emerged; downward if we learned the signature threshold was high (implying a very large anti-Metz base) or if there were visible, effective GOTV by recall proponents with little counter-mobilization.",
