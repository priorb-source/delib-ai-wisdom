    "review": "Both forecasters are well-aligned with my reasoning: the default is No given the explicit Apr 29 expiry and no extension signals as of Apr 21, with meaningful tail risk from slippage in temporary generation, adequacy/fuel logistics, and a small chance of an unrelated emergency. The most useful additions were (1) explicit precedent of rolling extensions in Samoa (e.g., COVID), which shows institutional comfort with extending SoEs when necessary, and (2) the observation that any extension would likely span several days, making Apr 30 very likely to be covered if an extension happens. Neither provided new concrete evidence about generator arrival/commissioning that would shift the base. The 38% forecast seems to overweight schedule/commissioning tail risk given current signaling; 30% feels more consistent with the information at hand.",
    "rationale": "I continue to anchor on the stated Apr 29 end date and lack of extension signals, which makes No the status quo. I assign nontrivial probability to a short extension driven by late-April schedule/commissioning slippage or initial inadequacy of temporary capacity/fuel logistics, plus a small probability of an unrelated emergency. The COVID-era extension precedent marginally supports the plausibility of an extension, but without fresh indications of delays or official hints, it doesn’t justify moving off my prior. Net: I maintain a roughly one-in-three chance that authorities keep emergency powers into early May; otherwise, the declaration lapses on time.",
