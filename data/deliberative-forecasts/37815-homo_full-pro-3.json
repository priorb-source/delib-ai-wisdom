    "review": "All three forecasters, including myself, identified the same core evidence: the low base rate of 1-2 South American pilot reports on NUFORC per year. We all correctly calculated this to a monthly probability range of approximately 8-17% and concluded that reporting friction (the site being US-based and English-language) pushes the forecast toward the lower end of this range. Forecaster 2’s analysis was functionally identical to my initial one, arriving at 8%. Forecaster 3’s analysis raised the same points but landed slightly higher at 10%. While they didn't explicitly model it, their reasoning implicitly gives slightly more weight to the possibility that the annual rate is above the bare minimum of 1 per year. I find this subtle difference convincing. My initial analysis was anchored too heavily on the low end of the provided 1-2 report range. Deliberation made me realize that the midpoint of the range (1.5 reports/year) is a more appropriate starting point for the base rate before applying adjustments for reporting friction.",
    "rationale": "My initial forecast of 8% was based on the low end of the estimated historical frequency (1 report per year), which yields a monthly probability of about 8.3%. Both other forecasters shared this foundational reasoning. However, Forecaster 3’s slightly higher forecast of 10% prompted me to reconsider how to best interpret the estimated range of “1-2 reports per year”. Using the midpoint of this range, 1.5 reports per year, as the central estimate for the base rate is a more robust approach. A Poisson probability calculation for an average rate of 1.5 events per year (or 0.125 events per month) yields a probability of approximately 11.8% for one or more events in a given month. Forecaster 3’s 10% forecast sits nicely between my initial conservative 8% estimate and the 12% derived from the average rate. I believe this position better synthesizes the available data. It correctly acknowledges the very low base rate but is not overly anchored to the absolute minimum possible rate. It implicitly accounts for the significant reporting friction by being lower than the 12% calculated from the average, but it also allows for the possibility that the true rate is not at the floor of the estimate. Therefore, I am increasing my forecast slightly to align with this more balanced view.",
