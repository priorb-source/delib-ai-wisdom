    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Approximately 4–6 months (UFC 316 is expected in late 2025)",
    "status_quo_outcome": "He fights Kelvin Gastelum at UFC 316 and the bout is competitive; outcome roughly a coin flip, slight lean to No after accounting for cancellation risk",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Pyfer withdraws, the bout is scrapped, or he fights at UFC 316 and does not win (loss, draw, or no contest)",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Pyfer competes at UFC 316 and wins his bout (vs Kelvin Gastelum or a late-replacement opponent) by KO/TKO, submission, or decision",
    "rationale": "- Setup: Per the provided SI note, Pyfer vs. Kelvin Gastelum has been rebooked for UFC 316 after a Mexico card issue. So the status quo is that Pyfer will have a fight lined up for UFC 316.\n- Decomposition: P(Yes) ≈ P(he fights at UFC 316) × P(he wins if he fights).\n  • Fight occurrence: UFC PPV bookings made months out are fairly reliable but not guaranteed; late injuries/withdrawals happen. Given this is a rebooking due to an event-level cancellation (not necessarily a fighter injury), I estimate ~85–90% that Pyfer actually competes at UFC 316.\n  • Win probability: If the opponent is Gastelum at middleweight, markets would likely price this as competitive with a slight lean toward Pyfer or near pick’em, given Pyfer’s power and youth versus Gastelum’s experience and durability. I’d place this around 50–57% absent sharper market data. Against a short-notice replacement, his win chance could go up or down, but typically hovers near similar levels unless there’s a clear mismatch.\n- Putting it together: Using midpoints (P(fight) ~0.88, P(win|fight) ~0.55) gives ~0.49. That justifies a forecast a touch under 50%.\n- Why not higher? Two dampeners: (1) non-trivial cancellation/withdrawal risk over several months; (2) Gastelum is a live underdog with deep experience, making the matchup close; and (3) any draw/NC does not count as a Yes.\n- Why not lower? The status quo is that Pyfer is booked and possibly a slight favorite; most UFC bookings do materialize; and he has genuine finishing upside.\n- What would move me up: Confirmed betting odds making Pyfer a clear favorite (e.g., implied >60%), evidence of Gastelum struggling (injury, camp changes, bad weight cut), or late replacement with a favorable style matchup.\n- What would move me down: Reports of Pyfer injury/withdrawal risk, adverse camp news, a significantly tougher opponent swap, or markets making him a clear underdog.\n- Research assistant summary: No additional info beyond the SI note, so I’m leaning on base rates and generic matchup priors.",
