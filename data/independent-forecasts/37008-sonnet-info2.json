  "information": "According to reports from Samoa NewsHub and the Samoa Observer, temporary generators were expected to be operational by the end of April, coinciding with the scheduled end of the state of emergency. However, the permanent solution to the power crisis is not anticipated to be in place until August 2025.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "9 days - the question resolves on April 30, 2025",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No - the state of emergency is currently scheduled to end on April 29, 2025, one day before the resolution date",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "The state of emergency ends as scheduled on April 29, 2025. Temporary generators become operational as expected by the end of April, providing sufficient relief from the power crisis. The Samoan government decides not to extend the emergency declaration.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "The state of emergency is extended beyond April 29, 2025. This could occur if temporary generators are delayed, fail to provide adequate power relief, or if the power crisis continues to pose significant challenges requiring continued emergency powers.",
    "rationale": "The state of emergency was explicitly scheduled to end on April 29, 2025, making the status quo outcome for April 30 a 'No' resolution. This scheduled end date carries significant weight - governments typically set specific timelines for emergency declarations and don't extend them lightly. However, several factors create meaningful uncertainty. The research assistant notes that temporary generators are only 'expected' to be operational by end of April, not confirmed. This introduces technical and timing risk. Additionally, the permanent solution won't be ready until August 2025, meaning the underlying power crisis will persist beyond April. If the temporary measures fail or are delayed, extending the emergency could be necessary. The key question is whether the temporary generators will arrive on time and provide sufficient relief. With only 9 days remaining, there's limited time for major changes, but emergency extensions can happen quickly if conditions warrant. My forecast is not higher because: (1) there's an explicit scheduled end date, (2) temporary generators are expected to provide relief, and (3) governments face political/economic costs from prolonged emergencies. My forecast is not lower because: (1) the underlying crisis persists through August, (2) 'expected' generators are not guaranteed, and (3) emergency extensions are not uncommon when problems aren't fully resolved. I would update higher if there were reports of delays with temporary generators or continued severe power outages in late April. I would update lower if there were confirmation the temporary generators are operational and working effectively.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill a state of emergency be in effect in Samoa on April 30, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\n[Samoan Prime Minister declares state of emergency over power cuts](https://www.stuff.co.nz/nz-news/360634988/samoan-prime-minister-declares-state-emergency-over-power-cuts)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if, according to [credible sources](https://www.metaculus.com/faq/#definitions) Samoa is in a state of emergency that has been declared by a governmental entity with the authority to make such a declaration.\n\nFor example, the state of emergency declaration [posted](https://www.facebook.com/samoagovt/posts/hon-prime-minister-of-samoa-press-statement-proclamation-of-emergency-energy-cri/1059050259591457/) by the government of Samoa on Facebook on March 31, 2025 would count. (Note that when it was declared, it was scheduled to be in effect through April 29, 2025.)\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nAccording to reports from Samoa NewsHub and the Samoa Observer, temporary generators were expected to be operational by the end of April, coinciding with the scheduled end of the state of emergency. However, the permanent solution to the power crisis is not anticipated to be in place until August 2025.\n\nToday is 2025-04-21.\n\nBefore answering you think:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n(e) You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
