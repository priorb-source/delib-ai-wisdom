  "information": "As of May 13, 2025, Tesla's market capitalization was approximately $1.078 trillion, while Walmart's was about $768.81 billion, giving Tesla a lead of roughly $309 billion. Tesla's P/E ratio stood at 163.88, with a GF Valuation labeling the company as \"Modestly Overvalued\" and HSBC reducing its price target to $130.00. In contrast, Walmart had a forward P/E ratio of 36.15 and received \"Buy\" ratings from all 19 analysts covering the stock.\n\nRecent company-specific developments include Tesla receiving a Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell) based on declining earnings estimate revisions. Its automotive division recorded its lowest profitability in five years in Q4 2024, with a 13.6% gross margin. The company plans to launch its Robotaxi in June 2025. For Walmart, its e-commerce segment is approaching profitability, with a projected 3-4% overall revenue growth. The company also announced plans to invest $6 billion in Mexico in 2025.\n\nOn May 12, 2025, the U.S. and China announced a trade deal to temporarily reduce tariffs, with U.S. tariffs on Chinese goods decreasing to 30% from 145% and Chinese tariffs on U.S. goods falling to 10% from 125%. The agreement spurred a market rally, with the S&P 500 rising 3% and the Nasdaq gaining over 4%. This development is considered beneficial for retailers like Walmart, which have significant supply chain operations in China. Key economic reports, including the Consumer Price Index (CPI) for April, are scheduled for release.",

    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Approximately 6 weeks.",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No. As of May 13, 2025, Tesla's market capitalization is approximately $309 billion higher than Walmart's.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Tesla's market capitalization remains higher than Walmart's. This could happen if hype surrounding the upcoming June 2025 Robotaxi launch buoys investor sentiment, preventing a significant stock price decline, while Walmart's stock continues its steady but slower growth. In this scenario, the existing $309 billion gap, while potentially narrowing, is not fully closed by the resolution date.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Walmart's market capitalization becomes higher than Tesla's. This scenario would likely involve a significant drop in Tesla's stock price, coupled with a modest increase or stability in Walmart's. A potential catalyst for this is a disappointing Robotaxi launch, further negative earnings revisions for Tesla, or a broader market rotation away from high-P/E growth stocks, causing investors to re-evaluate Tesla's high valuation.",
    "rationale": "My forecast is based on the significant, though not insurmountable, gap in market capitalization that currently favors Tesla. As of mid-May 2025, Tesla leads Walmart by approximately $309 billion. Overcoming such a large deficit in just six weeks is a difficult task and makes 'No' the status quo outcome.\n\nHowever, the underlying fundamentals of the two companies suggest a potential for significant change. Tesla exhibits multiple signs of being overvalued: an extremely high P/E ratio of 163.88, declining automotive profitability, downward earnings revisions leading to a 'Strong Sell' rating, and an analyst valuation of 'Modestly Overvalued'. The company's valuation is heavily reliant on future growth narratives, such as the upcoming Robotaxi launch. This makes its stock price highly volatile and vulnerable to a sharp correction if sentiment shifts or catalysts disappoint.\n\nConversely, Walmart presents a profile of stability and steady growth. It has a more reasonable forward P/E ratio, unanimous 'Buy' ratings from analysts, and stands to benefit from macroeconomic tailwinds like the recent U.S.-China trade deal. While Walmart is unlikely to experience the explosive growth needed to close the gap on its own, its stability provides a solid base.\n\nThe core of this forecast is a race between Tesla's valuation risk and the short time frame. A 30% decline in Tesla's market cap would be sufficient to close the gap, assuming Walmart's cap remains stable. For a stock as volatile and richly valued as Tesla, such a drop is plausible, especially around a high-stakes event like the Robotaxi launch.\n\nMy probability is not lower than 35% because Tesla's fundamental weaknesses and extreme valuation create a substantial risk of a significant price drop. The market has shown an increasing sensitivity to profitability, and Tesla's is weakening.\n\nMy probability is not higher than 35% because the $309 billion gap is very large, and inertia is a powerful force in markets. The narrative-driven nature of Tesla's stock could allow it to defy fundamental gravity for longer, especially with the hype surrounding the Robotaxi launch just weeks away.\n\nI would increase my probability for 'Yes' if there are negative pre-announcements regarding the Robotaxi, a major market downturn affecting growth stocks, or if upcoming economic data suggests a consumer flight to value-oriented retailers like Walmart. I would decrease it if the hype for the Robotaxi launch intensifies significantly or if Walmart issues any negative guidance.",
