  "information": "According to statements from Paul Gunning, the EPA's Director of the Office of Atmospheric Protection, the Energy Star program and other climate-related work are being 'de-prioritized and eliminated.' Gunning's office, along with the EPA's climate change division and climate protection partnership division, are slated for closure as part of a broader agency reorganization. The stated goal of the restructuring is to bring the agency to 'Reagan-era staffing levels,' aiming for a savings of $300 million a year by 2026.\n\nThe Energy Star program was launched in 1992 as a voluntary public-private partnership to certify energy-efficient products. Over its 33-year history, government figures and expert analyses estimate the program has saved consumers over $500 billion in energy costs and prevented 4 billion metric tons of greenhouse gas emissions. The program's annual cost is approximately $32 million, while it is credited with saving the average household around $450 per year.\n\nDecommissioning a federal .gov domain typically requires a process lasting several months for internal approvals, security reviews, and coordination with the General Services Administration (GSA). Federal laws, including the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) and record-retention statutes overseen by the National Archives and Records Administration (NARA), mandate archiving procedures. Historically, websites for discontinued federal programs have often remained online as static archives or with placeholder notices for years after the program ended. When other EPA climate-related webpages were targeted for removal in 2017, the outcome was a redirect or a static page, not a complete shutdown of the domain.",

    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "≈48 days",
    "status_quo_outcome": "Yes — the site remains online (possibly with a banner, redirect, or as a static archive).",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "EPA/GSA fast-track a full domain decommission before July 1, taking down DNS/hosting or firewalling the site, or there is a coincident outage when Metaculus checks IsItDownRightNow that reports the domain as down.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "EnergyStar.gov continues to resolve and serve a page (even if reduced to a notice or redirect) on/after July 1, and IsItDownRightNow reports it as UP.",
    "rationale": "- Baseline: As of May 7, IsItDownRightNow shows energystar.gov is UP. Government web properties typically persist through reorganizations; if programs are ended, agencies often leave sites up as static archives or put deprecation notices rather than pulling domains. In 2017, targeted EPA climate pages were redirected or archived, not fully removed. \n- Process friction/time: Decommissioning a .gov domain usually takes months (approvals, security, NARA archiving, coordination with GSA). We are ~7 weeks from July 1, which is short for a clean shutdown. The research assistant notes FOIA/NARA obligations and typical multi‑month timelines.\n- Incentives: Even if Energy Star is eliminated, there is strong reason to keep the domain reachable to communicate the change, host archives/specs, and avoid consumer/manufacturer confusion. A redirect from energystar.gov to an EPA or archive page would still likely register as UP for the resolution source.\n- Why not higher: There is a nontrivial chance of an aggressive, highly prioritized takedown aligned with broader reorganization goals, or that the domain is migrated/turned off faster than usual. Small tail risk of a transient outage precisely when Metaculus checks IsItDownRightNow.\n- Why not lower: Status quo strongly favors continuity; the cost and risk of abrupt removal are high; and the stated savings timeline (by 2026) suggests actions may roll out over months, not weeks.\n- Updates that would move me down: Official EPA/GSA notice of energystar.gov decommission before July 1; DNS changes indicating imminent removal; the site returning 410/404, or blocking public access; credible reporting of a shutdown date in June.\n- Updates that would move me up: Public commitment to maintain an archive/redirect under energystar.gov beyond July; signs of content being frozen with a closure banner but domain still active; NARA/OMB guidance emphasizing retention/continuity for this site.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill the EPA's EnergyStar.gov still be online on July 1, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nAccording to the [New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/06/climate/epa-energy-star-eliminated.html), \"'The Energy Star program and all the other climate work, outside of what’s required by statute, is being de-prioritized and eliminated,' Paul Gunning, the director of the E.P.A. Office of Atmospheric Protection, told employees during the meeting, according to the recording obtained by The New York Times. Mr. Gunning’s office itself is also slated for elimination.\n\nFor the past 33 years, Energy Star has been known for its recognizable blue label, which shows that an appliance has met energy efficiency standards set by the federal government.\"\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if EnergyStar.gov is online according to [Is It Down Right Now?](https://www.isitdownrightnow.com/energystar.gov.html) when accessed by Metaculus on or after July 1, 2025.\n\nAs of May 7, 2025, the resolution source returns the message, \"Energystar.gov is UP and reachable by us.\"\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nAccording to statements from Paul Gunning, the EPA's Director of the Office of Atmospheric Protection, the Energy Star program and other climate-related work are being 'de-prioritized and eliminated.'

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
