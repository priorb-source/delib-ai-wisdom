    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "About 27 days (until June 15, 2025; resolution when Metaculus checks on/after that date)",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No (base-rate default absent current-standings info)",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Another elite team (e.g., Yankees, Orioles, Phillies, Braves, Mariners, etc.) holds or edges into the top MLB winning percentage by a few points (.001–.010) when the MLB standings page is checked on/after June 15, 2025, leaving the Dodgers second-best. Small timing effects (a win/loss the day Metaculus checks) could also flip the top spot away from LA.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "The Dodgers enter mid-June already at or tied for the MLB-best winning percentage and maintain roughly league-leading form across late May–mid-June, so that on the MLB standings page on/after June 15, 2025, they appear with the highest (or tied-highest) winning percentage.",
    "rationale": "- Base rate and priors: On any midseason date, a randomly chosen team has ~3.3% chance to be best of 30. The Dodgers, however, are a perennial outlier with top preseason projections and deep roster strength, so a prior in the 20–30% range is reasonable for “best record on a given midseason date.”\n- Persistence over short horizons: From May 19 to June 15 is ~4 weeks. Season-long winning percentage by mid-June is based on ~65–75 games; only ~25–30 additional games occur before June 15. That dampens volatility—leaders tend to remain near the top. Thus, whatever the current ordering is, it’s likely to be similar by June 15. Because I lack current-standings data today, I lean on a Dodgers-favorable prior but still keep probability well below 50% given the number of credible contenders.\n- Competition: Multiple AL and NL contenders plausibly hold or overtake the top spot by mid-June. Even if LA is elite, the chance that exactly one of Yankees/Orioles/Phillies/Braves/others is fractionally ahead on the check date is substantial. Also, the resolution depends on when Metaculus checks on/after June 15; day-to-day variance around that weekend slightly lowers odds for any single team.\n- Ties: If the Dodgers are tied for the best winning percentage as shown on MLB.com, this should still count as “have the highest,” which modestly boosts LA’s chances relative to a “sole best” interpretation.\n- Why not higher? Because several top-tier teams can feasibly be ahead by a razor-thin margin on the exact check time; absent evidence the Dodgers are presently leading by a cushion, >35% would be overstated.\n- Why not lower? The Dodgers’ superior underlying strength and frequent early-season dominance justify a materially elevated probability over the 3–10% range.\n- What would move me up: Evidence that as of late May the Dodgers already hold (or are tied for) MLB’s best record, or that close rivals have key injuries/slumps, or that LA’s upcoming schedule is notably soft.\n- What would move me down: Confirmation that another team currently leads by >1–2 games in the loss column, adverse Dodgers injury news to key stars, or a notably tougher LA schedule into mid-June.\n- Research assistant input: None provided beyond the prompt; thus, I rely on structural/base-rate reasoning and team-quality priors.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill the LA Dodgers have the highest winning percentage in the MLB on June 15, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nYahoo Sports: [Even as Dodgers navigate injuries and manage pitcher usage, the wins keep coming](https://sports.yahoo.com/mlb/article/even-as-dodgers-navigate-injuries-and-manage-pitcher-usage-the-wins-keep-coming-053322413.html)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if the Los Angeles Dodgers have the highest winning percentage in Major League Baseball according to the [MLB official standings](https://www.mlb.com/standings/) when checked by Metaculus on or after June 15, 2025.\n\nNo other resolution source will be used to resolve the question. Question resolves based on how the page appears when checked by a Metaculus Admin.\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nNo additional information available.\n\nToday is 2025-05-19.\n\nBefore answering you think:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n(e) You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
