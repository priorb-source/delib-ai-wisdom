    "review": "Both forecasters align on key constraints: regular session is over, no evidence of passage, and any remaining path requires inclusion in an extended/special session. Forecaster 3 adds a useful procedural nuance (bills can become law without the governor’s signature) and emphasizes that purely database checks wouldn’t count—though in this question HB 831 is explicitly cited as qualifying, which slightly mitigates that concern. Forecaster 2’s point that passage would likely have been reported if it happened is persuasive. Both rightly note GOP trifecta as a nontrivial upside but stress legal friction and process/timing hurdles. I find F3’s 30% high given the lack of signals for a special session on elections; F2’s 18% is closer to my prior, with solid reasoning on inertia and agenda control.",
    "rationale": "Time remaining (~8 weeks) and process bottlenecks dominate. The regular session ended without enactment; CS/HB 1381 was withdrawn, and there’s no credible reporting that an elections omnibus with qualifying language passed late. The extended session beginning May 12 is focused on the budget; expanding its scope to voter-citizenship verification is possible but atypical. A separate special session could be called, and the GOP trifecta could pass and enact quickly, but we have no public signals that leadership intends to do so. Legal complexity around documentary proof may further dampen urgency. That said, the bar for a Yes is broad (the question explicitly says HB 831 would count), which preserves some upside if leadership seeks a narrower approach that still meets the criterion. Incorporating the other forecasters’ points, I slightly raise my estimate to reflect the multiple qualifying paths and the ease of gubernatorial enactment if passed, while still weighting the lack of session scope signals and recent withdrawal of key bills.",
