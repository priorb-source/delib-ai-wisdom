    "review": "Both forecasters make compelling arguments that I underweighted in my initial analysis. They correctly emphasize three critical factors: (1) The complete absence of preparatory signals - no exploratory committee filings, no staff hires, no leaked announcement dates, no scheduled events. With only 26 days remaining, major campaign launches are almost always preceded by such indicators. (2) The lack of electoral urgency - there's no forcing mechanism requiring a July 1 announcement. The primary is 14+ months away, and Forecaster 2 astutely notes the Miami City Commission election timing issue, which could reduce pressure further. (3) The 5% polling figure suggests Suarez needs substantial groundwork before launching, not a rushed announcement. Their independent convergence on 15% based on rigorous empirical reasoning is notable. They appropriately weight the status quo heavily given the short timeframe and absence of visible activity.",
    "rationale": "Upon reflection, my initial 30% forecast overweighted the Axios 'weighing' article and underweighted the significance of zero preparatory signals in a 26-day window. Campaign announcements of this magnitude are logistically complex. The fact that we see no leaked dates, no committee paperwork, no staff announcements, and no scheduled events is indeed the strongest evidence available. Each passing day without such signals makes the status quo (no announcement) more likely. I should also weight more heavily that there's no strategic imperative for a pre-July 1 announcement - the primary is August 2026, making fall 2025 or early 2026 equally viable timeframes. However, I maintain slightly higher probability than 15% because: (1) Modern campaigns can pivot quickly via social media, (2) 'Weighing' suggests active consideration beyond mere speculation, and (3) Surprise announcements, while rare, do occur. But the other forecasters are largely correct - the evidence strongly points toward no announcement in this narrow window.",
