  "information": "The United States and Ukraine have signed an agreement establishing a fund for reconstruction and granting the US administration access to Ukraine's mineral resources, including rare earth minerals. In an official statement about the deal, the US Treasury Department mentioned the 'large-scale invasion' of Ukraine by Russia. In parallel, the US has urged both Russia and Ukraine to accept its peace proposal during a UN Security Council meeting. On February 24, 2025, the US voted against a UN resolution demanding the immediate withdrawal of Russian troops from Ukrainian territory, aligning with Russia and North Korea. The US presented an alternative resolution that called for a 'swift end' to the conflict without mentioning Russian aggression.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "About 61 days (until June 30, 2025 inclusive)",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Russia keeps its ground forces confined to Ukraine and existing deployments with host-country consent (e.g., Belarus), avoids any new cross-border ground incursion into non-consenting states, and the US maintains its current rhetoric (occupation/illegal presence) without newly labeling another case as an “invasion.”",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "A discrete, publicized event prompts the US to say Russia has invaded another country by sending ground forces without consent. Plausible paths include: (1) a Russian move beyond occupation lines in Georgia into Tbilisi-controlled territory; (2) reinforcement or new deployments in Moldova/Transnistria without Chisinau’s consent; (3) a cross-border ground incursion into a NATO/non‑NATO neighbor (e.g., a small unit entering the Baltics or Finland) that Washington labels an invasion; or (4) a sudden, explicit US rhetorical shift that newly characterizes Russia’s existing non-consensual troop presence (e.g., in Moldova) as an “invasion.”",
    "rationale": "- Baseline and time horizon: With only about two months left, large geopolitical changes of this magnitude are uncommon. The status quo strongly favors “No.”\n- Russian capability and incentives: Russia remains heavily committed in Ukraine. Opening a second front or staging a new non-consensual deployment into another country before July 1 would be risky and costly, especially against NATO members. Non‑NATO neighbors most at risk are Georgia and Moldova (Transnistria), but logistics and escalation risks dampen near‑term odds.\n- US rhetoric to date: The US consistently labels Russia’s actions in Georgia as occupation stemming from the 2008 war and calls for withdrawal from Moldova/Transnistria, typically using terms like “illegal presence” rather than “invasion.” A deliberate US rhetorical reclassification to “invasion” absent a new event is possible but uncommon in a short window.\n- Tail risks: Small, deniable incursions or border provocations could occur; if publicly attributed to Russia’s ground forces, the US would likely use strong language. However, the probability of such an event by July 1 is low.\n- Research assistant info: The assistant’s claims (e.g., that the US voted with Russia and North Korea at the UN on Feb 24, 2025) conflict with well-established US positions and appear non-credible; they do not influence this forecast.\nWhy not higher? Because a fresh Russian ground incursion outside Ukraine—or a sudden US rhetorical shift to label existing situations as an “invasion”—within 61 days is unlikely, and would carry major geopolitical consequences.\nWhy not lower? Because limited-probability scenarios exist: a localized move in Georgia or Moldova, or a small cross-border incident into a NATO state that Washington labels an invasion. Also, a policy/rhetorical shift could, in principle, satisfy the resolution.\nWhat would move me upward? Credible reporting of Russian troop movements toward Moldova/Transnistria or Georgian ABLs; unusual Kremlin statements signaling deployments; sudden unrest inviting “peacekeepers” without host consent; or US officials previewing language that calls Russia’s non-consensual troop presence elsewhere an “invasion.”\nWhat would move me downward? Clear de-escalatory signals, Russian drawdowns near vulnerable borders, or reaffirmations from the US that maintain current terminology (occupation/illegal presence) without invoking “invasion.”",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nBefore July 1, 2025, will the United States accuse Russia of invading any country other than Ukraine?\n\nQuestion background:\nSky News [Ukraine war: Which countries could Putin go for next? Is Europe vulnerable to a nuclear-armed bully?

These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if, before July 1, 2025, the US government publicly accuses Russia of invading any country other than Ukraine, by Russia sending its ground military forces into that country without consent from the government of the country.\n\n\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nThe United States and Ukraine have signed an agreement establishing a fund for reconstruction and granting the US administration access to Ukraine's mineral resources, including rare earth minerals.

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
