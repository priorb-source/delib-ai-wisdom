    "review": "The other two forecasters and I are in strong agreement on the fundamental dynamics of this question. We all identified the central conflict between the significant judicial obstacles (the extended TRO, the finding of 'plausible' claims, the typically slow legal process) and the strong political will of the executive branch to deport Mahmoud Khalil. I found their analyses highly convincing and well-reasoned. Forecaster 3's framing of a 'Yes' outcome requiring 'a series of low-probability events to occur in rapid succession' was a particularly clear and compelling articulation of why that outcome is so unlikely. Similarly, Forecaster 2's statement that 'the timeline is the government's biggest enemy here' perfectly captures the core challenge facing the administration. There were no major new pieces of evidence, but their consistent logic and slightly lower probability caused me to re-evaluate my own weighting of the factors.",
    "rationale": "After reviewing the other analyses, I am lowering my forecast from 15% to 10%, aligning with the consensus. My initial reasoning was nearly identical to that of the other forecasters, but they have convinced me that I was likely giving slightly too much weight to the political will of the executive branch and not quite enough to the institutional inertia and procedural checks of the federal judiciary. The consensus view reinforces that the TRO, combined with a timeline of less than seven weeks, creates a very high barrier for the government to clear. For Khalil to be deported, a federal court would have to quickly dismiss his plausible First Amendment claims, lift the TRO, and then any subsequent appeal for an emergency stay would also have to fail—all within a matter of weeks. The probability of this sequence of events is very low. The 10% probability accounts for the small chance that the executive branch's intense focus on this case leads to an unusually rapid judicial outcome in their favor, but correctly reflects that the far more likely outcome is that the legal process will extend beyond the July 1, 2025 deadline.",
