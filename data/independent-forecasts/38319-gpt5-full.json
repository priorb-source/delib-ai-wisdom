  "information": "Tohoku's industrial production index for March 2025 increased by 7.6% month-over-month, the first rise in three months. The increase was driven by a 52.9% rise in machinery for industrial use, including semiconductors. For context, the nationwide preliminary Industrial Production Index for April 2025 showed a decline of 0.9% month-over-month. Historically, from 2015-2024, the monthly change for the Tohoku index was positive approximately 55% of the time, but the series exhibits modestly negative serial correlation, indicating a tendency for mean-reversion after large monthly movements.\n\nA survey by the Imperial Data Bank found that for 2025, only 19.2% of companies in the Tohoku region expect an increase in revenue and profits, a three-year low, while 26.2% expect a decrease, citing fluctuating oil prices, inflation, and labor shortages. In April 2025, corporate bankruptcies in the region rose to 53, a 32.5% increase from the same month last year and the third consecutive month of increases. Additionally, new company establishments in the region decreased by 5% in 2024, the first annual decrease in two years.\n\nThe Bank of Japan's April regional economic report maintained its judgment that the Tohoku economy is \"recovering.\" The report specified that production of machinery and equipment is also \"recovering,\" driven by strong demand for semiconductors related to artificial intelligence development. A surveyed manufacturer stated they expected related product production to remain at a high level until at least the middle of 2025. Conversely, the Golden Week holidays, which fall at the end of April, typically dampen production in the region’s electronics and machinery plants.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "About 17 days (expected around June 21, 2025)",
    "status_quo_outcome": "A slight month-over-month decline (No), as March’s large jump mean-reverts and regional production tracks the national April dip.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Payback from March’s +7.6% surge in machinery/electronics plus Golden Week effects and alignment with the nationwide April −0.9% m/m pull overall production to ≤0.0%.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Semiconductor-related machinery and electronics remain elevated on strong AI demand and backlog, offsetting holiday softness and lifting production slightly above 0.0% m/m.",
    "rationale": "Base rate: From 2015–2024, Tohoku’s monthly change is positive ~55%, so a naïve prior favors Yes.\nSignals pushing lower: (1) Negative serial correlation after a large move—March was +7.6% m/m, suggesting mean reversion; (2) Nationwide preliminary IP for April is −0.9% m/m, and regional series usually co-move with the national index; (3) Golden Week tends to dampen April output in electronics/machinery (even if partly seasonally adjusted, residual effects can linger). These factors tilt the odds below the base rate.\nSignals pushing higher: The BoJ’s April report judges Tohoku as “recovering,” with machinery/equipment supported by AI-related semiconductor demand; a manufacturer expects high production through mid-2025. That resilience tempers how far below 50% we should go.\nWhy not higher: The combination of national April decline, typical holiday softness, and mean reversion after March’s spike argue against a >50% chance of an increase. Why not lower: Persistent semiconductor-related strength and the BoJ’s recovery assessment keep the risk of a small positive print non-trivial, and the long-run base rate is slightly above 50%.\nWhat would move me up: Evidence of strong April output in Tohoku’s semiconductor/machinery clusters (firm disclosures, shipment/export data), or national IP revisions turning April positive. What would move me down: Reports of April outages, maintenance, supply disruptions, or firm-level downticks in Tohoku electronics/machinery, or confirmation that holiday effects were unusually large and not fully adjusted.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill the Northeast Japan region (Tohoku) show a month-over-month increase in April 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\n[Tohoku's March industrial production index rises 7.6% from the previous month, the first increase in three months](https://www.nikkei.com/article/DGXZQOCC214DI0R20C25A5000000/)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below.

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
