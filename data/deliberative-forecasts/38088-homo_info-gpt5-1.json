    "review": "New points I hadn’t explicitly incorporated: (1) a quantitative base-rate for the 200–300 band (~38% U.S.), (2) a claimed decline in U.S. share of the top 500 from ~40% to ~35%, and (3) the notion that large-cap U.S. outperformance chiefly affects the top ranks more than the 250 area. I find (1) and (3) persuasive and aligned with my priors; (2) is plausible and nudges the base rate down slightly. The “seasonality” claim of weaker U.S. representation in Q1–Q2 is speculative and I’m assigning it little weight without stronger evidence. Both forecasters’ emphasis on the current non-U.S. incumbent at #250 and the non-U.S.-heavy pool around that rank is reasonable and supports a sub-40% stance.",
    "rationale": "I anchored near the U.S. share in the 200–300 band (~38%) and adjusted for: (a) the current non-U.S. holder at #250 (most recently Russia), (b) the likelihood that nearby ranks are more non-U.S. than U.S., and (c) one month of market and FX volatility that can move a few spots but is unlikely to overturn the base composition. Broad late-May equity strength seems global and top-heavy, so it may not advantage U.S. names specifically around #250. Currency could matter at the margin; unless the USD meaningfully strengthens into late June, it doesn’t justify a higher U.S. probability. Netting these, I trim slightly from my prior 38% to reflect the added base-rate evidence and status quo tilt against the U.S.",
