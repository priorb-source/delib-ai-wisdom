    "review": "Both forecasters’ arguments closely track my priors: CDC’s base-rate behavior for yellow fever rarely exceeds Level 2, even during larger outbreaks (e.g., Brazil 2017–18), and Level 3 typically requires sustained urban transmission or unmitigable traveler risk. They also emphasize the short time window and CDC’s recent issuance of a Level 2 regional notice—both favor inertia. New (minor) considerations they raised: rainy-season vector dynamics and the possibility of fractional dosing/vaccine access affecting risk mitigation. These points slightly refine but don’t materially shift my assessment. I find their reasoning sound and consistent with CDC precedent. No compelling new evidence suggests an imminent shift to Level 3 within ~5–6 weeks absent a clear epidemiological break (urban transmission, exported cases, or demonstrated vaccine access failure).",
    "rationale": "I maintain a low probability due to: (1) CDC precedent to keep yellow fever at Level 2 with vaccination mitigation, even during larger outbreaks; (2) current epidemiology concentrated in rural areas without verified urban transmission in major Colombian cities; (3) the short lead time and the CDC’s tendency not to rapidly escalate shortly after issuing a regional Level 2. Paths to Yes remain: confirmed sustained urban transmission in a major city, multiple exported traveler cases linked to urban centers, or a material vaccine access shortfall undermining mitigation—none are currently evidenced. The added considerations from peers (rainy season, vaccine supply/operational measures like fractional dosing) do not change the balance: rainy season raises theoretical risk, but without urban seeding it’s unlikely to trigger a Level 3 before June 1; and vaccine strategies/support reduce, not increase, the likelihood of a Level 3. Thus, I do not update.",
