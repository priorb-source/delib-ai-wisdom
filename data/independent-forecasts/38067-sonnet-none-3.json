    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Approximately 1-2 weeks. The James Beard Awards ceremony typically occurs in early June, and we are currently in late May 2025. The finalists have already been announced, and the winner will be revealed at the upcoming ceremony.",
    "status_quo_outcome": "A male chef wins the award, consistent with historical patterns in the Outstanding Chef category which has been predominantly won by men.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "One of the male finalists for the Outstanding Chef category is selected as the winner at the June 2025 awards ceremony, continuing the male-dominated trend in this particular category.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "A female finalist is selected as the winner of the Outstanding Chef award at the ceremony, representing continued progress in recognizing women at the highest levels of culinary achievement.",
    "rationale": "The finalists for the 2025 awards have already been announced, meaning the pool of potential winners is fixed. The outcome depends entirely on which finalist is selected by the judges. Without specific information about the composition of the Outstanding Chef finalist pool, I must rely on historical patterns and recent trends. Historically, the Outstanding Chef category has been male-dominated, though not exclusively. The James Beard Foundation has made efforts in recent years to increase diversity and recognition of underrepresented groups in their awards. This suggests the probability may be higher than the pure historical base rate. However, the culinary industry at the highest levels remains male-dominated, and status quo outcomes tend to persist. My forecast is not higher because: (1) historical data shows male dominance in this category, (2) the field of chefs at the elite level still skews male, and (3) without knowing the specific finalists, I cannot confirm women are even represented. My forecast is not lower because: (1) recent years have seen increased recognition of female culinary talent, (2) the James Beard Foundation has actively worked toward diversity, and (3) there have been female winners of this award before, establishing precedent. I would update higher if I learned that multiple strong female candidates are among the finalists, or if recent years showed a trend of female winners. I would update lower if I learned there are no female finalists or very few compared to male finalists.",
