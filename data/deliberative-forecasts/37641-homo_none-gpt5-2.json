    "review": "Both forecasters add a key point I underweighted: multiple reports suggest Circle intends to list on the NYSE, which meaningfully reduces venue risk. They also argue that a June roadshow/pricing is operationally feasible within the remaining ~6–7 weeks. I agree with the feasibility. Where I’m less convinced is on their high confidence in execution without concrete markers (roadshow launch, declared effectiveness, confirmed ticker/listing date). Given crypto/regulatory sensitivity and how often target windows slip by a few weeks, 65–70% feels optimistic absent those signals. Still, the NYSE-intent point is a material update versus my prior exchange uncertainty and should move the probability up.",
    "rationale": "Updating upward primarily to reflect reduced venue risk if Circle’s S-1 and press coverage indeed specify an NYSE listing. With the IPO window open and enough time remaining for a June roadshow and pricing, a late-June debut is plausible. However, I keep a substantial discount for timing/execution risk: as of mid-May there’s no widely reported roadshow, SEC effectiveness, or firm listing date; modest delays would push past July 1. Crypto-related headline risk and potential SEC or market hiccups further cap odds. Triggers up: announcement of roadshow with June pricing, SEC effectiveness, NYSE approval/ticker confirmation, or credible reports of a June listing week. Triggers down: any indication of slip into July, adverse regulatory developments, a Nasdaq venue, or a risk-off turn in IPO markets.",
