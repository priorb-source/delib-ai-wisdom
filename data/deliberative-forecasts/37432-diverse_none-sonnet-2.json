    "review": "Both forecasters raised important points I hadn't fully considered. Forecaster 3's clarification that gubernatorial action is NOT required for enactment is crucial - this removes a significant procedural hurdle. Forecaster 2's emphasis on the GOP supermajority and historical precedent (2023 photo ID law) provides valuable context about Ohio's willingness to pass election-related legislation. Most importantly, Forecaster 3's insight about the June 30 budget deadline creates a plausible fast-track mechanism: attaching this provision to the must-pass biennial budget. This is a concrete path to Yes that I underweighted.\n\nHowever, I also note several counterarguments: (1) The bill was only introduced May 1, giving it just 4 days of existence with no reported movement; (2) Budget negotiations typically consume legislative bandwidth, and controversial election riders could complicate must-pass fiscal legislation; (3) The research assistant found no additional information suggesting active momentum; (4) Federal preemption concerns under NVRA could make leadership hesitant to prioritize this during critical budget negotiations.\n\nForecaster 2's 30% may overweight the favorable political alignment relative to the severe time constraint. Forecaster 3's 24% seems well-calibrated, appropriately balancing the budget attachment possibility against the practical difficulties of bicameral passage in under 8 weeks.",
    "rationale": "I am updating my forecast upward based on three key factors I underweighted: (1) No gubernatorial signature required, making enactment easier than typical legislation; (2) The budget attachment mechanism provides a viable fast-track path, given Ohio's June 30 budget deadline sits just before the July 1 resolution date; (3) Recent introduction (May 1) and GOP supermajority demonstrate both current interest and procedural capacity.\n\nHowever, I'm not moving as high as 30% because the timeline remains extremely compressed - even with favorable conditions, passing identical language through both chambers in under 8 weeks faces significant practical obstacles. The competing demands of budget negotiations could easily consume available legislative time, and there's no evidence the bill has advanced beyond introduction in its first 4 days. The budget attachment path, while plausible, is far from guaranteed - controversial election provisions could complicate passage of must-pass fiscal legislation.\n\nI'm settling near the midpoint between my original 18% and the other forecasts, closest to Forecaster 3's reasoning, which I find most persuasive in balancing the genuine paths to Yes against the formidable timing and procedural challenges.",
