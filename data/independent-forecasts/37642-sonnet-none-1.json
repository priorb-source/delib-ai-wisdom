    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Approximately 1.5 months (47 days from May 14, 2025 to July 1, 2025)",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No - the Fed maintains its current pause on rate cuts",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "The Federal Reserve continues its current pause through its next scheduled FOMC meeting (likely mid-June 2025), determining that economic conditions do not warrant further rate cuts. Inflation remains at levels that concern policymakers, labor markets stay resilient, and the Fed prefers to wait and assess the impact of previous rate cuts before making additional moves.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Economic data between now and the June FOMC meeting shows significant softening - either inflation falling faster than expected, meaningful labor market weakness, or financial market stress. This prompts the FOMC to announce a 25 basis point cut at their June meeting, resuming the rate cutting cycle they had previously paused.",
    "rationale": "The key context is that the Fed has been in a rate-cutting cycle but has paused, suggesting they are near an inflection point and waiting to assess economic data. With approximately 1.5 months until resolution, there is likely one FOMC meeting (expected in mid-June) where action could be taken. The status quo strongly favors 'No' - when central banks pause, they typically remain paused for multiple meetings as they assess the lagged effects of previous policy changes. The Fed moves deliberately and requires clear evidence before changing course. However, the probability is not negligible because: (1) the Fed was recently cutting, showing willingness to ease policy, (2) there is a scheduled meeting in the window where they could act, and (3) economic conditions can shift within 6-8 weeks. For me to update higher, I would need to see: deteriorating economic data, falling inflation prints, or Fed officials signaling openness to near-term cuts. For me to update lower, I would need: strong economic data, persistent inflation, or explicit Fed guidance that rates will remain steady for an extended period. Given the short timeframe, status quo bias, and the Fed's recent pause, I weight the 'No' outcome heavily while acknowledging the non-trivial possibility of one more cut.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill the Federal Reserve cut interest rates before July 1, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nJP Morgan: [Following the Fed’s decision to pause rate cuts, what could its next move be?](https://www.jpmorgan.com/insights/global-research/economy/fed-rate-cuts)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if, after the launch of this question and before July 1, 2025 the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) announces a reduction of any amount in the target federal funds rate range.\r\nThe primary resolution source is the FOMC's *target federal funds rate or range* webpage [here](https://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/openmarket.htm), the Federal Reserve's official minutes and statements [here](https://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/fomccalendars.htm), or other [credible sources](https://www.metaculus.com/help/faq/#definitions) in case the Federal Reserve's website is unavailable or not timely updated.\n\nThis question resolves based on the announcement. Therefore, the effective date of the rate cut does not need to be before the resolution date, as long as the announcement is made before then.\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nNo additional information available.\n\nToday is 2025-05-14.\n\nBefore answering you think:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n(e) You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
