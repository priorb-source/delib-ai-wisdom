    "review": "Both forecasters introduced critical information I lacked. Forecaster 2 referenced polling data showing a close race with 20% undecided and identified a specific mechanism (Tobago vote-splitting between TPP and PDP) that could deliver 2 crucial seats to PNM. They appropriately dismissed the 72%-18% poll as an outlier inconsistent with Trinidad's historically tight elections. Forecaster 3 provided the most important contextual update: Keith Rowley resigned and Stuart Young is now leading PNM, making this an early election triggered by leadership transition rather than strategic timing. This fundamentally changes the incumbency calculus. Additionally, Forecaster 3 noted a high-profile defection (former Attorney General Jeremie backing UNC), the UNC-COP alliance, and crime as a salient anti-incumbent issue. These are substantial headwinds I hadn't factored in. The corrected 2020 result (22-19, not 21-19) is noted. Both forecasters converged around 52-58%, significantly lower than my 62%.",
    "rationale": "The leadership transition from Rowley to Young is the most significant new information, fundamentally weakening the incumbency advantage I initially weighted heavily. This is not a continuation scenario with an established leader but rather a new leader defending a narrow majority in an election forced by resignation. This organizational disruption, combined with elite defections and the UNC-COP alliance, creates genuine uncertainty. However, I'm not going as low as Forecaster 3's 52% because: (1) The Tobago vote-splitting mechanism Forecaster 2 identified provides a concrete, credible path to 2 seats for PNM; (2) Even with leadership change, PNM retains organizational infrastructure and the 22-19 baseline; (3) The 20% undecided voters in a close race don't automatically favor the opposition. My updated forecast of 55% reflects that this is essentially a toss-up with a marginal PNM edge from Tobago dynamics and baseline structural advantages, while fully accounting for the leadership transition and anti-incumbent factors that make a UNC plurality very plausible.",
