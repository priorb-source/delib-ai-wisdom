    "review": "Both forecasters largely align with my prior view: capability at Punggye‑ri exists, but absent visible pre‑test signatures and with only ~2 months left, the base case is No. Forecaster 2’s emphasis on historical clustering and the lack of observable site activity is persuasive and matches my priors. Forecaster 3 adds two points I hadn’t explicitly weighted: (1) a salient political date (June 25, the Korean War anniversary—this year’s 75th) as a plausible timing hook, and (2) somewhat reduced international penalty given a more divided UNSC. I find both points directionally credible. However, neither overcomes the meaningful predictive value of observable pre-test preparations typically appearing days to weeks in advance. The absence of such signs today still dominates my near-term assessment.",
    "rationale": "I started at 7%. I continue to weigh most heavily: (a) no public pre‑test signatures at Punggye‑ri, (b) the short remaining window, and (c) DPRK’s demonstrated preference since 2017 to signal via missile and conventional systems. I slightly update upward for two reasons: the 75th anniversary on June 25 provides a natural provocation window inside the horizon, and the marginal cost of testing may be lower given weaker UNSC cohesion, which modestly increases tail risk. Still, historically, North Korean nuclear tests have been preceded by visible site activity (vehicle surges, cable reels/diagnostic gear, portal work, pumping) detectable by commercial satellites, and none has been credibly reported. With roughly 8–9 weeks left, I think the conditional hazard is front‑loaded into mid-to-late June and will be highly sensitive to any emergent prep signatures. Net effect: a small upward adjustment, but not to the teens absent corroborating indicators.",
