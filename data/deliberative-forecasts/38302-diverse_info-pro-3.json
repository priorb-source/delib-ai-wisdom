    "review": "The other forecasters provided critical context that I had overlooked. My initial analysis was too focused on the high-level trend of three consecutive negative prints and weak macro data. Forecaster 2's points about the shrinking magnitude of deflation (to just -0.1%) and the resilience of core CPI (+0.5%) were particularly convincing. This suggests the deflationary pressures are not as entrenched or broad-based as I had assumed, and that the headline figure is hovering precariously close to zero. Forecaster 3 added further valuable nuance with a detailed component analysis, highlighting the specific drags from pork and regulated energy prices, but also noting that the low base from May 2024 makes a negative print mathematically more difficult this year. Both analyses correctly identified that with the headline figure so close to the threshold, the outcome is far more uncertain than my initial 80% forecast reflected. Their reasoning was compelling and exposed an overconfidence in my initial assessment.",
    "rationale": "I am significantly revising my forecast downward from 80% to 65%. My initial forecast was based on the clear deflationary momentum and weak high-frequency data from manufacturing and property sectors. While those pressures remain valid, the other experts' analyses convinced me that I had underestimated several key countervailing factors. The most important factor is that the prior two months of deflation were only -0.1%. A reading this close to zero is highly susceptible to small fluctuations in any component, making a flip to 0.0% or a slightly positive number a very real possibility. Secondly, the fact that core inflation remains positive indicates the deflation is not a broad-based economic phenomenon but is concentrated in volatile food and energy prices. Finally, as Forecaster 3 noted, a low CPI reading in the base month (May 2024) makes it mathematically harder to achieve a year-over-year decline. While I still believe that the persistence of weak demand and negative producer prices makes another month of deflation the most likely outcome, these counterpoints introduce substantial uncertainty. Therefore, I am reducing my probability by 15 percentage points to 65% to better reflect the genuine possibility of a flat or marginally positive reading.",
