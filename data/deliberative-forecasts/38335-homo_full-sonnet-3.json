    "review": "Both forecasters independently arrived at 18%, which is 7 percentage points lower than my initial 25%. Their convergence on this lower figure is notable. They both emphasized several points I underweighted: (1) The complete absence of ANY visible campaign preparation is more significant than I acknowledged - in modern politics, there are almost always leaks or signals before announcements, (2) The House probe timing creates more serious impediment than I credited - launching while under investigation would be politically reckless, (3) Trump's endorsement of Donalds fundamentally changes the race dynamics in a GOP primary where Trump's backing is often decisive, and (4) 26 days without preparation signals is genuinely very short, not just 'tight but possible.' I may have been too optimistic about the June 30 fundraising deadline as a catalyst. While it's a natural announcement point, if she intended to announce by then, we would likely see SOME preparation activity by June 5. The other forecasters correctly note that for a major gubernatorial campaign, the complete silence on staffing and fundraising is a strong negative signal, not just a neutral absence of information.",
    "rationale": "Upon reflection, I gave insufficient weight to the combination of negative factors. The status quo bias should be stronger given: (1) Zero visible preparation as of June 5 with only 26 days remaining, (2) Active House probe creating reputational risk that makes an announcement inadvisable, (3) Trump's endorsement of Donalds fundamentally altering the competitive landscape, and (4) Her consistent noncommittal responses suggesting genuine indecision rather than strategic ambiguity before an imminent announcement. My initial 25% implied roughly a 1-in-4 chance despite all these headwinds, which seems too generous. However, I don't think the probability should be as low as 10% because: the June 30 deadline remains a plausible catalyst, she hasn't definitively ruled out running, and the timeframe is still within historical norms. I'm updating downward to 20%, splitting the difference between my original forecast and the other forecasters, acknowledging their arguments are compelling while maintaining slightly more probability mass on a late-June surprise announcement.",
