  "information": "Colombia has declared a national health emergency due to a yellow fever outbreak. As of April 2025, there have been 79 reported cases and 36 deaths since 2024, with the departments of Tolima and Putumayo being the most affected. The government has implemented mobility restrictions in high-risk areas and vaccination requirements for travelers. In response to rising cases in South America, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has issued a level 2 travel notice for the continent, citing spread to newly affected areas in Bolivia, Colombia, and Peru.\n\nThe Pan American Health Organization (PAHO) issued an epidemiological alert in early April 2025 due to an increase in yellow fever cases in the Americas. In the first three months of 2025, 131 human cases and 53 deaths were confirmed in the region, primarily in Brazil, Colombia, and Peru. This case count is more than double the total for all of 2024. Separately, the United Nations has warned that global aid funding cuts are disrupting child vaccination programs at a level similar to the COVID-19 pandemic, contributing to a rise in yellow fever cases after years of decline.\n\nSeveral countries near the outbreak zones have implemented preventive measures. Panama has activated health protocols, although it has not reported a human case since 1974 and has vaccination coverage of over 95% in high-risk areas. Ecuador has also activated protocols and is conducting preventive vaccination campaigns. Costa Rica has made the yellow fever vaccine mandatory for travelers arriving from 43 countries, including many in South America, as of March 11, 2025, due to the presence of the Aedes aegypti mosquito vector in the country.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Approximately 5 weeks. The question resolves on or after June 1, 2025, and the current date is April 24, 2025.",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No. Currently, the CDC has a travel notice for yellow fever in South America, but no specific North American country is listed.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "The yellow fever outbreak remains contained within South America. Preventive measures in border countries like Panama and Costa Rica are effective at preventing the importation and local transmission of the virus. No confirmed human cases are reported in any North American country, and therefore the CDC does not issue a relevant travel advisory by the resolution date.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "The severe outbreak in Colombia spreads across the border into Panama. Despite existing health protocols, one or more human cases of yellow fever are confirmed in Panama and officially reported. Given the heightened regional alert, the CDC acts quickly and issues a travel health notice for Panama, a North American country, before June 1, 2025.",
    "rationale": "My forecast is heavily weighted towards the status quo, which is 'No'. The primary reason is the very short timeframe of just over one month. For a 'Yes' outcome, the virus would need to cross from South America into a North American country, infect humans, be detected, be officially reported, and then trigger a CDC travel advisory, all before June 1, 2025. While the outbreak in neighboring Colombia is severe, which increases the baseline risk, key North American border countries have already implemented strong preventive measures. Panama, the most likely candidate for spread due to its border with Colombia, has activated health protocols and has high vaccination coverage in high-risk zones, significantly reducing the probability of an outbreak. Costa Rica has also implemented mandatory vaccination for travelers from affected regions. While the vector mosquito is present in these areas, the existing public health infrastructure and proactive measures create a strong buffer. The current CDC advisory is for the continent of South America, and they would require a specific, confirmed outbreak within a North American country to issue a new advisory. The combination of a short timeline and robust preventive measures in the most at-risk countries makes a 'Yes' outcome highly unlikely. My probability is not lower because the proximity and intensity of the Colombian outbreak create a non-zero risk of a rapid, unexpected cross-border transmission event. I would increase this forecast significantly if there were credible reports of confirmed human cases in Panama. Conversely, I would lower it if Colombia showed a sharp decline in cases near its northern border.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill any North American country be listed as having a CDC yellow fever travel advisory on June 1, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\n[PAHO issues new epidemiological alert amid rising yellow fever cases in the Americas](https://www.paho.org/en/news/31-3-2025-paho-issues-new-epidemiological-alert-amid-rising-yellow-fever-cases-americas)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below.

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower.
