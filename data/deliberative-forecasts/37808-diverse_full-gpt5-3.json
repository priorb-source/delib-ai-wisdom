    "review": "Both forecasters emphasize the same core drivers I used: the program’s statutory basis, very short timeline to July 1, and bureaucratic inertia keeping federal webpages stable. They also appropriately flag that DEI-related directives are not directly applicable to a statutory immigration program page and that aggressive immigration moves have faced quick legal challenges (TPS example). One nuance I’ll add is that the resolution hinges on that exact URL hosting the “Step 1: Submit an Entry” instructions; even a CMS re-slug or removal of the ‘Step 1’ page outside the entry window could fail the criterion despite the program continuing. That said, travel.state.gov tends to keep evergreen DV content up year-round with redirects when needed, making near-term URL churn less likely. I didn’t see materially new evidence that changes my risk balance; their arguments largely reinforce my prior view.",
    "rationale": "- Status quo and timing: DV-2026 is active, and DV entries for the next cycle don’t open until fall. There’s little operational reason to take down the instructions page before July 1. Legislative termination by then is implausible given process and politics.\n- Executive/administrative risk: While the administration opposes DV, pulling a statutory program’s instruction page would be conspicuous, likely litigated, and unnecessary months before the next entry window. Past practice (2017–2021) suggests rhetorical opposition doesn’t equate to near-term takedowns.\n- Technical/URL risk: The strict resolution on the specific URL is the main non-political tail risk (CMS reorganization, depublication, or a redirect that Metaculus deems non-compliant). travel.state.gov is relatively stable, and large changes usually include redirects, but a redirect might not satisfy the letter of the criterion.\n- Net: Legal/institutional inertia plus short horizon dominate, with small but real risks from targeted administrative action or URL changes. No new arguments from others materially shift this balance, so I’m holding my forecast.\n- Watch items: I’d lower on any explicit directive to pause DV-2027 or retire DV entry content, or signs of a travel.state.gov restructuring that changes DV page slugs. I’d raise on continued routine DV communications in June or explicit confirmation of content stability.",
