  "information": "The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) announced it will decommission its 'Billion-Dollar Weather and Climate Disasters' database. The database, created in 1980 to track the financial costs of major climate events, will not be updated beyond 2024 and its existing information will be archived. According to AM Best, a credit rating agency, the removal of this centralized data source could hinder insurance companies' ability to model, price, and manage risks associated with climate-related disasters. NOAA communications chief Kim Doster stated the change is 'in alignment with evolving priorities, statutory mandates, and staffing changes'.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Approximately six weeks.",
    "status_quo_outcome": "Yes, the website will remain online.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "A new political administration, following a policy of downplaying climate change, issues a directive to NOAA to take Climate.gov completely offline. Despite internal resistance, the order is carried out before the resolution date as part of a broader, swift removal of climate-related information from government web properties.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Despite a political environment hostile to climate science and the decommissioning of specific datasets, the institutional inertia of a large federal agency like NOAA prevails. The political and public backlash from taking down a major informational portal like Climate.gov is deemed too high. The website remains online, even if some of its content is altered or de-emphasized.",
    "rationale": "My forecast heavily weights the status quo, as government websites, particularly major portals like Climate.gov, possess significant institutional inertia. The default outcome is that the site will remain online. The decommissioning of the 'Billion-Dollar Weather and Climate Disasters' database is a significant piece of evidence; it demonstrates a willingness by the current administration to remove or archive specific climate data sources. This action lends credibility to the 'No' scenario and prevents my forecast from being higher. However, there is a substantial difference between archiving a single (albeit important) database and taking an entire flagship domain offline. The latter action would be far more visible, controversial, and would provoke significant backlash from the scientific community, the public, and industries that rely on this information, as noted by the AM Best comment regarding the decommissioned database. Even during past administrations skeptical of climate change, entire websites were not removed, though content was sometimes altered or made harder to find. The resolution criteria only require the site to be 'UP', not for its content to be unchanged. My forecast is not lower because the technical and bureaucratic hurdles to taking a site like this down are non-trivial, and such a move would likely be a low priority compared to other policy goals in the first six months of an administration. I would update my forecast towards 'No' if there were public statements from political appointees specifically targeting Climate.gov or credible internal leaks suggesting its imminent removal. I would update towards 'Yes' if key officials publicly affirmed the site's importance and utility.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill NOAA's Climate.gov still be online on July 1, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nNational Security Archive: [Disappearing Data: Trump Administration Removing Climate Information from Government Websites](https://nsarchive.gwu.edu/briefing-book/climate-change-transparency-project-foia/2025-02-06/disappearing-data-trump)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if Climate.gov is online according to [Is It Down Right Now?](https://www.isitdownrightnow.com/climate.gov.html) when accessed by Metaculus on or after July 1, 2025.\n\nAs of May 7, 2025, the resolution source returns the message, \"Climate.gov is UP and reachable by us.\"\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nThe National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) announced it will decommission its 'Billion-Dollar Weather and Climate Disasters' database. The database, created in 1980 to track the financial costs of major climate events, will not be updated beyond 2024 and its existing information will be archived.

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
