    "review": "Both forecasters largely corroborate my take: short time window (~26 days), no pre-launch smoke (staffing, filings, venue holds, donor signals), and an already-declared Trump-endorsed rival all depress the near-term hazard rate. Forecaster 2 adds a useful wrinkle on potential resign-to-run/municipal timing friction tied to Miami’s election shift—this marginally lowers the incentive to rush a June launch. Both also correctly note that a media-only announcement would satisfy resolution, preserving some upside. I find their logic sound overall. One minor note: a desire for a “clean Q3 start” would actually argue against a pre–July 1 announcement, if anything nudging probability down for our window.",
    "rationale": "We have 26 days left. Historically, June 2025 is within the typical 12–18 month window, but serious statewide launches usually show telltale prep, which we don’t see. The field dynamics (Donalds + Trump endorsement; uncertainty about other high-profile entrants) and Miami municipal timing considerations further reduce urgency to announce in June. Suarez could still opt for a quick, media-forward declaration, but the lack of leaks or ramp-up keeps the near-term hazard low. The additional resign-to-run/term-extension angle from the other forecasters modestly reinforces a wait-and-see posture rather than a June sprint. Net, I retain a sub-1-in-5 view; I don’t see new evidence to move higher, and the small added friction offsets any calibration toward their slightly higher estimates.",
