    "review": "The other two forecasters and I are in strong agreement on the fundamental drivers of this forecast. We all identified the same three core pieces of evidence for a 'Yes' outcome: 1) President Zelenskyy's explicit and public statement of intent on May 27 ('I will be'), 2) the concrete security and logistical preparations being made by the host nation, Canada, and 3) the immense strategic value for Ukraine of an in-person appearance to lobby for continued aid and sanctions. We also converged on the same primary risk factors that could lead to a 'No' outcome: a sudden, major military escalation or a specific, credible security threat. There is no significant disagreement on the evidence or the core logic. Forecaster 2 also made an excellent point that the lack of a finalized EU sanctions package before the summit likely serves as an additional motivator for Zelenskyy to attend and lobby in person, which strengthens the case for 'Yes'. The minor difference in probabilities between 92% and 95% reflects a small variance in quantifying the tail risks, not a substantive disagreement on the analysis.",
    "rationale": "After reviewing the analyses from my fellow forecasters, my confidence in my initial assessment has been reinforced. The consensus on the key evidence and primary risks confirms that my original reasoning was sound. I find the argument that the delay in a new EU sanctions package provides an even stronger incentive for President Zelenskyy to attend in person particularly compelling, as it underscores the importance of his direct diplomatic engagement at this moment. The primary evidence remains Zelenskyy's unambiguous public commitment, which is a very high-confidence signal, and the costly and visible preparations by the Canadian government. These factors establish a very strong status quo that would require a major, unexpected event to disrupt. The main sources of uncertainty are the low-probability, high-impact events inherent to a nation at war—a sudden battlefield crisis or a direct security threat. Given the lack of any current intelligence suggesting such an event is imminent, I assess the probability of one occurring and forcing a cancellation in the next twelve days to be low. Therefore, I see no reason to adjust my forecast. I will maintain my initial probability, which already accounts for these tail risks.",
