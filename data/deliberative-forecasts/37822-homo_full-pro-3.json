    "review": "My initial forecast of 60% was primarily driven by Beto O'Rourke's history of early campaign announcements, which aligns well with the July 1, 2025 deadline. The other two forecasters, while acknowledging this historical precedent, both arrived at a lower probability of 40%. Their core argument, which I found highly persuasive, is that I underweighted the significance of the lack of current, observable campaign activity. They correctly emphasized that with only about 40 days until the deadline, the absence of any FEC filings, an exploratory committee, or credible reports of senior staff hires is a very strong negative signal. They also compellingly argued that his recent string of losses likely necessitates a more cautious and deliberate exploratory phase than in his previous campaigns, making a quick launch less probable. Their reasoning highlighted a weakness in my initial analysis, which relied too heavily on past patterns without sufficiently adjusting for his changed political context.",
    "rationale": "After reviewing my peers' analyses, I am lowering my forecast. The central argument against a pre-July 1 announcement has become more convincing: the complete lack of visible campaign infrastructure. Major statewide campaigns require significant logistical groundwork, and its absence so close to the deadline is a more powerful indicator than historical precedent in this case. The other forecasters correctly pointed out that O'Rourke's political situation is different now than before his 2018 or 2022 runs. Coming off several high-profile losses, he and his donors have more reason to be cautious. A longer period of gauging support before a formal launch seems strategically prudent, pointing towards a timeline that extends beyond July 1. While his public comments keep the door open and the timing would fit his past behavior, the concrete, observable evidence of a campaign-in-waiting is missing. Therefore, the status quo 'No' outcome appears more likely to hold for the next 40 days. I have revised my probability downward to reflect that an announcement is less likely than not within this specific timeframe, though it remains a very plausible event later in the year.",
