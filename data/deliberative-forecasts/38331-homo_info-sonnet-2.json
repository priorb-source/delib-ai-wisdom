    "review": "Forecaster 3 raises a critical point I underweighted: this is explicitly a conjunctive question requiring ALL seven countries to maintain blocks. A single country lifting its ban triggers a No resolution. Their probability multiplication approach (yielding ~80%) is methodologically sound and highlights the compounding risk across seven countries. Forecaster 2's analysis at 93% is nearly identical to my 92%, emphasizing similar factors: the 26-day timeframe, entrenched censorship regimes, and the double requirement of policy change PLUS Wikipedia updating. However, both Forecaster 2 and I may have insufficiently modeled the conjunctive nature. The key tension is between: (1) the VERY short 26-day window making policy reversals extremely unlikely in any single country, versus (2) the multiplicative risk of seven independent countries where even one reversal causes No resolution. Venezuela and Myanmar present the highest individual risks due to political volatility, though both have maintained blocks for extended periods. I find Forecaster 3's conjunctive framework compelling and should update downward, though perhaps not to 80% given the extraordinarily short timeframe that makes even single-country reversals unlikely.",
    "rationale": "Upon reflection, I need to more explicitly model the conjunctive structure. Assigning rough individual probabilities for maintaining blocks over 26 days: China (99.5%), Iran (99%), North Korea (99.5%), Russia (97.5%), Turkmenistan (98%), Myanmar (94%), Venezuela (91%). Multiplying yields approximately 83%. However, this may slightly underweight how the 26-day timeframe constrains all countries simultaneously - policy reversals don't happen instantly, and even if decided, implementation and Wikipedia reflection take time. The double requirement (country decision + Wikipedia update within 26 days) adds friction. Venezuela and Myanmar are the main risk factors, but expecting either to lift bans within 26 days remains a tail scenario. I'm updating from 92% to 87%, acknowledging the conjunctive risk more explicitly while still emphasizing that the timeframe is so compressed that policy changes in ANY country remain unlikely. The multiplicative framework is correct in principle but the extremely short window provides significant protection against any single country defecting from the status quo.",
