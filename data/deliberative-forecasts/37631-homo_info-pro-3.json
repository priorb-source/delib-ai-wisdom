    "review": "I find Forecaster 3's analysis to be the most compelling and well-reasoned. We both started from the same premise: Walmart currently holds the market cap lead, and the short timeframe favors the status quo. Forecaster 3 strengthens this case by citing specific fundamental weaknesses for Tesla (Zacks Rank #5, declining profitability) and strengths for Walmart (e-commerce growth). Crucially, Forecaster 3 identified a specific, powerful catalyst for a 'No' outcome that I had underestimated: the announced Robotaxi launch in June 2025. This event could generate significant investor hype and a stock rally right before the resolution date. Forecaster 2's analysis appears to be based on a flawed premise that Tesla has a substantial lead, which contradicts the context implied by the background information and the analyses from myself and Forecaster 3. Therefore, while their point about Tesla's volatility is valid, their overall forecast is not applicable to the scenario as I understand it.",
    "rationale": "After reviewing my peers' analyses, I am lowering my forecast. My initial assessment of 75% was based on the status quo (Walmart leading) and broad fundamental trends favoring Walmart, particularly with the recent tariff reductions. However, Forecaster 3's argument has convinced me that I underweighted the potential impact of a single high-volatility event. The planned June 2025 Robotaxi launch is a major narrative catalyst for Tesla. The market's reaction to the *announcement and reveal* could easily drive a sharp, speculative rally in Tesla's stock in the weeks leading up to the June 27 resolution date, regardless of the product's immediate financial viability. This single event introduces significant uncertainty and a plausible path for Tesla to overtake Walmart, even if only temporarily. The fundamentals still favor Walmart, but this catalyst is potent enough to make the outcome less certain. Therefore, I am reducing my probability by 10 points to better reflect the risk posed by this event.",
