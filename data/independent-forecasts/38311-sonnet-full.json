  "information": "The White House has officially confirmed that President Donald Trump will attend the G7 summit in Canada from June 15-17, 2025. White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt stated that details of the visit would be announced shortly. Numerous media outlets reported the confirmation in late May 2025, and official G7 participant lists dated June 3 include Trump.\n\nThe 51st G7 Summit is scheduled to take place in Kananaskis, Alberta. Security measures are being implemented, including a controlled access zone around summit venues from June 10-18 and temporary airspace restrictions. In advance of the leaders' summit, U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent and Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell attended preparatory G7 meetings in Banff. Historically, sitting U.S. presidents have attended every in-person G7/G8 summit since its inception in 1975.\n\nAccording to reports from the Nikkei newspaper, the upcoming G7 summit may not produce a traditional final joint statement due to disagreements between the U.S. and other member nations. The summit may instead result in several separate documents on specific topics of cooperation, while excluding more contentious issues like global trade and relations with Russia from the formal agenda to avoid conflict. In preparation for the summit, German Chancellor Olaf Scholz is scheduled to meet with President Trump at the White House on June 5.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "The G7 Summit is scheduled for June 15-17, 2025. Today is June 3, 2025, so the outcome will be known in approximately 12-14 days when the summit takes place.",
    "status_quo_outcome": "Yes - Trump will attend the summit in person",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Trump cancels his attendance due to an unexpected development such as a health emergency, a major domestic or international crisis requiring his presence in Washington, or a last-minute diplomatic breakdown. Alternatively, he could attempt virtual attendance instead of physical presence, though this would not satisfy the resolution criteria.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Trump proceeds with the planned trip and physically travels to Kananaskis, Alberta to attend the G7 Summit from June 15-17, 2025. He participates in person alongside other G7 leaders, engaging in face-to-face discussions and meetings throughout the summit.",
    "rationale": "The evidence overwhelmingly supports Trump attending the summit. The White House has officially confirmed his attendance through Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt. We are only 12 days from the summit start, which is extremely close - at this point, extensive logistical preparations are already complete. Security measures including controlled access zones and airspace restrictions are being implemented from June 10-18. U.S. officials (Treasury Secretary Bessent and Fed Chair Powell) have already attended preparatory G7 meetings in Banff, indicating full U.S. engagement. Trump appears on official participant lists dated June 3, and a pre-summit bilateral meeting with German Chancellor Scholz is scheduled for June 5. Most compellingly, sitting U.S. presidents have attended every in-person G7/G8 summit since the format's inception in 1975 - this is an exceptionally strong historical precedent.\n\nThe main risks for non-attendance would be unexpected emergencies: a serious health issue, a major national security crisis, or an unforeseen diplomatic incident. Trump is also known for unpredictability and has occasionally made last-minute changes to international travel plans. However, given the proximity to the event and the level of official commitment and preparation, cancellation would be highly unusual and disruptive.\n\nMy forecast is not higher (100%) because we must account for the non-zero possibility of genuine emergencies or Trump's documented unpredictability. Even with 12 days remaining, unexpected events can occur. My forecast is not lower because the combination of official confirmation, historical precedent, proximity to the event, and advanced preparations makes cancellation quite unlikely. For my forecast to move higher, I would need to see Trump depart for Canada or additional confirmations closer to June 15. For it to move lower, I would need evidence of health concerns, emerging crises, or signals of potential cancellation.",
