  "information": "In early April 2025, the U.S. administration announced a new trade policy based on 'reciprocal tariffs,' effectively ending the African Growth and Opportunity Act (AGOA) which had allowed many African countries to export goods to the U.S. duty-free. The new policy applies tariffs to approximately 185 countries. The tariff rates are determined by a formula that involves dividing a country's bilateral trade deficit with the U.S. by the amount of U.S. imports from that country, and then dividing the result by two. This policy resulted in varying tariff rates, including 50% for Lesotho and Saint-Pierre and Miquelon, 49% for Cambodia, 46% for Vietnam, 34% for China, and 20% for the European Union. The new tariffs took effect on April 9, 2025, although the U.S. later announced a 90-day pause on introducing new tariffs for some countries, a move not extended to Lesotho.\n\nThe U.S. imposed a 50% tariff on Lesotho due to a significant trade imbalance; in 2024, Lesotho exported approximately $237-240 million worth of goods to the U.S., while importing only about $2.8-3 million from the U.S. The tariff is expected to severely impact Lesotho's economy, particularly its textile and apparel industry, which employs around 40,000 workers and constitutes about 90% of the country's manufacturing employment and exports. In response to the tariff, the Lesotho government announced on April 3, 2025, that it was forming a high-level delegation to travel to Washington to negotiate with U.S. authorities and seek clarification on the tariff's rationale.\n\nThe imposition of new U.S. tariffs prompted various international reactions. The Southern African Development Community (SADC) began assessing the tariffs' impact on the region and planned a high-level summit for June. Within the SADC, Zimbabwe's decision to remove its own tariffs on American imports was criticized by some as undermining regional solidarity. The European Union announced it would delay its own trade countermeasures against the U.S. for 90 days to allow for negotiations. China responded by imposing its own retaliatory tariffs of 34% and filing a formal complaint with the World Trade Organization (WTO).",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "About five weeks.",
    "status_quo_outcome": "Yes. The 50% tariff on Lesotho was implemented on April 9, 2025, and was explicitly not included in a 90-day pause offered to other countries. If the current policy remains unchanged, the tariff will still be listed as 50% on June 1, 2025.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "The diplomatic delegation sent by Lesotho to Washington successfully negotiates a reversal or reduction of the tariff before June 1, 2025. Alternatively, broader international pressure could lead the U.S. administration to make a quick concession for a small country like Lesotho as a gesture of goodwill in other trade disputes.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "The U.S. administration's 'reciprocal tariffs' policy remains firm. The negotiations with the Lesotho delegation are unsuccessful or do not conclude by the resolution date. The 50% tariff, which is already in effect, remains on the harmonized tariff schedule on June 1, 2025.",
    "rationale": "My forecast is heavily weighted by the status quo. The 50% tariff is not a proposal; it is an existing policy that took effect on April 9, 2025. The most significant piece of information is that the U.S. administration announced a 90-day pause for some countries but explicitly excluded Lesotho, signaling a firm stance. The timeline for a reversal is extremely short—just over one month until the resolution date. Diplomatic negotiations and bureaucratic policy changes, especially those requiring a reversal, rarely happen this quickly. While Lesotho is dispatching a delegation to Washington and there is broader international unease with the new U.S. trade policy, these efforts are unlikely to yield a concrete change for Lesotho before June 1. My probability is not higher than 90% because there is a small chance the U.S. could make a rapid concession. Reversing the tariff on a very small trading partner like Lesotho would be a low-cost way for the U.S. to appear reasonable amidst larger trade disputes with the EU or China. My probability is not lower because the combination of an already-enacted policy, a specific exclusion from a reprieve, and the short time frame creates powerful inertia favoring the 'Yes' outcome. I would update my forecast towards 'No' upon news of successful high-level talks between Lesotho's delegation and the U.S. Trade Representative. I would update towards 'Yes' if the U.S. administration publicly reaffirms the tariff's application to Lesotho.",
