  "information": "On May 11, 2025, a federal judge in New Jersey extended a temporary restraining order (TRO) that bars ICE from deporting Mahmoud Khalil. The extension was granted because the court found Khalil’s First-Amendment and Administrative Procedure Act claims to be “plausible.” Further legal briefings have been scheduled, and TROs that are extended typically remain in effect until a court rules on a motion for a preliminary injunction.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Approximately 1.5 months, until July 1, 2025.",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No. Mahmoud Khalil is currently in the United States, and a federal court's temporary restraining order (TRO) prevents the government from deporting him. If this legal status holds, he will not be deported by the deadline.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "The TRO preventing Mahmoud Khalil's deportation remains in effect or is converted into a preliminary injunction by the court. The legal proceedings regarding his First Amendment and APA claims continue beyond the July 1, 2025 deadline, making his deportation impossible within the question's timeframe.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "The federal judge overseeing the case dissolves the TRO and denies a motion for a preliminary injunction. ICE then acts with extreme expedience to physically deport Mr. Khalil from the United States before the July 1, 2025 deadline.",
    "rationale": "My forecast is strongly anchored to the status quo, which is that a federal court has actively intervened to prevent the deportation. The research indicates a judge extended a TRO on May 11, 2025, finding Mr. Khalil's claims 'plausible.' This is a significant legal hurdle for the government to overcome. The timeline is the second critical factor; there are fewer than seven weeks until the July 1 deadline. Federal court proceedings, especially those involving constitutional claims and further legal briefings, rarely move quickly enough to achieve a final resolution and subsequent government action (deportation) within such a short period. The path to a 'No' outcome simply requires the legal process to continue at a normal pace. The path to a 'Yes' would require an unusually rapid judicial ruling in the government's favor and swift logistical action from ICE. My probability is not lower because there is a non-zero chance that the court could rule quickly against Khalil or that a higher court could intervene on an emergency basis, lifting the stay and allowing deportation. My probability is not higher because the existence of a TRO from a federal judge, based on 'plausible' claims, represents a formidable and time-consuming barrier to deportation, making the 'No' outcome overwhelmingly likely.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill Mahmoud Khalil be deported before July 1, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\n[Mahmoud Khalil's challenge to his detention moves forward]()\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if the United States deports Mahmoud Khalil before July 1, 2025. For purposes of this question, \"deported\" means Khalil being transported out of the territory of the United States against his will.\n\n\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nOn May 11, 2025, a federal judge in New Jersey extended a temporary restraining order (TRO) that bars ICE from deporting Mahmoud Khalil.

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
