    "review": "Forecaster 2 makes a compelling point I initially underweighted: the May 7, 2025 meeting happened just days ago, making it extremely recent and suggesting active negotiations rather than mere exploratory discussions. The public, ministerial nature of such meetings typically indicates serious intent from both parties. However, I find the 85% forecast too optimistic given that (1) high-level discussions don't guarantee selection, (2) 54 days remains a genuinely tight window for formal announcement processes, and (3) we have zero corroborating information from ITKF sources or other channels. Forecaster 3's emphasis on governance cadence and typical announcement timing around congresses is valuable - smaller federations often have scheduled decision-making processes that may not align with our deadline. However, the 28% forecast seems to underweight the significance of the very recent, high-level engagement. The May 7 meeting does 'disrupt the status quo' as Forecaster 2 argues - this isn't background noise. All three of us note the lack of information about competing bids and corroborating sources, which creates genuine uncertainty.",
    "rationale": "Upon reflection, I initially undervalued the recency and seniority of the May 7 meeting between Egypt's Minister and the ITKF President. This wasn't a casual discussion but a formal ministerial engagement with public reporting, suggesting both parties view Egypt's candidacy seriously. The timing - less than two months before our deadline and roughly 18 months before the proposed event - aligns with when such hosting decisions would typically be finalized. However, several factors prevent me from updating as high as 85%: (1) We still lack any ITKF-sourced information confirming Egypt as preferred host or even mentioning a decision timeline, (2) The 54-day window genuinely constrains how quickly formal announcements can occur, especially if the ITKF has scheduled governance meetings, (3) Public discussions between potential hosts and federation presidents are common in bidding processes and don't guarantee selection. The complete absence of corroborating information remains concerning - if an announcement were truly imminent, we'd typically see some supporting signals. I'm updating upward from 30% to acknowledge the strong recent signal, but maintaining caution about the compressed timeline and information vacuum.",
