  "information": "In response to China's military exercises around Taiwan, the US has used terms such as \"intimidation tactics,\" \"provocative,\" \"coercive military activities,\" and \"aggressive military activities.\" In April 2025, the US Department of State accused China of \"putting regional security at risk\" with its drills. To date, US government statements have not officially characterized China's actions as a \"blockade.\" Historically, even during the 1995-1996 Taiwan Strait Crisis, the US did not formally accuse China of a blockade. Diplomatic talks between the US and China were held in Shanghai in April 2025.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Approximately 56 days until July 1, 2025",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No - the US continues using strong diplomatic language but avoids formally accusing China of blockading Taiwan",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "China continues military exercises and shows of force around Taiwan, while the US maintains its current rhetorical approach using terms like 'provocative' and 'coercive' but stops short of the formal 'blockade' accusation. Diplomatic channels remain active, and no actual blockade is implemented or if exercises intensify, the US chooses to characterize them through other terminology to avoid further escalation.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "China escalates to implementing an actual blockade of Taiwan's seaports - perhaps preventing commercial shipping from entering or leaving port. Faced with an undeniable blockade that significantly disrupts Taiwan's maritime access, the US government is compelled to formally and publicly accuse China of blockading Taiwan, potentially as part of a broader international response or to justify countermeasures.",
    "rationale": "Multiple factors strongly favor the status quo NO outcome. First, historical precedent is decisive: even during the serious 1995-1996 Taiwan Strait Crisis, the US did not formally accuse China of a blockade despite significant military tensions. The research assistant notes that recent US language has been calibrated to be strong but not use 'blockade' terminology - terms like 'intimidation tactics,' 'provocative,' and 'coercive military activities' are employed instead. Second, diplomatic engagement is ongoing (Shanghai talks in April 2025), suggesting both sides are managing escalation. Third, the timeframe is very short - only 56 days for this specific outcome to occur. For a YES outcome to materialize, China would need to: (1) actually implement a blockade rather than just conduct exercises, (2) do so in a manner the US cannot diplomatically avoid acknowledging, and (3) do this within two months. The base rate for such rapid escalation is low. However, the probability is not negligible because: the region is demonstrably tense with recent April 2025 exercises; China has been building and demonstrating blockade capabilities; and geopolitical miscalculation or accidents remain possible. My forecast would increase significantly if: China begins preventing commercial vessels from accessing Taiwan ports, Taiwan requests international assistance characterizing actions as a blockade, or there's a major triggering incident. My forecast would decrease if: diplomatic engagement produces de-escalation agreements, or we get closer to July 1st without any actual blockade actions. Given the strong historical precedent against this language, active diplomacy, and short timeframe, I assess the probability at 10%.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill the United States accuse the People's Republic of China of blockading Taiwan before July 1, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nWSJ via MSN: [China Is Ready to Blockade Taiwan.

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
