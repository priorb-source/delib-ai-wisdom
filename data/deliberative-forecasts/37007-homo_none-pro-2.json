    "review": "The other two forecasters provide reasoning that is highly congruent with my own, arriving at a nearly identical conclusion. We all identified the same key drivers: the strong advantage of incumbency, the stable and competitive two-party system in Trinidad and Tobago, the narrow margin of the 2020 election, and the critical lack of specific polling data or news of a major catalyst for change. Their explicit framing of the 'burden of proof' being on the opposition (UNC) to demonstrate a shift in voter sentiment was a particularly clear and convincing articulation of the incumbency advantage. There were no new pieces of evidence introduced, but the strong consensus on these foundational principles is itself a valuable signal.",
    "rationale": "After reviewing the analyses from the other forecasters, I am making a small upward revision to my forecast. My initial forecast of 58% was based on the same factors they identified, but I placed slightly more weight on the narrowness of the 2020 election result (22-19) as an indicator of inherent volatility, keeping my forecast closer to 50%. However, the other forecasters' strong and unanimous emphasis on incumbency advantage and the 'burden of proof' on the challenger in a data-poor environment is compelling. The fact that two independent analysts both arrived at 62% suggests a robust consensus that the structural advantage of the incumbent PNM should be weighted more heavily than I initially did. In the absence of any evidence pointing towards a pro-opposition swing, the most logical starting point is a status-quo outcome, adjusted for the inherent uncertainty of a close election. Therefore, I am updating my forecast to align with the consensus, as it better reflects the balance of probabilities given the structural factors at play.",
