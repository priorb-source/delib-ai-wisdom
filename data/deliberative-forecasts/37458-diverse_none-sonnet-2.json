    "review": "Forecaster 2 raises a critical interpretation question I need to address: Trump's status during the resolution period. They treat Trump as a private citizen/candidate, which would indeed make the probability extremely low (~5%). However, given the timeline (May 2025) and standard US political cycles, if Trump won the November 2024 election, he would be the sitting president during May 12-June 15, 2025. This is the more natural interpretation and aligns with why trade/tariff issues would be pressing and relevant.\n\nThat said, Forecaster 2 makes excellent points about the mutual acknowledgment requirement being a high bar. The CBS background showing China denying Trump's claims about talks is a strong negative signal that I appropriately weighted but perhaps not heavily enough. Even if Trump is president, China's demonstrated reluctance to confirm communications creates significant friction.\n\nForecaster 3's analysis is well-balanced and their 24% forecast appropriately accounts for: (1) the narrow 34-day window, (2) base rates of leader calls being relatively low over such a period, (3) the high bar of requiring both-sides acknowledgment, and (4) the lack of a clear scheduled catalyst. Their reasoning about what would move the probability up or down is sound.\n\nBoth forecasters appropriately emphasize the mutual acknowledgment constraint more heavily than I did initially. This is the key friction point - even if a call occurs, public confirmation from both sides requires diplomatic coordination that may not materialize given current tensions.",
    "rationale": "After review, I'm revising downward from 40% to 28%. Key reasons:\n\n1. **Mutual acknowledgment bar is higher than I initially weighted**: The CBS background showing China denying talks is a strong signal. Both forecasters correctly emphasize this creates substantial friction even if contact occurs.\n\n2. **Base rate considerations**: Forecaster 3's point about leader-level calls being relatively infrequent over a 34-day window without a clear catalyst is well-taken. While trade tensions exist, they don't necessarily trigger immediate leader-level engagement.\n\n3. **No immediate catalyst**: There's no scheduled summit, imminent crisis, or announced negotiating round that would necessitate a leaders' call in this specific window.\n\n4. **Diplomatic preparation time**: Even if both sides wanted a call, the short window may not allow for proper preparation and coordination that typically precedes such calls.\n\nHowever, I'm not going as low as Forecaster 2's 5% because:\n- Assuming Trump is president (most likely given the timeline), leader-level communication remains possible\n- Trade/tariff pressures could create sudden need for engagement\n- Trump's communication style favors direct leader contact\n- 34 days is enough time for a call to be arranged if both sides see value\n\nMy 28% reflects meaningful probability that mutual interests align for a call, but appropriately weights the substantial barriers identified by both forecasters.",
