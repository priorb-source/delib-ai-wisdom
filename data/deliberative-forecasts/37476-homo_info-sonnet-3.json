    "review": "Forecaster 2 provides crucial financial data I hadn't fully considered: a catastrophic $432M net loss on $801M revenue, a current ratio of 0.5 indicating severe liquidity stress, and a collapsed $91M market cap. The burn rate calculation of ~$36M/month is particularly alarming. However, there's a critical temporal observation: if GoPro burned $36M/month from December 2024 through May 2025, they should have exhausted most/all of their $283M cash by now. Yet no bankruptcy has been filed, and they continue releasing products. This suggests either: (1) they secured additional financing, (2) cost cuts dramatically reduced burn, or (3) the Q4 extrapolation overestimated ongoing burn. Forecaster 3's point about Q1 results arriving May 12 (3 days away) is important - this will reveal whether the crisis is as acute as the numbers suggest. Both forecasters appropriately weighted the short 53-day timeframe as a strong factor against bankruptcy, even with severe distress. The fact that we're already in May without a filing despite what the raw numbers suggest is actually positive information about near-term bankruptcy risk.",
    "rationale": "I'm updating my forecast upward from 5% to 10% based on the severe financial metrics I didn't fully weight: the 0.5 current ratio is a critical liquidity indicator, and the magnitude of losses is worse than I initially assessed. However, I'm not going as high as Forecaster 2's 20% because of a key temporal inconsistency: if the burn rate analysis is correct, GoPro should have largely exhausted cash by now (5 months after December 31), yet they haven't filed for bankruptcy and continue normal operations (product releases, sponsorships). This suggests the immediate crisis isn't as acute as raw Q4 numbers imply. The 53-day timeframe remains the dominant factor - bankruptcy is a dramatic action that typically requires board approval, creditor negotiations, and legal preparation. Even severely distressed companies often operate for months before filing. The upcoming Q1 results on May 12 are a potential catalyst, but even adverse results would need to be processed and acted upon within the remaining ~50 days. The status quo of continued operations, combined with the short timeline, still heavily favors No, but the severe financial distress warrants a meaningful probability above my initial 5%.",
