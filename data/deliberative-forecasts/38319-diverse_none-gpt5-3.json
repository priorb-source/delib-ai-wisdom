    "review": "Forecaster 2 adds a concrete argument about Japan’s fiscal year-end (March) rush and April payback. That’s a useful consideration I hadn’t explicitly weighed. However, monthly changes used by METI are typically seasonally adjusted, so much of the March/April timing effect should already be filtered, though residuals can remain—so I treat this as a moderate, not dominant, headwind. Forecaster 3’s emphasis on mean reversion after a +7.6% jump is solid and consistent with high-volatility IP series; I agree that such outsized gains often see partial giveback. Neither forecaster brought new hard April data, so their inputs mostly adjust priors via pattern arguments rather than evidence. I find the mean-reversion point persuasive enough to trim my optimism slightly; the fiscal year-end payback point nudges me further, but I discount it due to seasonal adjustment.",
    "rationale": "Baseline odds around 50% for m/m IP. The +7.6% in March increases the chance of some reversion, especially in a volatile regional series, and absent April-specific tailwinds, that argues against a strong continuation. On the other hand, if March reflected normalization after prior weakness (first increase in three months), a modest follow‑through in April is plausible. The fiscal year-end rush/payback effect cited by Forecaster 2 is partly mitigated by seasonal adjustment, though not perfectly. Balancing these: I move slightly down from my prior 57% to reflect mean-reversion risk and potential residual payback, but keep a small positive lean on the possibility of ongoing normalization. No new data justifies a larger shift.",
