    "review": "Forecaster 2 and 3 both emphasize the very short timeline, the junta’s demonstrated insulation from external pressure (notably ECOWAS withdrawal), and the rarity of rapid reversals by military regimes after major consolidating moves. I find these points compelling and somewhat underweighted in my initial 10%. Forecaster 3’s note about the decision’s veneer of legitimacy via transitional bodies/national consultations is an added cost-to-reversal I hadn’t highlighted, further lowering the odds. I agree that court action is unlikely to be decisive within 40 days and, even if it were, compliance would still require an explicit government announcement. Overall, their arguments tighten the base-rate and incentive picture toward a lower probability.",
    "rationale": "Time left is short (~40 days). The status quo favors maintaining the ban: dissolving parties is core to the junta’s power-consolidation, and reversing so quickly would signal weakness. Mali’s reduced susceptibility to ECOWAS/Western leverage, reliance on alternative partners, and history of defiance suggest international condemnation won’t bite fast enough. Domestic pushback has been visible but limited; there is no sign yet of mass, sustained, cross-elite mobilization or elite fractures that typically force abrupt U-turns. Legal challenges exist but judicial independence and enforcement are doubtful, and the resolution requires an explicit government reversal announcement. Comparative cases in the Sahel show sustained restrictions rather than rapid rollbacks. A ‘Yes’ pathway could still emerge via an administrative court ruling that the junta decides to honor to preserve a legal veneer, or a sudden spike in coordinated domestic pressure or targeted sanctions with clear reversal conditions—possible but unlikely on this compressed timeline. Given these factors and the additional points raised by the other forecasters, I’m lowering my estimate but keep a small residual for a tactical climbdown.\n\nChange: Down from 10% to 6%, reflecting stronger weight on the base rate of rapid reversals and the added legitimacy/credibility costs the others highlighted, while retaining a small chance for a court-driven or tactical reversal.",
