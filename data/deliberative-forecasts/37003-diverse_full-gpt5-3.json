    "review": "Both forecasters largely echo the key points: overwhelming and consistent polling lead for SPÖ, extremely strong Viennese fundamentals, and little time for reversal. Neither introduced materially new evidence beyond what I had already considered. Forecaster 2’s 98% feels a bit overconfident given residual tail risks (systemic polling error, turnout asymmetries, late-breaking events). Forecaster 3’s 92% is reasonable but, in my view, slightly underweights that the resolution is seats and D’Hondt typically advantages the largest party, making a vote lead even more likely to translate into a seat plurality. Overall, their reasoning is sound and consistent with my prior view; I don’t see a reason to move off my estimate.",
    "rationale": "The core facts remain: SPÖ has led every Vienna election since 1945, current public polls put SPÖ ahead by ~16–19 points (circa 38–40% vs FPÖ ~21–24%), and we are within a week of the vote. Translating votes to seats under D’Hondt further reduces the probability that a lead of this magnitude fails to yield a seat plurality. A No outcome would require an unusually large, Vienna-specific polling miss and/or a late shock causing a double-digit swing plus turnout dynamics strongly favoring FPÖ—scenarios that are possible but improbable. Given no new contrary evidence, I maintain my prior assessment. I would revise downward only if credible late polls shrink the lead to single digits or a major scandal emerges; upward if final polls widen the lead further or credible election-day indicators affirm strong SPÖ performance.",
