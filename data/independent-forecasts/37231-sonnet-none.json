    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Very minimal - approximately 1-2 weeks. We are at the end of April 2025, so the April unemployment data has already been determined and is simply awaiting official release and reporting by Trading Economics.",
    "status_quo_outcome": "The unemployment rate continues at its recent trend level from the preceding months (January-March 2025). Given the status quo bias, if recent months were below 3%, April likely remains below 3%; if recent months were at or above 3%, April likely remains at or above that level.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Mexico's April 2025 unemployment rate is 3.0% or higher. This could occur if: (1) recent months already showed rates at or above 3%; (2) US tariff impacts on auto supply chains began affecting manufacturing employment in April; (3) seasonal factors or broader economic conditions pushed the rate up; (4) there was a modest uptick from February-March levels that crossed the 3% threshold.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Mexico's April 2025 unemployment rate comes in below 3.0%. This would occur if: (1) recent months (January-March 2025) showed rates consistently below 3% and this trend continued; (2) Mexico's labor market remained tight despite tariff concerns; (3) the impact of US tariffs on employment hasn't yet materialized in the April data; (4) strong domestic economic activity maintained low unemployment levels.",
    "rationale": "This forecast faces significant uncertainty due to the lack of recent unemployment data from my research assistant. Mexico's unemployment rate historically fluctuates between roughly 2.7% and 4.5%, with the 3% threshold falling in the lower portion of this range. The key insight is that we're essentially at the outcome determination point - April 2025 has already occurred, and the unemployment rate for that month is now a historical fact simply awaiting official publication. The mentioned US tariffs and disruption to auto supply chains represent a bearish factor, as Mexico's automotive sector is a significant employer. However, tariff impacts typically take time to flow through to unemployment statistics, and April data may not yet reflect major employment disruptions. The status quo bias is crucial here: unemployment rates exhibit month-to-month persistence, rarely changing dramatically absent major economic shocks. Without knowledge of January-March 2025 rates, I must estimate the baseline probability of being below 3%. Given Mexico's historical distribution and the 3% threshold being relatively low, I estimate moderate probability. I'm not higher because: (1) the tariff concerns suggest economic headwinds; (2) 3% represents a relatively low unemployment threshold; (3) without confirmation of recent very low rates, I cannot be confident. I'm not lower because: (1) Mexico has demonstrated capacity for very low unemployment in past periods; (2) the status quo bias suggests if recent months were below 3%, April likely is too; (3) tariff impacts may not have fully materialized yet. To update higher, I would need: evidence that Q1 2025 rates were consistently well below 3% (say, 2.6-2.8%). To update lower, I would need: evidence of Q1 2025 rates above 3%, or reports of significant manufacturing job losses in March-April.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill Mexico's unemployment rate be under 3% in April 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nAP: [US tariffs ripple through auto supply chains into Mexico](https://apnews.com/article/mexico-stellantis-trump-tariffs-sheinbaum-569ae29d203b1997d50a3a9655c928a8)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if Mexico's unemployment rate is less than 3.0% for April 2025 according to data presented by [Trading Economics](https://tradingeconomics.com/mexico/unemployment-rate).\n\n\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nNo additional information available.\n\nToday is 2025-04-29.\n\nBefore answering you think:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n(e) You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
