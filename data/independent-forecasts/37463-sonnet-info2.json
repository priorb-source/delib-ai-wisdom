  "information": "Warren Buffett has announced his intention to step down as CEO by the end of 2025, with Greg Abel set to succeed him. Following the announcement, a Stocktwits poll indicated that 46% of retail investors still view Berkshire Hathaway as a long-term 'buy', and retail sentiment on the stock was described as 'extremely bullish'. UBS analysts stated that the company's structural advantages, including its permanent capital and information collection capabilities, are not expected to be significantly reduced by the leadership change.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "The Q1 2025 13F filing deadline is approximately 45 days after quarter end (March 31), making it due around mid-May 2025. Since today is May 8, 2025, the filing is either already submitted or will be submitted within the next 1-2 weeks. The outcome should be known imminently.",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No - Berkshire likely continues to hold 10 million shares or fewer of Amazon stock, maintaining their current position without significant additional purchases.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Berkshire Hathaway maintains its existing Amazon position or makes only minor adjustments during Q1 2025. The 13F filing reports 10 million shares or fewer, consistent with their recent pattern of being net sellers of equity positions while building cash reserves.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Berkshire Hathaway makes a significant purchase of Amazon shares during Q1 2025, accumulating enough to bring their total holdings above 10 million shares. This would represent approximately $1.8-2 billion in value at current prices and would signal renewed conviction in the company despite Berkshire's recent preference for cash accumulation.",
    "rationale": "The status quo strongly favors a No outcome. Berkshire Hathaway has been characterized by conservative investment behavior in recent quarters, accumulating record cash positions rather than making large equity purchases. The company's Amazon position, initiated in 2019, has not been highlighted as a major strategic holding compared to their traditional concentration in financial and industrial stocks.\n\nThe research assistant's information about leadership transition (Buffett stepping down by end of 2025) and positive retail sentiment toward Berkshire itself doesn't provide evidence of specific Q1 2025 Amazon purchases. The 10 million share threshold being set as the resolution criteria suggests current holdings are likely below this level.\n\nFor this forecast to be higher, I would need evidence of: (1) Berkshire announcing or signaling increased tech sector allocation, (2) specific Q1 2025 buying activity rumors, or (3) information showing current holdings closer to the 10 million threshold. For it to be lower, I would need confirmation that Berkshire has been reducing its Amazon stake or explicit statements ruling out major purchases.\n\nGiven Berkshire's recent cash-building tendency, lack of specific catalysts, and the general principle that major portfolio shifts are rare events even for active investors, the probability is low but not negligible. Amazon remains a quality company that fits Berkshire's long-term value criteria, leaving some possibility of accumulation.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill Berkshire Hathaway reveal a purchase of more Amazon stock in its Q1 2025 13F filing?\n\nQuestion background:\nStockCircle: [Berkshire Hathaway's Amazon Stake](https://stockcircle.com/portfolio/warren-buffett/amzn/transactions)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if the 13F filing for Berkshire Hathaway, Inc., filed for the period ending 2025-03-31, reports the company holding greater than 10,000,000 shares of Amazon.com, Inc.\n\n\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nWarren Buffett has announced his intention to step down as CEO by the end of 2025, with Greg Abel set to succeed him.

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
