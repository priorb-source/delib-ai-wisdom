    "review": "Both forecasters emphasize the very high threshold for a nationwide Level 4 and the State Department’s preference for granular, region-specific Level 4 carve-outs within an overall Level 3. Forecaster 3 adds a useful historical point: Ethiopia was not rated Level 4 even during the peak of the Tigray war, which supports a lower probability now. Forecaster 2’s triggers (fighting approaching Addis, nationwide state of emergency, coup attempt, embassy drawdown) mirror the key catalysts I highlighted. The main new angle is the explicit comparison to countries that do get Level 4 (e.g., Afghanistan, Syria) and the reminder that Ethiopia historically has stayed below that bar despite serious conflict—this slightly reinforces the ‘No’ baseline. The arguments for higher risk rest on Ethiopia’s volatility and the possibility of rapid escalation; I acknowledge that tail risk, but see no fresh indicators suggesting imminent deterioration to the point of embassy evacuation or countrywide Level 4.\n",
    "rationale": "Time to resolution is ~60 days, and the status quo is Level 3 with multiple regional Level 4 areas. The State Department typically reserves nationwide Level 4 for situations with acute, pervasive risk and/or significant constraints on U.S. consular support (e.g., ordered departure, suspension of services), or when the capital and main transport nodes become unsafe. Ethiopia’s recent pattern—and the fact it remained below Level 4 during earlier, arguably worse nationwide conflict—suggest that a countrywide upgrade in the next two months would require a sharp shock: major violence in or near Addis, a nationwide state of emergency that curtails movement/communications, a large terror incident, air hub disruption, or an Embassy drawdown/evacuation. I see no specific indications of such triggers right now. The short horizon and institutional inertia further favor a No outcome. I retain some tail risk for a rapid escalation scenario, but the comparative and historical arguments raised by the other forecasters, if anything, reinforce a low probability. Therefore, I keep a low forecast and do not adjust upward.\n",
