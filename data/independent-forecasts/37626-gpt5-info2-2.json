  "information": "Dole plc, a major fruit distributor, reported its first-quarter 2025 financial results. While revenue decreased by 1.0% year-over-year, it increased by 4.2% on a like-for-like basis. The company's adjusted EBITDA decreased by 4.8%, a change attributed primarily to higher fruit costs and increased shipping expenses. The report also noted improvements in banana volumes.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "About 4 weeks (BLS typically releases May CPI average prices in mid-June 2025).",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No — the reported price is at or above $0.6300.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Banana retail prices remain in the mid-to-upper $0.60s per lb due to still-elevated shipping/fuel and fruit costs, with retailers maintaining current price points and only localized promotions that don’t move the national average below $0.6300.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "A broad, national wave of retail promotions and/or a short-term supply glut drives the average price to $0.629 or lower; easing ocean freight and port constraints and a favorable dollar cut import costs, and retailers quickly pass through discounts in May.",
    "rationale": "Baseline conditions favor a No. Over the past couple of years, BLS average banana prices have mostly sat at or above $0.63, often in the mid-$0.60s, with relatively low month-to-month volatility. The threshold here is strict (must be under $0.6300), which likely requires either an unusually soft month or broad retail discounting. The research assistant’s note that Dole’s Q1 2025 saw higher fruit and shipping costs (with only improved volumes) is inconsistent with a sharp near-term drop in retail prices. Recent logistics and fee pressures highlighted in media coverage also argue against a decisive step-down by May.\n\nWhy not higher than this probability? Bananas do see periodic promotions (e.g., aggressive pricing at large chains like Walmart/Aldi), and if supply is abundant and freight costs ease, a quick pass-through could shave a couple of cents off the national average. If April 2025 prints very close to $0.63, only a small additional decline would be needed to get under in May.\n\nWhy not lower? The recent cost backdrop from a major distributor (Dole) points to sustained upstream pressure, and bananas historically exhibit limited month-to-month swings. If the latest readings are in the mid-$0.60s, getting below $0.6300 in one month would require an atypically large move.\n\nWhat would change my view upward (toward Yes):\n- April 2025 BLS average price at or below ~$0.632.\n- Evidence of widespread national promotions (ad circulars) at $0.49–$0.55/lb across major chains in May.\n- Data showing a sharp drop in import/ocean freight costs or a supply surge from key exporters.\n\nWhat would change my view downward (toward No):\n- April 2025 average price clearly above ~$0.64.\n- Reports of continued or rising shipping/port costs or supply tightness.\n- Retail pricing intel showing stable prices around $0.65–$0.69 with limited promotions in May.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill the price of bananas reported by the US BLS for May 2025 be under 63 cents a pound?\n\nQuestion background:\nQuartz: [Move over, eggs – bananas are the next victim](https://qz.com/bananas-dole-price-hikes-inflation-port-fees-trump-tari-1851772583)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if the price reported by the Bureau of Labor Statistics [here](https://data.bls.gov/toppicks?survey=ap) for Bananas, per lb. - APU0000711211, to the thousandths of a decimal point, is under $0.6300 for May 2025.\n\n\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nDole plc, a major fruit distributor, reported its first-quarter 2025 financial results.

The company's adjusted EBITDA decreased by 4.8%, a change attributed primarily to higher fruit costs and increased shipping expenses. The report also noted improvements in banana volumes.\n\nToday is 2025-05-13.\n\nBefore answering you think:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n(e) You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
