  "information": "As of May 15, 2025, the Project 2025 Tracker spreadsheet listed the objective to 'Break up the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration' as 'In progress'. The moderators of the tracker have previously indicated that an item is moved to 'Complete' status only when a formal action, such as a signed executive order or an enacted statute, achieves the specific recommendation. For other large-scale restructurings, the tracker's status was changed to 'Complete' only after such a formal action was taken. From January through mid-May 2025, 5 of 41 objectives marked as 'In progress' on the tracker were updated to 'Complete'.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Approximately 6 weeks. The question resolves on July 1, 2025.",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No. The objective's status is currently 'in progress', and if it remains unchanged until the deadline, the question resolves as No.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "No definitive legislative or executive action to break up NOAA is finalized by the deadline. The objective's status on the tracker remains 'in progress' or is otherwise not updated to 'complete' by July 1, 2025.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "The President signs a sweeping executive order, or Congress passes and the President signs a law, that mandates the dissolution and restructuring of NOAA. The moderators of the Project 2025 Tracker deem this action sufficient to change the objective's status to 'complete' before July 1, 2025.",
    "rationale": "My forecast is 2%. The primary reason for this low probability is the extremely short timeframe of approximately six weeks remaining until the July 1, 2025, deadline. The objective—to 'break up' a major federal agency like NOAA—is a monumental administrative and legislative task. According to the provided research, the tracker's moderators require a formal action, such as an enacted statute or a signed executive order, that fully achieves the objective before marking it 'complete'. Passing the necessary legislation through Congress in such a short period is virtually impossible. While an executive order is more plausible, a single order is unlikely to be considered as having fully 'completed' the breakup of an agency with wide-ranging statutory responsibilities; it would likely only initiate a lengthy process. The base rate of change on the tracker further supports this low probability. From January to mid-May 2025, only 5 of 41 'in progress' objectives were marked complete, and breaking up NOAA is arguably far more complex than the average objective. The forecast is not zero because a politically motivated, sweeping executive order could be signed that is so decisive the tracker's moderators deem it sufficient for 'completion'. The forecast is not higher due to the immense logistical, legal, and political hurdles that make such a rapid and finalized action highly improbable. I would raise my forecast upon seeing credible reports of a specific bill clearing major legislative hurdles or a comprehensive executive order being drafted for imminent release.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill the Project 2025 Tracker spreadsheet have the objective of breaking up NOAA marked as complete before July 1, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nAt the time of this question, the objective was marked as \"in progress.\" The 2025 Tracker is a project of the Keep_Track subreddit and is explained [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/Keep_Track/comments/1ii7tbr/project_2025_tracker_is_now_live/).\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if the Project 2025 objective to \"break up the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration\" is marked as complete according to [this spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1QGG6wNHna-1tt91yXNkOauAJJ7snobFjfEnmxlmzhl4/edit?gid=0#gid=0) before July 1, 2025. If it is anything other than complete (such as \"in progress\") when accessed by Metaculus on or after July 1, 2025, then the question resolves as **No**.\n\n\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nAs of May 15, 2025, the Project 2025 Tracker spreadsheet listed the objective to 'Break up the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration' as 'In progress'.

From January through mid-May 2025, 5 of 41 objectives marked as 'In progress' on the tracker were updated to 'Complete'.\n\nToday is 2025-05-15.\n\nBefore answering you think:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n(e) You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
