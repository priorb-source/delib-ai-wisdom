    "review": "The other forecasters and I are in strong agreement on a low-probability forecast, primarily driven by the extremely short timeline. I found their analyses compelling as they reinforced and supplemented my own reasoning. Forecaster 2 added a crucial piece of evidence I had not considered: Premier Smith's public mention of a potential 2026 referendum, which strongly suggests a pre-July 2025 announcement is not on the government's agenda. Forecaster 3 provided an excellent analysis of the political calculus, highlighting the lack of majority support for independence in polls and the strategic value of using the *threat* of a referendum as a bargaining tool rather than actually holding one. This provides a strong motive for the government to avoid a hasty announcement, complementing the procedural barriers I had focused on. Both arguments convincingly strengthen the case for a 'No' outcome.",
    "rationale": "My initial forecast of 8% was based on the significant procedural hurdles and the short timeline, balanced against the recognized political volatility. After reviewing the other analyses, I am lowering my forecast. The new evidence provided, particularly Premier Smith's own reference to a 2026 timeline and the lack of popular support for independence, significantly weakens the already slim case for a 'Yes' outcome. The political argument that the threat of a referendum is more useful to the Alberta government than the actual event is a powerful one I had not fully weighted. It provides a strong rationale for why the government would adhere to the slow, citizen-led process rather than take unilateral action. Therefore, the combination of procedural impossibility within the timeframe and strong political disincentives for the government to rush makes an announcement before July 1 highly improbable. I am lowering my forecast from 8% to 5% to reflect these additional, compelling arguments against a 'Yes' resolution. The remaining 5% accounts for a low-probability 'black swan' event, such as a sudden and severe federal-provincial crisis that forces the Premier's hand.",
