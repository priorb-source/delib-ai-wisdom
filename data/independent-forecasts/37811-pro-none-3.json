    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Approximately 1 month. The outcome will be known on or after July 1, 2025.",
    "status_quo_outcome": "Yes. The website is currently online and, absent any specific intervention, is expected to remain online as part of NOAA's public outreach mission.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "A new presidential administration, viewing the site as a purveyor of 'climate alarmism', directs NOAA to decommission Climate.gov entirely. This directive is successfully carried out before the resolution date.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "The website continues to be maintained by NOAA. Despite potential political pressure, bureaucratic inertia, the site's utility to researchers and the public, and the potential for public backlash prevent its removal. The site experiences no catastrophic, long-term technical failures.",
    "rationale": "This forecast is strongly anchored on the principle of institutional inertia. Major government websites like Climate.gov are highly stable and rarely taken offline entirely. The status quo is that the site is operational, and this is the most likely outcome. The primary risk identified in the question's background is political: a new administration hostile to climate science could order the site's removal. This is a non-trivial risk, as the resolution date is well into a new potential presidential term. However, completely removing a major scientific resource is a politically costly and highly visible act. A more common tactic observed in the past has been to alter, bury, or defund updates to such sites, rather than complete decommissioning. Furthermore, even with a political directive, the bureaucratic process of shutting down a major government domain can be slow and encounter internal resistance, making a shutdown by the July 1, 2025 deadline less certain. The probability of a permanent shutdown due to technical failure is negligible. The forecast is not higher because the political risk is real and an administration may seek to make a strong symbolic statement. The forecast is not lower because the forces of institutional stability are powerful, and outright removal is a drastic step with a low historical base rate.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill NOAA's Climate.gov still be online on July 1, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nNational Security Archive: [Disappearing Data: Trump Administration Removing Climate Information from Government Websites](https://nsarchive.gwu.edu/briefing-book/climate-change-transparency-project-foia/2025-02-06/disappearing-data-trump)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if Climate.gov is online according to [Is It Down Right Now?](https://www.isitdownrightnow.com/climate.gov.html) when accessed by Metaculus on or after July 1, 2025.\n\nAs of May 7, 2025, the resolution source returns the message, \"Climate.gov is UP and reachable by us.\"\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nNo additional information available.\n\nToday is 2025-05-21.\n\nBefore answering you think:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n(e) You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
