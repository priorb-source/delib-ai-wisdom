  "information": "The final University of Michigan Consumer Sentiment index for May 2025 was 52.2, an improvement from the preliminary reading of 50.8, but a decline from 57.0 in March and 64.7 in February. The index has fallen nearly 30% since January 2025. Within the May report, the Current Economic Conditions Index decreased to 58.9 points from 59.8 in April, while the Economic Expectations Index increased to 47.9 points from 47.3. In a separate survey, the Conference Board's consumer confidence index rose to 98 in May from a revised 85.7 in the prior month. Other economic indicators showed soft growth signals, with the ISM services index at 49.9 and the manufacturing index at 48.5.\n\nInflation expectations remain a significant concern for consumers. The May University of Michigan survey showed consumer expectations for inflation over the next year increased to 7.3% from 6.5% in April, while long-term inflation expectations rose to 4.6% from 4.4%. Trade policy is also a major factor; according to the survey's director, Joanne Hsu, nearly three-quarters of consumers mentioned tariffs and trade policies as a source of uncertainty. Recent policy actions include the doubling of US steel tariffs. Federal Reserve governor Christopher Waller has outlined a potential path to interest rate cuts later in the year but noted this depends on how trade negotiations unfold and on progress toward the Fed's 2% inflation goal.\n\nAmerican consumers are exhibiting cautious behavior. Personal spending rose by only 0.2% in the last reported month, while the savings rate surged to 4.9% in March, the highest level in almost a year. Consumers are reportedly focusing more on essential goods and services. This caution is reflected in the performance of discount retailers like Dollar General, which recently hiked its sales forecast. Household finances are also under pressure from debt; following the end of the pandemic-era payment pause, student loan delinquencies jumped to 7.74% from 1%.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "About 3 weeks. The report is expected on the final Friday of June 2025, which is June 27, 2025.",
    "status_quo_outcome": "Yes. The final reading for May 2025 was 52.2, which is already below the 54.0 threshold. The recent trend has been negative, suggesting the index is more likely to stay below this level than to rise above it.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "A 'No' outcome, where the index is 54.0 or greater, would likely be driven by unexpectedly positive economic news. This could include a surprisingly low CPI report for May, a significant breakthrough in trade negotiations that eases tariff concerns, or a clear and imminent signal from the Federal Reserve about interest rate cuts. This positive news would need to be strong enough to reverse the recent downward trend and overcome persistent consumer anxiety about inflation.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "A 'Yes' outcome, where the index is less than 54.0, aligns with the current trend. This scenario involves the continuation of factors currently pressuring consumers: elevated inflation expectations, persistent uncertainty around trade policy and tariffs, and cautious household spending. Any additional negative news, such as a weak jobs report or further signs of economic softening, would reinforce this outcome and potentially drive the index even lower than May's 52.2 reading.",
    "rationale": "My forecast is based on the strong downward momentum of the index and the persistence of its key negative drivers. The final May 2025 reading was 52.2, already comfortably below the 54.0 threshold. For the outcome to be 'No', sentiment would need to reverse its sharp decline of nearly 30% since January.\n\nThe primary factors weighing on sentiment are high inflation expectations and trade policy uncertainty, both of which were explicitly highlighted in the May survey. The report indicated short-term inflation expectations rose to 7.3%, and nearly three-quarters of consumers cited tariffs as a concern. These are not issues likely to be resolved in the next three weeks.\n\nFurthermore, consumer behavior data supports this pessimistic outlook. Cautious personal spending (up only 0.2%) and a high savings rate (4.9%) indicate that consumers are worried and pulling back, a sentiment that the index is designed to capture. Rising student loan delinquencies also point to tangible financial stress for a portion of the population.\n\nMy probability is not higher because of some countervailing data and inherent uncertainty. The Conference Board's consumer confidence index rose sharply in May, suggesting some divergence in consumer mood that could potentially influence the Michigan survey. Additionally, sentiment can be volatile and react strongly to single data points. A surprisingly good inflation or jobs report could cause a short-term spike in optimism.\n\nMy probability is not lower because the path to a 'No' outcome requires a significant positive shock to overcome the established negative trend and the current low reading. The weight of the evidence, from the index's own recent history to the underlying economic data on inflation and consumer behavior, strongly points toward sentiment remaining depressed and below the 54.0 mark.\n\nI would raise my probability (towards Yes) with any escalation in trade tensions or a higher-than-expected inflation report. I would lower my probability (towards No) if the preliminary June sentiment reading shows a significant unexpected rebound, or if there is a major de-escalation of trade disputes.",
