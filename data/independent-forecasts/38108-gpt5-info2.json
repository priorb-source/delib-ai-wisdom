  "information": "Elon Musk, who led the DOGE initiative, has departed from his public-facing role but will remain an advisor. The project's work is transitioning to the White House Office of Management and Budget (OMB), under the direction of Russell Vought. The US Treasury Secretary has stated that several members of the DOGE team will be integrated into the Treasury to apply its cost-saving principles on a long-term basis. Both Musk and President Trump have publicly expressed confidence that savings will continue to grow, with Musk suggesting a long-term goal of $1 trillion.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "About 31 days (until July 1, 2025)",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No — the DOGE savings page remains below $200B through early July.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "The transition of DOGE’s work into OMB/Treasury slows public updates and tightens accounting. Without a major new, quantifiable initiative, the tracker inches up only modestly and stays under $200B (e.g., in the $120–$180B range) when Metaculus checks in early July.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "OMB/DOGE posts one or two large-ticket items and counts multi‑year projected savings (e.g., procurement reforms, cancellations/rescissions, benefit fraud clampdowns), enabling a step‑change that pushes the published total to ≥$200B by or shortly after July 1.",
    "rationale": "- What I’m weighting: The status quo is that the criteria have not yet been satisfied, implying the official DOGE savings tally is currently below $200B. With only a month to go, inertia favors “No” unless there’s a sizable new claim or a methodological shift that lets them count projected savings.\n- Evidence/context: The research assistant notes Musk has stepped back from a public role; DOGE is being institutionalized within OMB (Russell Vought) and Treasury. That institutional shift can cut both ways: (a) slower, more conservative vetting could dampen near‑term headline increases; (b) the political incentives remain strong, and OMB has tools to frame multi‑year savings that could quickly add tens of billions on paper. Both Musk and President Trump have publicly targeted large long‑term savings (up to $1T), signaling willingness to claim ambitious figures.\n- Why not higher: We don’t have evidence that the tally is already close (e.g., ≥$170–$190B). Integration into OMB/Treasury may reduce the cadence of big updates in June. Many real savings require congressional action or time to materialize, which can restrain what OMB is comfortable claiming in the near term.\n- Why not lower: The metric is “claimed estimated savings,” not third‑party‑verified. Political communication value around crossing $200B near July 4th is high, and one or two large, projected savings items could plausibly push the tally over the threshold within a month.\n- What would move me up: Confirmation the current tracker is already ≥$160–$180B; announcements of major procurement/benefit program reforms with quantified multi‑year savings; signs that DOGE/OMB has recently made large, discrete jumps in the tally. What would move me down: Evidence the current total is near ~$100–$130B; indications OMB has adopted more conservative counting rules or that major proposed cuts won’t be included as “savings” absent legislation.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill Doge claim a total savings of $200 billion or more on July 1, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nNY Post: [Tech guru admired by Elon Musk estimates ‘over $100 billion’ in taxpayer money is being wasted or stolen](https://nypost.com/2025/02/25/us-news/tech-guru-admired-by-elon-musk-estimates-over-100-billion-in-taxpayer-money-is-being-wasted-or-stolen/)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if the Department of Government Efficiency [claims](https://doge.gov/savings) a total estimated savings of greater than or equal to $200 billion when checked by Metaculus on or after July 1, 2025.\n\n\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nElon Musk, who led the DOGE initiative, has departed from his public-facing role but will remain an advisor. The project's work is transitioning to the White House Office of Management and Budget (OMB), under the direction of Russell Vought. The US Treasury Secretary has stated that several members of the DOGE team will be integrated into the Treasury to apply its cost-saving principles on a long-term basis.

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
