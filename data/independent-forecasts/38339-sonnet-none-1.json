    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "25 days (until July 1, 2025)",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No - the agreement remains in force through July 1, 2025",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Despite political pressure from Bulgarian PM Borissov and reported financial difficulties at Bulgargaz, neither party formally announces cancellation of the agreement. The parties continue negotiations or implement temporary measures to address the debt issues without formally terminating the contract. The agreement technically remains in place through the resolution date.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "The financial crisis at Bulgargaz reaches a breaking point, or political pressure from Bulgaria culminates in either Bulgaria or Turkey formally announcing cancellation of the natural gas transmission agreement. This could occur due to Bulgaria's inability to continue payment obligations, or Turkey's decision to terminate due to non-payment and debt accumulation.",
    "rationale": "This forecast requires balancing several competing factors. On one hand, there is documented political pressure (Borissov's direct appeal to Erdogan) and serious financial distress (Bulgargaz reportedly near bankruptcy due to BOTAS debts). The resolution criteria is also lenient - requiring only an announcement by one party, even if disputed. On the other hand, we face a very short timeframe of only 25 days, and international gas transmission agreements are complex commercial contracts that typically involve significant legal barriers to rapid termination. The status quo strongly favors continuation. Most importantly, my research assistant found no recent information suggesting imminent action or movement toward cancellation. While the background articles establish that problems exist, there's no indication these issues are coming to a head in the next 25 days. For my forecast to be higher, I would need: evidence of active termination proceedings, recent statements indicating imminent cancellation, or reports of final negotiations breaking down. For it to be lower, I would need: evidence of successful debt restructuring, explicit statements committing to continuation, or removal of political pressure. Given the strong status quo bias and lack of recent movement, I'm forecasting low probability while acknowledging the genuine pressures that make cancellation non-trivial.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill the Botas Gas Agreement between Bulgaria and Turkey be cancelled before July 1, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\n[Borissov to Erdogan: Bulgaria Needs Out of the Botas Gas Deal](https://www.novinite.com/articles/232423/Borissov+to+Erdogan%3A+Bulgaria+Needs+Out+of+the+Botas+Gas+Deal) | [Bulgargaz on verge of bankrupty due to debts to Turkish gas company BOTAS: Turkish media](https://www.turkiyetoday.com/business/bulgargaz-on-verge-of-bankrupty-due-to-debts-to-turkish-gas-company-botas-turkish-med-3201881)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if before July 1, 2025, the natural gas transmission agreement between Bulgargaz EAD and BOTAŞ Petroleum Pipeline Corp is announced by either party as being cancelled.\n\nTermination of the agreement by either side, even if denied by the other side, would still count.\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nNo additional information available.\n\nToday is 2025-06-06.\n\nBefore answering you think:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n(e) You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
