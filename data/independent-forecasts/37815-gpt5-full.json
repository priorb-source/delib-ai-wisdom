  "information": "The National UFO Reporting Center (NUFORC) receives approximately 5,000-6,000 total UFO reports annually. The 'Pilot' report subtype constitutes about 1% of these, amounting to 30-60 reports worldwide per year. Non-US pilot reports are less frequent, with about 3-5 recorded annually from outside the United States. Reports from South American countries average around 1-2 per year. Specific examples of recent pilot reports from the continent logged in the NUFORC database include a sighting in Brazil in December 2024 and one from a Chilean Air Force crew in February 2023. The NUFORC system is based in the United States and uses an English-language reporting form.\n\nThe U.S. government's All-Domain Anomaly Resolution Office (AARO) and the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) officially document and investigate Unidentified Aerial Phenomena (UAP). In 2020, the Department of Defense established a UAP Task Force to track and analyze sightings. According to official data, 757 UAP reports were documented between May 2023 and June 2024, with 708 of these occurring in the air. As of the latest report, only 49 of these cases have been officially closed. A report submitted to the U.S. Congress stated that of the 757 observations, no evidence suggested extraterrestrial origin; analysis indicated approximately 70% of the objects were balloons and 16% were drones.\n\nA number of high-profile encounters between military aircraft and UAPs have been reported in North America. In an incident on January 19, 2023, a U.S. Air Force F-16 fighter jet collided with an unidentified object during a training mission over Arizona, cracking the aircraft's canopy. This event was one of 22 UAP sightings reported by Air Force pilots between October 2022 and June 2023. Arizona, particularly near military training zones, is described as a hotspot for such sightings. Some U.S. officials have suggested these objects may be advanced drones. In a separate event on September 17, 2024, an Air Force pilot reported a close encounter with a dark grey, football-sized cylindrical object over California.",

    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "About 41 days (until on/after July 1, 2025)",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "No South American pilot-subtype NUFORC report with an occurrence date in June 2025 is posted by early July; or a June event occurs but is not tagged as “Pilot,” is reported as over international waters rather than in a country, is submitted late (after Metaculus checks), or is never submitted to NUFORC.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "A pilot (airline, military, or GA) in a South American country reports a June 2025 UAP to NUFORC, it’s categorized under the Pilot subtype and assigned to a South American country location, and it appears on the NUFORC pilot page by the time Metaculus checks after July 1, 2025.",
    "rationale": "Base rate framing: NUFORC logs roughly 5,000–6,000 reports per year, with the Pilot subtype about 1% (≈50–60 globally). The research assistant notes non‑US pilot reports at ~3–5 per year, and South America at ~1–2 per year. Treating South American pilot reports as a Poisson process with λ ≈ 1–2 per year yields a per‑month probability of ≈8–17% for at least one such report; a midpoint suggests ~12–14% for any given month. A different framing—4–5 pilot reports per month globally, with a South America share around 2–4%—produces a similar monthly chance (≈11–19%). These converge on a low‑teens probability.\n\nConstraints that push the probability down: language/reporting friction for non‑US pilots to use NUFORC; the strict requirement that the report be tagged specifically as “Pilot” and be assigned to a South American country (not open ocean); and the possibility of posting delays that miss Metaculus’s check soon after July 1.\n\nFactors supporting the base rate (and preventing a lower forecast): NUFORC does log South American pilot reports most years (e.g., Brazil in Dec 2024; Chile in Feb 2023 per the assistant). The event can be posted after the end of June as long as it’s visible by the time Metaculus checks on or after July 1, which slightly mitigates timing risk.\n\nWhy not higher: Even under optimistic shares, the monthly likelihood remains in the teens; the classification/tagging and geography requirements add failure modes. Why not lower: Historical cadence suggests roughly 1–2 South American pilot reports per year, so ≈10–15% per month is reasonable rather than, say, 5%.\n\nWhat would move me up: Early‑June NUFORC postings showing an uptick in pilot reports, any publicized South American pilot/UAP incident in June, or evidence NUFORC has started tagging more international reports as “Pilot.” What would move me down: Evidence of a slowdown in NUFORC postings or a pattern of delayed international entries not appearing until well after month‑end, or confirmation that “Pilot” tagging is rarely applied to non‑US reports.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill a pilot report of UFOs come from a country in South America in June 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nFor example, the resolution source [reports](https://nuforc.org/subndx/?id=x) a sighting in Brazil in December 2024.\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below.

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower.
