  "information": "The US State Department's travel advisory system consists of four tiers: Level 1 (Exercise Normal Precautions), Level 2 (Exercise Increased Caution), Level 3 (Reconsider Travel), and Level 4 (Do Not Travel). Advisories are regularly reviewed and can be upgraded due to factors like a significant deterioration in security, increased terrorist activity, political instability, or civil unrest. A notable security concern for Tanzania is the insurgency in Mozambique's Niassa Reserve, which borders the country. Terrorist activity linked to Islamic extremism was reported in the area as recently as April 2025, creating potential spillover risks.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Approximately 2 months (from May 2, 2025 to July 1, 2025)",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No - Tanzania maintains its current travel advisory level (likely Level 2) through July 1, 2025",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Tanzania's security situation remains stable enough that the US State Department does not upgrade the advisory. Despite ongoing concerns about spillover from the Mozambique insurgency, no major incidents occur within Tanzania that would trigger a Level 3 designation. Tourist areas remain relatively secure, and the terrorist activity stays confined to the Mozambique side of the border.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "A significant security incident occurs in Tanzania before July 1 - such as a terrorist attack in a major city or tourist area, kidnapping of Western nationals, major spillover violence from the Mozambique insurgency crossing into Tanzanian territory, or a substantial deterioration in security conditions. The State Department responds by upgrading Tanzania to Level 3 to warn US citizens to reconsider travel.",
    "rationale": "The status quo strongly favors a No outcome. Travel advisory upgrades to Level 3 are significant policy decisions that typically require major triggering events - they are not made lightly or frequently. With only 2 months until the resolution date, there is limited time for the circumstances requiring such an upgrade to develop.\n\nThe research assistant's report highlights a legitimate concern: terrorist activity linked to Islamic extremism in Mozambique's Niassa Reserve bordering Tanzania, with incidents as recently as April 2025. This creates real spillover risk. However, this insurgency has been ongoing for several years without prompting a Level 3 advisory for Tanzania, suggesting the State Department views the threat as contained or manageable under current advisory levels.\n\nWhat would need to be true for a Yes outcome: A major security incident within Tanzania itself - particularly targeting tourists or Western interests, or a dramatic escalation in cross-border attacks. The State Department would need not just general concerns but a specific catalyst justifying the warning to reconsider travel.\n\nWhy not higher (30%+): No evidence of imminent threats or recent attacks within Tanzania proper. The spillover risk, while real, has existed without triggering Level 3. Advisory upgrades require substantial justification and don't happen based on theoretical risks alone.\n\nWhy not lower (5-10%): The April 2025 terrorist activity in the border region is recent and concerning. The short 2-month timeframe means if an incident does occur, there's less time for the situation to stabilize before the resolution date. The security environment is dynamic enough that a significant event, while unlikely, is plausible.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill Tanzania receive a \"Level 3 – Reconsider Travel\" travel advisory from the US State Department before July 1, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nTravel and Tour World: [Travel Advisory for Tanzania: How Increased Crime and Terrorism Threats Impact Tourists in Popular African Destinations](https://www.travelandtourworld.com/news/article/travel-advisory-for-tanzania-how-increased-crime-and-terrorism-threats-impact-tourists-in-popular-african-destinations/)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below.

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
