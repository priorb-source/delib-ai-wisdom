    "review": "All three forecasters are in strong agreement on the fundamental drivers of the forecast: the intense political instability in South Korea, the impeachment of the former president, and the upcoming snap presidential election are all extremely powerful catalysts for protest. We all agree the base rate of qualifying protests in early 2025 is very high. The primary difference in our forecasts (85%, 90%, 95%) stems from the weight we assign to potential downside risks. Forecaster 2 provides the most compelling case for caution, highlighting both a potential 'political release valve' after the election and, crucially, the 'resolution source risk'—the possibility that a protest occurs but is not captured correctly by the Global Protest Tracker due to reporting lags or conservative estimation methods. Forecaster 3 makes a strong counterargument by focusing on the sheer unlikelihood of a two-month period containing a presidential election passing with zero qualifying events, given the established precedent.",
    "rationale": "After reviewing my peers' analyses, I am making a slight downward revision to my forecast. My initial assessment was centered on the high probability of a large-scale protest event occurring on the ground. I remain highly confident in that aspect. However, Forecaster 2's analysis persuasively articulated the 'resolution source risk,' which I had previously considered but not weighed heavily enough. The resolution depends specifically on the Global Protest Tracker, and there is a non-trivial chance that a protest with around 10,000-15,000 participants could be missed or undercounted by this specific source, or that a protest in late June is not logged until after the resolution date. While Forecaster 3 is correct that the political drivers and high base rate make a 'Yes' outcome extremely likely, Forecaster 2's point about this specific failure mode related to the measurement process is a critical piece of nuance. Therefore, I am lowering my confidence slightly from 90% to 88%. This change reflects my continued belief that a 'Yes' outcome is the overwhelming favorite, while more accurately pricing in the specific risks tied to the resolution criteria.",
