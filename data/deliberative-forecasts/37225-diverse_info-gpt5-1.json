    "review": "Forecaster 2 adds useful macro and sentiment context. The macro improvements (inflation down, IMF program on track, oil investment, wage hikes) plausibly help VHP, but a reported ~3% approval for Santokhi is so extreme that it warrants skepticism unless corroborated by multiple, high-quality sources; still, even directionally, very poor approval and majority dissatisfaction are meaningful headwinds. Their argument about limited time left is fair. They underweight the recent April poll showing VHP ahead on seats, but their caution about noisy Surinamese polling is reasonable.\n\nForecaster 3’s analysis relies on two claims I do not find reliable: (1) that this election is under a new national PR system (my understanding is Suriname remains district-based with reforms to malapportionment rather than pure national PR), and (2) that the NDP is in disarray due to Bouterse’s death (which I cannot verify and thus discount). Their point on opposition fragmentation potentially helping VHP is valid, but their core factual premises look shaky, so I discount their high 72%.\n\nNet: I put weight on the latest poll edge for VHP and opposition fragmentation, but the approval/dissatisfaction signals and prior contradictory polling argue for caution and a closer-to-even outlook.",
    "rationale": "I started at 52% based on the April 22 projection showing VHP ahead on seats and the likelihood that a fragmented opposition makes a low-plurality VHP win feasible. Incorporating the deliberation:\n- Downward pressure: Very negative sentiment/approval (even if the 3% figure is an outlier, the direction is likely correct), plus prior polling volatility (January had NDP well ahead), and district-level disproportionality risks for VHP.\n- Upward pressure: Most recent polling snapshot shows VHP ahead on seats, incumbency/resources, and opposition fragmentation (including NDP/VHP non-cooperation, which affects government formation more than plurality but implies continued splintering).\n- I discount Forecaster 3’s claims about national PR and Bouterse’s death; if either were accurate and materially harmful to NDP cohesion, I would move up, but I lack confidence in those premises.\n\nGiven 3–4 weeks left and a likely close race, I edge slightly down from a coin flip but keep a substantial chance for VHP given the latest seat projection and fragmentation. If a subsequent credible poll confirms catastrophic approval translating into NDP gains in key districts, I would move lower; if multiple district-level polls or credible models continue to show VHP ahead, I would move higher.",
