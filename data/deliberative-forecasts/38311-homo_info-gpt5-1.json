    "review": "Forecaster 2 adds useful concrete signals I hadn’t explicitly cited: Canada’s controlled access zone (June 10–18) and airspace restrictions, plus U.S. principals’ preparatory participation. These materially reduce risks of postponement/cancellation and indicate mature logistics. Forecaster 3’s point that communiqué disputes don’t affect attendance is also sound, and the note about bilateral diplomacy (e.g., Scholz meeting June 5) is consistent with normal leader engagement. Both appropriately flag residual tail risks (health, crisis, security, weather, or a format/date change). I find their reasoning well-aligned with mine and slightly strengthening the pro-attendance case via additional operational indicators.",
    "rationale": "With roughly 12 days to go, we have: (1) explicit White House confirmation; (2) inclusion on official participant lists; (3) Canadian security and airspace measures covering the summit window; and (4) pre-summit engagements by senior U.S. officials and allied leaders. These are strong, convergent signals that the summit is proceeding as planned and that Trump intends to attend in person. Remaining risks are real but small: sudden health issues, a domestic or international crisis requiring him to remain in Washington, a specific security threat, severe aviation/weather disruption, or a last-minute postponement/virtualization that would also imperil a June resolution. The added evidence about controlled access zones and airspace restrictions slightly reduces postponement risk. I was already at 95%, which appropriately reflects these tail risks; I’m not increasing further until we see the official schedule, pool reports, or wheels-up. No change.",
