    "review": "My initial forecast heavily discounted the possibility of a voluntary return, focusing on the legal risks and diplomatic inertia. Forecaster 2's analysis reinforces this view by adding specific, compelling details about the imminent legal threats Sheikh Hasina faces, such as the crimes against humanity investigation and a contempt of court case with a May 15 deadline. This strengthens the argument for a 'No' outcome. However, Forecaster 3 introduced a crucial piece of information I had completely overlooked: the return of her political arch-rival, Khaleda Zia, on May 6. This is a game-changing event. Forecaster 3 convincingly argues that this creates immense political pressure on Hasina to return to maintain her relevance and leadership, transforming the situation from a simple risk-avoidance calculation into a high-stakes political dilemma. This argument is powerful enough to warrant a significant revision of my initial forecast.",
    "rationale": "I am significantly increasing my forecast based on the new information provided by Forecaster 3. My initial 5% forecast was based on the premise that a voluntary return was highly unlikely given the severe legal jeopardy Hasina faces, a point well-articulated and strengthened by Forecaster 2. However, the return of Khaleda Zia on May 6 fundamentally alters the political landscape. For Hasina to remain in exile while her chief rival is back in the country rallying support is a path to political irrelevance. This creates a powerful incentive for her to make a high-risk 'martyr's return,' gambling that her presence, even if imprisoned, is politically more potent than her absence. The probability of this voluntary return is now much higher than I previously assessed. Despite this, I am not raising my forecast to 40% because the risks, as detailed by Forecaster 2, are not abstract; they are concrete, severe, and immediate. The near certainty of arrest on charges as serious as crimes against humanity remains the single strongest factor arguing against her return. My updated forecast of 25% reflects a new balance between these two powerful and opposing forces: the dramatically increased political necessity for her to return and the severe, near-certain personal consequences she would face upon arrival.",
