    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Approximately one month.",

    "no_outcome_scenario": "At least one of the remaining seven fugitives successfully evades capture past the July 1 deadline. This individual, or small group, might receive assistance from outside contacts, successfully leave the state, or find a secure location to hide long-term, causing the trail to go cold.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "A combination of sustained, high-intensity efforts from local, state, and federal law enforcement, along with tips from the public, leads to the steady recapture of the remaining escapees. The fugitives, running low on resources and making mistakes under pressure, are apprehended one by one before the deadline.",
    "rationale": "My forecast is based on the conflicting evidence presented. A significant point in favor of a 'Yes' outcome is the initial success of law enforcement, who, according to the provided article, recaptured 3 of the 10 inmates within the first three days of the escape (by May 19, 2025). This suggests a capable and swift response. Furthermore, there is still an entire month until the July 1 deadline, which is a substantial amount of time for a high-priority, multi-agency manhunt to operate. Most prison escapees are recaptured, and often within weeks, as they struggle with resources and visibility.\n\nHowever, there are strong reasons for caution, which is why my forecast is not higher. The primary challenge is the resolution criteria: *all* 10 inmates must be recaptured. The probability of capturing every single fugitive is significantly lower than capturing most of them. The inmates captured first are often the least prepared or the unluckiest. The seven who have remained at large for two weeks (from May 16 to today, May 30) have likely overcome the initial dragnet and may be more resourceful. The longer a fugitive remains at large, the colder the trail becomes, and the harder they are to find. A single determined and well-connected escapee could evade capture for months, which would be sufficient to resolve this question as 'No'.\n\nTherefore, I place the probability slightly in favor of law enforcement's success due to the long timeframe and significant resources likely being deployed. My forecast is not lower because of the initial 30% capture rate in just three days, demonstrating effectiveness. It is not higher because of the high bar set by the 'all 10' condition and the increasing difficulty of catching fugitives over time.\n\nI would increase my forecast upon news of additional captures. I would decrease it if we approach mid-to-late June with several inmates still at large, or if credible reports suggest one or more may have fled the country.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill all 10 inmates who escaped from jail in New Orleans on May 16, 2025 be recaptured before July 1, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\n[Manhunt continues Monday for 7 Orleans jail escapees as state launches investigation](https://www.fox8live.com/2025/05/19/manhunt-continues-monday-7-orleans-jail-escapees-state-launches-investigation/)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if before July 1, 2025, all 10 inmates who escaped from jail in the [2025 New Orleans jailbreak](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2025_New_Orleans_jailbreak) have been either recaptured or killed, according to [credible sources](https://www.metaculus.com/faq/#definitions). If any are still at large on July 1, 2025, then the question resolves as **No**.\n\n\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nNo additional information available.\n\nToday is 2025-05-30.\n\nBefore answering you think:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n(e) You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
