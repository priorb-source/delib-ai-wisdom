    "review": "Both Forecaster 2 and Forecaster 3 provide convincing and well-structured arguments. The most compelling point, which they both raised and I had under-weighted, is the impact of significantly enhanced global genomic surveillance capabilities post-2020. This correctly shifts the analysis from purely the probability of a spillover event to the probability of a spillover event being *detected and reported* within the timeframe. Forecaster 2's specific points about the virus's biological capacity—that it can bind to human ACE2 receptors, confirming a pathway, but does so with low efficiency, suggesting a high barrier—provided useful context that reinforces a low-but-non-zero probability. Forecaster 3's framing of the required 'cascade' of events (spillover, symptoms, testing, sequencing, reporting) was also an effective way to illustrate the low overall odds. Their reasoning is sound, and their convergence on 2% is a strong signal.",
    "rationale": "I am updating my forecast upward from 1% to 2%. My initial analysis was heavily anchored on the historical base rate of zoonotic spillover for newly discovered coronaviruses, which is extremely low. While this and the very short timeframe (~45 days) remain the strongest arguments for a 'No' outcome, the other forecasters have convinced me that I did not adequately account for one critical variable: the post-COVID-19 global surveillance environment. As both forecasters argued, the greatly increased capacity for and sensitivity of genomic surveillance makes it more likely that a single, rare human case would be detected, sequenced, and reported than it would have been in the pre-2020 era. My 1% forecast was based on the probability of the event itself, while the question resolves based on the *reporting* of the event. The enhanced detection capability justifies a modest increase in the forecast. I am therefore moving my forecast to 2% to align with this updated view, which better balances the raw improbability of the spillover event with the increased likelihood of its detection.",
