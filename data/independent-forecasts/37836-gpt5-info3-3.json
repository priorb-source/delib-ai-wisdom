  "information": "Broader regional aviation activity and international interest in the area have seen recent developments. Dubai-based carrier flydubai announced the resumption of direct daily flights to Damascus, Syria, starting from June 1, 2025, after a 12-year suspension. This move is part of a wider effort to enhance regional connectivity. In a different development indicating tourism interest, British travel company Wild Frontiers is offering a 15-day tour of Iraq, which includes visits to historical sites such as the citadel of Erbil, despite official UK government warnings against travel to the country.",

    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "About 39 days (until July 1, 2025)",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "The FlightsFrom EBL page lists roughly 29–31 destinations going into July, with no newly added summer routes beyond those already loaded in the S25 schedule. One or two suspensions (e.g., security-related, airline operational issues) keep the count at or below 31.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "A handful of summer-season additions (e.g., Turkish coastal cities, extra Saudi destinations tied to summer/Umrah traffic, an added Iranian or European city) are loaded and operating by July 1, pushing the count to 32+ on FlightsFrom.",
    "rationale": "- Baseline/status quo: The cutoff (>31) is set near Erbil’s typical band of nonstop destinations. Given seasonal schedules are largely published by late spring, the number on July 1 is likely close to what FlightsFrom already shows in late May. That favors a modest tilt toward No absent clear evidence of new routes. \n- Seasonal upside: July is peak summer; if any seasonal/charter-like services are scheduled (Turkish resorts, Egyptian resorts, additional Saudi services) and appear on FlightsFrom as scheduled nonstops, they could nudge the count above 31. Istanbul’s dual airports count separately, which helps. \n- Offsetting risks: Geopolitical and operational volatility in Iraq and the region can lead to short-notice suspensions, which could shave the total. Also, many summer routes would already be visible in schedules; fewer entirely new adds tend to launch mid-season. \n- Assistant’s info: Regional connectivity is improving (e.g., flydubai restarting DXB–Damascus) and there’s rising tourism interest (e.g., UK tour offering). These signal a supportive environment but do not directly add EBL routes. \nWhy not higher? Because without concrete, route-specific announcements to EBL, the status quo likely prevails, and schedule changes late in the season are less common. \nWhy not lower? July is peak season; even a couple of seasonal adds could tip the count to 32+. \nWhat would move me up: Verified announcements of new EBL routes effective by July 1 (e.g., added Saudi, Turkish resort, Egyptian resort, Iranian, or a resumed European link) appearing on FlightsFrom’s schedule, or an observed increase in the current FlightsFrom count to 31+ before July. \nWhat would move me down: Reports of suspensions/cancellations from key Gulf, Turkish, or regional carriers; security disruptions; or current FlightsFrom counts sitting at 29–30 by late June.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill there be greater than 31 direct flight destinations from Erbil, Iraq on July 1, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nShafaq News: [Kurdistan Summer 2025: A Promising Season](https://shafaq.com/en/Kurdistan/Kurdistan-Summer-2025-A-Promising-Season)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if there are greater than 31 direct flight destinations listed at the [All scheduled direct (non-stop) flights from Erbil (EBL)](https://www.flightsfrom.com/EBL) tracker when checked by Metaculus on or after July 1, 2025.\n\n\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nBroader regional aviation activity and international interest in the area have seen recent developments.

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
