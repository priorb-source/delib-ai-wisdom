    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "About 39 days (until June 30, 2025, 11:59 pm local time)",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No — no announcement is made before July 1, 2025.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "O’Rourke waits until July to launch so he can count a full Q3 fundraising quarter, or he delays pending John Cornyn’s intentions and broader party signals, or he ultimately opts not to run.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "O’Rourke announces in late May or June 2025, potentially coordinated with DSCC recruitment, a Texas Democratic Party event, or a strategy to clear the Democratic field and begin early fundraising and organizing.",
    "rationale": "Baseline: As of May 22, 2025, no announcement has been made; if nothing changes, the resolution is No. The window is short (about five and a half weeks), so the status quo carries significant weight. Historical timing cuts both ways. Per the research assistant: Colin Allred announced for the 2024 Senate race in May 2023 (17 months ahead), and O’Rourke announced his 2018 Senate bid 20 months ahead (March 2017) but his 2022 gubernatorial bid later, ~12 months ahead (Nov 2021). The July 1, 2025 cutoff is ~16 months before November 2026, so an early announcement is plausible on precedent. However, there are countervailing incentives to wait. Many campaigns prefer to launch at the start of a federal fundraising quarter; announcing right after July 1 enables a full Q3 haul to be reported as an opening statement, whereas announcing in late June would yield only a few days of Q2 receipts. That timing convention nudges against a pre–July 1 launch. Strategic uncertainty also favors waiting: Cornyn’s plans for 2026, DSCC recruitment decisions, and the potential Democratic field could all become clearer over the summer and fall, and Texas candidates often don’t need 16+ months of runway given high name recognition (which O’Rourke already has). On the pro-Yes side, O’Rourke’s recent public openness (“if Texans want him to run… yes I will”), his proven fundraising network, and DSCC interest could pull an announcement forward into late spring/early summer to shape the field. Still, absent concrete reporting of staff hires, FEC filings, or coordinated rollout plans, the near-term announcement remains less likely than not. Why not higher? The Q3 fundraising timing, the lack of immediate necessity to announce so early, and uncertainty around the GOP incumbent all depress the odds. Why not lower? O’Rourke and recent Texas Democrats have announced on similar timelines before, and a coordinated June launch tied to party events or recruitment is credible. What would move me up: credible reports of O’Rourke hiring campaign staff, reserving media/vendors, an FEC statement of candidacy or committee activity, DSCC public courting, or Cornyn announcing retirement with signals that Democrats want O’Rourke to clear the field quickly. What would move me down: another strong Democrat launching before July 1, O’Rourke publicly ruling out a run or signaling he’ll decide later in the year, or continued silence through late June (making a pre-deadline launch logistically unlikely).",
