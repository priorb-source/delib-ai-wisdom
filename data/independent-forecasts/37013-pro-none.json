    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Approximately 12 days, with the election on May 1, 2025 and results expected shortly after.",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No. The Conservative Party is the status quo, having won a large majority in the 2021 election with 47 seats, compared to 13 for the Liberal Democrats.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "The Conservative party's vote share falls significantly due to national political headwinds, but they manage to hold onto enough seats to remain the largest single party on the council, leading to a 'No Overall Control' situation where they still have a plurality.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "A collapse in the national Conservative vote translates into major losses at the local level. The Liberal Democrats successfully campaign on local issues and capitalize on their historical strength in the region, winning a large number of seats from the Conservatives to become the largest party, likely leading a coalition in a council with no overall control.",
    "rationale": "My forecast is anchored in the 2021 Cornwall Council election results, which saw the Conservatives win a commanding majority with 47 of the 87 seats, while the Liberal Democrats secured only 13. Overcoming a 34-seat deficit is a monumental task in a single electoral cycle, making the status quo 'No' outcome highly probable. However, local elections are often heavily influenced by national politics. Assuming the Conservative party is in government nationally, they are likely facing significant electoral headwinds, which typically result in substantial losses for the governing party in local council elections. The Liberal Democrats have a strong historical base and activist network in Cornwall and are the best-positioned party to capitalize on anti-Conservative sentiment. While they are likely to make significant gains, the sheer scale of the 2021 Conservative victory provides a substantial buffer. It is more probable that the Conservatives lose their majority, resulting in a council under 'No Overall Control', but that they still retain a plurality of seats. The considerable presence of Independent candidates (who also won 13 seats in 2021) further complicates the path to victory for the Liberal Democrats, as they may also pick up seats from disenchanted Conservative voters. My forecast is not higher because the starting gap is simply too large to ignore; a complete reversal is a high-bar anomaly. It is not lower because a significant anti-government swing is a very real possibility, and the Lib Dems are the most likely beneficiaries in Cornwall. I would increase my forecast if local polling showed a clear and substantial lead for the Liberal Democrats, or if a major local scandal specifically damaged the Cornwall Conservatives. I would decrease it if polling suggested the Conservative vote was holding up better than expected in the South West, or if support for Labour or Independents appeared to be surging, which would likely split the anti-Conservative vote.",
