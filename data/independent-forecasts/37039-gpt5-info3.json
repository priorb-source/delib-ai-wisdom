  "information": "The 31% additional ad valorem duty for Swiss products was officially listed under subheading 9903.01.60 of the U.S. Harmonized Tariff Schedule (HTS). On April 10, 2025, the U.S. administration announced that the country-specific tariffs, including the one for Switzerland, would be suspended for 90 days to allow for negotiations. This suspension period is scheduled to run until July 9, 2025, covering the June 1 resolution date. The HTS listing for Switzerland under subheading 9903.01.60 reflects the 31% rate but is marked as 'suspended'.",

    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "~5 weeks (about 38 days) until June 1, 2025",
    "status_quo_outcome": "Yes — 9903.01.60 currently shows an additional +31% rate for Switzerland on the HTS, labeled as suspended, and suspension status does not affect resolution.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "The administration finalizes a deal before June 1 that removes Switzerland from 9903.01.60 or revises the listed rate there from 31% (e.g., rescission, renumbering, or substituting a different percentage), and USITC updates the HTS accordingly before Metaculus checks.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "No change to the listing before June 1; 9903.01.60 continues to display +31% for Swiss-origin articles (even if flagged “suspended”).",
    "rationale": "The research assistant reports that subheading 9903.01.60 on the HTS already lists an additional ad valorem duty of 31% for Switzerland and that, on April 10, 2025, the administration announced a 90‑day suspension of these country-specific tariffs through July 9, 2025. The question resolves based on whether the 31% is listed on June 1, irrespective of suspension. Given that the suspension extends beyond June 1, the status quo is that the entry remains visible with the 31% rate, likely marked as suspended. Policy and administrative inertia over a 5‑week window favors the listing remaining as-is. A No outcome requires early, definitive action to remove or alter Switzerland’s rate before June 1 and a prompt HTS update; while possible (e.g., a quick bilateral deal), the 90‑day window suggests negotiations will run longer. Legal or procedural developments (e.g., injunctions) would more likely affect enforceability rather than the listing format, which the resolution rules explicitly ignore. Why not higher: There is non-trivial risk that the administration carves out Switzerland early or adjusts the rate as part of rapid talks, and USITC updates quickly. Why not lower: The announced suspension through July 9 reduces near‑term pressure to change the publication, and HTS entries are typically retained (with suspension notes) during such pauses. What would move me up: Continued signs through May that talks are ongoing with no carve-outs; USITC retaining the same display convention. What would move me down: Credible reports of an early deal removing Switzerland from the measure, a new proclamation modifying 9903.01.60 before June 1, or evidence that USITC changed the display to omit the 31% figure for suspended entries.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill the US government's harmonized tariff schedule list the tariff on Switzerland as 31% on June 1, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nNew York Times: [Swiss Indignant to Make the Top 10 of Trump’s Tariffs List](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/04/business/trump-tariffs-switzerland.html)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below.

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any).
