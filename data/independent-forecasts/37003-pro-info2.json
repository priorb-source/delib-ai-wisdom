  "information": "Public polls from outlets such as ElectsWorld and ORF ahead of the April 27, 2025, election consistently showed the SPÖ with 38-40% of the vote, compared to the Freedom Party of Austria (FPÖ) with 21-24%, indicating a lead of 16-19 percentage points.",

    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "6 days. The election is scheduled for April 27, 2025.",
    "status_quo_outcome": "The Social Democratic Party of Austria (SPÖ) wins the most seats, continuing its long-standing political dominance in Vienna.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "A last-minute surge in support for the Freedom Party of Austria (FPÖ), driven by a major SPÖ scandal or a highly effective FPÖ get-out-the-vote campaign, coupled with a systemic polling error that undercounted FPÖ voters, leads to the FPÖ unexpectedly winning a plurality of seats.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "The consistent and substantial polling lead for the SPÖ holds through election day. The party's campaign successfully mobilizes its base, and no major political events disrupt the race's trajectory. The SPÖ wins a clear plurality of votes, which translates directly into a plurality of seats.",
    "rationale": "My forecast is based primarily on the overwhelming and consistent polling data available less than a week before the election. As my research assistant noted, polls from multiple outlets show the SPÖ with 38-40% of the vote, leading the second-place FPÖ (21-24%) by a commanding 16 to 19 percentage points. In an election this close, such a large lead is exceptionally difficult to overcome. This polling data is strongly reinforced by the historical context; the SPÖ has been the dominant force in Viennese politics for over a century, creating a powerful status quo and incumbency advantage. The probability is not higher because polling is not infallible, and there remains a small, non-zero chance of a 'black swan' event—such as a major, breaking scandal—that could dramatically shift public opinion in the final days. Additionally, a systemic polling miss, while unlikely to be large enough to erase a 16-point gap, cannot be entirely ruled out. The probability is not lower because the SPÖ's lead is not marginal; it is substantial, consistent, and corroborated by historical precedent. For the outcome to be 'No', it would require not just a polling error, but an error of historic proportions. I would lower my forecast if a credible, major scandal involving the SPÖ leadership emerged, or if the final pre-election polls unexpectedly showed the gap narrowing to the single digits. Conversely, I would raise it slightly if the final polls showed the SPÖ's lead widening even further.",

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any).
