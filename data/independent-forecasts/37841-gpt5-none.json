    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "About 5–6 weeks (by June 29, 2025)",
    "status_quo_outcome": "Yes — they play as scheduled, since they are currently on the official lineup",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Festival drops them or they withdraw before their slot due to legal/policing concerns (e.g., a formal investigation/charges related to proscription laws), security/licensing pressure, or a last‑minute illness/logistical issue.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "They appear on their billed stage and perform under the name Kneecap (even if one member is absent), with the festival backing the booking despite controversy.",
    "rationale": "Baseline: Once Glastonbury announces an act, the vast majority perform; last‑minute removals are uncommon and typically due to illness/injury or uncontrollable logistics. That sets a high base rate for “Yes.” Glastonbury is also relatively independent and historically tolerant of politically controversial artists, which modestly reinforces the base rate. \n\nCountervailing risks: The recent UK controversy is non‑trivial. Reports to the Metropolitan Police alleging praise of proscribed groups, plus the widely publicized “dead Tory” clip (for which they apologized for the hurt caused), raise the chance of policing, licensing, or security pressures. The band has already had some cancellations elsewhere post‑Coachella, showing that gatekeepers may act under pressure. A formal police investigation or CPS action would significantly threaten the slot, and even absent charges, festival organizers could still decide the risk isn’t worth it. \n\nTiming considerations: We’re ~5 weeks out. Going from complaint to charge in that window is possible but not common. Organizers booked them knowing their politics; public pressure alone may be insufficient for Glastonbury to reverse unless legal or safety constraints bite. \n\nWhy not higher: Open controversy with specific legal sensitivities (UK proscription laws), evidence of prior cancellations, and the possibility of late pressure from authorities or stakeholders keep this below the typical 90%+ base rate for announced Glastonbury acts. \n\nWhy not lower: They are on the official lineup now; Glastonbury’s culture tends to favor artist autonomy; there’s limited time for a full legal process; and annulment of the festival itself is extremely unlikely. Most similar controversies at major festivals resolve with the artist performing. \n\nWhat would move me up: Explicit public backing from Glastonbury after the latest reports; published set times including Kneecap close to the festival; no sign of an active police investigation; the band completing other UK festival/TV appearances in June without disruption. \n\nWhat would move me down: Announcement of a police investigation or arrests/charges; credible reporting of licensing or security concerns tied to their slot; the festival quietly removing them from updated lineups/schedules; further incendiary statements by the band prompting intensified scrutiny; cascading cancellations by other UK festivals. \n\nResearch assistant: No additional information available; forecast relies on base rates for festival follow‑through, Glastonbury’s institutional behavior, and the known controversy dynamics.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill Kneecap perform at Glastonbury 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\n[Kneecap](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kneecap_\\(band\\)) are an Irish band who have significantly risen in popularity since their formation in 2017.&#x20;\n\nThe band is a trio consisting of: \"Mo Chara\" (Liam Óg Ó hAnnaidh), \"Móglaí Bap\" (Naoise Ó Caireallain), and \"DJ Próvaí\" (J. J. Ó Dochartaigh) whose songs consist of rap in a mixture of Irish Gaelic and English giving them a unique style.\n\nNamed after a [torture technique](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kneecapping) made infamous by the Irish Republican Army, the group are no stranger to controversies. Whilst most have been minor - complaints about profanity, drug use, violence in their songs, music videos and concerts, and promotion of Irish Republicanism - the band have come under a large amount of controversy resulting in cancelled performances which initially stemmed from a Coachcella performance where the band, \"described Israel's military action in Gaza as a US-funded genocide\".&#x20;\n\nOn top of this, [two reports were made](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/cly5r4gg7l6o) to the UK Metropolitan police:\n\n> \\[...] the band allegedly call for the death of Conservative MPs. Another seems to show a band member shouting \"up Hamas, up Hezbollah\". Both groups are banned in the UK and it is a crime to express support for them.\n\n> \\[...]\n\n> They claimed that footage where they appeared to say \"the only good Tory is a dead Tory\" had been \"taken out of all context\", and apologised for the hurt caused to the families of murdered MPs Jo Cox and Sir David Amess.\n\nThe band are [due](https://www.glastonburyfestivals.co.uk/line-up/) to play at Glastonbury 2025 - the UK's largest and most prestigious music festival - however there have been [calls](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/politics/2025/04/30/kneecap-should-be-banned-full-stop-after-dead-tories-video/) for the band to be removed from the lineup.\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question will resolve as **Yes** if Kneecap officially performs at Glastonbury 2025, scheduled for June 25 to June 29, 2025.\n\n* If Glastonbury 2025 does not take place before September 1, 2025 this question will be **annulled**.\n* Officially perform is defined as a planned performance as allowed by the festival organisers.\n* Any official performance is considered sufficient for this question. If, for example, one band member is banned from the festival, the question will still resolve as **Yes** if the other member(s) perform under the name Kneecap.\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nNo additional information available.\n\nToday is 2025-05-23.\n\nBefore answering you think:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n(e) You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
