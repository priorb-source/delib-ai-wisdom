    "review": "Forecaster 2 usefully emphasizes the strict resolution criteria (public S-1 or an explicit News-page announcement) and the unusually short window, along with the lack of preparatory signals—points that further depress the odds versus a generic “IPO sometime soon” claim. I find that persuasive, especially the observation that companies rarely self-announce IPO plans before an S-1 due to gun-jumping risk. Forecaster 3 adds the claim of a very recent, very large private round at a higher valuation; if accurate, that substantially lowers near-term need for public capital and strengthens the status quo argument. I can’t fully verify that claim here, but even the possibility of ample fresh private funding nudges the probability down. Both analyses align with my initial view that the main practical path to a Yes is a public S-1 in June, which remains possible but unlikely without any visible smoke (bank mandates, audit timing leaks, media reports).",
    "rationale": "My base case remains that Anthropic stays private through July 1, with the only realistic Yes trigger being a public S-1 filed in late May/June. The News-page announcement route is unlikely given regulatory caution, and SPAC/de-SPAC paths wouldn’t meet the stated resolution. The short ~6.5-week window, lack of credible leaks about IPO preparations, and the availability of substantial private capital (including potential recent raises) all point to low odds. I’m nudging my forecast down modestly to reflect Forecaster 2’s emphasis on the specificity of the resolution criteria and the absence of signals, and Forecaster 3’s argument that fresh private capital would defer public-market timing. I would update upward only on credible reporting of an imminent public S-1 (not just a confidential filing) or clear bank/advisor engagement with dates; I would move down further if a new private round closes or executives explicitly signal no near-term IPO. Change from 12% to 9% reflects these considerations.",
