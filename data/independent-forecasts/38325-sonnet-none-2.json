    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Approximately 3-4 weeks. The BEA typically releases the third estimate of GDP about 3 months after the quarter ends. Since Q1 2025 ended on March 31, the third estimate should be released around late June 2025.",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No - the third estimate continues to show negative GDP growth. The advance estimate reported -0.3% annualized real GDP growth for Q1 2025, and absent significant data revisions, the third estimate would likely remain in negative territory.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "The third estimate confirms or further revises downward the initial reading, showing annualized real GDP growth at or below 0.0%. Additional data incorporated into later estimates reveals that initial weakness in economic activity was accurately captured or even understated in the advance estimate. Consumer spending, business investment, or trade data confirm the contractionary quarter.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "The third estimate revises Q1 2025 real GDP growth upward by at least 0.31 percentage points to positive territory. More complete data on consumer spending, business inventories, or net exports reveals stronger economic activity than initially reported. The advance estimate's preliminary figures systematically underestimated growth in key components, leading to a revision from -0.3% to positive growth.",
    "rationale": "The advance estimate showed a small contraction of -0.3%, which represents a relatively modest negative reading. GDP estimates undergo revisions as more complete source data becomes available, and these revisions can be substantial. However, several factors inform my forecast:\n\nSupporting a higher probability: (1) The magnitude of contraction is small, requiring only a 0.31+ percentage point upward revision to reach positive territory; (2) Advance estimates are based on incomplete data and are subject to revision; (3) Historical precedent shows GDP estimates can swing from negative to positive territory between releases.\n\nSupporting a lower probability: (1) Status quo bias - absent specific evidence of systematic underestimation, the initial reading should be weighted heavily; (2) The advance estimate already incorporated substantial economic data, making large revisions less likely; (3) No information from the research assistant suggests known biases or data issues that would predict upward revision; (4) While revisions happen, they don't systematically favor one direction.\n\nMy forecast would increase if: Evidence emerges of data collection issues in key sectors that likely understated growth, or if the second estimate (due in late May) shows significant upward revision. My forecast would decrease if: The second estimate confirms or lowers the initial reading, or if additional economic indicators for Q1 released since April support the contraction narrative.\n\nBalancing these factors with appropriate weight on the status quo, I estimate a 40% probability of a positive third estimate.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill the third estimate of Q1 2025 annualized real GDP growth show an increase?\n\nQuestion background:\nAdvisor Perspectives: [Q1 GDP Advance Estimate: Real GDP at -0.3%, Lower Than Expected](https://www.advisorperspectives.com/dshort/updates/2025/04/30/gdp-gross-domestic-product-q1-2025-advance-estimate)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if the Bureau of Economic Analysis' Gross Domestic Product, 1st Quarter 2025 (Third Estimate) release shows that real gross domestic product (GDP) increased at an annual rate greater than 0.0%.

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
