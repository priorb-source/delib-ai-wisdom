  "information": "On May 21, 2025, Kneecap member Liam Óg Ó hAnnaidh (also known as Mo Chara) was charged with a terrorism-related offence under Section 13 of the Terrorism Act 2000. The charge relates to an allegation that he displayed a Hezbollah flag during a concert in London in November 2024. A court date at Westminster Magistrates' Court has been set for June 18, 2025, approximately one week before the Glastonbury festival is scheduled to begin. The band has publicly denied the charge, describing it as 'political policing'.\n\nThe Metropolitan Police's Counter Terrorism Command is formally investigating the band over footage from two separate events. One investigation concerns a video from a 2024 concert where a band member allegedly said, 'The only good Tory is a dead Tory. Kill your local MP.' Another investigation relates to a 2023 concert where a band member appeared to chant, 'up Hamas, up Hezbollah.' Following public backlash, the band issued an apology to the families of murdered MPs Jo Cox and Sir David Amess. Several UK politicians and government ministers have publicly called for Glastonbury to remove Kneecap from the festival's lineup.\n\nAs of late May 2025, Kneecap remains officially listed on the Glastonbury 2025 lineup for the West Holts stage, and festival organizers have not issued any public statement regarding the controversies or the recent charge. Several venues and European festivals, including the Eden Project, Plymouth Pavilions, and Germany's Hurricane and Southside festivals, have cancelled Kneecap's scheduled appearances. However, other events have proceeded; London's Wide Awake Festival confirmed the band would still perform on May 24, and the band played a surprise gig in London on May 22, the day after the terrorism charge was made public.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Approximately 5 weeks, until the Glastonbury festival concludes on June 29, 2025.",
    "status_quo_outcome": "Yes. Kneecap is currently on the official Glastonbury 2025 lineup and festival organizers have not announced a change.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Following the terrorism charge against a band member and intense political pressure, Glastonbury organizers remove Kneecap from the lineup to avoid further controversy and potential security issues.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Glastonbury's organizers resist the political pressure, citing principles of free speech and artistic expression. The band's legal issues do not prevent their performance, and they play their scheduled set.",
    "rationale": "The current status quo is that Kneecap is scheduled to perform, and it requires a positive action from the festival organizers to change this. Glastonbury has a long history of embracing counter-culture and resisting establishment pressure, which supports the likelihood they will stand by the band. However, the situation has escalated significantly beyond typical controversy. The recent terrorism-related charge against band member Liam Óg Ó hAnnaidh under the UK's Terrorism Act 2000, coupled with two ongoing police investigations and public pressure from government ministers, creates a powerful incentive for Glastonbury to cancel the performance. Several other venues and festivals have already done so, setting a precedent. The key variable is the risk tolerance of the Glastonbury organizers, who must weigh their anti-establishment ethos against potential security risks, damage to their brand, and pressure from authorities. The charge provides them with a strong, legally-grounded justification for cancellation that transcends a simple debate over offensive lyrics. While they have held firm so far, the pressure is likely to intensify as the festival nears. The upcoming court date on June 18 is a critical event; any bail conditions restricting travel could make the decision for them. My forecast is set at 40% because while the status quo favours 'Yes', the gravity of a formal terrorism charge makes a cancellation more likely than not. The forecast is not lower because of Glastonbury's unique culture of defiance and the lack of any official statement from them indicating a change of heart. The forecast is not higher because a terrorism charge is an exceptional circumstance that most major event organizers would find difficult to ignore. I would increase my forecast if Glastonbury issued a statement of support for the band, and decrease it significantly if they express they are 'reviewing' the situation or if restrictive bail conditions are imposed.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill Kneecap perform at Glastonbury 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\n[Kneecap](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kneecap_\\(band\\)) are an Irish band who have significantly risen in popularity since their formation in 2017.&#x20;\n\nThe band is a trio consisting of: \"Mo Chara\" (Liam Óg Ó hAnnaidh), \"Móglaí Bap\" (Naoise Ó Caireallain), and \"DJ Próvaí\" (J. J. Ó Dochartaigh) whose songs consist of rap in a mixture of Irish Gaelic and English giving them a unique style.\n\nNamed after a [torture technique](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kneecapping) made infamous by the Irish Republican Army, the group are no stranger to controversies. Whilst most have been minor - complaints about profanity, drug use, violence in their songs, music videos and concerts, and promotion of Irish Republicanism - the band have come under a large amount of controversy resulting in cancelled performances which initially stemmed from a Coachcella performance where the band, \"described Israel's military action in Gaza as a US-funded genocide\".&#x20;\n\nOn top of this, [two reports were made](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/cly5r4gg7l6o) to the UK Metropolitan police:\n\n> \\[...] the band allegedly call for the death of Conservative MPs. Another seems to show a band member shouting \"up Hamas, up Hezbollah\". Both groups are banned in the UK and it is a crime to express support for them.\n\n> \\[...]\n\n> They claimed that footage where they appeared to say \"the only good Tory is a dead Tory\" had been \"taken out of all context\", and apologised for the hurt caused to the families of murdered MPs Jo Cox and Sir David Amess.\n\nThe band are [due](https://www.glastonburyfestivals.co.uk/line-up/) to play at Glastonbury 2025 - the UK's largest and most prestigious music festival - however there have been [calls](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/politics/2025/04/30/kneecap-should-be-banned-full-stop-after-dead-tories-video/) for the band to be removed from the lineup.\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question will resolve as **Yes** if Kneecap officially performs at Glastonbury 2025, scheduled for June 25 to June 29, 2025.\n\n* If Glastonbury 2025 does not take place before September 1, 2025 this question will be **annulled**.\n* Officially perform is defined as a planned performance as allowed by the festival organisers.\n* Any official performance is considered sufficient for this question. If, for example, one band member is banned from the festival, the question will still resolve as **Yes** if the other member(s) perform under the name Kneecap.\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nOn May 21, 2025, Kneecap member Liam Óg Ó hAnnaidh (also known as Mo Chara) was charged with a terrorism-related offence under Section 13 of the Terrorism Act 2000.
