  "information": "According to data from Drought.gov on May 29, 2025, 14.5 million Florida residents, representing 73.9% of the state's population, were in drought-affected areas. Reports from late April 2025 indicated that 84% of the state was classified under moderate to extreme drought conditions, a severity level not seen since April 2012. The state has recorded its 12th driest April-to-March period since 1895, and some regions are 6-10 inches below their average rainfall since mid-October 2024.\n\nThe drought has caused significant ecological and public safety consequences. The Everglades is experiencing its worst drought in 13 years, causing some areas to dry up completely, which has led to the suspension of tourism activities like airboat tours. As of early May 2025, elevated fire risk resulted in over 100 active wildfires burning more than 3,600 acres of vegetation. In response to the dry conditions, at least 21 counties have issued burn bans.\n\nThe forecast period coincides with the start of Florida's typical rainy season on June 1, which is also the official start of the Atlantic hurricane season. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) has forecast a 60% chance of an above-average 2025 hurricane season, with 13-19 named tropical storms expected. This is attributed to factors like warmer ocean temperatures and low wind shear. However, a separate NOAA forecast from March 2025 also predicted that drought conditions in South Florida would likely persist from April through June.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "One month.",
    "status_quo_outcome": "Yes. As of May 29, 2025, 14.5 million residents are in drought conditions, which is above the 14.0 million threshold.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "The onset of Florida's rainy season in June is particularly strong and early. A series of widespread, heavy thunderstorms or an early-season tropical system brings significant rainfall to populated areas, reducing the number of residents in drought to below 14.0 million by the resolution date.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "The rainy season in June has a slow or average start. Rainfall is not sufficient to overcome the significant precipitation deficits from previous months. While some improvement may occur, the total number of residents in drought remains above the 14.0 million threshold on June 28, 2025.",
    "rationale": "My forecast is based on the high starting point and the short timeframe, balanced against the seasonal shift to Florida's wet season. The status quo is a powerful indicator; as of May 29, 2025, 14.5 million Floridians are in drought, 500,000 above the resolution threshold. Given that this is the result of a historically dry period with rainfall deficits of 6-10 inches in some areas, one month is a very short period to expect a full reversal. A NOAA forecast from March also predicted drought conditions would persist through June, adding weight to the 'Yes' scenario. The primary factor driving a potential 'No' outcome is that the resolution date falls one month into Florida's rainy and hurricane season. An above-average hurricane season is predicted, and a single, well-placed early tropical system could dramatically alleviate drought conditions. However, relying on such a specific event within a one-month window is speculative. It is more probable that an average onset of the rainy season will only begin to chip away at the large deficit, but not enough to drop the affected population below 14.0 million. My probability is not higher because the seasonal shift to a much wetter climate pattern is a certainty, making significant improvement plausible. It is not lower because the current drought severity and the 500,000-resident buffer make the 'Yes' outcome a resilient status quo over the short term. I would increase my probability if the first few weeks of June are drier than average. I would decrease it significantly if a tropical storm is forecast to impact the state.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill Florida have 14.0 million or more residents living in drought on June 28, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nUSA Today: [14 million Florida residents are under drought conditions, some extreme: What to know](https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2025/04/28/florida-drought-conditions-what-to-know/83328368007/)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if Drought Monitor at [this link](https://www.drought.gov/states/florida) lists greater than or equal to 14.0 million Florida residents in areas of drought, when the link is accessed by Metaculus on or after June 28, 2025. If the number is below that, this question resolves as **No**.\n\nThe question will resolve as soon as the page is accessed by Metaculus Admins on the resolution date. However, if there are issues accessing the page, then resolution will wait up until the end of the tournament's scoring at which point if Metaculus has still not been able to access the resolution source, this question will be **annulled**.\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nAccording to data from Drought.gov on May 29, 2025, 14.5 million Florida residents, representing 73.9% of the state's population, were in drought-affected areas.

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
