    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Approximately 55 days until July 1, 2025",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No - the recall remains in Active status past the July 1 deadline",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "The recall remains Active because Cargill has not completed all required corrective actions, product recovery verification, or FSIS has not finished its investigation and validation process by July 1, 2025. The complexity of tracking distributed product or implementing facility changes extends the timeline.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Cargill successfully completes all corrective actions including facility cleaning modifications, implements preventive controls, recovers all affected product, passes FSIS verification inspections, and FSIS administratively closes the recall before July 1, 2025.",
    "rationale": "The recall was issued on March 28, 2025, giving approximately 95 days total until the July 1 deadline. About 40 days have elapsed, leaving 55 days remaining. USDA/FSIS recall closures typically require completion of multiple steps: investigation, corrective actions, product recovery verification, facility re-inspection, and administrative closure. While cleaning solution contamination is relatively straightforward compared to pathogen contamination, recall timelines are highly variable. Historical data suggests many recalls extend beyond 3 months, particularly when verification of widespread product recovery is needed. The lack of information about current progress, product distribution scope, or corrective action status suggests applying a status quo bias - recalls tend to remain open longer than initially expected. The ~3-month window is plausible for streamlined recalls but represents a moderately aggressive timeline. Without evidence of rapid progress or indication the recall is nearing closure, I weight toward the status quo (remaining Active). My forecast would increase with evidence of: limited distribution scope, advanced corrective actions, or FSIS statements indicating imminent closure. It would decrease with evidence of: widespread distribution, complex facility modifications needed, or comparable recalls showing longer timelines. Balancing the reasonable but compressed timeframe against typical recall duration patterns yields a probability of approximately 30%.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill the USDA-posted recall by Cargill Kitchen Solutions of its liquid egg product for an unapproved substance issued March 28, 2025 be closed before July 1, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nABC News: [Liquid eggs recalled due to potential cleaning solution contamination](https://abcnews.go.com/GMA/Food/liquid-eggs-recalled-due-potential-cleaning-solution-contamination/story?id=120329600)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if the status of the recall posted by the U.S. Department of Agriculture’s Food Safety and Inspection Service (FSIS) is changed from Active to Closed on [this page](https://www.fsis.usda.gov/recalls-alerts/cargill-kitchen-solutions-recalls-liquid-egg-products-due-unapproved-substance) before July 1, 2025. If the recall is still shown as Active when the link is accessed by Metaculus on or after July 1, 2025, this question resolves as **No**.\n\n\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nNo additional information available.\n\nToday is 2025-05-07.\n\nBefore answering you think:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n(e) You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
