    "review": "Both forecasters emphasize the same core structure I used: a large 2021 Conservative baseline, rural seat advantages, and a hostile national environment. Forecaster 2 adds a useful stress on the sheer weight of Northampton town and the possibility that a big Labour sweep there could be enough to overcome the rural Conservative bank; they also flag boundary changes as a potential lever (though my priors are that 2021 LGBCE wards likely remain in place in 2025, so I’m less concerned on that point). Forecaster 3’s framing matches mine closely, including the point that even in bad cycles Conservatives often remain the largest party in mixed urban–rural unitaries.\n\nNew/valuable angles I hadn’t foregrounded: the explicit seat arithmetic risk if Northampton constitutes a very large share of the 93 seats; the possibility that Lib Dem/Green advances in rural/edge wards could deny Conservatives enough of a cushion even if Labour’s gains are concentrated in town. I find those arguments plausible and they slightly increase the chance that Conservatives fall to second, especially with Reform splitting right-of-centre votes.\n\nGiven that, I see a modest case to shade down from my prior. I’m not persuaded by the boundary-change uncertainty (likely minimal/none), and I still think opposition fragmentation keeps Conservatives competitive for largest-party status. But the Northampton seat-weight point warrants a small downward update.",
    "rationale": "Baseline remains: Conservatives start from a large 2021 majority and enjoy structural advantages across South Northants and Daventry. National polling and 2024 GE results imply strong Labour performance in Northampton town; Reform plus Lib Dem/Green presence raises the risk of right-of-centre vote splits in both urban and some rural/edge wards. Multi-member wards can produce sweeps where Labour leads convincingly, potentially flipping many Northampton seats.\n\nKey judgment calls: I expect Conservatives to lose significant ground and likely lose overall control. Whether they still finish as largest hinges on (1) how dominant Labour is across Northampton’s multi-member wards and (2) how many rural/edge wards the Conservatives can still sweep or split. With no evidence of boundary changes and assuming typical opposition fragmentation outside the town, I still see Conservatives as narrowly more likely than not to remain the largest group—but with less confidence than my initial 60% after considering the concentration risk in Northampton highlighted by Forecaster 2.\n\nNet: Small downward adjustment reflecting the credible path to Labour plurality via town dominance plus some rural leakage, partially offset by Conservative rural resilience and opposition fragmentation.",
