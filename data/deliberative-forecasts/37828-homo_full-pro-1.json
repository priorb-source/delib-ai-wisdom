    "review": "The other two forecasters and I are in strong agreement on the core drivers of this question. We all identified the same three crucial pieces of evidence pointing towards a 'No' outcome: 1) CEO Parker Conrad's direct and very recent statements disavowing any imminent IPO plans, 2) the massive $450 million Series G funding round in May 2025, which removes near-term capital needs, and 3) the commitment to secondary liquidity programs, which alleviates pressure from employees and early investors. Forecaster 2's emphasis on the practical, time-consuming nature of preparing an S-1 filing was a convincing point that further strengthens the case against a surprise announcement in such a short window. I found their reasoning highly compelling and aligned with my own.",
    "rationale": "After reviewing the analyses of my peers, my confidence in a 'No' outcome has increased. The deliberation process strongly reinforced my initial reasoning. The combination of direct CEO statements against an IPO, a recent major private funding round, and the provision of alternative liquidity mechanisms creates a powerful and consistent narrative. My peers' analyses did not introduce any significant counter-evidence; instead, they reinforced the strength of the existing arguments. I initially set my forecast at 5% to account for the small possibility of strategic misdirection by the CEO or a sudden change in market conditions. However, the other forecasters' reasoning, particularly the point about the logistical hurdles of a rapid S-1 filing, convinces me that this tail risk is even smaller than I first estimated. The alignment between the company's words and its recent actions is simply too strong to ignore. Therefore, I am making a small downward adjustment to my forecast to reflect this increased conviction.",
