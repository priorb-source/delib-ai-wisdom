  "information": "Student-led protests demanding the immediate dissolution of parliament and early elections have been ongoing in Serbia for over six months, originating from a tragic canopy collapse in Novi Sad in November 2024. Protestors threatened to escalate their actions if their demands were not met by mid-May. A survey conducted by the CRTA research center indicated that 59% of Serbian citizens support the students' actions. However, reports also suggest that the momentum of the protests has been waning and the political opposition remains fragmented.\n\nIn response to protests, government officials have maintained that there is no need for early elections. Vice-Premier Ivica Dačić stated that the ruling coalition has a 'stable majority' in parliament. Following the Prime Minister's resignation in January 2025, President Aleksandar Vučić announced that a decision would be made within ten days on whether to form a new government or hold elections. More recently, a May 14, 2025 article quoted Vučić saying the party would again decide 'within ten days' whether to form another new cabinet or go to the polls.\n\nFollowing the Prime Minister's resignation in January 2025, a constitutional deadline was triggered, requiring the formation of a new government to avoid a mandatory snap election. According to multiple wire-service reports from March and April 2025, a new government successfully won a confidence vote in the Serbian parliament in mid-April. This event removed the automatic, constitutionally-mandated trigger for snap elections before the summer.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "About 46 days (until July 1, 2025)",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No announcement is made; the recently formed government continues without calling snap elections.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "With a new cabinet confirmed in mid-April and a stated stable parliamentary majority, the government rides out waning protests and reiterates there is no need for early elections. No formal decree setting an election date is issued before July 1.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Facing a surge in protests, an internal coalition rift, or a tactical calculation to consolidate power, President Vučić/the government dissolves parliament and formally announces an election date for late summer or early autumn before July 1.",
    "rationale": "- Time horizon: There are roughly six weeks for an announcement, which is feasible procedurally but short politically given a new government just secured confidence in mid-April.\n- Status quo: Multiple reports indicate the constitutional trigger for snap elections was removed when a new government won a confidence vote in mid-April. Officials claim a stable majority and have publicly said early elections aren’t needed. Protest momentum appears to be waning and the opposition is fragmented. This favors no announcement by July 1.\n- Reasons for some upside risk: President Vučić has a track record of using early elections tactically, and he has kept the option rhetorically open (e.g., saying a decision would come “within ten days”). Public support for the student protests is nontrivial (CRTA: 59%), so a sharp resurgence of unrest, a scandal, or advantageous polling could prompt an early call with an autumn election date announced in late May or June.\n- Why not higher: A newly formed cabinet usually seeks to govern for a period before returning to the polls; calling snap elections weeks after a confidence vote would be unusual and risks appearing reactive. Official messaging emphasizes stability.\n- Why not lower: Vučić’s past willingness to trigger early elections, fluid domestic politics, and the short, but still sufficient, time window make a sudden announcement plausible.\n- What would move me up: Clear signs of renewed, large, sustained protests; coalition fractures; credible polling showing a strong ruling-party advantage now versus later; EU/diplomatic pressure creating an incentive to refresh the mandate quickly.\n- What would move me down: Continued de-escalation of protests; cohesive government agenda rollout; repeated categorical statements ruling out early elections from key actors; scheduling or political constraints signaling preference for a later timeline.\n\nResearch assistant highlights used: months-long protests with some public support but waning momentum; government statements against early elections; PM resignation in January followed by a new cabinet winning a confidence vote in mid-April, removing the automatic snap-election trigger; Vučić’s ongoing hints about a decision timeline.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill Serbia announce a general election before July 1, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\n[Serbia could face snap elections as PM’s resignation confirmed](https://tvpworld.com/85681783/serbia-could-face-snap-elections-as-pms-resignation-confirmed-)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if, before July 1, 2025, a specific date on which a general election will be held is officially announced by the government of Serbia or any of its agencies that have the authority to do so. If no such announcement occurs before July 1, 2025, this question resolves as **No**.\n\nThe election does not have to be held before July 1, 2025; this question resolves based on an announcement.\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nStudent-led protests demanding the immediate dissolution of parliament and early elections have been ongoing in Serbia for over six months, originating from a tragic canopy collapse in Novi Sad in November 2024.

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
