    "review": "Forecaster 2 provides a compelling, data-driven case for a 'No' outcome. The use of multiple, independent, and consistent real-time indicators (port data, new orders, shipping analytics) showing catastrophic drops of 30-64% is overwhelming evidence that I had not previously considered. This quantifies the likely magnitude of the post-tariff-surge drop, which my initial analysis only framed qualitatively. Forecaster 3 introduces crucial counterpoints regarding trade diversion to Mexico and the strength of services imports. While these are valid and important offsetting factors, their likely scale seems insufficient to counteract the massive decline in goods imports suggested by Forecaster 2's data. Forecaster 2's point that Census data is measured at customs value, thus not artificially inflated by the tariffs themselves, is also a key technical clarification that reinforces the pessimistic outlook.",
    "rationale": "I am significantly updating my forecast downward based on the new evidence presented, primarily by Forecaster 2. My initial forecast of 25% was based on the economic principle that a massive, tariff-induced pull-forward of imports in March would lead to a subsequent drop in April. Forecaster 2's analysis provides a wealth of high-frequency data that strongly supports this hypothesis and indicates the drop is not minor, but rather a severe contraction in the range of 30-40%. If these real-time indicators are even remotely accurate, April's import value would fall to the $200-240 billion range, making the $338.5 billion threshold for a 'Yes' outcome exceedingly unlikely. While Forecaster 3 correctly identifies offsetting factors like robust services imports and trade diversion to Mexico, these are unlikely to be large enough to fill a potential $100 billion gap in goods imports. Therefore, I am lowering my forecast from 25% to 15%. This 10-point decrease reflects the shift from a theory-based expectation of a decline to a data-backed expectation of a very large decline. The remaining 15% chance accounts for the possibility that the real-time indicators are systematically flawed or that the offsetting factors are unexpectedly strong.",
