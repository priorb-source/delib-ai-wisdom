    "status_quo_outcome": "No",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "He remains outside the U.S. while legal appeals, congressional inquiries, or humanitarian parole requests (if any) proceed too slowly to allow reentry before July 1, 2025; or no formal effort materializes. No credible reporting emerges of him entering U.S. territory.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "DHS grants humanitarian parole or reverses an error and facilitates his return; a federal court orders DHS to allow reentry pending review; a high-profile congressional intervention leads to expedited parole-in-place; or he reenters irregularly and is apprehended, with credible media or official sources confirming his presence in U.S. territory within the window.",
    "rationale": "Time is short and, absent concrete signals of an imminent return, the base rate for a recently deported individual to lawfully reenter within a two-month window is low. Reversals of deportations or expedited humanitarian parole do occur but are uncommon and typically take longer than several weeks unless there is extraordinary political, legal, or administrative pressure. Credible public reporting would likely accompany any swift reversal, and none is cited here. While the existence of a dedicated Wikipedia page suggests public attention, that alone does not imply fast-tracked reentry. A Yes outcome could still occur via: (1) DHS-approved parole following advocacy or recognition of error; (2) a court order compelling facilitation of return; or (3) irregular reentry followed by arrest and public confirmation. However, each is a low-probability pathway over a ~2‑month horizon. The research assistant provided no additional information, which I interpret as the absence of indications of imminent return. Why not higher: Quick, documented returns post-deportation are rare, legal processes are slow, and we lack signals (court docket activity, DHS statements, congressional letters, or credible media reports) pointing to imminent entry. Why not lower: The case appears notable enough to have public attention, which modestly increases the chance of advocacy-induced parole or a court-ordered remedy; irregular reentry and subsequent reporting, while unlikely, is possible. Upward updates: credible reports of a court stay/order addressing his case, DHS or CBP indicating parole or reconsideration, congressional intervention with timelines, or travel/port-of-entry details. Downward updates: official statements rejecting relief, indications that no legal actions are pending, or simple passage of time without new signals.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill Kilmar Abrego Garcia return to the United States before July 1, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nWikipedia: [Deportation of Kilmar Abrego Garcia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deportation_of_Kilmar_Abrego_Garcia)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if Kilmar Abrego Garcia after the launch of this question and before July 1, 2025 enters territory of the United States according to [credible sources](https://www.metaculus.com/help/faq/#definitions).\n\nSubsequently leaving the United States, such as a deportation, will not cause this question to re-resolve.\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nNo additional information available.\n\nToday is 2025-05-01.\n\nBefore answering you think:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n(e) You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
