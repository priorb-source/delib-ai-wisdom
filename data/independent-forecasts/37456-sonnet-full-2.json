  "information": "On March 28, 2025, Cargill Kitchen Solutions recalled approximately 212,268 pounds of liquid egg products, including items under the Egg Beaters and Bob Evans brands. The recall was due to potential contamination with sodium hypochlorite, a cleaning solution. The affected products were produced on March 12 and 13, 2025, have 'use by' dates in August 2025 and March 2026, and bear the establishment number 'G1804' on the carton. The products were shipped to distributors in Ohio and Texas and for foodservice use in at least six other states, with potential for nationwide distribution.\n\nThe U.S. Department of Agriculture’s Food Safety and Inspection Service (FSIS) has designated this a Class III recall. This classification is used when the use of or exposure to a violative product is not likely to cause adverse health consequences. No adverse health effects or illnesses have been reported in connection with the consumption of these products. Cargill stated the recall was issued 'out of an abundance of caution.'\n\nHistorical data on FSIS recalls shows that resolution times vary based on classification and complexity. Class I (high-risk) recalls typically close in 2-4 months. Class III recalls often close within 1-3 months, with a median time of approximately 90 days. However, recalls that span multiple states, involve large product volumes, or are distributed through institutional foodservice channels frequently take longer to resolve. The extended shelf life of some of the recalled products, until March 2026, is another factor that can complicate and lengthen the verification process.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "55 days remain until July 1, 2025. The recall was issued 40 days ago on March 28, 2025.",
    "status_quo_outcome": "The recall remains Active. Based on the fact that 40 days have elapsed without closure and typical Class III recall timelines, the status quo trajectory suggests the recall will likely still be Active on July 1, 2025.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "The recall verification process takes longer than expected due to the complexity of tracking products through multiple state foodservice channels, the large volume of product (212,268 pounds), and the extended shelf life (some products until March 2026). FSIS requires confirmation that all affected products have been recovered or accounted for before closing the recall. By July 1, while substantial progress has been made, the recall status remains Active as final verification steps continue.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "As a Class III recall with no reported illnesses, clear contamination source, and products issued 'out of abundance of caution,' the verification process proceeds efficiently. Cargill's cooperation and the trackable nature of the products (bearing establishment number G1804 and specific use-by dates) enables swift recovery. By mid-to-late June, FSIS confirms sufficient product recovery and accountability, changing the status to Closed before July 1.",
    "rationale": "This forecast weighs several competing factors. The historical median closure time for Class III recalls is approximately 90 days, which would place closure around June 26, 2025—just 5 days before the July 1 deadline. This provides a narrow window. Favoring earlier closure: this is a Class III (lowest risk) recall with no illnesses, a clear contamination cause, and was issued proactively. These factors typically accelerate resolution. Against earlier closure: we're already 40 days into the recall with no indication of imminent closure, suggesting we're not in the fast-resolution category. Additionally, the recall involves multi-state distribution (8+ states), foodservice channels (harder to track than retail), large volume (212,268 pounds), and products with shelf life extending to March 2026, all of which complicate verification. The fact that 40 days have passed without closure is a meaningful signal—if this were tracking toward a 30-45 day closure, we'd likely see movement by now. This suggests we're probably in the 60-120 day range rather than the faster end. With 95 days total until the deadline and already 40 days elapsed, we have 55 days remaining. The question is whether the recall will close in the next 55 days. Given the 90-day median but accounting for complicating factors and the already-elapsed 40 days without closure, I estimate roughly 40% probability of closure before July 1. This forecast would increase if: FSIS announces substantial progress in product recovery, Cargill reports high percentage of product accounted for, or precedents emerge of similar recalls closing faster. It would decrease if: no progress updates emerge by late May, additional complications arise, or the verification process proves more complex than initially assessed.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill the USDA-posted recall by Cargill Kitchen Solutions of its liquid egg product for an unapproved substance issued March 28, 2025 be closed before July 1, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nABC News: [Liquid eggs recalled due to potential cleaning solution contamination](https://abcnews.go.com/GMA/Food/liquid-eggs-recalled-due-potential-cleaning-solution-contamination/story?id=120329600)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below.

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
