    "review": "Both forecasters arrived at very similar conclusions (80% and 82%), which validates my initial assessment. Forecaster 3's quantitative base-effect analysis is valuable - explicitly calculating that May 2025 would need approximately a 0.5-1.5% month-over-month decline to reach YoY ≤ 0% depending on May 2024's level. This is more concrete than my general reasoning. The observation that normal IP volatility includes -0.5% to -1.0% monthly swings is important and somewhat concerning, as it suggests such declines aren't rare events. However, both forecasters agree that current hard data proxies (rail, electricity, stable manufacturing hours) don't indicate such a contraction is occurring in May. Forecaster 2's emphasis on the 'substantial buffer' requiring a 'significant negative shock' aligns with my view. The key insight I'm taking is that while normal volatility could theoretically threaten the outcome, the available May indicators suggest stability rather than contraction. Neither forecaster presented evidence that meaningfully changes the risk assessment - the May 2024 base uncertainty they raise is valid but speculative without data. The tight clustering of forecasts (80%, 80%, 82%) suggests we're converging on the appropriate probability range given the evidence.",
    "rationale": "After reviewing both analyses, I maintain my 80% forecast. The quantitative base-effect framework from Forecaster 3 is helpful but doesn't fundamentally alter the assessment. The key factors remain: (1) Strong positive momentum with April at +1.49% YoY providing a meaningful buffer, (2) Mixed but not alarming May forward indicators - PMIs expansionary, hard proxies stable, (3) Energy sector concentration creating vulnerability but no evidence of May energy disruptions, (4) Concerning leading indicators (LEI, PPI) that suggest medium-term weakness but are less likely to cause sharp single-month reversals. The risk of normal IP volatility (-0.5% to -1.0% monthly swings) is real, but multiple May indicators tracking close to April levels suggest we're not seeing such a decline materialize. The May 2024 base uncertainty is valid but cuts both ways without specific data. The 20% risk I assign appropriately captures: potential energy sector reversals, unfavorable base effects, normal volatility, or data revisions. I see no compelling reason to move from this forecast - the other forecasters' analyses reinforce rather than challenge this assessment.",
