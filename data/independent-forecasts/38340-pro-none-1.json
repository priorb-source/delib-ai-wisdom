    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "25 days.",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No. The ongoing civil war prevents any normal functioning of the Sudanese state, making the ratification of an international treaty impossible.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "The civil war between the Sudanese Armed Forces (SAF) and the Rapid Support Forces (RSF) continues. The de facto government lacks the stability, capacity, and political focus to complete the legislative process for ratification before the July 1, 2025 deadline.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "A sudden, comprehensive peace agreement is signed in the coming days. A transitional government of national unity is immediately formed and, in a symbolic act to signal a new era of stability and continental cooperation, an emergency decree is issued to ratify the AfCFTA agreement just before the deadline.",
    "rationale": "My forecast is overwhelmingly driven by the ongoing, devastating civil war in Sudan which began in April 2023. The status quo is one of intense conflict, state fragmentation, and humanitarian crisis. Ratifying a complex trade agreement requires a stable, functioning government with a recognized legislative body capable of debating and passing such an instrument. Sudan currently possesses no such institution. The country is split between warring factions, and what remains of the state apparatus is focused solely on the war effort and maintaining survival. The timeline is also critically short; with less than one month until the deadline, the political and security transformations required for a 'Yes' outcome are virtually impossible to achieve. While there was some pre-war momentum towards developing an AfCFTA implementation strategy, the conflict has rendered that work obsolete for the time being. The focus of the international community and any functioning parts of the Sudanese administration is on conflict resolution and humanitarian aid, not trade policy.\n\nMy probability is not lower than 1% simply to account for highly improbable 'black swan' events, such as one faction attempting a symbolic ratification to gain international legitimacy, though the legal validity of such an act would be highly questionable. My probability is not higher because of the complete paralysis of normal governance. For me to increase my forecast, I would need to see credible evidence of an immediate, nationwide ceasefire followed by the rapid formation of a unified, internationally recognized government.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill Sudan ratify AfCFTA (the pan-African free trade agreement) before July 1, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\n[Draft National AfCFTA Implementation Strategy for Sudan Reviewed and Validated by Stakeholders](https://igad.int/draft-national-afcfta-implementation-strategy-for-sudan-reviewed-and-validated-by-stakeholders/)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if Sudan ratifies the African Continental Free Trade Area (AfCFTA) Agreement before July 1, 2025.\n\n\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nNo additional information available.\n\nToday is 2025-06-06.\n\nBefore answering you think:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n(e) You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
