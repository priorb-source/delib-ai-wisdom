    "review": "Both other forecasters arrived at the same 15% probability, and their reasoning is nearly identical to my own. The unanimous consensus centers on a few key factors: the very short timeline of approximately six weeks, the strict resolution criteria requiring a formal action like a signed Executive Order, and the historical precedent showing such reorganizations take significantly longer (a minimum of 2-6 months). Neither forecaster introduced new evidence or a line of reasoning that I had not considered. This strong agreement among independent analysts significantly increases my confidence in my initial assessment and rationale. There is no new information or compelling argument that would warrant a change in my forecast.",
    "rationale": "After reviewing the analyses of my fellow forecasters, I am maintaining my forecast. My reasoning is reinforced by the consensus view. The primary factor against a 'Yes' resolution remains the compressed timeline. We have only 1.5 months until the July 1 deadline, whereas a formal executive reorganization of a federal agency historically takes a minimum of two to six months to proceed from concept to a signed order. A legislative path is even less likely to meet the deadline. The resolution criteria are explicit: the tracker status must change to 'complete', which its moderators only do upon a formal, final action such as a signed executive order or an enacted statute. The recent actions against NOAA—discontinuing the disasters database and proposing budget cuts—are significant indicators of intent and are consistent with the current 'In progress' status, but they do not satisfy the resolution criteria for 'complete'. The consensus strengthens the view that these are preparatory steps, not the final act. I will therefore not update my forecast.",
