  "information": "The Pan American Health Organization (PAHO) issued an epidemiological alert in early April 2025 due to an increase in yellow fever cases in the Americas. In the first three months of 2025, 131 human cases and 53 deaths were confirmed in the region, primarily in Brazil, Colombia, and Peru. This case count is more than double the total for all of 2024. Separately, the United Nations has warned that global aid funding cuts are disrupting child vaccination programs at a level similar to the COVID-19 pandemic, contributing to a rise in yellow fever cases after years of decline.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Approximately 5 weeks",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "The current yellow fever outbreaks in South America are contained or do not spread to North American countries before the resolution date. Any isolated, imported cases in North America are quickly identified and do not lead to sustained local transmission sufficient to warrant a new CDC travel advisory.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "The severe outbreak in South America spreads to a neighboring North American country, most likely in Central America or the Caribbean (e.g., Panama, Trinidad & Tobago). A cluster of locally transmitted cases is confirmed, prompting the CDC to issue a Travel Health Notice for that country before June 1, 2025.",
    "rationale": "My forecast is heavily weighted towards the status quo. Currently, no North American country is listed on the CDC's Travel Health Notices page for yellow fever. For the outcome to be 'Yes,' a series of events must occur within a very short five-week timeframe: the virus must be introduced into a North American country, establish local transmission via mosquito vectors, be detected by public health officials, and result in the CDC issuing a formal notice. While the PAHO alert about a significant increase in cases in nearby South America and the warning about disruptions to vaccination programs are concerning and elevate the baseline risk, this chain of events is unlikely to conclude within five weeks. The primary barriers are the short timeline and the fact that public health surveillance, while imperfect, is designed to prevent such rapid escalations. My probability is not lower because the ongoing outbreak in South America is described as severe, more than doubling the prior year's cases in just three months. This significantly increases the chance of exportation to a neighboring country with a suitable climate and mosquito population. My probability is not higher because of the high bar for a new travel advisory to be issued in such a limited timeframe. I would increase my forecast if there were confirmed reports of local yellow fever transmission in any Central American or Caribbean nation. I would decrease it if PAHO reported that the South American outbreaks were being successfully contained.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill any North American country be listed as having a CDC yellow fever travel advisory on June 1, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\n[PAHO issues new epidemiological alert amid rising yellow fever cases in the Americas](https://www.paho.org/en/news/31-3-2025-paho-issues-new-epidemiological-alert-amid-rising-yellow-fever-cases-americas)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if a country in North America is listed as having a travel advisory by the Centers for Disease Control at its [Travel Health Notices](https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/travel/notices) page when checked by Metaculus on or after June 1, 2025.\n\n\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nThe Pan American Health Organization (PAHO) issued an epidemiological alert in early April 2025 due to an increase in yellow fever cases in the Americas. In the first three months of 2025, 131 human cases and 53 deaths were confirmed in the region, primarily in Brazil, Colombia, and Peru. This case count is more than double the total for all of 2024.

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
