    "review": "The deliberation reveals a strong consensus, with all three forecasters independently arriving at a 25% probability. This convergence strengthens confidence in the initial assessment. The other two analyses effectively sharpened the core arguments without introducing fundamentally new evidence. Forecaster 2's point about regional precedents (e.g., Uganda, Burundi) suggesting a potentially 'low threshold' for upgrades is a compelling argument for why the probability is not lower. Conversely, Forecaster 3 provided an excellent counterpoint, arguing convincingly that the existing risks (terrorism, crime) are already 'priced into' the current Level 2 advisory, and that a higher, 'qualitative shift' in the threat landscape would be required for an upgrade. This supports the argument for why the probability is not higher. Their reasoning was sound, well-structured, and confirmed the central tension between bureaucratic inertia and tangible security risks.",
    "rationale": "My forecast remains unchanged at 25%. The deliberation process with my fellow forecasters has reinforced my initial analysis. We are in strong agreement on the primary factors at play: the significant bureaucratic inertia of State Department advisories, especially over a short two-month timeframe, versus the credible and ongoing security threats. The other forecasters' arguments have clarified the balance of these factors. The fact that known risks like the Mozambique insurgency spillover and coastal security concerns are already cited in the current Level 2 advisory (as Forecaster 3 noted) establishes a high bar for an upgrade. The State Department has already acknowledged these risks and has so far deemed a country-wide Level 3 unnecessary, preferring a targeted warning for the Mtwara region. However, as Forecaster 2 argued, the regional context, with recent upgrades for neighboring countries on similar grounds, shows that such a change is entirely plausible if a triggering event occurs. A single significant terrorist incident or a major cross-border incursion could easily meet the threshold for a change. Therefore, while the status quo is the most likely outcome, the combination of proximate threats and regional volatility creates a substantial minority chance of a 'Yes' resolution. The consensus at 25% accurately reflects this balance.",
