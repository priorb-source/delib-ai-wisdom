    "no_outcome_scenario": "Circle’s IPO is delayed into July or later due to SEC review, market conditions, or company choice; or Circle lists on Nasdaq instead of NYSE; or the deal is postponed/withdrawn.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Circle completes its roadshow, receives SEC effectiveness, prices the deal, and begins trading on the NYSE in late May or June (e.g., under a planned ticker such as CRCL).",
    "rationale": "- Signals: The Forbes piece (Apr 4, 2025) framing a Circle IPO as defining for 2025 suggests an active, near-term process rather than a distant plan. Circle had previously filed for an IPO and has the scale and regulatory posture to be a credible Q2 candidate. That supports a relatively high base chance of a listing before July. \n- Exchange specificity: The resolution requires NYSE specifically. If Circle were to choose Nasdaq, the outcome is No even if it lists before July. Public reporting around crypto/fintech listings is mixed (Coinbase chose Nasdaq; some fintechs choose NYSE). However, the prompt’s explicit NYSE reference likely mirrors Circle’s stated intent in offering documents, which reduces (but does not eliminate) exchange risk. \n- Timing window: With roughly seven weeks left, a company already in the IPO pipeline can complete SEC review, run a 1–2 week roadshow, and price. The IPO window in Q2 2025 appears open enough for high-profile names, but macro or regulatory shocks could slip timing into July or beyond. \n- Status quo weight: Right now, shares are not trading on NYSE; if nothing changes, the default is No. I temper optimism with common risks: regulatory scrutiny of stablecoins, market volatility, and the possibility of last-minute delays or a different exchange choice. \n- Why not higher: Short runway, exchange-specific criterion, and crypto/regulatory risks that could delay/redirect the listing. \n- Why not lower: Strong signaling (Forbes coverage) that the IPO is live, Circle’s maturity and prior filings, and a still-open Q2 IPO window. \n- Updates: I’d move up (to 80–90%) on news of an announced roadshow date, NYSE-confirmed ticker reservation/listing date, or SEC effectiveness. I’d move down (to 25–35%) on reports of delay, adverse SEC feedback, market-wide IPO pullbacks, or confirmation of a Nasdaq listing.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill Circle be publicly-traded before July 1, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nForbes: [The Circle IPO Solidifies 2025 As The Year Of Stablecoins](https://www.forbes.com/sites/digital-assets/2025/04/04/the-circle-ipo-solidifies-2025-as-the-year-of-stablecoin/)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if shares of Circle Internet Group, Inc. are publicly traded on New York Stock Exchange (the \"NYSE\") before July 1, 2025.\n\n\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nNo additional information available.\n\nToday is 2025-05-14.\n\nBefore answering you think:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n(e) You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
