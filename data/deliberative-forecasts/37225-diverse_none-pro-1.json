    "review": "The two other forecasters arrived at the same 60% probability, indicating a strong consensus. Their reasoning aligns closely with my initial analysis, focusing on the central tension between the incumbent VHP's unpopular but necessary economic policies and the structural weaknesses of the main opposition NDP, particularly the legal status of its leader, Dési Bouterse. Forecaster 2 helpfully emphasized the importance of status quo bias so close to the election. Forecaster 3 provided the most valuable new insights, adding crucial structural context about Suriname's electoral system—specifically the role of multi-member districts and malapportionment—which benefits parties with geographically concentrated support like the incumbent VHP. They also articulated a more concrete scenario for a 'No' outcome through potential tactical alliances between opposition parties like the NDP and ABOP. Their analysis was highly convincing and added depth to the shared conclusion.",
    "rationale": "After reviewing the other analyses, I am maintaining my forecast of 60%. The deliberation did not introduce evidence that fundamentally alters the core dynamics of the race, but it did sharpen the reasoning and increase my confidence in the existing forecast. Forecaster 3's points about the electoral system's structure add a significant tailwind to the 'Yes' scenario; this system makes it harder for a fragmented opposition to translate a general anti-incumbent mood into a plurality of seats, reinforcing the VHP's advantage as the largest party. However, this is counterbalanced by their clear articulation of the primary risk: tactical coordination between opposition parties in key districts. This provides a more plausible path to a 'No' victory than mere vague discontent. These two new considerations, one strengthening the 'Yes' case and one clarifying the 'No' case, effectively cancel each other out in terms of a probability shift. Ultimately, the forecast remains a judgment call between the powerful, historically demonstrated force of voter backlash against economic austerity and the unique, significant liability the NDP carries with its current leadership. The consensus at 60% appears to be a robust assessment of this balance.",
