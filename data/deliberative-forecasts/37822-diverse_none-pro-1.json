    "review": "My initial forecast of 8% was considerably lower than the 25% and 30% from the other forecasters. We all agreed on the core facts: the short timeline, Beto O'Rourke's electoral history, his non-committal public statement, and the lack of concrete signals like staff hires or FEC filings. The primary point of divergence was the perceived base rate for a campaign announcement this early. I initially viewed it as highly unusual. Both other forecasters correctly viewed an early start as plausible, which prompted me to check campaign launch dates from the previous cycle. Forecaster 3 made a particularly sharp point that O'Rourke's high name recognition reduces his need for an early announcement, which is a strong argument for 'No'. However, the biggest impact on my thinking came from researching the precedent set by other challengers, a step I took after seeing the other forecasters' weight on the plausibility of an early launch.",
    "rationale": "My initial forecast of 8% was flawed because it was based on an incorrect premise that an announcement before July of the off-year would be highly unusual. After reviewing the other forecasts, I checked the precedent. High-profile Democratic challengers in the 2024 cycle, such as Colin Allred (for this same Texas seat), Ruben Gallego (AZ), and Adam Schiff (CA), all announced between January and May 2023. This reveals that an announcement in the current timeframe is not an outlier at all; it aligns perfectly with modern campaign timelines. This new information invalidates the core of my previous low forecast.\n\nThe other forecasters' probability range of 25-30% is therefore much better calibrated to this reality. I am substantially increasing my forecast to align more closely with theirs. However, I am updating to 20%, which is slightly below their consensus. I remain persuaded by the complete lack of public reporting on preparatory activities (staffing, exploratory committees, donor calls) that typically precede a launch. While such an announcement could still happen within the next 39 days, the absence of these leading indicators suggests it is less likely than a one-in-four chance. My updated forecast of 20% reflects the much higher base rate for an announcement in this window, while still accounting for the significant negative signal of zero pre-launch activity.",
