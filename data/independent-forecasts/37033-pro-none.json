    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "About five weeks.",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No further payment is made by the deadline.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Despite the recent reaffirmation of its commitment, the Zimbabwean government's severe fiscal constraints and bureaucratic inertia prevent it from organizing and disbursing another payment in the short timeframe before June 1, 2025. The April payment remains a one-off gesture for the time being.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "As part of ongoing negotiations with international creditors for debt relief or new financing, the Zimbabwean government makes another small, symbolic payment to demonstrate tangible progress and political will, building on the momentum of the first payment in early April.",
    "rationale": "The core of this forecast hinges on the tension between Zimbabwe's stated intent and its capacity to act within a very short timeframe. The government has strong incentives to make another payment; doing so would signal to international creditors (like the IMF and World Bank) that its commitments on debt and governance reform are credible, potentially unlocking crucial financing. The first payment in April 2025 broke years of inaction and, combined with the public reaffirmation, created momentum. However, the status quo for Zimbabwe is one of extreme financial distress and bureaucratic sluggishness. The government has a long history of making promises it cannot keep due to these constraints. The most significant factor arguing for a 'No' outcome is the short deadline of June 1, 2025. Disbursing government funds often involves a slow process, and making two separate payments within seven weeks would be uncharacteristically swift. My forecast is not lower than 35% because the first payment proves that the mechanism for payment exists and that there is high-level political will to act, likely driven by external pressure. A small, symbolic payment is not fiscally impossible if the motivation is strong enough. My forecast is not higher because the default state of affairs is inaction due to the country's dire economic situation. The April payment may have been timed to meet a specific short-term diplomatic goal, with no immediate follow-up planned. I would increase my forecast upon news of an imminent debt restructuring deal conditional on this payment. I would decrease it if reports emerged of a new domestic funding crisis or if officials described the April payment as the only one scheduled for this quarter.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill the Zimbabwe, before June 1, 2025, make another payment to white farmers whose property was seized?\n\nQuestion background:\n[Zimbabwe reaffirms commitment to land compensation to spur growth, debt sustainability](https://www.thestar.com.my/news/world/2025/04/10/zimbabwe-reaffirms-commitment-to-land-compensation-to-spur-growth-debt-sustainability)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if, according to [credible sources](https://www.metaculus.com/faq/#definitions) the government of Zimbabwe after the launch of this question and before June 1, 2025 makes an additional payment to former farmers covered under the 2020 Global Compensation Deed.\n\nOn April 9, 2025, Zimbabwe [was reported](https://nehandaradio.com/2025/04/09/zimbabwe-pays-us3-1m-to-former-white-farmers-as-part-of-land-compensation-deal/) to have made its first compensation payment, of USD $3.1 million. Additional such disbursements made after the launch of this question and before June 1, 2025 would count.\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nNo additional information available.\n\nToday is 2025-04-23.\n\nBefore answering you think:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n(e) You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
