    "review": "The other forecasters raise valuable points I had underweighted. Most significantly, Forecaster 2 notes that midterm Senate candidates typically announce 12-18 months before the November election, which means a June 2025 announcement would fall squarely within normal timing for a 2026 race. This is more specific than my general assessment and provides a concrete reason why June 1 isn't an arbitrary deadline but rather falls within a strategically sensible window. All three analyses converge on similar reasoning: exploration suggests serious intent but doesn't guarantee announcement, status quo favors No, and the timeframe is technically sufficient but not compelling. The clustering of forecasts (30%, 38%, 40%) indicates broad agreement on the fundamentals. However, I believe the other forecasters may be slightly overweighting the possibility of announcement given the complete absence of follow-up news in the 20 days since the Nebraska Examiner report. In political campaigns, exploration phases that lead to candidacy typically generate continuing signals - staff hires, donor meetings, local engagement - even before formal announcement. The silence is meaningful.",
    "rationale": "Reconsidering the evidence: The midterm timing argument is compelling - June 2025 does represent a conventional announcement window for 2026 races, which I had not adequately weighted. This increases the structural likelihood that if Osborn intends to run, June would be a logical announcement timeframe rather than pushing later into summer or fall. However, the 20-day information vacuum since the April 3 report remains significant. Political explorations that convert to candidacies typically show progressive signs of momentum - even informal ones like increased local political engagement, meetings with party officials, or continued media attention. The absence of any such signals suggests either a slow-moving process or genuine uncertainty about proceeding. The status quo bias remains strong: the current state is exploration without commitment, and maintaining that state requires no action while announcing requires a positive decision. Given the reasonable timing window identified by the other forecasters, I'm updating modestly upward from 30% to 35%, but I maintain that the probability should remain below 40% given the lack of momentum indicators and the fundamental difficulty of converting exploration to candidacy within a compressed timeframe.",
