    "review": "I've identified a critical data discrepancy that undermines my original analysis. My research assistant reported that June 2022 had 603 reports and all 2023 months exceeded 600, but Forecaster 2 claims June 2022 had 326 and June 2023 had 260. This is an enormous difference. Two independent forecasters (2 and 3) both arrived at probabilities around 32-35%, suggesting they're working with similar data showing a downward trend with recent monthly averages 'well under 300.' Their convergence on low probabilities is strong Bayesian evidence that my assistant's data may be incorrect or misinterpreted. Forecaster 3 raises important points I hadn't considered: the July 1 resolution date creates a lag bias where late-June reports may not yet be posted, and 400 is 'above what I expect for an average June' even accounting for seasonality. Forecaster 2's specific mention of the sustained downward trend since 2020 and median of last five Junes at 396 provides crucial context. The fact that both forecasters independently identified similar patterns and arrived at similar low probabilities suggests systematic evidence I'm missing.",
    "rationale": "Given the fundamental data conflict between my research assistant's report and what both other forecasters describe, I must significantly update downward. The convergence of two independent forecasters at ~33% probability, combined with their specific claims about recent low monthly totals and downward trends, suggests my original 82% was based on flawed data. However, I'm not dropping all the way to their level because: (1) my assistant did provide specific numbers that could potentially be verified, (2) there remains uncertainty about which data source is correct, (3) I should maintain some confidence in my original research while updating substantially on new evidence. The lag bias point about July 1 resolution is particularly compelling - late June reports may not count, creating a structural bias toward No. I'm settling at 38% as a significant downward update that respects the epistemic weight of two independent forecasters converging on similar conclusions while maintaining some residual confidence pending data verification.",
