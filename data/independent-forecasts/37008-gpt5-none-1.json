    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "About 9 days (until April 30, 2025, Samoa time)",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No — the current emergency declared Mar 31, 2025 was scheduled to end Apr 29, 2025, so without an extension or a new declaration, there will be no state of emergency on Apr 30.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "The government allows the March 31 emergency to expire on Apr 29 and does not issue any new proclamation or extension; power reliability is deemed manageable under normal authorities.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Before or on Apr 29, the government issues an extension of the “Energy Crisis” emergency (or declares a new one) that remains in force on Apr 30 due to continued grid instability or procurement/operational needs.",
    "rationale": "Known facts: Samoa declared a state of emergency for the power crisis on Mar 31, 2025, scheduled through Apr 29. The question asks whether a state of emergency is in effect on Apr 30. Thus, the status quo path is No unless authorities actively extend or replace the order. There is no additional information from the research assistant indicating an imminent extension or resolution.\n\nAssessment: Extensions are plausible—Samoa has previously extended emergencies (e.g., COVID), and if power supply issues persist, the government has both precedent and incentive to maintain emergency powers. However, emergency powers carry political cost; if short-term measures (fuel procurement, payment arrangements) stabilized supply, leadership will likely let the order lapse as scheduled. With nine days left and no public signal (as of Apr 21) of ongoing severe outages or an intent to extend, the base case favors expiration on Apr 29.\n\nWhy not higher: We lack evidence that the crisis remains acute enough to require emergency powers past Apr 29; an extension requires an active step by the government. The currently posted end date is the day before the target date.\n\nWhy not lower: The initial situation was serious enough to warrant an emergency; extensions in Samoa are institutionally straightforward and common when problems persist. If outages continue or procurement reforms aren’t in place, a short extension into May would be unsurprising.\n\nWhat would move me up: Credible reports this week of continuing widespread blackouts; official statements hinting at or scheduling an extension; publication of an extension order. What would move me down: Government statements that supply is stabilized and the emergency will lapse; a revocation or confirmation of no extension by Apr 28–29.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill a state of emergency be in effect in Samoa on April 30, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\n[Samoan Prime Minister declares state of emergency over power cuts](https://www.stuff.co.nz/nz-news/360634988/samoan-prime-minister-declares-state-emergency-over-power-cuts)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if, according to [credible sources](https://www.metaculus.com/faq/#definitions) Samoa is in a state of emergency that has been declared by a governmental entity with the authority to make such a declaration.\n\nFor example, the state of emergency declaration [posted](https://www.facebook.com/samoagovt/posts/hon-prime-minister-of-samoa-press-statement-proclamation-of-emergency-energy-cri/1059050259591457/) by the government of Samoa on Facebook on March 31, 2025 would count. (Note that when it was declared, it was scheduled to be in effect through April 29, 2025.)\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nNo additional information available.\n\nToday is 2025-04-21.\n\nBefore answering you think:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n(e) You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
