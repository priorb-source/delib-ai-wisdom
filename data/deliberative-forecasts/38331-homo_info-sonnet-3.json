    "review": "Both forecasters make compelling arguments that caused me to reconsider my initial assessment. Forecaster 2's emphasis on the 'double requirement' (policy change AND Wikipedia update within 26 days) is particularly valuable - I underweighted this Wikipedia update lag factor. Forecaster 3's point about the extreme longevity of some blocks (China and Iran since 2009 - 16 years) is also powerful evidence for stickiness. Both correctly emphasize that the historical pattern shows these reversals don't happen on short timescales. However, I notice both forecasters may not be fully accounting for the multiplicative risk inherent in the conjunctive structure. When you need ALL seven countries to maintain blocks, even small individual risks compound. Their forecasts of 92-93% imply individual country probabilities that seem slightly optimistic given Venezuela's historical variability and Myanmar's political fluidity, even within a short timeframe.",
    "rationale": "Upon reflection, I believe I was too conservative initially, but the other forecasters may be slightly too optimistic. Let me recalculate with updated individual probabilities informed by their arguments: China (99.7% - 16-year block, structural censorship), Iran (99.5% - 16-year block), North Korea (99.8% - essentially no public internet), Russia (98.5% - tied to ongoing geopolitical conflict), Turkmenistan (99% - one of world's most closed regimes), Myanmar (95% - junta consolidating power but still some fluidity), Venezuela (92% - most variable but short timeframe limits risk). Multiplying these: 0.997 × 0.995 × 0.998 × 0.985 × 0.99 × 0.95 × 0.92 ≈ 0.875. The other forecasters correctly identified that I underweighted the extreme difficulty of policy reversals in such a short window and the Wikipedia update lag. However, the conjunctive structure still creates meaningful compounded risk. I'm updating significantly upward from 80% to 87%, acknowledging the force of their arguments about timeline constraints and block entrenchment, while maintaining slightly more caution about the multiplicative risk across seven authoritarian regimes.",
