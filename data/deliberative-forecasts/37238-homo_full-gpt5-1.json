    "review": "Both forecasters align with my base-rate framing and the key drivers: proximity to Bedminster/NYC, Dana White relationship/optics, and the recency penalty from attending UFC 314. The most useful added point is Forecaster 3’s note that Trump skipped Newark’s UFC 302 in 2024, showing that venue proximity alone doesn’t make attendance likely. Both also stress potential early-June presidential obligations (e.g., D‑Day-related travel) as meaningful downside risk and identify good leading indicators (public schedule hints, Dana White teases, Bedminster presence). I find their reasoning sound and largely consistent with mine; their probabilities (35–45%) bracket my initial 40%. The Newark-302 datapoint nudges me slightly down; the rest is already priced in.",
    "rationale": "Baseline for any single UFC card remains No. Upside factors here are unusually strong: Newark is low-friction from Bedminster/NYC, UFC optics are reliably favorable for Trump, Dana White is an ally, and O’Malley headlining ensures coverage. Offsetting: (1) he rarely does two UFC PPVs within ~8 weeks; (2) early-June official travel (e.g., June 6 commemorations or other diplomatic commitments) could conflict; (3) the fact he skipped Newark’s UFC 302 last year shows proximity isn’t dispositive. Netting these, I keep the probability materially above a generic PPV but below even odds. I slightly trim my prior to reflect the Newark-302 counterexample while acknowledging the Bedminster-weekend possibility could flip this late if signaling emerges.",
