  "information": "As of early May 2025, Republika Srpska (RS) has taken several legislative and political steps. A draft for a new constitution, which includes rights to self-determination and provisions for confederal relationships, completed its public consultation phase in mid-April 2025. The RS government has also passed laws to ban Bosnia's central judicial, police, and intelligence agencies from operating within its territory. Milorad Dodik, the leader of RS, has stated he is willing to declare independence if the central authorities, with international support, attempt to take control of RS property. Similarly, Nenad Stevanović, President of the RS Parliament, warned that continued pressure would lead to a declaration of independence, stating that RS is a functional entity capable of implementing its decisions independently.\n\nInternational reactions to the political situation in Republika Srpska are varied. The U.S. and EU have expressed strong opposition to secession, with a U.S. envoy labeling RS's proposals as \"secession by another name.\" The U.S. Embassy in Sarajevo has warned that disobeying the decisions of Bosnia's Constitutional Court, such as celebrating the banned January 9th holiday, may constitute a criminal offense. In contrast, Croatian Prime Minister Andrej Plenković has expressed support for Bosnia and Herzegovina's EU membership while voicing concern over secessionist rhetoric from RS, warning that delays in EU integration could allow Russia and China to increase their influence. Russia has appeared supportive of moves by RS, and a Russian military documentary film festival was scheduled to take place in Banja Luka in May 2025.\n\nHistorical and legal precedents provide context for a potential referendum. Bosnia's Constitutional Court has ruled on multiple occasions that celebrating Republika Srpska Day on January 9 is unconstitutional. Despite this, RS held a parade for the banned holiday in January 2025. Analysis of other independence movements shows varying timelines: the process for Catalonia's 2017 referendum took approximately 7-8 months from legislative groundwork to the announcement, while Scotland's 2014 referendum process took about 2 years. In contrast, Crimea's 2014 referendum, under Russian influence, was organized in about two weeks. The political structure of Bosnia and Herzegovina is based on the 1995 Dayton Agreement, which divided the country into two entities: the Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina and Republika Srpska.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Approximately 2 months, until July 1, 2025.",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No. The government of Republika Srpska (RS) continues its pattern of secessionist rhetoric and legislative challenges to the authority of the central Bosnian state, but stops short of officially announcing a date for an independence referendum.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "The strong and coordinated diplomatic pressure from the United States and the European Union, including the threat of further sanctions and international isolation, successfully deters Milorad Dodik and the RS government from taking the final step of scheduling a referendum. Dodik continues to use the threat as a political tool to rally his base and extract concessions, but deems the cost of actually calling a vote too high within the given timeframe, and the July 1, 2025 deadline passes without an official announcement.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "A perceived major provocation by the central Bosnian government or the international community's High Representative, such as an attempt to arrest a high-level RS official or seize state property, pushes Milorad Dodik to act on his threats. Believing he has sufficient political and potential external backing from Russia, he convenes the RS National Assembly and officially announces a date for an independence referendum as a defiant response, precipitating a major constitutional crisis.",
    "rationale": "My forecast is based on the assessment that while the rhetoric and legislative actions from Republika Srpska are at a high point, the powerful constraints of a short timeline and significant international pressure make the official scheduling of a referendum unlikely before July 1, 2025. The status quo in Bosnian politics has long involved Milorad Dodik employing the threat of secession as a primary political tool without following through on the most extreme action. This pattern of brinkmanship has historically served to consolidate his power and negotiate with the international community. The primary factors against a 'Yes' outcome are the credible threats of severe consequences from the US and EU, which would likely cripple the RS economy and isolate it politically. Furthermore, scheduling a referendum is a significant logistical and political undertaking; while the Crimean case shows it can be done quickly under extraordinary circumstances (i.e., foreign military intervention), the more comparable Catalan or Scottish cases suggest a much longer runway than the two months available here. My probability is not lower than 15% because the current situation is highly volatile. Dodik has taken concrete steps, such as passing laws to undermine state institutions, which go beyond mere rhetoric. A miscalculation by any party—RS, the central government, or international actors—could trigger an escalatory spiral where Dodik feels compelled to announce a referendum date to save face or preempt a stronger action against him. For my forecast to increase, I would need to see signs that the international community's resolve is weakening, or clear, tangible evidence of much stronger support for RS secession from a major power like Russia, beyond documentary festivals. Conversely, my forecast would decrease if there were signs of de-escalation, such as renewed dialogue between the entities or a postponement of the controversial legislative agenda within RS.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nBefore July 1, 2025, will the government of Republika Srpska officially announce a date for an independence referendum?\n\nQuestion background:\nFair Observer: [Balkan Tinderbox: How Russia’s Moves Could Reignite Bosnia](https://www.fairobserver.com/politics/balkan-tinderbox-how-russias-moves-could-reignite-bosnia/)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if, before July 1, 2025, a referendum on the independence of Republika Srpska from Bosnia and Herzegovina is officially scheduled. If this does not occur before that date, this question resolves as **No**.\n\nFor purposes of this question, the referendum will be considered \"officially scheduled\" when it is announced by a person or entity with the authority to do so within Republika Srpska. Please note that broader legality, such as within Bosnia and Herzegovina, will be considered irrelevant for this question, so if the Bosnian government declared the referendum illegal, the question would still resolve as Yes.\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nAs of early May 2025, Republika Srpska (RS) has taken several legislative and political steps.
