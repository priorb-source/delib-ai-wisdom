    "review": "Forecaster 3 raises a critical piece of information I had not considered: that the 31% tariff is allegedly already listed in the HTS under subheading 9903.01.60 but marked as suspended through July 9, 2025. If accurate, this fundamentally changes the analysis. The key insight is that the suspension period extends BEYOND the June 1 resolution date, and the resolution criteria explicitly state that suspended listings still count as Yes. This means the status quo already satisfies the resolution criteria - we don't need anything to happen, we just need nothing to change.\n\nForecaster 2 also correctly emphasizes that suspended tariffs count, but doesn't provide the specific suspension detail. Both forecasters note strong Swiss leverage for negotiations, which I had underweighted.\n\nThe suspension detail is particularly important because it suggests the administration wants to preserve the tariff as a negotiating tool while conducting talks. Removing a listing entirely (the only path to No) would eliminate that leverage and is rarely done during active negotiations. Additionally, administrative changes to tariff schedules typically require formal processes that take time.\n\nHowever, I have some reservations: I cannot independently verify Forecaster 3's suspension claim from my original materials, and there remains tail risk of unexpected policy changes, administrative errors, or accelerated negotiations leading to complete removal rather than extension of suspension.",
    "rationale": "The most significant update to my analysis is accepting that if the 31% tariff is already listed (even if suspended), the bar for a Yes outcome is simply maintenance of status quo rather than implementation of new policy. For a No outcome, the administration would need to actively remove the listing or change the rate - both unlikely given:\n\n1. The suspension allegedly extends to July 9, well past June 1\n2. Removing tariff listings eliminates negotiating leverage\n3. Only 38 days remain for major policy reversals\n4. Administrative processes for HTS changes typically take longer than this timeframe\n5. The recent suspension (if accurate) suggests the administration wants to preserve this option\n\nThe primary downside risks are: (a) the suspension information may be inaccurate or I'm misunderstanding the HTS system, (b) unexpected diplomatic breakthroughs leading to complete removal, (c) administrative or technical errors in the HTS, (d) policy reversal if the tariff generates significant domestic opposition.\n\nBalancing the strong status quo bias with these residual uncertainties, I'm updating upward from 78% to 84%. This is higher than my original forecast but slightly lower than Forecaster 3's 87%, reflecting modest uncertainty about the suspension details and small tail risks of unexpected changes.",
