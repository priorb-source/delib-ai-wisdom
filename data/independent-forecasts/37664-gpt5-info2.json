  "information": "According to reports from Cursor-IDE (May 15) and ZDNet (May 16), a next-generation Anthropic model codenamed 'Claude Neptune' completed its red-team testing phase on May 18. The same reports indicate a target for general availability in late May or early June. In the past, Anthropic has used internal codenames that later became part of public branding, such as the codename 'Asimov' for the models released as the Claude 3 family.",

    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "About 45 days (until July 1, 2025)",
    "status_quo_outcome": "Yes",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Anthropic ships the next model after July 1, 2025; or it launches before July 1 but is branded without the numeral (e.g., “Claude Neptune”/“Claude 3.5”) or is only available via waitlist/closed beta/enterprise, so a typical member of the public cannot access it.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Anthropic announces the next generation as “Claude 4” and makes at least one “Claude 4” model variant generally available (e.g., via claude.ai or API) to the public without a waitlist in late May or June.",
    "rationale": "- What I know and baseline: Anthropic has historically advanced major versions roughly annually (Claude 2 in mid-2023, Claude 3 in early 2024) and tends to make at least one tier (e.g., Sonnet) generally available at launch without a waitlist. This suggests a high base rate for a mid-2025 major release with public access.\n- Research assistant inputs: Reports (Cursor-IDE, May 15; ZDNet, May 16) indicate a next-gen model codenamed “Claude Neptune” finishing red-teaming around May 18 and targeting general availability in late May or early June. Prior codename-to-brand mapping (e.g., “Asimov” → Claude 3 family) supports that “Neptune” could be the public “Claude 4.” These specifics meaningfully raise the near-term launch probability.\n- Key risks (why not higher):\n  1) Naming risk: The resolution requires the public name to include both “Claude” and “4.” If Anthropic brands as “Claude Neptune,” “Claude Next,” or “Claude 3.5/3.7,” the question resolves No even if it ships broadly. I assign a non-trivial chance (~10–20%).\n  2) Access gating risk: They could limit initial access to waitlisted users, enterprises, or partners. Historically less common for Anthropic’s major family launches, but still a possibility (~10%).\n  3) Schedule risk: Safety or readiness issues could delay GA into July or later (~10–15%).\n- Why not lower: Multiple independent reports point to completion of red-teaming and GA targeted within the next few weeks, which is comfortably before July 1. Past Anthropic launches often included immediate public availability for at least one model tier via claude.ai/API, supporting compliance with the “no waitlist” criterion.\n- What would move me up: An official Anthropic announcement confirming the “Claude 4” name and a dated GA window in May/June; sightings of “Claude 4” available on claude.ai or API docs without waitlist.\n- What would move me down: Credible reporting of delays past June, explicit branding that omits the numeral “4,” or confirmation that initial access is waitlist/enterprise-only.\nOverall, given timing signals and historical patterns, I expect a Yes more often than not, but I discount for naming and gating risks.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill Claude 4 be available to the general public before July 1, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nPromptLayer: [Everything we know: Claude 4](https://blog.promptlayer.com/claude-4/)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if a member of the general public can access Anthropic's Claude 4 model without first joining a waitlist or participating in an early access or testing phase. If Anthropic does not release Claude 4 before July 1, 2025, this question resolves as **No**.\n\nThe resolution will rely on [credible sources](https://www.metaculus.com/help/faq/#definitions), including that it may rely on the ability of Metaculus employees to access Claude 4. \"Access\" may be via API, the Anthropic website, or any other method that allows interaction with Claude 4. Models that do not include both \"Claude\" and \"4\" in the name will not be considered for resolution of this question.\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nAccording to reports from Cursor-IDE (May 15) and ZDNet (May 16), a next-generation Anthropic model codenamed 'Claude Neptune' completed its red-team testing phase on May 18.

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
