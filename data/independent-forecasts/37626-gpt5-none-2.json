    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "About 4–5 weeks (BLS typically releases May average prices in mid-June 2025).",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No — the BLS average price for bananas has recently hovered in the low-to-mid $0.60s per lb, making a print under $0.6300 somewhat unlikely absent a clear downward move.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "May 2025 averages around $0.635–$0.665/lb as retailers pass through modest cost increases (shipping/port fees, supplier price adjustments) and typical month-to-month volatility keeps prices near recent levels.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Retailers run promotions or loss-leader pricing, supply from Central/South America is ample, logistics costs ease, and/or a stronger dollar trims import costs, nudging the average down to ~$0.620–$0.629/lb.",
    "rationale": "With about a month to go, the best guide is the recent level and volatility of APU0000711211. Bananas are unusually stable in price; month-to-month swings are typically a few tenths of a cent to a couple of cents. Recent years have seen averages mostly in the ~$0.62–$0.66 range, with 2024–early 2025 generally in the low-to-mid $0.60s. The threshold ($0.6300) is toward the lower end of that band. The referenced article highlights upward pressures (supplier price hikes, higher port/shipping costs), which, if anything, bias the distribution slightly above $0.63. Given the series’ low volatility and sticky retail pricing, a single-month drop below $0.6300 is possible but not the base case.\nWhy not higher: Supermarkets sometimes discount bananas aggressively; any broad-based promotions, easing logistics costs, or favorable FX could push the average a couple of cents lower. Why not lower: The status quo is slightly above $0.63 and upward cost pressures persist; with limited volatility, a sub-$0.6300 outcome requires a coordinated or sizable downward nudge in May.\nUpdates I’d watch to move the forecast: (1) The April 2025 BLS print — if April is ≤$0.632, I’d raise the Yes probability; if ≥$0.645, I’d lower it. (2) USDA AMS wholesale banana prices in May vs. April — sustained declines would raise the Yes probability. (3) Any news on retailer promotions or easing port/shipping fees (upward for Yes), or fresh cost/tariff shocks (downward for Yes). The research assistant provided no additional data; thus, I’m leaning on historical levels/volatility and the qualitative pressure from the article.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill the price of bananas reported by the US BLS for May 2025 be under 63 cents a pound?\n\nQuestion background:\nQuartz: [Move over, eggs – bananas are the next victim](https://qz.com/bananas-dole-price-hikes-inflation-port-fees-trump-tari-1851772583)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if the price reported by the Bureau of Labor Statistics [here](https://data.bls.gov/toppicks?survey=ap) for Bananas, per lb. - APU0000711211, to the thousandths of a decimal point, is under $0.6300 for May 2025.\n\n\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nNo additional information available.\n\nToday is 2025-05-13.\n\nBefore answering you think:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n(e) You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
