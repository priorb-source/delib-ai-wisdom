    "review": "My initial forecast was 75%. The other two forecasters bracketed my own, with Forecast 2 at 78% and Forecast 3 at 70%. I found both of their analyses to be well-reasoned and helpful in refining my own thinking. Forecaster 2 reinforced my core reasoning about the established pattern of communication and the powerful catalyst of the upcoming peace talks, adding the useful frame of the 33-day window being 'generous' and thus robust to short-term disruptions. Forecaster 3 provided an excellent and structured list of specific 'failure modes' that I had not considered in sufficient detail. The most compelling points were the risk that communication could shift to multi-party calls (which might not resolve as 'Yes') and the stringency of the resolution criteria requiring both sides to acknowledge the call. This second point, in particular, introduces a pathway to a 'No' resolution that is independent of whether a conversation actually occurs, which is a significant source of uncertainty I had previously underweighted.",
    "rationale": "After reviewing my peers' analyses, I am slightly decreasing my forecast. My initial confidence was based on the strong positive signals: an established monthly communication cadence between the two leaders, and a major diplomatic event (the May 15 Istanbul talks) that creates a clear need for coordination. Forecaster 2's analysis strengthens this view. However, Forecaster 3 raised several crucial points that temper this optimism. The strict resolution criteria—requiring a bilateral (not multi-party) call that is explicitly acknowledged by *both* sides—creates more opportunities for a 'No' outcome than I had originally priced in. A call could happen but be part of a group discussion, or one side might decline to issue a public readout for strategic reasons. These are plausible failure modes. While I still believe the fundamental drivers make a call highly probable, these resolution-specific risks are significant. Therefore, I am reducing my forecast slightly from 75% to 72% to account for this increased uncertainty about the event meeting the specific resolution criteria, even if the underlying event itself is likely.",
