    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Approximately 3-4 weeks. We are currently in mid-May 2025, and the BLS typically releases monthly price data in the following month, so the May 2025 banana price data should be published in June 2025.",
    "status_quo_outcome": "Yes - banana prices remain under 63 cents per pound. Historically, banana prices have been remarkably stable over time, typically ranging between 50-65 cents per pound, making them one of the most price-stable fresh produce items in US grocery stores.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "The price reaches or exceeds 63 cents per pound due to the factors mentioned in the Quartz article: increased tariffs on banana imports, higher port fees, supply chain disruptions, or inflationary pressures. Additional factors could include disease affecting banana crops (like Panama disease) or extreme weather events in major banana-producing regions like Ecuador, Guatemala, or Costa Rica.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "The price remains below 63 cents per pound. Since we are already in May 2025, the prices for this month are essentially already determined - consumers have been buying bananas all month at established prices. The concerns raised in the article either haven't materialized yet or their impact has been more modest than feared. Competition among major suppliers (Dole, Chiquita, Del Monte) keeps prices stable.",
    "rationale": "The critical factor here is timing: we are already in mid-May 2025, meaning the May price data is essentially already determined - it's just waiting to be compiled and reported by the BLS. The actual prices consumers paid throughout May have already been set by retailers. This significantly reduces uncertainty compared to forecasting future price movements. The Quartz article warns about banana price increases, suggesting upward pressure from tariffs, port fees, and inflation. However, news articles often emphasize potential problems without full context about magnitude or timing. Bananas have historically been one of the most price-stable produce items due to established supply chains, year-round availability, and intense competition among major brands. Without specific current price data from my research assistant, I must rely on historical patterns. Banana prices have typically ranged from 50-65 cents per pound in recent years, with 63 cents representing the higher end of this range. Given that we're looking at prices that have already occurred (May 2025), the status quo strongly suggests that if prices were going to spike dramatically above 63 cents, we would likely have already seen evidence of this in news reports or consumer complaints. The lack of such reports suggests prices remain in normal ranges. My forecast is not higher because: the article does warn of genuine upward price pressures, there could be tariff impacts I'm unaware of, and 63 cents is achievable as an upper range price. My forecast is not lower because: the extreme proximity to the measurement period means uncertainty is low, banana prices are historically stable, and major disruptions would likely already be visible. I would update higher (toward No) if I saw: current BLS data showing March/April 2025 prices already at or above 62 cents, news of major supply disruptions in May, or confirmed tariff implementations. I would update lower (toward Yes) if I saw: recent BLS data showing prices well below 60 cents, or evidence that the article's concerns were speculative rather than based on actual implemented policies.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill the price of bananas reported by the US BLS for May 2025 be under 63 cents a pound?\n\nQuestion background:\nQuartz: [Move over, eggs – bananas are the next victim](https://qz.com/bananas-dole-price-hikes-inflation-port-fees-trump-tari-1851772583)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below.

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
