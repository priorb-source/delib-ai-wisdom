  "information": "On May 13, 2025, Mali's military junta, led by General Assimi Goïta, issued a presidential decree dissolving all political parties and organizations. The government justified the decision by citing the need to rationalize the political landscape, which includes around 300 parties, and to preserve national unity and stability. The decree followed national consultations held in April 2025. Preceding the decree, the National Transitional Council (CNT) voted 130-2 to repeal the law governing the charter of political parties and the statute of political opposition. The government has stated its intention to draft a new legislative framework to regulate the political sector in the future.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Approximately 5 weeks, until July 1, 2025.",
    "status_quo_outcome": "The government of Mali does not reverse its decree, and the ban on all political parties remains in place past the deadline. This resolves the question as No.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "The military junta holds firm on its decision, citing the need to reform the political system. It weathers any domestic protests and international condemnation, and the ban on political parties continues through July 1, 2025, without being reversed.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "A combination of significant, sustained domestic protests and the imposition of severe, unexpected sanctions by regional powers like ECOWAS creates a crisis for the junta. To restore stability and avoid further isolation, the government announces a reversal of the decree as a concession.",
    "rationale": "The forecast is based on the high inertia of the current political situation. The military junta's decision to dissolve all political parties on May 13, 2025, was a deliberate and significant step to consolidate power, following a vote in the transitional council and national consultations that provide it with a veneer of legitimacy. Authoritarian regimes rarely reverse such fundamental policy decisions within weeks, as doing so would project weakness and instability. The very short timeframe—just over one month until the deadline—makes a reversal even more unlikely, as the conditions that would force such a change would need to materialize and escalate extremely rapidly. The government has already demonstrated a willingness to defy international pressure, suggesting that mere condemnation will be insufficient to force a change. \n\nMy probability is not lower than 5% because military governments can be brittle. An unexpectedly strong and unified domestic opposition, a fracture within the ruling military elite, or the sudden application of crippling economic sanctions could theoretically force a rapid policy U-turn. Events can change quickly in such political environments.\n\nMy probability is not higher than 5% because the path to a 'Yes' outcome requires overcoming the junta's core interest in maintaining and consolidating power. The bar for forcing such a quick and total reversal is exceptionally high. The most probable outcome is that the junta will maintain the ban while slowly working on a new political framework that further entrenches its rule.\n\nI would increase my forecast upon seeing evidence of massive, country-wide protests, public dissent from senior military figures, or the imposition of severe new sanctions by key regional bodies. Conversely, I would decrease it if the domestic and international response remains muted over the next couple of weeks.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nBefore July 1, 2025, will the government of Mali reverse its decision to dissolve all political parties?\n\nQuestion background:\n[Mali's Military Government Shuts Down All Political Parties](https://www.legit.ng/world/africa/1654992-malis-military-government-shuts-political-parties/)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if the government of Mali announces a reversal of its May 13, 2025 presidential decree dissolving all political parties in the country.\n\nA partial reversal, such as allowing the reinstatement of a limited number of parties, will only count as long as new parties are generally allowed to be formed again.\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nOn May 13, 2025, Mali's military junta, led by General Assimi Goïta, issued a presidential decree dissolving all political parties and organizations.

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
