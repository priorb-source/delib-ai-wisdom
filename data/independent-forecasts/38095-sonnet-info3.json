  "information": "During his first presidential term, Donald Trump did not grant any clemencies during the month of June in any of the four years. For his second term, a May 28, 2025, report from the Washington Times indicated that Trump has signaled more pardons could be forthcoming, including for two men convicted in the plot to kidnap Michigan Governor Gretchen Whitmer. A White House official was also quoted stating the President has come to the aid of political supporters and donors and has expressed sympathy for allies caught in the judicial system.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Approximately 32 days (June 2025 ends on June 30, 2025)",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No - Trump does not grant clemency to more than 2 individuals in June 2025",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Trump continues his historical pattern from his first term and grants zero clemencies in June 2025, or he grants clemencies but only to 1-2 individuals, falling short of the threshold of more than 2.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Trump follows through on signals from the May 28 report and grants pardons to the two Whitmer kidnapping plot individuals plus at least one additional person (political ally, donor, or supporter) during June 2025, totaling 3 or more clemencies.",
    "rationale": "The historical base rate strongly favors a No outcome: Trump granted zero clemencies in June during all four years of his first term (2017-2020). This establishes a clear pattern suggesting June is not a month he typically uses for clemencies. However, several factors provide some counterweight to this strong prior. The May 28, 2025 report indicates Trump has 'signaled more pardons could be forthcoming,' specifically mentioning two individuals from the Whitmer kidnapping plot. The report also notes Trump's pattern of aiding political supporters and donors caught in the judicial system. The key threshold here is 'more than 2 individuals' (i.e., 3+). If Trump grants clemency to the two Whitmer-related individuals, he would only need one additional clemency to meet the threshold. This is a relatively low bar. My forecast is not higher because: (1) the historical precedent is extremely strong - four consecutive years with zero June clemencies; (2) 'could be forthcoming' indicates possibility, not certainty or timeline; (3) the status quo typically persists; (4) no specific June timeline was mentioned in the reporting. My forecast is not lower because: (1) there are specific cases mentioned; (2) recent explicit signals about forthcoming pardons; (3) second-term dynamics may differ from first-term patterns; (4) Trump has demonstrated willingness to grant clemencies to allies; (5) the threshold of 3+ is achievable. To update higher, I would need: specific announcements of planned June clemencies, more concrete reporting on timing, or Trump statements indicating imminent action. To update lower: June beginning with no announcements, delays in the mentioned cases, or Trump focusing on other priorities.",
