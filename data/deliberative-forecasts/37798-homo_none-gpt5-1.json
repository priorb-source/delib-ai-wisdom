    "review": "Both forecasters emphasize short horizon, clustering at the top, and multiple credible contenders, which aligns with my prior. Forecaster 3 adds a helpful variance estimate (~2.5 wins SD over ~28 games) and frames the effective competition set at ~4–6 teams, which supports a one-team probability near 17–25% before adjusting for Dodgers’ edge. Both note ties likely count and mention the small timing risk from “on/after June 15,” which I had considered but they articulated clearly. No new hard data (e.g., current standings) was provided, but their structured quantification nudges me slightly upward from my prior 27% on calibration grounds. I’m not as high as 32% absent confirmation the Dodgers currently lead or have a cushion.",
    "rationale": "- Time horizon: ~4 weeks and ~25–30 games remain before June 15; leaders tend to persist but thin margins make swaps plausible.\n- Competitive set: Likely 4–6 top-tier teams with comparable true talent; a neutral split is ~17–25%. The Dodgers’ underlying strength (true-talent edge, depth) warrants an uplift versus a typical contender.\n- Tie handling and timing: Ties for best win% should count as “have the highest,” boosting odds slightly. The “checked on/after June 15” clause introduces small timing variance that slightly reduces the chance any one team is on top at the exact check moment.\n- Rough calibration: Start with ~5-team contest → 20%. Apply a 1.3–1.5x weight for Dodgers’ superiority → 26–30%. Subtract 1–2 pp for timing variance, add ~1 pp for tie allowance → net around 29–30%.\n- Without current standings or schedule/health edges, I keep the estimate below one-third. The other forecasters’ variance framing and consensus around low-30s warrants a modest upward adjustment from 27% to 30%, but not all the way to 32%.",
