    "review": "Forecaster 2 and 3 emphasize war‑risk tails (aid delays, grid attacks) and NBU credibility, but they don’t provide concrete April‑specific shocks or recent CPI/FX data that would plausibly push April YoY to ≥15%. Their probabilities (35–40%) seem to overweight generic wartime uncertainty and the “stagflation” headline without quantifying the mechanics of getting from recent YoY levels to 15% in one month. Neither discusses base effects or the size of m/m increases needed. I agree with their identification of the key pathways (FX devaluation, administered‑price hikes, energy shocks), but I don’t find their high odds convincing absent evidence that such shocks actually materialized in early April.",
    "rationale": "Timing matters: with April nearly complete, most determinants of the April print are already realized. To hit ≥15% YoY in April, the March YoY rate would already need to be very high, or April would need an outsized m/m surge. Even if March YoY were in the low double digits, reaching 15% would typically require an unusually large single‑month increase (several percent m/m) driven by a sharp FX move or major administered‑price hikes—events that tend to be visible. I’ve seen no indication of a critical aid cutoff, a disorderly hryvnia slide, or a nationwide tariff shock in April big enough to generate that kind of step‑up. The NBU’s policy credibility and managed‑FX framework further reduce the odds of an abrupt spike. The “stagflation” article signals medium‑term risk but isn’t evidence of a near‑term April jump to ≥15%. Weighing the others’ arguments, I maintain a low probability, allowing a small tail for unobserved admin‑price actions or energy disruptions with unusually fast pass‑through.",
