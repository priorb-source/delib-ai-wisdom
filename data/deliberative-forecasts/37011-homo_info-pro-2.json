    "review": "I have reviewed the analyses from two other forecasters. There is a strong consensus on the significant structural barriers facing Reform UK, including the First-Past-The-Post (FPTP) electoral system, the party's lack of local infrastructure, and the advantages of incumbency held by the major parties. Forecaster 2 provides a compelling and specific piece of data I had not explicitly considered: under the new electoral boundaries, the Conservatives notionally hold 57 of 64 seats. This quantifies the gargantuan scale of the electoral swing Reform would need to achieve, reinforcing the view that a 'Yes' outcome is a remote possibility. Forecaster 3 places significantly more weight on Reform's national polling numbers (23-25%) to justify a much higher forecast of 8%. While acknowledging the national trend is important, I find this reasoning unconvincing. It seems to overweight the predictive power of national sentiment for a specific local election outcome. As Forecaster 3 notes, historical precedent with UKIP showed that high national support does not translate into winning control of county councils. The most likely outcome of a national poll surge is winning a handful of seats and splitting the vote, not winning the most seats outright.",
    "rationale": "After deliberation, I am revising my forecast downwards from 2% to 1%. The argument from Forecaster 2 was particularly persuasive. The specific data point that the Conservatives notionally start with 57 of the 64 seats under the new boundaries powerfully illustrates the near-insurmountable challenge for Reform. To win the most seats (i.e., likely 32 or more), they would need to achieve a political landslide of a magnitude for which there is no modern precedent for a new party at a local level. My initial 2% forecast was intended to capture a low-probability 'political earthquake' scenario where the Conservative vote completely collapses and transfers directly to Reform. However, Forecaster 2’s data point makes it clear that even in such a scenario, the swing required would be so immense and would need to be so geographically efficient that the probability is even lower than I first estimated. I am not persuaded by Forecaster 3's 8% forecast, as it appears to conflate the probability of Reform doing well (winning some seats) with the probability of them winning the *most* seats, which is a far higher bar. The structural barriers of the FPTP system and the power of local incumbency remain the dominant factors, making a Reform victory a remote tail risk. Therefore, a 1% forecast better reflects this extremely high degree of improbability.",
