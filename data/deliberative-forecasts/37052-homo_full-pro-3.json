    "review": "The other forecasters and I agree on the core dynamics: the risk is concentrated in Africa (particularly the Sahel), the timeframe is short, and the baseline coup frequency has significantly increased recently. The main point of contention is how to weigh this recent frequency. Forecaster 2 uses a longer-term average (since 2020) and sees recent failed attempts as a deterrent, leading to a low 20% forecast. I find this unconvincing; the 'coup contagion' effect suggests recent attempts, even failed ones, are a sign of greater, not lesser, risk. Forecaster 3 uses a more recent base rate (from 2024 data) and interprets foiled plots as a sign of active instability, leading to a high 45% forecast. I find this reasoning more persuasive, as it better captures the current volatile environment.",
    "rationale": "After reviewing the other analyses, I believe my initial forecast of 35% was too conservative. My own quantitative analysis, using a Poisson distribution with a rate of 3-4 successful coups per year (a conservative average for the 2021-2024 period), pointed to a probability range of 40-50%. I discounted this result too heavily based on the qualitative feeling that 'two months is a short time.' Forecaster 3's analysis, which highlighted that the 2024 frequency implies a successful coup happens on average every 73 days, reinforced that the base rate is high enough to make an event in a 66-day window a very real possibility. I agree with Forecaster 3's interpretation that recent foiled attempts in Burkina Faso and Chad are evidence of ongoing instability and active plotting, rather than a successful deterrent effect as Forecaster 2 suggested. Therefore, I am updating my forecast upwards to better align with the quantitative evidence of a significantly elevated short-term risk, which the deliberation has convinced me is the most important factor.",
