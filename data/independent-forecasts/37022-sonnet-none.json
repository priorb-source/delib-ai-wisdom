    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "The outcome should be determinable now or within days, as March 2025 has passed and we are currently on April 22, 2025. Official government debt statistics for March 2025 should be published or available imminently on Trading Economics.",
    "status_quo_outcome": "Yes - Ukraine's government debt likely meets or exceeds 1.90 trillion UAH",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Ukraine's government debt falls below 1.90 trillion UAH in March 2025, potentially due to significant debt restructuring, substantial debt forgiveness from international creditors, better-than-expected fiscal revenues, or reduced borrowing needs if the war situation improved unexpectedly in early 2025.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Ukraine's government debt reaches or exceeds 1.90 trillion UAH in March 2025, driven by continued high wartime expenditures, ongoing international and domestic borrowing to finance defense and government operations, reduced tax revenues due to economic disruption, and the accumulated debt burden from three years of war.",
    "rationale": "Since today is April 22, 2025, we are evaluating data that should already exist for March 2025. The key factors are: (1) Ukraine has been in an active war since February 2022, requiring massive defense spending and reconstruction; (2) The background article mentions stagflation concerns, indicating ongoing economic stress and fiscal pressure; (3) Government debt typically grows during wartime due to emergency spending and reduced revenues; (4) The specific threshold of 1.90 trillion UAH suggests this is near expected levels, making it a meaningful benchmark. The status quo strongly points toward high debt levels - wars are expensive, and Ukraine has required substantial international aid and borrowing. Without contrary evidence suggesting major debt relief or unexpected fiscal improvement, the wartime trajectory points to continued debt accumulation. My forecast is not higher (e.g., 90%+) because: there's uncertainty about the exact March 2025 figures, possibility of accounting adjustments, or potential debt restructuring deals. My forecast is not lower because the fundamental drivers (war costs, economic disruption) strongly support high debt levels, and we're past the reference date so the outcome is essentially determined. I would update higher if I saw recent reports of Ukraine's debt exceeding 2 trillion UAH, and lower if there were announcements of major debt forgiveness or restructuring completed before March 2025.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill Ukraine's government debt be at least 1.90 trillion UAH in March 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\n[Ukraine is one step away from stagflation. And here's why](https://en.iz.ru/en/1868046/2025-04-10/ukraine-one-step-away-stagflation-and-heres-why)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if Ukraine's government debt is greater than or equal to 1.90 billion UAH Thousand (in other words, 1.90 trillion Ukrainian hryvnia for the month of March 2025, according to the number presented by [Trading Economics](https://tradingeconomics.com/ukraine/government-debt). Under 1.90 billion UAH Thousand resolves as **No**.\n\n\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nNo additional information available.\n\nToday is 2025-04-22.\n\nBefore answering you think:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n(e) You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
