    "review": "Both forecasters center the short time horizon and liquidity runway, which is the right framing. They emphasize: $225.6m cash as of Jan 31, sharply reduced operating cash use in Q4, no debt maturities until 2028, and that NYSE non‑compliance is not a solvency trigger. They also note that NEVI awards signal ongoing operations. The key incremental point is the strong base‑rate argument: with this cash and no near‑term maturities, filings within ~8 weeks are historically rare absent an acute shock. One caveat: describing the runway as “years” off a single low‑burn quarter may be too generous—Q4 burn can benefit from working‑capital timing—but even a reversion to a much higher burn would still carry them past July 1. Overall, their reasoning aligns with mine and reinforces a very low short‑term bankruptcy probability.",
    "rationale": "The decisive factors are (1) time remaining (~8 weeks), (2) cash on hand (~$226m at Jan 31), and (3) absence of near‑term debt maturities. Even if Q4’s $3m operating cash usage was unusually low and burn reverted to $30–60m per quarter, liquidity should still comfortably bridge to July 1 without creditor pressure. NYSE price non‑compliance is a listing issue with a cure period and not a liquidity event; a reverse split is a standard remedy. The paused federal funding introduces medium‑term headwinds, and NEVI awards don’t equate to immediate cash, but neither creates an imminent default pathway. Bankruptcy within this window would likely require a severe, low‑probability shock (e.g., major undisclosed liability, catastrophic product/recall, fraud, cyber/ransom event, or sudden vendor credit freeze). I would update higher on signs of acute stress: going‑concern language, missed filings, auditor resignation, vendor holds, default notices, or an 8‑K revealing a large unexpected liability or dramatic cash depletion in Q1. I would move lower if Q1 shows manageable burn and stable liquidity, or if governance steps (e.g., reverse split approval) proceed smoothly. Given the deliberation, my prior 2% remains appropriate; the additional analyses reinforce rather than alter the base case.",
