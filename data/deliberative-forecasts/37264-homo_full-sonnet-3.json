    "review": "All three forecasters converged remarkably on 18-20%, identifying the same core factors: Niger's persistent Level 3 status since March 2023, the significant 'coup test' (no elevation after July 2023), regional Level 4 designations showing deliberate calibration, short 2-month timeframe, and the South Sudan precedent requiring specific triggers like ordered departures. Forecaster 2's emphasis on the State Department's 'nuanced approach' with regional designations is well-taken - this demonstrates active risk management rather than neglect. Forecaster 3's framing of 'institutional inertia' and observation that Level 4 requires 'extreme circumstances' (active warfare, state collapse) effectively highlights that Niger, while unstable, doesn't match the profile of current Level 4 countries like Afghanistan, Syria, or Yemen. The coup survival test is particularly compelling evidence - if a military takeover didn't trigger elevation, what would in the next 60 days? However, I don't think the other forecasters fully grappled with the advisory being genuinely outdated (over 2 years without formal review despite 6-month requirements). This unusual staleness could indicate either bureaucratic delay or an imminent review. The regional context remains genuinely concerning with Mali and Burkina Faso both at Level 4, and Sahel-wide terrorism remains active.",
    "rationale": "The convergence at 18-20% across all forecasters validates that this probability range appropriately captures the tension between strong status quo forces and residual uncertainty. The status quo case is even stronger than I initially weighted: (1) The July 2023 coup was a natural trigger point that didn't result in elevation, demonstrating high institutional threshold; (2) Regional Level 4 designations show deliberate policy choice rather than oversight; (3) Level 4 is reserved for extreme situations (active war zones, collapsed states) that Niger doesn't currently match. However, I'm not lowering my forecast because: (1) The 2-year gap without updates remains genuinely anomalous and could signal pending review; (2) Regional Sahel instability is real and ongoing; (3) Unexpected security incidents requiring personnel evacuation could occur even in short timeframes; (4) The short timeframe cuts both ways - while it limits opportunity for change, policy shifts can happen quickly when triggered by specific events. The 18% probability appropriately reflects high confidence in status quo maintenance while acknowledging non-trivial tail risks from regional volatility and potential review cycles.",
