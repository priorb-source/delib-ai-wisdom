    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Approximately 2-3 weeks. G7 summits typically occur mid-to-late June, so the outcome should be known by the end of June 2025.",
    "status_quo_outcome": "Modi does not attend. Based on the Times of India article, Canada has invited other non-G7 countries (Australia, Ukraine) but has not yet extended an invitation to India.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Canada does not extend an invitation to India due to strained bilateral relations or strategic priorities. Alternatively, Canada extends a late invitation but Modi declines due to scheduling conflicts, domestic political considerations, or diplomatic tensions between the two countries.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Canada extends a last-minute invitation to India as part of outreach to Global South nations. Modi accepts despite the short notice and attends the summit in person, possibly viewing it as strategically important for India's international positioning or to address pressing global issues.",
    "rationale": "The status quo strongly suggests Modi will not attend. As of the background article, Canada has already invited Australia and Ukraine but not India, despite India having attended previous G7 summits as a guest nation. We are already in early June 2025, and G7 summits typically occur mid-to-late June, leaving limited time for an invitation, acceptance, and logistical arrangements. The selective invitation pattern is a negative signal - if India were a priority guest, an invitation would likely have been extended already alongside other non-G7 invitees. Additionally, Canada-India bilateral relations have faced challenges in recent years, which could be a factor in the invitation decision. However, I'm not assigning zero probability because diplomatic situations can shift quickly, and there remains technical time for a late invitation and acceptance. India is a major global power and sometimes receives last-minute invitations to such forums. My forecast is not higher because the absence of an invitation at this late stage, combined with other countries already being invited, is a very strong negative indicator. My forecast is not lower because there is still physically enough time for this to happen, and diplomatic norms can sometimes produce surprising outcomes. I would update higher if news emerges of an invitation being extended or diplomatic warming between Canada and India. I would update lower as each day passes in June without invitation news.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill India's PM Narendra Modi attend the G7 Summit in June 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nTimes of India: [Canada invites Australia, Ukraine for G7 meet but no call for India yet](https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/canada-invites-australia-ukraine-for-g7-meet-but-no-call-for-india-yet/articleshow/121398906.cms)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi attends in person a G7 summit held in June 2025.\n\n\"In person\" is defined as occupying the same physical space closely enough at the G7 Summit that he can see and hear other heads of state through direct un-intermediated exchange of photons and sound waves.\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nNo additional information available.\n\nToday is 2025-06-03.\n\nBefore answering you think:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n(e) You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
