    "review": "Both forecasters identified the same central tension as my initial analysis: the status quo holding of 10.7 million shares versus Berkshire's consistent, multi-quarter trend of being a net seller of equities. Forecaster 2 (85%) convincingly framed retaining the shares as the 'path of least resistance,' emphasizing the inertia of large positions and the strong fundamental case for Amazon, which I find persuasive. Forecaster 3 (70%) made an excellent point that I had not fully weighed: trimming a small amount like 6.5% to fall below the 10 million share threshold would be perfectly consistent with their broader de-risking strategy, making it a very plausible portfolio management action rather than a specific negative call on Amazon. Neither forecaster introduced new factual evidence, but their framing helped clarify the arguments on both sides.",
    "rationale": "After reviewing my peers' analyses, I am maintaining my original forecast of 75%. My initial reasoning correctly identified the key variables. The other forecasters provided valuable perspectives that sharpened my view but ultimately balanced each other out. Forecaster 3's argument that a small trim is consistent with Berkshire's macro strategy slightly increased my perceived probability of a 'No' outcome. However, this was counteracted by Forecaster 2's emphasis on inertia and a point I now consider more strongly: selling just over 700,000 shares would raise an insignificant amount of cash for Berkshire (roughly $160 million). Such a small sale is unlikely to be motivated by their broad desire to increase their massive $348 billion cash hoard. Therefore, a sale of that size would likely require a specific, negative catalyst related to Amazon itself. Given Amazon's strong performance, positive analyst ratings, and growth in AWS, such a catalyst seems unlikely to have occurred in Q1 2025. The status quo remains the most powerful factor; it is the default outcome and requires an active decision to change. While Berkshire's selling trend is real, it's more probable they would leave a high-conviction, non-Buffett pick like Amazon untouched, or trim it by an amount too small to cross the resolution threshold.",
