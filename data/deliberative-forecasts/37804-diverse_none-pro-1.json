    "review": "The other forecasters and I agree on the primary argument favoring a 'Yes' outcome: bureaucratic and scientific inertia make a formal change to a long-standing public health recommendation extremely unlikely by July 1, 2025, given the review was just announced in April. Forecaster 3 provided a very compelling point that I hadn't explicitly considered: the most likely institutional response to the review would be to keep the current guidance online but add an 'under review' disclaimer, which would resolve as 'Yes'. This strengthens the case for the status quo holding. Conversely, Forecaster 2 raised a crucial point that I had underweighted: a 'No' outcome does not require a completed scientific review. The resolution criteria state that the question resolves as 'No' if the page is simply pulled offline. This is a much lower-friction, politically-driven action that could happen quickly, representing the most plausible path to a 'No' outcome. Their reasoning convinced me that the risk of a political intervention bypassing the formal process is slightly higher than I initially assessed.",
    "rationale": "My initial forecast of 90% was based on the near impossibility of the CDC completing a scientific review and implementing new guidance in under three months. The arguments from the other forecasters have refined my view. I am maintaining a high probability for 'Yes' because the institutional inertia is immense, and as Forecaster 3 noted, adding an 'under review' notice is a standard bureaucratic practice that would lead to a 'Yes' resolution. However, I am lowering my forecast slightly from 90% to 88%. This small adjustment is to more formally account for the specific risk, emphasized by Forecaster 2, that a political decision could be made to simply take the page offline to appease critics without going through a full review process. This is the most viable path to a 'No' outcome. While I still believe this is unlikely given the blowback from the public health community, it is a non-trivial risk that warrants a slight downward adjustment from my initial confidence. The 88% forecast reflects a dominant probability of the status quo holding, while assigning a 12% chance to a 'No' outcome, driven primarily by the possibility of this kind of swift political intervention.",
