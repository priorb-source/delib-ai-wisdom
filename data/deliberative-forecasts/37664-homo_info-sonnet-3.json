    "review": "Forecaster 2's historical analysis of release cadences (5 months, 8 months, now 14+ months) adds valuable context I hadn't explicitly considered, though it reinforces my original skepticism. The observation that Claude 3 is well beyond previous patterns suggests either extended development or strategic delays.\n\nForecaster 3 presents fundamentally different information - claiming the research assistant reported 'Claude Neptune' completing red-team testing on May 18 with late May/early June availability. This is NOT in my research assistant's report, which only mentioned February/March sources saying 'later in 2025'. This creates a critical information asymmetry. If Forecaster 3's information is accurate, it would be highly relevant. However, I must be skeptical of information I cannot verify.\n\nEven accepting Forecaster 3's timeline at face value, their naming concern is crucial: 'Neptune' might become 'Claude 3.5' or 'Claude Neptune' rather than 'Claude 4'. The question's strict requirement for both 'Claude' AND '4' in the name is a high bar. Previous codename 'Asimov' became 'Claude 3', but there's no guarantee 'Neptune' becomes 'Claude 4'. Additionally, the general availability requirement (no waitlist/early access) adds further uncertainty even if something launches.\n\nThe convergence between Forecaster 2 and myself at 18% using different reasoning provides some confidence in the lower range. However, I should modestly update upward to account for: (1) possible near-term launches I'm unaware of, (2) the possibility Forecaster 3 has legitimate additional information, and (3) remaining time technically sufficient for surprise announcements.",
    "rationale": "My updated analysis weighs three factors: First, the status quo remains strongly toward No - as of mid-May with no official announcements, sources consistently point to 'later in 2025', and Forecaster 2's historical analysis shows this release is already delayed beyond previous patterns. Second, Forecaster 3's specific timeline information, if accurate, would suggest higher probability, but I cannot verify this information and must discount it accordingly. The strict naming requirement ('Claude' AND '4') and general availability requirement create substantial execution risk even if a model launches soon. Third, 46 days is technically sufficient for a surprise launch, and Anthropic has demonstrated ability to move quickly from announcement to public availability.\n\nI'm updating modestly from 18% to 28% to acknowledge: (1) genuine uncertainty about information asymmetries between forecasters, (2) non-zero probability of developments I'm unaware of, and (3) sufficient remaining time for a launch. However, I'm not moving to 50% because I cannot verify Forecaster 3's specific claims, the naming uncertainty is substantial, and absent any announcements with 6.5 weeks remaining, the base rate still strongly favors No resolution.",
