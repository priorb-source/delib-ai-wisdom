  "information": "On March 13, 2025, the government of Chad officially granted Starlink an operating license. The stated goal is to enhance internet connectivity, particularly in remote areas where the existing 6,000 km of fiber optic infrastructure is insufficient, and to support educational and healthcare institutions. Government officials have stated that negotiations were conducted to ensure affordable pricing for the service.",

    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "About 46 days (until July 1, 2025)",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No — As of now Chad is not marked “Available” on Starlink’s map; absent a change, it will remain No by July 1, 2025.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Post-license execution slips: Starlink keeps Chad as “Coming Soon” (or with a later-quarter ETA) due to final regulatory steps (type approval, reseller onboarding), import/logistics delays, or cautious rollout sequencing in Central Africa, pushing launch into Q3 or later.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Starlink completes remaining compliance and distribution tasks and flips Chad to “Available” for at least part of the country in a soft launch, updating the availability map in late May or June (even if hardware supply is limited).",
    "rationale": "- What we know: The government of Chad officially granted Starlink an operating license on March 13, 2025, with a policy goal of broadening access and keeping prices affordable. That signals political will and regulatory alignment, which are prerequisites for going live.\n- Typical timelines: In many African markets, Starlink has moved from license to availability in roughly 1–3 months when spectrum/type approvals and distribution are straightforward, though in some cases it takes longer (3–9 months) due to paperwork, importer setup, or pricing/FX issues. We are about two months post-license with ~1.5 months left until July 1.\n- Map-based resolution lowers the bar: The question resolves based on the availability map alone. Starlink can mark a country as “Available” once regulatory and operational minimums are in place, even if on-the-ground distribution is still ramping. Inter-satellite links reduce dependence on local gateways, which makes rapid activation more feasible post-license.\n- Headwinds specific to Chad: Landlocked logistics, potential customs/tax steps, and the need to align on retail pricing and authorized resellers could slow execution. Regional political/security dynamics can also prompt caution. These factors make an immediate flip less than certain.\n- Base-rate vs. status quo: The status quo is No. Good forecasting gives weight to inertia; many countries linger at “Coming Soon” for a while after licensing. However, 2025 has seen aggressive African expansion, and the March license plus government support nudges odds upward relative to pure inertia.\n- Why not higher? Two months have already elapsed without a visible map change; any unresolved type approvals/import pathways or reseller agreements could push activation past July. Chad is a smaller, more complex market than coastal peers, which can delay first shipments and retail presence.\n- Why not lower? The official license and public policy backing indicate intent to move soon, and Starlink’s recent cadence suggests a live-or-soft-launch pattern within a few months of approval. The map can flip before full-scale distribution.\n- What would move me up: Evidence of terminal type-approval published by Chadian authorities; Starlink’s map showing “Q2 2025” or a waitlist for Chad; announcements from an authorized in-country reseller; reports of kits clearing customs or arriving in N’Djamena.\n- What would move me down: New regulatory hurdles (pricing disputes, import restrictions), signals of postponed African rollouts, regional security/internet-control measures affecting satellite services, or the Starlink map updating to a later ETA (e.g., Q3/Q4 2025) for Chad.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill Starlink's website show Chad as a country with Starlink availability before July 1, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\n[SpaceX’s Starlink Secures License to Operate in Chad](https://spaceinafrica.com/2024/11/12/spacexs-starlink-secures-license-to-operate-in-chad/)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if, before July 1, 2025, the [Starlink Availability Map](https://www.starlink.com/us/map) has anywhere in Chad listed as \"Available.\"\n\n\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nOn March 13, 2025, the government of Chad officially granted Starlink an operating license. The stated goal is to enhance internet connectivity, particularly in remote areas where the existing 6,000 km of fiber optic infrastructure is insufficient, and to support educational and healthcare institutions. Government officials have stated that negotiations were conducted to ensure affordable pricing for the service.\n\nToday is 2025-05-15.\n\nBefore answering you think:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n(e) You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
