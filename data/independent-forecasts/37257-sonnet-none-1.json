    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Approximately 2 months remain until July 1, 2025",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No - currently no independence referendum has been officially scheduled by Republika Srpska authorities",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Republika Srpska leadership, despite ongoing tensions and rhetoric about independence, does not officially announce a referendum date before July 1, 2025. This could result from continued international pressure, internal political calculations, lack of sufficient support, or strategic decision to delay such announcements beyond the resolution date.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Milorad Dodik or the National Assembly of Republika Srpska officially announces a specific date for an independence referendum before July 1, 2025. This could occur as an escalation of existing tensions, as a response to perceived provocations from the central Bosnian government, or as a strategic move timed with Russian geopolitical interests in the region.",
    "rationale": "This forecast weighs heavily toward the status quo for several key reasons. First, while Milorad Dodik has repeatedly threatened referendums and secession over many years, these threats have consistently not materialized into official referendum scheduling. This pattern of rhetoric without follow-through is the strongest historical indicator. Second, the international community (EU, US, NATO) maintains strong opposition to unilateral secession attempts in Bosnia, creating substantial disincentives. Third, the research assistant found no additional information suggesting an imminent announcement, which in a 2-month timeframe would be notable if plans were advanced. The reference to Russian moves and Balkan tensions confirms this remains an active issue but doesn't indicate immediate action. However, I'm not forecasting lower because: (1) the region remains genuinely volatile with real separatist sentiment, (2) 2 months provides sufficient time for a political announcement if leadership chooses to escalate, (3) the question only requires an announcement, not actual implementation, making the bar lower, and (4) Dodik has shown willingness to make provocative moves for political leverage. I would update higher if: evidence emerges of concrete referendum planning, Dodik makes more specific statements about timing, or regional tensions dramatically escalate. I would update lower if: Dodik explicitly rules out near-term referendums, international pressure demonstrably increases, or we pass mid-June without movement.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nBefore July 1, 2025, will the government of Republika Srpska officially announce a date for an independence referendum?\n\nQuestion background:\nFair Observer: [Balkan Tinderbox: How Russia’s Moves Could Reignite Bosnia](https://www.fairobserver.com/politics/balkan-tinderbox-how-russias-moves-could-reignite-bosnia/)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if, before July 1, 2025, a referendum on the independence of Republika Srpska from Bosnia and Herzegovina is officially scheduled. If this does not occur before that date, this question resolves as **No**.\n\nFor purposes of this question, the referendum will be considered \"officially scheduled\" when it is announced by a person or entity with the authority to do so within Republika Srpska. Please note that broader legality, such as within Bosnia and Herzegovina, will be considered irrelevant for this question, so if the Bosnian government declared the referendum illegal, the question would still resolve as Yes.\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nNo additional information available.\n\nToday is 2025-05-02.\n\nBefore answering you think:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n(e) You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
