  "information": "The People's National Movement (PNM) is the incumbent party, having won the 2020 general election with 21 out of 41 seats. The main opposition, the United National Congress (UNC), won the remaining 19 seats. The country uses a first-past-the-post electoral system. Historically, the PNM has won the majority of general elections held since the year 2000.\n\nThe upcoming election on April 28, 2025, is an early election triggered by the resignation of former Prime Minister Keith Rowley. The PNM is now led by Prime Minister Stuart Young. Reports indicate that the opposition UNC has formed a coalition with the Congress of the People (COP). Among the issues raised during the campaign are high crime rates and concerns about electoral transparency, which prompted the presence of Commonwealth election observers. Former Attorney General John Jeremie has publicly endorsed the UNC.\n\nA poll conducted by Guardian TT between April 10-13, with research by pollster Hamid Ghany, indicated that the PNM was positioned to benefit from vote-splitting in Tobago's two key seats between the Tobago Progressive Democratic Patriots (TPP) and the Progressive Democratic Patriots (PDP), potentially allowing the PNM to win both. The same poll identified that 20% of the electorate was undecided or planning to split their vote. A separate poll by WIC News showed the UNC at 72% and the PNM at 18%.",

    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "About 7 days (election April 28, 2025; results likely same night or next day)",
    "status_quo_outcome": "Yes — PNM remains the largest party (they narrowly led in seats in 2020 under FPTP)",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "UNC consolidates anti-PNM sentiment in key Trinidad marginals and avoids vote-splitting in Tobago (e.g., effective coordination between PDP/TPP or tactical voting), flipping several close seats and finishing ahead of PNM; a tie for most seats would also resolve as No.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "PNM defends its Trinidad marginals, benefits from opposition vote-splitting (especially in Tobago’s two seats), and converts a near-even vote share into an efficient seat plurality under FPTP, ending slightly ahead of UNC.",
    "rationale": "- Baseline/status quo: PNM held a narrow seat lead after the last general election under first-past-the-post, and historically has often won pluralities. In FPTP, incumbents with efficiently distributed votes can retain a seat edge even with tight or slightly unfavorable national vote shares. That points modestly toward PNM.\n- Current cycle signals: The early election and leadership change (Rowley to Stuart Young) introduce risk for PNM amid salient crime concerns and general anti-incumbent pressures. UNC has allied with COP and received some notable endorsements (e.g., former AG John Jeremie), suggesting momentum on their side. Countervailing, a Guardian TT/Hamid Ghany poll snapshot (Apr 10–13) highlights 20% undecided and indicates PNM could benefit from Tobago vote-splitting between TPP and PDP, potentially capturing both Tobago seats — a meaningful structural edge if realized. The separate WIC News poll showing UNC 72% vs PNM 18% is starkly out of line with local context and seat arithmetic; it likely reflects low-quality/online sampling and gets low weight. \n- Seat mechanics: Tobago’s two seats are pivotal. If PDP/TPP split persists, PNM’s path to a plurality strengthens even if national sentiment is close. In Trinidad, a handful of marginals will decide the outcome; PNM’s incumbency and vote efficiency could offset modest swings against them, but a uniform anti-incumbent swing or unusually high UNC turnout in their heartlands could flip enough seats.\n- Why not higher than 58%: Crime, the leadership transition, early-election uncertainty, and potential opposition coordination (especially in Tobago) could break late against PNM. A late surge among undecideds toward change would imperil a PNM plurality.\n- Why not lower than 58%: The status quo favors PNM in seat distribution; FPTP often rewards the incumbent’s map. Credible local analysis flags Tobago vote-splitting that specifically advantages PNM. With 20% undecided, late noise need not translate into seat flips if PNM holds key marginals.\n- What would move me up: Credible seat-level polling or reporting showing PDP/TPP are both running strong in Tobago (i.e., split confirmed), plus indications PNM is ahead or holding in swing constituencies; robust ground game/turnout indicators for PNM.\n- What would move me down: Evidence of opposition consolidation in Tobago behind a single contender, reputable polls showing UNC ahead in multiple Trinidad marginals, or late-breaking scandals/crime shocks tied to PNM driving an anti-incumbent wave.",
