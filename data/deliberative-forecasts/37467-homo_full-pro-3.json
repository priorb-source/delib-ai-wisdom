    "review": "All three forecasters correctly identified the new $100 million financing facility as the key factor making bankruptcy unlikely within the very short timeframe. My initial forecast of 8% was higher than the others, reflecting a greater weight on the company's severe underlying distress. The other forecasters' analyses were convincing, particularly Forecaster 3's point that lenders would not provide a new facility if they anticipated an immediate bankruptcy filing. This implies the lenders' due diligence gave them confidence in survival for at least the near term. Forecaster 2's argument that the new cash, combined with existing reserves, definitively covers the operational cash burn for a period well beyond the July 1 deadline was also a crucial and well-articulated point. Their reasoning persuaded me that my initial forecast gave too much weight to the long-term fundamentals and not enough to the specific, short-term impact of this new liquidity.",
    "rationale": "I am updating my forecast downward from 8% to 4%. My initial analysis was correct in identifying the company's poor health but over-weighted the immediate risk of collapse. The other forecasters' arguments convinced me of the overwhelming significance of the new $100 million in financing as a near-term shield against bankruptcy. This capital injection, secured just before the forecast period, combined with existing cash reserves, makes a liquidity-driven filing before July 1, 2025, extremely improbable. The new loan is a clear sign from both management and the new lenders that the intent is to operate for at least the next several quarters. I am lowering my probability to 4%, which brings me much closer to the other forecasters' estimates. The remaining 4% reflects the non-zero tail risk associated with a deeply distressed and volatile company. An unexpected event, such as a major operational failure triggering a covenant breach on the new loan or the revelation of a major scandal, could still theoretically force a sudden filing, and this risk is higher than for a healthy company.",
