  "information": "The proposed acquisition of U.S. Steel by Nippon Steel, announced in December 2023, is valued at $14.1 billion, or $55 per share. The deal is currently under review by the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (CFIUS) due to national security concerns. President Joe Biden has officially blocked the merger, but the administration has delayed enforcement of the executive order until June 18, 2025. In response to the block, both Nippon Steel and U.S. Steel have filed lawsuits claiming the ruling was unconstitutional. The case is being handled by the U.S. Court of Appeals, with a decision expected by the June 18 deadline. In early May 2025, a Nippon Steel executive was scheduled to visit Washington for meetings with government officials and Pennsylvania to meet with union members. An alternative offer from Cleveland Cliffs and Nucor to purchase U.S. Steel for $30 per share has also been reported.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Approximately 6.5 weeks until July 1, 2025. A critical milestone is June 18, 2025, when the Biden administration's executive order enforcement begins and a court decision is expected.",
    "status_quo_outcome": "The merger is currently blocked by presidential order, with enforcement delayed until June 18, 2025, while both companies pursue legal challenges through the U.S. Court of Appeals.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "The merger does NOT collapse if: (1) the Court of Appeals overturns Biden's block as unconstitutional before June 18; (2) the parties negotiate a resolution addressing national security concerns; or (3) the companies continue their legal fight past July 1 without filing a formal termination notice, choosing to appeal further or seek other remedies rather than abandoning the deal.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "The merger collapses if: (1) the Court of Appeals upholds Biden's block by June 18 and one or both companies file Form 8-K terminating the agreement; (2) U.S. Steel's board accepts the alternative $30/share offer from Cleveland Cliffs/Nucor; or (3) the parties determine the legal and political obstacles are insurmountable and formally abandon the deal.",
    "rationale": "The status quo strongly suggests merger failure. Biden's presidential block on national security grounds is a formidable barrier, and such blocks are rarely overturned. The alternative $30/share bid provides U.S. Steel an exit option, albeit at a significant discount to Nippon's $55/share offer. However, three factors moderate the probability below 80-85%: First, the question requires a specific action - filing SEC Form 8-K announcing termination. Companies fighting legal battles often delay formal terminations while pursuing appeals, even when prospects are poor. With only 6.5 weeks until July 1, Nippon could receive an unfavorable court ruling on June 18 yet choose to appeal further rather than immediately terminate. Second, Nippon's continued engagement (May meetings in Washington and Pennsylvania) suggests they perceive some path forward, whether legal victory or negotiated compromise. Third, there's a small but non-negligible chance the constitutional challenge succeeds - presidential blocks of commercial transactions on national security grounds, while powerful, can face judicial scrutiny. What would move my forecast higher (toward 80-85%): Clear signals that U.S. Steel's board is seriously considering the Cleveland Cliffs alternative, leaked information that the court will rule against the companies, or statements from officials that no compromise is possible. What would move my forecast lower (toward 50-60%): Positive indications from the court proceedings for Nippon's constitutional arguments, reports of productive negotiations with the administration, or strong signals both companies will fight indefinitely regardless of initial court ruling. The 70% probability reflects high confidence the merger will ultimately fail, but meaningful uncertainty about whether formal termination occurs by the July 1 deadline versus companies continuing to fight.",

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
