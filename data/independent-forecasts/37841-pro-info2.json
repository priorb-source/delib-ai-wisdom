  "information": "The Metropolitan Police's Counter Terrorism Command is formally investigating the band over footage from two separate events. One investigation concerns a video from a 2024 concert where a band member allegedly said, 'The only good Tory is a dead Tory. Kill your local MP.' Another investigation relates to a 2023 concert where a band member appeared to chant, 'up Hamas, up Hezbollah.' Following public backlash, the band issued an apology to the families of murdered MPs Jo Cox and Sir David Amess. Several UK politicians and government ministers have publicly called for Glastonbury to remove Kneecap from the festival's lineup.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Approximately one month, with the festival scheduled for June 25-29, 2025.",
    "status_quo_outcome": "Yes. Kneecap are currently on the official Glastonbury 2025 lineup and the performance is scheduled to go ahead.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Glastonbury's organizers remove Kneecap from the lineup due to intense pressure from politicians and the public, and to mitigate the significant reputational, security, and potential legal risks arising from the ongoing Metropolitan Police Counter Terrorism Command investigation.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "The police investigation does not result in charges or a definitive negative statement before the festival date, and Glastonbury's organizers withstand the political pressure, allowing the performance to proceed as scheduled, potentially framing it as a commitment to artistic freedom.",
    "rationale": "The current status quo is that Kneecap are scheduled to perform, which provides a strong anchor for a 'Yes' outcome. However, the situation is highly volatile due to severe external pressures. The key factor against their performance is the active investigation by the UK's Counter Terrorism Command. The allegations, particularly expressing support for proscribed terrorist organizations like Hamas and Hezbollah, are exceptionally serious and represent a significant escalation from typical artist controversies over profanity or political statements. This elevates the risk for Glastonbury from a simple PR issue to a potential security and legal one. The public calls from government ministers for the band to be dropped add substantial political pressure that a major event like Glastonbury cannot easily ignore. While the festival has a history of embracing counter-culture and controversial artists, the specific nature of these allegations, tied to UK anti-terrorism laws, creates a uniquely challenging situation. My probability is not lower than 35% because, as of today, no action has been taken by the festival organizers. They may be waiting for a definitive outcome from the police investigation, and if no charges are brought before the event, they might proceed on the principle of 'innocent until proven guilty'. My probability is not higher than 35% because the reputational and security risks associated with a Counter Terrorism investigation are immense. It is more probable than not that a risk-averse decision will be made by the organizers or their insurers to cancel the performance to protect the festival's brand and ensure public safety. I would increase my forecast if the police cleared the band of wrongdoing. I would decrease it significantly if charges were filed or if a major sponsor withdrew.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill Kneecap perform at Glastonbury 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\n[Kneecap](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kneecap_\\(band\\)) are an Irish band who have significantly risen in popularity since their formation in 2017.&#x20;\n\nThe band is a trio consisting of: \"Mo Chara\" (Liam Óg Ó hAnnaidh), \"Móglaí Bap\" (Naoise Ó Caireallain), and \"DJ Próvaí\" (J. J. Ó Dochartaigh) whose songs consist of rap in a mixture of Irish Gaelic and English giving them a unique style.\n\nNamed after a [torture technique](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kneecapping) made infamous by the Irish Republican Army, the group are no stranger to controversies. Whilst most have been minor - complaints about profanity, drug use, violence in their songs, music videos and concerts, and promotion of Irish Republicanism - the band have come under a large amount of controversy resulting in cancelled performances which initially stemmed from a Coachcella performance where the band, \"described Israel's military action in Gaza as a US-funded genocide\".&#x20;\n\nOn top of this, [two reports were made](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/cly5r4gg7l6o) to the UK Metropolitan police:\n\n> \\[...] the band allegedly call for the death of Conservative MPs. Another seems to show a band member shouting \"up Hamas, up Hezbollah\". Both groups are banned in the UK and it is a crime to express support for them.\n\n> \\[...]\n\n> They claimed that footage where they appeared to say \"the only good Tory is a dead Tory\" had been \"taken out of all context\", and apologised for the hurt caused to the families of murdered MPs Jo Cox and Sir David Amess.\n\nThe band are [due](https://www.glastonburyfestivals.co.uk/line-up/) to play at Glastonbury 2025 - the UK's largest and most prestigious music festival - however there have been [calls](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/politics/2025/04/30/kneecap-should-be-banned-full-stop-after-dead-tories-video/) for the band to be removed from the lineup.\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question will resolve as **Yes** if Kneecap officially performs at Glastonbury 2025, scheduled for June 25 to June 29, 2025.\n\n* If Glastonbury 2025 does not take place before September 1, 2025 this question will be **annulled**.\n* Officially perform is defined as a planned performance as allowed by the festival organisers.\n* Any official performance is considered sufficient for this question. If, for example, one band member is banned from the festival, the question will still resolve as **Yes** if the other member(s) perform under the name Kneecap.\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nThe Metropolitan Police's Counter Terrorism Command is formally investigating the band over footage from two separate events. One investigation concerns a video from a 2024 concert where a band member allegedly said, 'The only good Tory is a dead Tory. Kill your local MP.'

Several UK politicians and government ministers have publicly called for Glastonbury to remove Kneecap from the festival's lineup.\n\nToday is 2025-05-23.\n\nBefore answering you think:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n(e) You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
