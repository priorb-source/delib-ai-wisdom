    "review": "Forecaster 2 and 3 both emphasize the narrow timing window and lack of specific public signals, which is a useful corrective to my earlier optimism. I agree with Forecaster 2’s weight on NASA’s “coming weeks and months” comment and the role of June venues as catalysts. Forecaster 3’s stricter base-rate framing using only 2025 (λ≈0.6/month, ~45%) is reasonable, and the point about status quo/no-action being the default is valid. However, I think Forecaster 3 underweights that June isn’t an average month: COPUOS and the Paris Air Show tend to bunch announcements, and recent signings have often had minimal advance press, so the absence of rumors has limited diagnostic value. Overall, their arguments nudge me slightly downward from my prior but keep me modestly above even odds.",
    "rationale": "Base rate: Depending on window, λ is about 0.6/month (Jan–May 2025) to 0.83/month (Dec 2024–May 2025), implying ~45% to ~56% chance of ≥1 signing in a given month under a Poisson assumption. June-specific factors likely raise the hazard rate vs an average month: the UN COPUOS main session and the Paris Air Show (biennial, June in odd years) frequently serve as venues for international space cooperation announcements. Additionally, acting NASA Administrator Petro’s May 22 statement about expecting more signings in the “coming weeks and months” suggests a live pipeline that could materialize in early summer. Offsetting this, there are no concrete public indications of a June ceremony, and slippage across the month boundary would resolve this as No. Given these cross-pressures, I trim my prior 61% slightly to reflect timing risk and the lack of specific rumors, but remain above 50% due to June’s event calendar and NASA’s signal.",
