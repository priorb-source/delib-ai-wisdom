    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Approximately 45 days until July 1, 2025",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No - Ukraine does not announce a presidential election date",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Ukraine remains under martial law due to the ongoing war with Russia. The security situation does not improve sufficiently to lift martial law or modify the constitutional prohibition on elections during wartime. The government continues operating under the existing framework with President Zelenskyy's term extended by martial law provisions, and no announcement of an election date is made before July 1, 2025.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "A significant breakthrough in peace negotiations occurs, leading to a ceasefire or peace agreement. Martial law is lifted or the Ukrainian parliament passes legislation enabling elections during reduced martial law. The government announces a specific date for presidential elections (even if the election itself would occur after July 1, 2025), responding to domestic or international pressure to restore normal democratic processes.",
    "rationale": "With only 45 days remaining until the resolution date, the status quo strongly favors No. Ukraine has been under martial law since February 24, 2022, when Russia invaded. Under Article 83 of the Ukrainian Constitution, elections cannot be held during martial law or a state of emergency. President Zelenskyy's term, which would normally have ended in May 2024, has been extended under these constitutional provisions. The ongoing active warfare, particularly along the eastern and southern fronts, makes it extremely difficult to conduct legitimate elections, especially in occupied or contested territories. For a Yes outcome, multiple significant changes would need to occur within 45 days: (1) a dramatic shift in the military/political situation enabling martial law to be lifted or modified, (2) a political decision by Ukrainian leadership to announce elections, and (3) legal framework adjustments. While peace negotiations have occurred periodically, there are no public indications of an imminent breakthrough that would enable such an announcement in this timeframe. My forecast is not higher because the structural barriers (ongoing war, martial law, constitutional restrictions) are substantial and unlikely to resolve in 45 days. It's not lower because unexpected diplomatic developments, even if unlikely, could occur, or the government could make a symbolic announcement of future elections as part of a peace process. I would update higher if credible reports emerged of advanced peace negotiations or government statements indicating plans to announce elections. I would update lower if the military situation deteriorated further or if Ukrainian officials explicitly ruled out near-term election announcements.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill Ukraine announce a presidential election before July 1, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\n[Next Ukrainian presidential election](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Next_Ukrainian_presidential_election)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if, before July 1, 2025, a specific date on which a presidential election will be held is officially announced by the government of Ukraine or any of its agencies that have the authority to do so. If no such announcement occurs before that date, this question resolves as No.\n\nThe election does not have to be held before July 1, 2025; this question resolves based on an announcement.\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nNo additional information available.\n\nToday is 2025-05-16.\n\nBefore answering you think:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n(e) You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
