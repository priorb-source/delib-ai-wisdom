    "review": "My initial forecast was too low, as it was singularly focused on the dire implications of the hypothetical \"liberation day tariffs\" mentioned in the prompt. Both other forecasters provided convincing arguments for why a 'Yes' outcome remains plausible. Forecaster 2 introduced the crucial point of implementation lags, correctly noting that the full negative impact of new tariffs might not be reflected in the April data, providing a short-term buffer. Forecaster 3's analysis was also very compelling, offering a detailed component-level breakdown of exports. They highlighted the significant, ongoing momentum in services exports and the support from elevated energy prices, both of which could offset weakness in goods trade. These arguments effectively challenge my initial assumption that a tariff shock would immediately and overwhelm all other factors.",
    "rationale": "I am significantly updating my forecast upward. My initial analysis overweighted the immediate impact of the tariff shock and underweighted key countervailing factors. The other forecasters' arguments have convinced me to revise my thinking. Specifically, I now give more weight to two factors: 1) Policy Lags: As Forecaster 2 argued, trade flows have inertia due to existing contracts and logistics. The negative effects of tariffs implemented in Q1 2025 may not fully depress the April 2025 export numbers. 2) Component Strength: As Forecaster 3 detailed, the US export picture is not monolithic. Strong momentum in services (like travel) and high nominal values for energy exports provide a substantial cushion that could offset a tariff-induced decline in manufactured goods. These two factors, combined with the tailwind of baseline inflation, make the hurdle for a year-over-year nominal increase much lower than I first assessed. The forecast now represents a toss-up between a significant negative policy shock and the combined positive forces of inflation, sector-specific momentum, and policy lags. My confidence is low, and a 50% forecast reflects that this is now a highly uncertain question with powerful arguments on both sides.",
