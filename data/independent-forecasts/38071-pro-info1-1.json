  "information": "Six Democrats are running in the June 17 primary for Virginia lieutenant governor: Alex Bastani, State Sen. Ghazala F. Hashmi, Babur B. Lateef, State Sen. Aaron R. Rouse, Victor Salgado, and former Richmond Mayor Levar Stoney. While the candidates agree on many core policies, such as repealing Virginia's right-to-work law and increasing the minimum wage, they differ on specific issues like gaming and education. Rouse, a former Virginia Beach City Council member, has sponsored legislation to strengthen protections for renters and to create a regulatory framework for the state's recreational cannabis market. Stoney has positioned himself as both business-friendly and committed to helping families. Hashmi, a former professor, highlights her six years of experience in the Senate.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "21 days",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No, as Aaron Rouse is one of several strong candidates in a crowded primary field, making it more likely that another candidate wins.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "One of his principal rivals, such as former Richmond Mayor Levar Stoney or State Senator Ghazala Hashmi, consolidates support among key Democratic constituencies in populous Northern Virginia, ultimately securing a plurality of the vote.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Aaron Rouse successfully leverages his profile as a former NFL player and his strong political base in the Hampton Roads region to drive high turnout, while his opponents split the vote in Central and Northern Virginia, allowing him to win with a narrow plurality.",
    "rationale": "My forecast of 25% reflects that Aaron Rouse is a top-tier contender in a very crowded and competitive Democratic primary, but not a clear frontrunner. The status quo in a race with at least three strong candidates (Rouse, Levar Stoney, Ghazala Hashmi) is that the field is favored against any single individual. Stoney has high name recognition as the former mayor of Richmond and a one-time gubernatorial candidate. Hashmi has a strong legislative record and base in the Richmond suburbs. Rouse's primary assets are his celebrity status and his solid base in the populous Hampton Roads region. In a multi-way primary, victory often depends on consolidating a regional base while preventing others from doing the same elsewhere. With the vote likely to be split geographically, no single candidate has an easy path. My probability is not higher because the field is too strong, particularly with a candidate of Stoney's profile. It is not lower because Rouse's own profile and regional strength give him a very plausible path to victory, placing him in the top tier of contenders. I would increase this forecast upon seeing polls showing Rouse in the lead or him securing major statewide endorsements (e.g., from labor unions or a senior federal official). I would decrease it if fundraising reports showed him significantly lagging his rivals or if key endorsements consolidated behind one of his opponents.",
