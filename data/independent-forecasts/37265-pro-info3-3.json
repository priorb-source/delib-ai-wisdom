  "information": "The US State Department's travel advisory system consists of four tiers: Level 1 (Exercise Normal Precautions), Level 2 (Exercise Increased Caution), Level 3 (Reconsider Travel), and Level 4 (Do Not Travel). Advisories are regularly reviewed and can be upgraded due to factors like a significant deterioration in security, increased terrorist activity, political instability, or civil unrest. A notable security concern for Tanzania is the insurgency in Mozambique's Niassa Reserve, which borders the country. Terrorist activity linked to Islamic extremism was reported in the area as recently as April 2025, creating potential spillover risks.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Approximately 2 months, with the question resolving on July 1, 2025.",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No. The current travel advisory for Tanzania is Level 2 ('Exercise Increased Caution'). If there are no significant changes to the security environment, the advisory level will not be raised.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "The security situation in Tanzania remains relatively stable through June 2025. While risks of crime and localized terrorism persist, particularly near the Mozambique border, they do not escalate to a level that the State Department deems a widespread threat to US citizens, and no major high-profile incidents occur.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "A significant deterioration in security occurs, most likely stemming from the insurgency in Mozambique. This could manifest as one or more high-profile terrorist attacks in a major Tanzanian city or tourist area, or a significant cross-border incursion that overwhelms local security forces, leading the State Department to conclude that the threat level warrants a 'Reconsider Travel' advisory.",
    "rationale": "My forecast is based on the strong tendency for bureaucratic assessments like travel advisories to remain unchanged absent a major catalyzing event. The current advisory for Tanzania is Level 2, which already accounts for existing risks from crime and terrorism. For an upgrade to Level 3, a significant negative change in the security landscape is required. The primary risk factor identified in the provided research is the spillover from the insurgency in northern Mozambique. While the reported extremist activity in April 2025 is a serious concern, this threat has been present for some time without triggering an upgrade for Tanzania as a whole. The short timeframe of under two months makes a significant escalation that prompts a change in advisory less likely. The status quo is the most probable outcome. My probability is not lower than 15% because the threat of spillover violence is real and active, making a triggering event plausible. A single major attack targeting foreigners could be sufficient to cause an immediate upgrade. My probability is not higher because it would require a major negative event to occur within a very short window, and such events are, by nature, difficult to predict and relatively infrequent. I would increase my forecast upon confirmed reports of major attacks in Tanzanian cities or a significant escalation of violence in the southern Mtwara Region. Conversely, a continued period of calm through May and early June would lead me to lower my forecast.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill Tanzania receive a \"Level 3 – Reconsider Travel\" travel advisory from the US State Department before July 1, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nTravel and Tour World: [Travel Advisory for Tanzania: How Increased Crime and Terrorism Threats Impact Tourists in Popular African Destinations](https://www.travelandtourworld.com/news/article/travel-advisory-for-tanzania-how-increased-crime-and-terrorism-threats-impact-tourists-in-popular-african-destinations/)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if the country of Tanzania has received a Level 3 [travel advisory](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/International-Travel-Country-Information-Pages/Tanzania.html) from the US Department of State before July 1, 2025.\n\n\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nThe US State Department's travel advisory system consists of four tiers: Level 1 (Exercise Normal Precautions), Level 2 (Exercise Increased Caution), Level 3 (Reconsider Travel), and Level 4 (Do Not Travel).

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
