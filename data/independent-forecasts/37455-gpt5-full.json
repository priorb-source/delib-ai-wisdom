  "information": "On April 14, 2025, the Lesotho Communications Authority (LCA) granted Starlink Lesotho a 10-year license to operate a satellite network and provide broadband services nationwide. Starlink Lesotho Pty Ltd, owned by Starlink Holdings Netherlands B.V., had submitted its application on January 24, 2025. The LCA had previously rejected a request from Starlink due to concerns over the company's lack of local ownership. The approval followed the imposition of a 50% US tariff on Lesotho in early April 2025. No official timeline for the service launch was provided at the time of the license grant.\n\nStarlink's service rollout timelines in other African nations have varied. In the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC), a license was granted around May 3-5, 2025, and service availability was announced by May 5, with the launch expected within days. The company also received a license from Somalia in April 2025. However, Starlink has faced regulatory challenges in other countries; it lacks a full operating license in South Africa, and authorities in Zimbabwe have asked the company to disconnect kits operating illegally in the country.\n\nStarlink's parent company, SpaceX, has a regional partnership with Airtel Africa to provide high-speed internet services to its customers across the continent. Geographically, Lesotho is a landlocked country, entirely surrounded by South Africa, where Starlink is not yet licensed to operate. The country has a small area of approximately 30,355 km² and is characterized by mountainous terrain.",

    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "About 54 days (through June 30, 2025, since the question resolves before July 1, 2025)",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No — as of May 7, 2025, Lesotho is not shown as Available on Starlink’s availability map.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Despite the April 14 license, Starlink delays turning on/advertising service due to remaining compliance steps (e.g., equipment type approval, tax and payments setup), distribution/logistics constraints for a landlocked country reliant on transit via South Africa, or caution about precise geofencing to avoid unauthorized use in South Africa. The map stays Coming Soon through June.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Starlink completes remaining local approvals and storefront setup, enables geofenced service for Lesotho, and updates the availability map to show at least part of Lesotho as Available in May or June, opening orders and/or shipping shortly thereafter.",
    "rationale": "- What we know: Lesotho granted Starlink a 10-year license on Apr 14, 2025. No official launch date. In the DRC, licensing in early May was followed by an availability announcement within about two days, suggesting Starlink can move very fast post-licensing when it chooses. Somalia also licensed in April. South Africa remains unlicensed, and Zimbabwe has pushed back on unauthorized kits.\n- Time left: ~54 days, which is ample based on recent fast activations elsewhere (e.g., DRC) but not guaranteed.\n- Status-quo weight: The map has not flipped yet more than three weeks after licensing; absent further action, the default outcome remains No. World changes slowly, and some countries have lagged between license and map availability due to administrative or operational readiness.\n- Arguments for Yes (why not lower):\n  • Demonstrated ability to switch on quickly post-license (DRC precedent).  \n  • PR incentive to add another African flag in Q2 2025.  \n  • Lesotho’s small geography makes geofencing straightforward; enabling Lesotho without enabling South Africa is technically feasible.  \n- Arguments for No (why not higher):\n  • Logistics and compliance may take time: equipment type approval, tax registration, payments, and authorized distribution.  \n  • Landlocked dependence on South African transit could complicate initial shipping, prompting Starlink to wait until logistics are ironed out before marking Available.  \n  • No public timeline from LCA or Starlink hints at potential internal gating items.\n- What would move me up: Evidence of type approval notices, Starlink store enabling Lesotho in the country dropdown with pricing, an LCA/Starlink announcement of imminent service, or third-party reseller partnerships in Lesotho. \n- What would move me down: Signs of additional regulatory conditions (e.g., local ownership or spectrum/landing rights still pending), customs/import frictions via South Africa, or Starlink prioritizing other markets first.\nNetting these, I place moderate weight on fast activation post-license (recent pattern) but retain meaningful risk for administrative/logistics delays in a small, SA-enclaved market. That yields a modestly above-even probability.",

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
