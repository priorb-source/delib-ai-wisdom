  "information": "Several prominent Democrats, including Governor Gretchen Whitmer and Secretary of Transportation Pete Buttigieg, have opted not to run for the Senate seat. Meanwhile, other Democratic candidates such as Mallory McMorrow and Abdul El-Sayed have already officially entered the race. As of late April 2025, Stevens had not filed any paperwork with the Federal Election Commission (FEC) to form an exploratory committee.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "About 9 days (until 2025-05-01)",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Stevens continues to signal she’s focused on her House seat, makes no Senate-related moves, and the date passes without an announcement.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "A credible report leaks that Stevens is staffing up and calling donors; within days she holds a launch event or posts a formal statement/video announcing a Senate run before May 1.",
    "rationale": "- Short window: With ~9 days left, most plausible timelines require preexisting prep (hiring staff, donor calls, draft launch materials). There’s no public evidence of that yet.\n- Status quo favors No: As of late April, per the research assistant, Stevens has not filed any FEC paperwork for an exploratory effort and has not announced. Most potential candidates do not move from quiet consideration to full launch within a week absent clear signals.\n- Field dynamics: Multiple Democrats (e.g., Mallory McMorrow, Abdul El-Sayed) are reportedly already in. High-profile figures (Whitmer, Buttigieg) have declined, and CNN coverage suggests others have bowed out as well. If Stevens were imminent, we would typically see trial balloons or sourcing in local/political press by now. The lack of visible smoke argues against a sudden announcement within days.\n- Why not higher: If Stevens intended to capitalize on Q2 fundraising, a mid-April launch would have been natural, especially after Whitmer/Buttigieg bowed out by April 10. The absence of preparatory signals and filings makes a rapid pivot less likely.\n- Why not lower: It’s still early in the 2026 cycle, and some candidates do launch without exploratory committees. If party stakeholders are uneasy with the current field, they could encourage a quick Stevens entry, and she could announce first and handle filings within the FEC’s post-threshold window.\n- What would move me up: Credible reporting (Politico/Bridge Michigan/Detroit News/Free Press) that Stevens is making donor calls, hiring consultants, reserving URLs, or scheduling a launch; a public statement that she’s ‘seriously exploring’ with a near-term timeline; staff departures from her House office to a campaign vehicle.\n- What would move me down: A public Shermanesque statement declining, endorsement of another candidate, or fresh reporting that she will seek House reelection and is not considering the Senate.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill Haley Stevens announce her candidacy for US Senator from Michigan before May 1, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nCNN: [Democrats lose another top contender for US Senate seat in Michigan after Whitmer and Buttigieg bow out](https://www.cnn.com/2025/04/10/politics/michigan-senate-race-democrats-mcdonald-rivet/index.html)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if Haley Stevens announces her candidacy for US Senator from Michigan before May 1, 2025. If no such announcement has been made before that date, the question resolves as **No**.\n\n\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nSeveral prominent Democrats, including Governor Gretchen Whitmer and Secretary of Transportation Pete Buttigieg, have opted not to run for the Senate seat. Meanwhile, other Democratic candidates such as Mallory McMorrow and Abdul El-Sayed have already officially entered the race. As of late April 2025, Stevens had not filed any paperwork with the Federal Election Commission (FEC) to form an exploratory committee.\n\nToday is 2025-04-21.\n\nBefore answering you think:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n(e) You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
