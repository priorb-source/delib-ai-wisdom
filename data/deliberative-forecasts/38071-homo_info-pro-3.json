    "review": "The other two forecasters provided compelling arguments that have caused me to revise my initial assessment. Both correctly identified Levar Stoney as the probable frontrunner, a point my analysis noted but perhaps under-weighted. Forecaster 2's framing of the race as 'the field vs. any single individual' is a useful heuristic in a crowded primary. Forecaster 3's analysis was particularly influential, introducing two crucial pieces of information I hadn't fully considered: the race consists of six candidates, not just the three mentioned in my initial poll data, and Stoney holds a significant fundraising lead of approximately $1.4 million. The larger field fragments the opposition, and the fundraising disparity gives Stoney a major advantage in communicating with undecided voters in the campaign's final weeks. Their reasoning, especially the introduction of new, hard data, was highly convincing.",
    "rationale": "I am updating my forecast downward from 40% to 30%. My initial 40% forecast was based heavily on a poll showing 63% of voters were undecided, which I interpreted as creating a highly volatile environment where a 6-point polling deficit was easily surmountable. While the race remains fluid, the arguments from the other forecasters have convinced me that I underestimated the structural advantages held by the frontrunner, Levar Stoney. The confirmation of a six-candidate field means the non-Stoney vote is likely to be more fractured, making it harder for a single challenger like Rouse to consolidate support. More importantly, Stoney's significant fundraising advantage is a decisive factor in a primary's closing weeks, allowing his campaign to finance the advertising and get-out-the-vote (GOTV) efforts necessary to win over a large bloc of undecideds. Aaron Rouse remains a top-tier candidate with a clear path to victory, but these factors make his path considerably more difficult than I first believed. A 30% probability better reflects his position as a strong, credible underdog rather than a co-favorite in the race.",
