    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "46 days (from May 16, 2025 to July 1, 2025)",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No - the objective remains marked as 'in progress' rather than 'complete'",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Congressional efforts to defund NPR and PBS face procedural delays or opposition. While some preliminary steps may occur (committee hearings, proposed amendments), no final legislation passes both chambers and gets signed into law by July 1. Alternatively, executive actions are taken but the tracker maintainers assess them as insufficient to mark the objective as 'complete,' keeping it in 'in progress' status.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "The administration issues an executive order or directive that immediately halts federal funding to CPB (Corporation for Public Broadcasting), which funds NPR and PBS. The tracker maintainers assess this action as sufficiently achieving the objective and update the status to 'complete' within days. Alternatively, Congress passes and the president signs legislation eliminating CPB funding on an accelerated timeline, and the tracker is updated accordingly before July 1.",
    "rationale": "This question hinges on two factors: (1) actual policy implementation to stop NPR/PBS funding, and (2) the Keep_Track subreddit maintainers' assessment that the objective is 'complete.' The 46-day timeframe is quite short. The current 'in progress' status suggests some momentum toward the objective but that substantial work remains. For a 'complete' designation, I would expect either comprehensive legislation or definitive executive action that functionally ends federal funding. Legislative action faces significant hurdles: appropriations bills typically move slowly, and completely defunding CPB would likely face Senate opposition and procedural obstacles. A 46-day timeline makes comprehensive legislation unlikely. Executive action is more plausible—the president could direct OMB to withhold funds or take similar administrative steps. However, even if such action occurs, the tracker maintainers would need to assess it as 'complete' rather than maintaining 'in progress' status if legal challenges or implementation questions remain. The status quo strongly favors No: objects marked 'in progress' typically don't reach completion within 6 weeks unless there's an imminent forcing event. My forecast would be higher if we were closer to a budget deadline or if there were reports of imminent executive orders. It would be lower if the timeline were longer (giving more certainty to the status quo) or if there were explicit reports that funding decisions had been deferred to later in 2025.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill the Project 2025 Tracker spreadsheet have the objective of stopping funding for NPR and PBS marked as complete before July 1, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nAt the time of this question, the objective was marked as \"in progress.\" The 2025 Tracker is a project of the Keep_Track subreddit and is explained [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/Keep_Track/comments/1ii7tbr/project_2025_tracker_is_now_live/).\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if the Project 2025 objective to \"stop funding for NPR and PBS\" is marked as complete according to [this spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1QGG6wNHna-1tt91yXNkOauAJJ7snobFjfEnmxlmzhl4/edit?gid=0#gid=0) before July 1, 2025. If it is anything other than complete (such as \"in progress\") when accessed by Metaculus on or after July 1, 2025, then the question resolves as **No**.\n\n\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nNo additional information available.\n\nToday is 2025-05-16.\n\nBefore answering you think:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n(e) You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
