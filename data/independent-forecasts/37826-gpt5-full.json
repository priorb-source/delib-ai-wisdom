  "information": "Following a terrorist attack in Pahalgam, Jammu and Kashmir on April 22, 2025, which killed 26 tourists, the Indian government took several actions against Pakistan. These included suspending the Indus Water Treaty, closing the Attari-Wagah border, and banning the SAARC visa scheme for Pakistan. The Indian military launched 'Operation Sindoor' (also referred to as 'Operation Sundar'), a series of targeted strikes against what were described as terrorist camps in Pakistan-occupied Kashmir and Pakistan proper. Indian sources reported that over 100 terrorists were killed in these operations, including high-value targets. The operation targeted infrastructure linked to groups like Lashkar-e-Taiba and Jaish-e-Mohammed.\n\nAfter India's initial strikes, a period of military escalation occurred. The Indian Army reported that on the night of May 8-9, 2025, Pakistan launched multiple attacks using drones and missiles targeting military stations at Jammu, Pathankot, and Udhampur, and committed numerous ceasefire violations along the Line of Control. India stated that these threats were neutralized using kinetic and non-kinetic means with no casualties or material losses reported on the Indian side. India conducted retaliatory strikes, with reports claiming the destruction of a Pakistani post, a terrorist launch pad, and 11 Pakistani airbases. After several days of tension, a ceasefire was agreed upon on May 10, 2025, following direct talks between the two countries' Directors-General of Military Operations (DGMOs). Subsequently, Pakistani intelligence sources reported an agreement for both sides to withdraw troops to their pre-conflict positions by the end of May.\n\nIn the aftermath of the military engagements, India initiated a diplomatic offensive. The government dispatched seven all-party delegations to 32 countries for a diplomatic push scheduled between May 21 and June 5. These delegations were provided with 'talking points' and a 150-page dossier detailing India's position on cross-border terrorism. Politically, the Indian Prime Minister announced a new doctrine of 'no tolerance for terror that hides under nuclear blackmail'. In parallel, the Indian Army Chief, General Upendra Dwivedi, granted 'full authority' to the Western Commanders to retaliate with kinetic actions in response to any future violations of the ceasefire agreement by Pakistan.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "About 40 days (resolution on July 1, 2025)",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No – no Indian kinetic strike in Pakistan’s Sindh, Balochistan, Punjab, or Khyber Pakhtunkhwa during June 2025.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "The May 10 ceasefire holds and both sides complete the agreed pullback by end-May. June features quiet or only contained incidents along the LoC in Pakistan-administered Kashmir (which would not count). India sustains a diplomatic campaign and avoids cross-border kinetic action into Pakistan’s four provinces.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "A significant Pakistani provocation in late May or June—such as a major cross-border ceasefire violation across the international border, or a mass-casualty terror attack in India credibly linked to Pakistan-based groups—triggers a punitive Indian response that hits a target in Pakistan proper (e.g., an air/drone/missile/artillery strike in Punjab or Khyber Pakhtunkhwa).",
    "rationale": "Baseline: Cross-border Indian kinetic strikes into Pakistan proper are historically rare (e.g., Balakot 2019). Most Indo-Pak kinetic exchanges occur along the Line of Control in Pakistan-administered Kashmir, which would not satisfy this market’s criteria. The default, absent a new shock, is therefore No.\n\nCurrent context from the research assistant: After the April 22 Pahalgam attack, India undertook ‘Operation Sindoor/Sundar’ against militant infrastructure, reportedly including strikes in Pakistan-administered Kashmir and possibly Pakistan proper; Pakistan then used drones/missiles on May 8–9 against Indian military sites, followed by Indian retaliatory strikes. A ceasefire was agreed May 10 via DGMO talks, with reported mutual pullback to pre-conflict positions by end-May. India launched a diplomatic push (May 21–June 5). Politically, India articulated a tougher doctrine and the Army Chief granted Western Commanders ‘full authority’ to conduct kinetic retaliation to any future ceasefire violations.\n\nWhy not higher: • The ceasefire plus planned pullback by end-May indicates de-escalation. • India has incentives to consolidate diplomatic gains and avoid renewed conflict during the June window. • Strikes in Pakistan proper carry higher escalation risks than actions in Pakistan-administered Kashmir, so leaders are likely to reserve them for exceptional provocations. • International pressure typically rises quickly against renewed cross-border strikes.\n\nWhy not lower: • The environment is still tense following April–May events, with explicit authority for commanders to retaliate kinetically. • If Pakistan conducts a notable violation across the international border (opposite India’s Jammu/Punjab sectors) or there is a fresh, high-profile terror attack in India, decision thresholds for a punitive strike in Pakistan proper become lower than in a typical month. • India has recent precedent for deep strikes (e.g., Balakot 2019), and the RA report suggests India already accepted higher risk in early May.\n\nUpdate signals: I would raise the probability if we see (a) credible reports of significant Pakistani ceasefire violations across the international border in the Jammu–Punjab sector, (b) a mass-casualty terror incident in India with attribution to Pakistan-based groups, (c) forward deployment/alerts of Indian strike aircraft, missile units, or NOTAMs indicating imminent air activity, (d) evacuation orders or media reports of heavy artillery duels on the IB. I would lower it if (a) verified mutual pullbacks are completed and the border stays quiet into early/mid-June, (b) clear signs of sustained diplomatic engagement and external pressure for restraint, (c) public rhetoric from New Delhi turns notably de-escalatory.\n\nNet assessment: With de-escalation steps in place and the high bar for striking Pakistan proper, the most likely outcome in June is No, but the risk remains materially above peacetime due to the recent crisis and the stated readiness to retaliate.",
