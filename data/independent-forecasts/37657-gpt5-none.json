    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "About 46 days (until July 1, 2025)",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "HKU5-CoV-2 remains detected only in animals or environmental samples; no verified human infections are identified, or any suspected infections are not confirmed and thus not reported by WHO/CDC before July 1, 2025.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "A zoonotic spillover or lab-associated exposure leads to at least one confirmed human infection, is sequenced and attributed specifically to HKU5-CoV-2, and is reported by a credible source (e.g., WHO Disease Outbreak News or a CDC advisory) before July 1, 2025.",
    "rationale": "- Time horizon: Only ~6.5 weeks remain. For a newly highlighted bat coronavirus lineage, the window is short for spillover detection, confirmation, nomenclature alignment, and official reporting.\n- Base rates: Dozens of novel bat coronaviruses are discovered each year; very few cause verified human infections, and confirmation/official communication often takes months. Since 2003, only a handful of coronaviruses have been confirmed in humans (SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, SARS-CoV-2); most bat CoVs do not spill over or are not detected in humans in near-term windows after discovery.\n- Naming/reporting hurdle: The resolution requires human cases of HKU5-CoV-2 reported by credible sources. WHO/CDC are conservative about naming; even if a novel human case occurred, it might initially be reported as an unidentified or “novel coronavirus” before any specific HKU5-CoV-2 designation is agreed, lowering the near-term resolution chance.\n- Current signals: The prompt indicates the criteria have not yet been satisfied, and my research assistant found no additional information—suggesting no known human cases or imminent official reports as of May 16, 2025.\nWhy not higher: The short time left, low base rate of immediate human detection post-discovery, and the need for specific, credible-source attribution to HKU5-CoV-2 suppress the probability. A WHO/CDC report would likely follow verification, which is time-consuming.\nWhy not lower: Non-zero tail risk remains—e.g., a localized zoonotic spillover akin to MERS-like events, a lab-associated infection, or intensified surveillance around the discovery site uncovering a human case that is rapidly sequenced and publicly reported.\nUpdates that would move me up: (1) Evidence HKU5-CoV-2 uses a human receptor (e.g., DPP4) efficiently, (2) reports of animal or intermediate-host infections near humans, (3) clusters of pneumonia of unknown etiology with sequencing pointing to a Merbecovirus closely matching HKU5-CoV-2, (4) any WHO/CDC risk assessment or DON mentioning HKU5-CoV-2 specifically, (5) credible preprints/agency reports of a confirmed human case pending official notice.\nUpdates that would move me down: (1) Passage of 2–3 more weeks with no relevant signals, (2) clarification that HKU5-CoV-2 has poor human cell entry, (3) lack of any animal infections near humans or negative targeted surveillance results.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill there be any human cases of the novel coronavirus, HKU5-CoV-2, before July 1, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\n[Discovery of HKU5-CoV-2, a Novel Coronavirus in China](https://assure-test.com/discovery-of-hku5-cov-2-a-novel-coronavirus-in-china/)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if before July 1, 2025, there are any human cases reported anywhere globally of HKU5-CoV-2.\n\nQuestion resolves according to [credible sources](https://www.metaculus.com/help/faq/#definitions), especially the World Health Organization or US Centers for Disease Control.\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nNo additional information available.\n\nToday is 2025-05-16.\n\nBefore answering you think:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n(e) You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
