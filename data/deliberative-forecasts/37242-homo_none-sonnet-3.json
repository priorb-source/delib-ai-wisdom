    "review": "Forecaster 3 raises a crucial calendar effect I completely missed: Easter timing. Easter 2024 fell on March 31, placing most Easter holiday travel in March 2024, while Easter 2025 falls on April 20, placing the entire Easter holiday period within April 2025. This is a significant structural advantage for April 2025 numbers, as Easter drives substantial European tourism to the Canaries. This is the most substantive new evidence presented and strongly favors continued growth rather than decline. Forecaster 2's analysis aligns closely with mine but doesn't add major new considerations beyond reinforcing the status quo bias. Both forecasters appropriately emphasize the limited US tourism exposure and recent growth trends. All three analyses converge on low probability of decline (22-28% range), but Forecaster 3's Easter timing argument provides concrete reasoning for the lower end of that range.",
    "rationale": "The Easter calendar effect is compelling and changes my analysis significantly. With Easter holiday travel shifting from March 2024 to April 2025, there's a structural reason to expect April 2025 to outperform April 2024, independent of underlying tourism trends. Combined with the established growth trend (February 2025 up 2.2%), limited US tourist exposure, and absence of reported disruptions in April 2025, the case for decline weakens considerably. I'm updating my forecast downward from 28% to 24%. I'm not going as low as 22% because: (1) we lack March 2025 data to confirm trend continuation between February and April, (2) economic conditions in key European markets (UK, Germany) in Q1-Q2 2025 remain uncertain to me, and (3) without actual booking data or preliminary April reports, some residual uncertainty is warranted. However, the Easter timing argument is strong enough to shift my probability notably lower.",
