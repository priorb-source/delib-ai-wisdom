  "information": "As of April 30, 2025, the official UN OCHA impact snapshot reported 295 UN staff fatalities in Gaza. Reports from late April cited UNRWA stating that 295 of its personnel had died since October 7, 2023. This number reflects a steady increase over time; a UN report on March 19, 2025, had stated at least 280 UN employees were killed, and an OCHA report cited on January 9, 2025, listed 263 UNRWA staff fatalities. Broader figures for humanitarian workers indicate a higher total toll; an OCHA report on April 23, 2025, stated that at least 418 humanitarian workers, including the 295 UN staff, had been killed in Gaza since the conflict began. A specific incident on March 23, 2025, resulted in the deaths of 15 humanitarian personnel, including staff from the Palestinian Red Crescent and one UN staff member.\n\nThe United Nations has warned of a worsening humanitarian crisis in Gaza, exacerbated by a blockade that severely restricts access to aid, food, water, and medical supplies. In early May 2025, UN Emergency Relief Coordinator Tom Fletcher called the aid blockade a form of 'cruel collective punishment,' noting that over 3,000 aid trucks were stalled at the border. According to OCHA reports from late April and early May 2025, insecurity and access restrictions have compelled humanitarian organizations to close nutrition centers. The same reports indicated an 80% rise in children being treated for malnutrition and that 65% of residents lack access to clean drinking water. The UN Population Fund also announced it had exhausted its supply of emergency shelter materials and hygiene products.\n\nOn May 5, 2025, Israel's security cabinet reportedly approved a plan to intensify military operations in the Gaza Strip. This follows a period of renewed violence since a ceasefire broke down in mid-March 2025. The UN has described Gaza as one of the most dangerous places in the world for humanitarian workers, with its personnel and facilities at risk from military activity. The UN's Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) has stated that humanitarian efforts are severely hindered by severe restrictions on movement within the territory. The International Red Cross also noted that the deteriorating security situation is hindering the work of its staff and partners.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Less than two months. The outcome will be determined by the UN OCHA report published just before July 1, 2025.",
    "status_quo_outcome": "Yes. The current reported total is 295 UN staff killed. With the conflict ongoing, the recent rate of casualties (approximately one UN staff member every 3-4 days) indicates the threshold of 300 will be crossed.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Fewer than five additional UN staff are killed before the resolution date. This would almost certainly require an immediate, durable, and effective ceasefire that halts major military operations and prevents further casualties among humanitarian workers.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "At least five more UN staff are reported killed before July 1, 2025. This occurs if the conflict continues at its current intensity or escalates as recent reports suggest is planned, leading to further deaths among UN personnel operating in a hazardous environment.",
    "rationale": "My forecast is based on three key factors: the low number of additional fatalities needed, the established trend of casualties, and the current geopolitical context. As of April 30, 2025, the reported death toll was 295, just five short of the 300 threshold. The fatality rate among UN staff has been consistent, with an increase of 15 deaths in the 42 days prior to April 30. Extrapolating this rate over the remaining ~57 days until the deadline makes it highly probable that at least five more deaths will occur. Most importantly, the research indicates an intent to intensify military operations in Gaza, as approved by Israel's security cabinet on May 5, 2025. This escalation, combined with the already severe humanitarian crisis and dangerous operating conditions for aid workers, makes further UN staff casualties almost inevitable. The probability is not higher to account for the small chance of an unforeseen, sudden, and lasting ceasefire. My forecast would decrease significantly only with credible intelligence pointing to an imminent and durable peace agreement. It would increase with reports of any new UN staff fatalities.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill 300 or more UN staff be reported to be killed in Gaza according to UN's OCHA in its final impact snapshot before July 1, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nSee accompanying Humanitarian update [here](https://www.ochaopt.org/content/humanitarian-situation-update-284-gaza-strip).\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if the number of reported UN staff killed in Gaza is greater than or equal to 300 according to the most recent impact snapshot for the Gaza Strip posted [here](https://www.ochaopt.org/publications) by the United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs as of July 1, 2025. For example, a snapshot dated April 30, 2025, [reports](https://www.ochaopt.org/content/reported-impact-snapshot-gaza-strip-30-april-2025) 295 UN staff fatalities.\n\nIf OCHA stops posting new updates, this resolves as the most recent number, which as of the time of this question would be the impact snapshot posted on April 30, 2025.\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nAs of April 30, 2025, the official UN OCHA impact snapshot reported 295 UN staff fatalities in Gaza.

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
