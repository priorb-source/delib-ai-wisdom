    "review": "- Useful additions: Forecaster 2 emphasized cross-border security coordination (Secret Service/RCMP) and raised the Canada-specific political optics, plus the Rogan “boycott” context. Forecaster 3 grounded things with a base rate (Trump attends ~5–10% of all UFC events) and argued that recent attendance and tight spacing reduce odds.\n- Convincing elements: The base-rate framing is strong and aligns with my prior. The Canada venue historically having zero presidential attendance is salient. Cross-border security/logistics is a real friction. The lack of pre-event signaling 12 days out also matters.\n- Weaker elements: The Rogan boycott/Canada-critique is a soft, indirect proxy for Trump’s behavior; I’d treat that as marginal evidence. The claim that he is currently serving as President (Forecaster 3) is unverified here; I won’t anchor on it. The assertion that he just attended a Miami UFC in April 2025 may be true but I can’t confirm; I’ll weight it lightly as a plausible but uncertain downwards nudge.\n- Net: Their inputs nudge me slightly lower than my initial 10%, mainly due to the base-rate emphasis and added cross-border complexity, but I discount unverifiable claims.",
    "rationale": "Baseline: Trump’s historical UFC attendance rate is in the single digits per event. UFC 315 is in Montreal, adding immigration/entry and cross-border security coordination, which raises planning hurdles. There’s no precedent for a sitting or former U.S. president attending a UFC event in Canada. With ~12 days to go, there are no strong public signals (permits, security prep chatter, schedule hints) pointing to attendance. \nUpside tail: Trump’s unpredictability, his closeness to Dana White, and UFC’s ability to facilitate VIP logistics mean a surprise appearance is not impossible, especially if his schedule places him nearby and Canadian entry is feasible. \nUpdate: I trim from 10% to 9% to reflect the reinforced base-rate argument and the added cross-border friction highlighted by the other forecasters. I apply only a small adjustment because some of their claims (e.g., April 2025 Miami attendance, current presidential status) are unverified here and I already accounted for many of the logistical hurdles in my prior.\nWhat would move me up: Credible reporting of planned attendance, signs of Canadian entry clearance/permit if needed, visible security coordination in Montreal, or direct hints from Trump/UFC. Down: Confirmed conflicting commitments, clear immigration obstacles/denial, or explicit statements that he will not attend.",
