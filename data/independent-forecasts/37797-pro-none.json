    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "About one month. The FATF Plenary is in June 2025, and the results are typically published at its conclusion.",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No. The FATF 'black list' of High-Risk Jurisdictions subject to a Call for Action remains unchanged, consisting of North Korea, Myanmar, and Iran.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "The FATF June 2025 Plenary concludes without making any additions to or removals from its 'High-Risk Jurisdictions subject to a Call for Action' list. The FATF determines that North Korea and Iran have not made sufficient progress, Myanmar's situation does not warrant a change in status, and no other jurisdiction meets the criteria for being added to the list.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Following its June 2025 Plenary, the FATF announces the addition of a new jurisdiction to the black list due to a severe and unaddressed deterioration in its anti-money laundering and counter-terrorist financing (AML/CFT) regime. Alternatively, though far less likely, the FATF could remove a country, such as Myanmar, if it demonstrated unexpected, rapid, and verifiable progress on its action plan.",
    "rationale": "My forecast is based on the significant inertia of the FATF lists. Changes to the 'black list' are infrequent and require a strong consensus among member states.\n\n1.  **Likelihood of Removals:** The probability of removing any of the three currently listed jurisdictions is extremely low. North Korea and Iran have been on the list for extended periods due to deep-seated structural deficiencies and a lack of political will to reform. Their removal is not a credible short-term prospect. Myanmar was added in October 2022 following the military coup, and the ongoing political instability and conflict make it highly unlikely that it could implement and verify the sweeping reforms required for delisting by June 2025.\n\n2.  **Likelihood of Additions:** Adding a new jurisdiction is the FATF's most severe censure, typically preceded by a period on the 'grey list' and a clear failure to cooperate. While the current geopolitical climate is tense, and there has been discussion about blacklisting countries like Russia, such a move would be a major escalation. There have been no strong public signals from the FATF or its key members to suggest such a move is imminent for the June plenary.\n\nMy probability is not lower than 5 because the global situation is volatile, and a surprise addition resulting from a sudden event or a shift in political consensus cannot be entirely ruled out. This small probability almost entirely reflects the chance of an addition, not a removal.\n\nMy probability is not higher because there is no concrete evidence pointing towards a change. The default outcome for any given FATF plenary is no change to the black list. I would need to see credible reports of a country being under serious consideration for addition, or verifiable evidence of major reforms in Myanmar, to increase my forecast.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill any jurisdictions be added to or removed from the FATF \"black list\" following the FATF Plenary meeting in June 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nWikipedia: [Financial Action Task Force blacklist](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Financial_Action_Task_Force_blacklist)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if following its June 2025 plenary, the Financial Action Task Force (FATF) has made any changes to its \"High-Risk Jurisdictions subject to a Call for Action\" list, which at the time of this question consists of North Korea, Myanmar and Iran. Resolves according to the [official list](https://www.fatf-gafi.org/en/countries/black-and-grey-lists.html).\n\nThe question may resolve according to [credible sources](https://www.metaculus.com/help/faq/#definitions) in case the website is unavailable or not timely updated.\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nNo additional information available.\n\nToday is 2025-05-19.\n\nBefore answering you think:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n(e) You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
