  "information": "According to a June 11, 2025 snapshot, Google’s Gemini-2.5-Pro model ranked first on the Chatbot Arena leaderboard with an Elo score of 1478, while OpenAI’s best model was 53 points behind. The competitive landscape in early 2025 has been characterized by a narrowing gap between top models; the Elo score difference between the top-ranked and 10th-ranked model decreased from 11.9% in 2024 to 5.4% in early 2025. Previous leaderboard leaders in 2025 have included Grok-3 by xAI, which held the top spot in February.",

    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Approximately 2 weeks. The question resolves on or after July 1, 2025, and today is June 15, 2025.",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No. As of June 11, 2025, Google's Gemini-2.5-Pro is ranked #1, and OpenAI's best model is in a lower position.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Google's Gemini-2.5-Pro maintains its lead, or another competitor model from a company like xAI or Anthropic holds the top spot. OpenAI does not release a new model or an update significant enough to bridge the 53-point Elo gap by the end of the quarter.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "OpenAI releases a new, significantly more capable model (e.g., an early version of GPT-5 or a major update to GPT-4o) in the final weeks of June. This model is quickly added to the Chatbot Arena and proves to be a strong favorite in head-to-head user comparisons, allowing it to rapidly gain Elo points and claim the #1 rank by July 1, 2025.",
    "rationale": "My forecast is primarily based on the current state of the leaderboard and the short time remaining. The status quo is a strong predictor, and currently, Google's Gemini-2.5-Pro holds a significant 53-point Elo lead over OpenAI's top model. With only about two weeks until the resolution date, overcoming this gap is a substantial challenge. The research indicates that the competitive landscape is tightening, with multiple actors capable of holding the top spot, as evidenced by xAI's Grok-3 leading earlier in the year. This multi-polar environment makes it harder for any single company to dominate.\n\nHowever, the probability is not lower because OpenAI has a consistent history of releasing state-of-the-art models that leapfrog the competition. The pressure to reclaim the top spot is immense, and a strategic release of a new flagship model before the end of Q2 is a plausible, high-impact event that cannot be discounted. The primary barrier is the logistical and statistical challenge of a new model being deployed, evaluated by a sufficient number of users, and having its Elo rating stabilize at the #1 position within such a compressed timeframe.\n\nThe forecast is not higher because the burden of proof lies with the challenger. Without a confirmed release from OpenAI, the default expectation must be that the current leader, Google, will maintain its position. The existing 53-point gap is a concrete disadvantage, while a potential OpenAI model release is still speculative.\n\nI would increase my forecast upon any credible announcement or leak of an imminent, major new model release from OpenAI. I would decrease my forecast if a competitor releases another powerful model or if the end of June approaches with no news from OpenAI.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill an OpenAI model be ranked #1 overall on the Chatbot Arena Leaderboard at the end of the 2nd Quarter of 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nMethodology: [Chatbot Arena: An Open Platform for Evaluating LLMs by Human Preference](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.04132)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if a model owned by OpenAI is in the number 1 overall rank (ties count) at the [Chatbot Arena Leaderboard](https://lmarena.ai/leaderboard) when accessed by Metaculus on or after July 1, 2025. If this is not the case, this question resolves as **No**.\n\nScroll down to Arena Overview and the resolution is based on the \"overall\" rank.\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nAccording to a June 11, 2025 snapshot, Google’s Gemini-2.5-Pro model ranked first on the Chatbot Arena leaderboard with an Elo score of 1478, while OpenAI’s best model was 53 points behind. The competitive landscape in early 2025 has been characterized by a narrowing gap between top models; the Elo score difference between the top-ranked and 10th-ranked model decreased from 11.9% in 2024 to 5.4% in early 2025.

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
