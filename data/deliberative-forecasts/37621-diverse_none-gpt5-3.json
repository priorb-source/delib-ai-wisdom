    "review": "Both forecasters rightly emphasize the tight 20-day window, the 24-vote threshold, and the absence of any credible signals (agenda leaks, Competition Committee endorsement, or whip counts) pointing to imminent action. I think they slightly overstate the need for a special meeting—there is typically a Spring League Meeting in May that could serve as a venue—but their core point stands: major playing-rule changes are usually resolved in March, and without visible momentum or reporting, the prior probability of a late May surprise is low. Their reliance on status-quo inertia and the lack of recent media smoke is persuasive and highlights that my prior was too high given the information vacuum.",
    "rationale": "- Time and process: Even assuming a Spring Meeting later in May, owners would need a placed agenda item, Competition Committee support, and 24 votes. We have no credible public indications of any of these. Historically, significant playing-rule changes tend to crystallize by the March meeting; May meetings are less commonly used for on-field rules.\n- Signal check: If there were strong support or a committee-backed proposal queued for May, we’d likely see pre-meeting reporting by now. The absence of such reporting this close to the date is meaningful evidence against passage.\n- Inertia: The play has survived multiple review cycles amid enforcement and safety-data ambiguity. That, plus the high voting threshold, tilts toward no change absent a clear trigger.\n- Scenarios: Yes requires passage at the May meeting with immediate announcement; No occurs if the meeting takes no action or the item isn’t on the agenda. The latter currently looks much more likely.\nGiven these factors—and the persuasive emphasis from the other forecasters on the lack of visible momentum—I’m revising down from 22% to 8%. I’d move up quickly if credible reports emerge that (1) a ban/restriction is formally on the May agenda, (2) the Competition Committee endorses it, and/or (3) reporters indicate 24+ likely votes.",
