    "review": "The other forecasters introduced critical new information. Forecaster 2 presented strong evidence for a 'No' outcome by detailing a hostile political environment, including budget cuts, layoffs, and the closure of climate centers at NOAA, all linked to a plan to dismantle the agency's climate functions. This significantly strengthens the case for a politically motivated takedown. Conversely, Forecaster 3 provided extremely compelling evidence for a 'Yes' outcome: a direct and recent quote from a NOAA spokesperson explicitly stating, 'All NOAA Research sites will remain online.' These two pieces of information are in direct tension and represent the core conflict of this forecast.",
    "rationale": "I am updating my forecast upwards from 90% to 97%. My initial reasoning was balanced between institutional inertia and the negative signal of a single database being decommissioned. The new information has clarified the situation significantly. I find the evidence from Forecaster 3—the direct, public, and recent statement from NOAA promising to keep sites online—to be the most decisive factor, especially given the very short timeline of approximately 40 days. This statement was likely made in direct response to the concerns generated by the hostile actions described by Forecaster 2. For the site to be taken down, a political actor would have to not only order the removal but also publicly reverse a clear and recent agency commitment. In such a short timeframe, this is highly unlikely. The political and bureaucratic friction created by the public promise provides a strong buffer against a rapid takedown. While the risks outlined by Forecaster 2 are real and severe, they are more likely to manifest over a longer period through less visible means (e.g., defunding, not updating content) rather than a dramatic and politically costly takedown before July 1st. I am not updating to 99% because the overtly hostile political environment means that a sudden override from a high-level appointee remains a non-trivial possibility, justifying a slightly larger tail risk than Forecaster 3 allowed for.",
