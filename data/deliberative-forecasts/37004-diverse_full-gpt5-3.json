    "review": "Both forecasters largely align with my prior take: a consistent 5–7 point Liberal national lead this late makes a Conservative popular-vote win a tail outcome. Two incremental points they add that I hadn’t fully weighted: (1) Forecaster 3’s emphasis that cross-pollster agreement reduces the risk of a systematic miss; and (2) Forecaster 2’s point that heavy advance voting can ‘lock in’ the current state and limit the impact of any late swing. Both arguments modestly reduce the probability of a late-breaking Conservative overtake. I note a caveat that some media reports can reference the same underlying pollster (which would lessen true independence), but in the absence of evidence of duplication, the cross-source consistency still carries weight.",
    "rationale": "Baseline remains that Liberals lead nationally by roughly 5–7 points, with especially important advantages in Ontario and Quebec. Conservative strengths (enthusiasm/commitment, Western dominance, competitiveness in BC) provide a path but likely narrow the margin rather than flip it outright. Typical Canadian polling error in popular vote is usually smaller than the current gap, and with limited time and heavy advance voting, the window for a swing is small. Incorporating the other forecasters’ points about cross-pollster consistency and advance-vote lock-in, I trim my probability slightly. I would move up if late high-quality polls show the gap closing to ≤2 points nationally or if there’s concrete evidence of ON tightening or a Bloc surge eroding Liberal vote in QC. I would move down if final polls hold or widen the Liberal lead, particularly in ON/QC.",
