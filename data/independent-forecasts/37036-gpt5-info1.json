  "information": "Dan Osborn, an independent from Nebraska, is exploring a potential run for the U.S. Senate in 2026 against incumbent Republican Pete Ricketts. In early April 2025, Osborn formed an exploratory committee. He previously ran for the Senate in 2024 against Deb Fischer, losing by approximately six percentage points in a race that attracted $14 million in fundraising. Osborn has also launched a political action committee, the Working Class Heroes Fund, aimed at training and supporting working-class candidates for office. In public statements regarding a potential 2026 run, Osborn has framed the race as a choice to \"replace a billionaire with a mechanic.\"",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Approximately 39 days (until June 1, 2025)",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No — remains in exploratory phase with no formal candidacy announcement before June 1, 2025",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Osborn keeps the exploratory committee active through spring, continues testing polling/fundraising, focuses on his Working Class Heroes Fund, and waits to announce until later in summer or fall 2025 (or ultimately decides not to run).",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Osborn leverages early momentum and name ID from 2024, decides quickly based on positive polling/finance signals, and announces in May (e.g., tied to a labor-focused message or event) to start fundraising and organizing for a 2026 run against Sen. Pete Ricketts.",
    "rationale": "- What we know: Per the assistant’s report, Dan Osborn (an independent) formed an exploratory committee in early April 2025 to consider a 2026 run against Sen. Pete Ricketts. He previously ran in 2024 against Deb Fischer and lost by ~6 points, raising about $14M. He also launched the Working Class Heroes Fund PAC and is positioning the 2026 race as “replace a billionaire with a mechanic.”\n- Base rates/status quo: Most exploratory phases last longer than a few weeks. Many midterm challengers announce between mid-2025 and early 2026. With only ~5.5 weeks until June 1, the default is that he remains exploratory through spring; thus the status quo favors No.\n- Reasons for Yes before June 1: Osborn already signaled serious interest (exploratory committee), has existing name recognition and donor networks from 2024, and as an independent does not face a primary calendar constraint—an early general-election style run can be advantageous for fundraising, signature gathering, and defining the race. A symbolic May announcement (e.g., early May) would fit his labor-forward brand.\n- Reasons for No before June 1: He likely wants to see polling, fundraising viability, and coalition-building data before committing; independent ballot access and campaign build-out do not require a spring 2025 launch. He may prefer a summer/fall rollout to optimize media attention and staffing. Exploratory-to-announcement in under two months is plausible but not the norm.\n- Why not higher: The window is short, and exploratory phases typically run longer; no public report here of imminent announcement mechanics (e.g., scheduled events, staff hires, FEC conversion, press advisories).\n- Why not lower: The exploratory step, his competitive 2024 showing and fundraising, and the clear target (Ricketts, 2026) all suggest a real likelihood of running—and some chance he moves quickly to lock in donors/volunteers.\n- What would move me up: Credible reporting of a scheduled announcement event in May, hiring key campaign staff, converting to a full candidate committee, new campaign website/call-to-action, or strong leaked polling/fundraising encouraging a swift go decision.\n- What would move me down: Signals he’s continuing a prolonged exploratory phase (extended listening tour without commitments), fundraising lag, personal/work constraints emphasized in interviews, or statements indicating a timeline beyond early summer.",
