    "review": "My initial forecast was based on the high degree of inertia for a recently implemented tariff. Forecaster 2 correctly identified that Switzerland presents a sympathetic case for reversal, creating diplomatic pressure. However, Forecaster 3 introduced a critical piece of new information that reshapes the forecast: the 31% tariff is already codified in the Harmonized Tariff Schedule (HTS) but is under a 90-day suspension that extends beyond the June 1, 2025, resolution date. This new information makes Forecaster 3's analysis extremely compelling. The resolution criteria explicitly state that a suspension is irrelevant, meaning the current, documented status quo is a 'Yes' outcome. Forecaster 3's logic, which rests on the high likelihood that this administrative state will persist through the suspension period, is more robust than my initial, more generalized reasoning about inertia.",
    "rationale": "I am updating my forecast based on the pivotal information provided by Forecaster 3 regarding the 90-day suspension of the tariff. My initial 88% confidence was based on the general principle of policy inertia. The existence of a formal suspension period running until July 9, 2025—well after the June 1 resolution date—makes this inertia a near-certainty. The resolution hinges only on whether the 31% figure is *listed* in the HTS, which it currently is. The suspension provides a formal window for negotiations, making it very unlikely that the administration would pre-emptively conclude talks and remove the HTS entry within the next five weeks. The path to a 'No' outcome has narrowed significantly; it now requires not just a diplomatic agreement but an unusually rapid conclusion to that agreement and an immediate follow-up to amend the official HTS publication, all well before the designated negotiation period expires. The path to 'Yes' requires no action at all. I am therefore increasing my probability from 88% to 92%, with the remaining 8% accounting for the small chance of a sudden, early diplomatic resolution that is immediately codified in the tariff schedule.",
