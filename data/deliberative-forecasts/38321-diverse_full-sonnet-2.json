    "review": "Both forecasters make compelling arguments that I had somewhat underweighted. Forecaster 2 correctly emphasizes that with less than three weeks remaining, the logistical and political commitments are firmly in place - advance security arrangements, bilateral meetings, and diplomatic preparations have already been made, making cancellation extremely costly. Forecaster 3 makes an important historical point that once such high-level attendance is officially confirmed, cancellations are rare, which provides valuable base rate information. Both forecasters also place greater weight on the official White House confirmation than I initially did, and they're right that this is the strongest possible evidence short of the event itself. However, I find Forecaster 3's reasoning more balanced than Forecaster 2's 98% forecast. Forecaster 3 explicitly accounts for Trump's documented unpredictability and history of late changes, which I believe is a crucial factor that prevents this from being a near-certain outcome. Forecaster 2's 98% forecast seems to underweight these Trump-specific considerations.",
    "rationale": "After reviewing the other analyses, I'm updating my forecast upward but not to the highest level proposed. The key factors moving me higher are: (1) the diplomatic and logistical lock-in effect at this late stage - with thousands of delegates, extensive security preparations, and scheduled bilateral meetings, canceling would be extraordinarily costly; (2) the historical base rate showing that once presidential attendance at major summits is officially confirmed, follow-through is the overwhelming norm; and (3) the multiple independent confirmations from allied leaders following direct communication with Trump, which reduces the likelihood this is merely speculative planning. However, I'm not moving to 98% because Trump has a documented pattern of unpredictability that differs from typical presidential behavior, and 20 days still provides a window for health issues, domestic crises, or sudden changes of plan. The 90-92% range appropriately reflects high confidence while maintaining realistic uncertainty about Trump-specific risks.",
