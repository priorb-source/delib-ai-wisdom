    "review": "The other forecasters provided critical context that I had undervalued. Forecaster 3's comparison to the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) launch, which occurred just two days after licensing, was particularly powerful. This precedent makes the 23-day silence since Lesotho granted its license a significant negative indicator, suggesting specific complications or deprioritization, a point I had overlooked. Forecaster 2's detailed breakdown of specific operational hurdles—local checkout, tax/import handling, device approvals—provided a concrete explanation for why such delays occur and can persist. Both arguments were highly convincing and highlighted a major flaw in my initial analysis, which was too focused on the license grant and not enough on the granular, time-consuming steps that follow.",
    "rationale": "My initial forecast of 75% was too high. I overweighted the importance of the license being granted and underestimated the 'last-mile' operational challenges and the significance of the time that has already passed without an announcement. The arguments from the other forecasters, especially the comparison to the near-instantaneous launch in the DRC (Forecaster 3) and the enumeration of specific logistical hurdles (Forecaster 2), have persuaded me to be much more cautious. The fact that over three weeks have passed since the license was approved without the service going live is a strong signal that this is not a simple, high-priority rollout for Starlink. While the primary regulatory barrier is gone and 55 days still remain before the deadline, the unexplained delay significantly tempers my optimism. The probability of a launch before July 1 is still slightly better than even, given Starlink's capabilities, but the risks of operational friction pushing the date out are much higher than I first assessed. I am therefore making a substantial downward adjustment to my forecast, moving from 75% to 58%, to better reflect these newly appreciated risks.",
