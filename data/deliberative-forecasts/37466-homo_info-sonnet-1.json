    "review": "Both forecasters raise critical points I underweighted. Forecaster 3 correctly identifies that WorldAtlas is a **Canadian company**, making them significantly less susceptible to U.S. political pressure - this is a major factor I failed to adequately consider. Forecaster 3 also makes an excellent distinction between parenthetical acknowledgment (which is standard informational practice) versus changing primary nomenclature. Forecaster 2 provides valuable context that **Google has adopted the change for U.S. users** while National Geographic and Apple have not, showing a split landscape. This creates some precedent but also demonstrates lack of consensus among major map providers. Forecaster 2's emphasis on cartographic status quo bias is well-founded - maps prioritize stability and international recognition. The 2012 rejected proposal mentioned by Forecaster 3 adds important historical context about resistance to politicized name changes. Both forecasters correctly note that most of the time window has elapsed without change, which is a strong indicator. However, I think Forecaster 3's 10% may be too low given Google's adoption and the 54 days remaining.",
    "rationale": "Upon reflection, my initial 40% was too high. The Canadian ownership of WorldAtlas is crucial - they have no obligation to follow U.S. executive orders and typically prioritize international geographic standards. The parenthetical inclusion in their article title is likely just informational acknowledgment, not a signal of intent to change primary nomenclature. The fact that 3.5 of 4.5 months have passed without updating the North America page is a strong indicator they've chosen not to make the change. However, I don't go as low as 10% because: (1) Google's adoption for U.S. users shows the change has gained some traction among major platforms, (2) 54 days is sufficient time for updates if editorial policy shifts, and (3) commercial websites can change quickly for SEO/relevance reasons. The most likely scenario remains status quo, but there's enough movement and time remaining to warrant a non-trivial probability. Updating from 40% to 22%.",
