    "review": "The other forecasters present compelling and largely convergent analyses. Forecaster 2's emphasis on the 'complete and sudden reversal' required is well-put - it captures the magnitude of policy shift needed. Forecaster 3 adds valuable procedural detail about parliamentary acts and legal requirements, which reinforces the institutional friction argument. Both correctly identify the same core factors: gradualist mandate, short timeframe, economic dependence, and multi-year commission timeline. However, I find Forecaster 2's 5% slightly conservative given the distinction between announcing a date (which could be years away) versus holding a referendum, and the significant external pressure from Trump's comments. Forecaster 3's 10% acknowledges this path more explicitly - that the government could announce a distant or consultative referendum date as a political maneuver. This is a legitimate scenario that keeps probability from being extremely low. The key insight from Forecaster 3 is that even setting a distant date has procedural requirements and political costs, making it unlikely in 60 days. All three analyses converge on recognizing high public support for independence in principle, but also the government's clear commitment to economic development first. The narrow forecast range (5-10%) suggests strong agreement on the underlying logic.",
    "rationale": "After reviewing both analyses, I'm adjusting slightly downward from 7% to 6%. Forecaster 3's procedural detail about parliamentary acts and legal requirements strengthens the case that even announcing a date quickly involves institutional complexity I somewhat underweighted. The six-week timeline since the new government took office is simply insufficient for this level of political and legal preparation. However, I'm not moving as low as Forecaster 2's 5% because the 'announce a distant date' scenario remains plausible as a political response to external pressure or coalition dynamics. The lack of any concrete signals (no referendum bill, no coalition pledge, no parliamentary agenda items) strongly indicates this isn't being prepared. My forecast would increase substantially with any of Forecaster 3's specified conditions: government platform mentioning scheduling, referendum bill tabling, or explicit PM statements about setting a date. Conversely, explicit government statements ruling out 2025 scheduling would push me lower. The status quo path - continued focus on economic development, gradual sovereignty building, and multi-year institutional processes - remains overwhelmingly likely through July 1, 2025.",
