    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "About 1–3 weeks (the summit is scheduled for June 2025, and attendance will be observable during the event)",
    "status_quo_outcome": "Yes",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "A late-breaking disruption prevents travel or participation—for example, a domestic crisis requiring him to remain in Washington, an acute health issue, a deliberate political snub/decision to skip, or the summit being postponed/cancelled or shifted out of June (so no G7 summit occurs in June 2025).",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "He flies to Canada and is physically present at the G7—appearing with other leaders in plenary, a leaders’ photo, or any official session/event such that he can directly see and hear other heads of state in person.",
    "rationale": "- Evidence/status quo: The cited CTV report says the White House has confirmed President Trump will visit Canada for the G7 leaders’ summit. Historically, sitting U.S. presidents almost always attend G7 summits in person; even Trump in 2018 attended (though he left early). Canada is a close, low-friction destination for U.S. travel, and the flight is short, reducing logistical risk. Given confirmation plus the high base rate of attendance, the status quo strongly favors a Yes. \n- Why not higher: Residual risks remain—Trump’s unpredictability, potential domestic crises (e.g., urgent legislative or security matters), health issues, or a last-minute diplomatic calculation to skip or significantly curtail attendance. There is also a small chance of schedule changes that move the summit out of June, which would invalidate a June attendance. \n- Why not lower: Official confirmation from the White House and the strong historical base rate of U.S. presidential attendance at G7s argue for a high probability. The costs of non-attendance are non-trivial diplomatically, and the threshold for this question is minimal (any in-person appearance during the summit counts). \n- What would move me up: Public release of a detailed schedule including confirmed bilateral/plenary times with security lock-ins; leaders’ agenda documents listing POTUS participation; photographic evidence of travel plans underway (e.g., pool reports indicating departure). \n- What would move me down: Credible reporting of health concerns; announcements of a change in format (virtual/hybrid) or postponement beyond June; explicit White House guidance that the Vice President or a cabinet member will lead the delegation; a major domestic or international crisis necessitating the President’s presence in Washington. \n- Research assistant summary: No additional info beyond the CTV item; my forecast relies primarily on the White House confirmation report and the historical base rate of U.S. presidential G7 attendance.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill Donald Trump attend the G7 Summit in June 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nCTV: [Donald Trump will visit Canada for G7, White House confirms](https://www.ctvnews.ca/politics/article/white-house-confirms-trump-will-visit-canada-for-g7-leaders-summit/)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if US President Donald J. Trump attends in person a G7 summit held in June 2025.\n\n\"In person\" is defined as occupying the same physical space closely enough at the G7 Summit that he can see and hear other heads of state through direct un-intermediated exchange of photons and sound waves.\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nNo additional information available.\n\nToday is 2025-06-03.\n\nBefore answering you think:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n(e) You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
