    "yes_outcome_scenario": "He converts at least one of his five nominations—most plausibly a male artist, song/single, album, or collaboration category—benefiting from strong industry respect and broad voter support.",
    "rationale": "- Base rates and status quo: Chris Stapleton is a perennial awards favorite with strong ACM track record and industry esteem. Having five nominations strongly signals broad support. Historically, artists with 4–6 nominations at major country awards usually win at least one. The status quo, therefore, is that he wins something.\n- Simple probability frame: If his average per-category win chance were around 20–30%, the chance of being shut out across five independent shots is (1−p)^5 ≈ 33% at p=0.2, 24% at p=0.25, 17% at p=0.3. Given his stature, an effective per-category chance near the mid-20s seems reasonable, implying a 70–85% chance of at least one win.\n- Competition: This is why the forecast is not higher. Current peers (Lainey Wilson, Luke Combs, Morgan Wallen, Jelly Roll, etc.) are formidable, and ACM voters sometimes spread trophies. Category-level correlations mean a cold voting mood toward Stapleton could produce a shutout.\n- Why not lower: Five nominations reduce tail risk of zero wins; he’s a critical and industry favorite, often converting at least one category even in competitive years.\n- What would move me up: Market odds or credible pundit consensus favoring him in one or more categories; evidence of weaker competition in his nominated fields; historical note of strong ACM bloc support this cycle.\n- What would move me down: Final-category lineups showing dominant favorites against him; news suggesting vote-splitting disadvantages or an industry push to reward other artists; indications he’s absent from marquee categories or that his nominated works underperformed with voters.\n- Research assistant input: No additional information was available beyond the five nominations and date; forecast relies on base rates, track record, and competition assessment.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill Chris Stapleton win an award at the 60th Academy of Country Music Awards?\n\nQuestion background:\nThe awards are scheduled to be held on May 8, 2025. Stapleton has 5 nominations.\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if Chris Stapleton wins an award at the [60th Academy of Country Music Awards](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/60th_Academy_of_Country_Music_Awards).\n\n\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nNo additional information available.\n\nToday is 2025-04-22.\n\nBefore answering you think:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n(e) You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
