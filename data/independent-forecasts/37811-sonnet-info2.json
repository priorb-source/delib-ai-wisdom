  "information": "The Trump administration has implemented significant budget and staff cuts at NOAA. According to reports, hundreds of scientists and climate experts have been laid off, sparking concern over the future of climate research and environmental policy. These actions are seen by some as aligning with the 'Project 2025' plan promoted by the Heritage Foundation, which proposes dismantling the agency. Additionally, some of NOAA's regional climate centers have been shut down, and all contributors to the National Climate Assessment have been fired.",

    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "41 days (from May 21, 2025 to July 1, 2025)",
    "status_quo_outcome": "Climate.gov remains online and reachable",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "The Trump administration deliberately shuts down Climate.gov as part of broader efforts to remove climate information from government platforms, or budget cuts eliminate website hosting/maintenance funding entirely",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Climate.gov continues operating with its existing hosting infrastructure, even if content updates cease or staff are reduced, as website hosting costs are minimal and the site remains technically operational",
    "rationale": "The status quo strongly favors a Yes resolution. As of May 7, 2025, Climate.gov was confirmed online and reachable, just 14 days ago. With only 41 days until resolution, there's limited time for dramatic changes. While my research assistant reports significant NOAA cuts including mass layoffs, regional center closures, and removal of climate data from government websites, there's an important distinction between reducing operations/removing content versus completely taking a website offline. Website hosting infrastructure is relatively inexpensive and automated - once deployed, sites typically remain accessible unless deliberately shut down. Government websites historically remain online even when agencies face severe cuts, as the technical and financial barriers to maintaining basic hosting are low. The resolution criteria only requires the site be 'reachable,' not actively updated or fully staffed. The main risk factors are: (1) deliberate political decision to shut down the site entirely as symbolic action against climate policy, (2) complete defunding of hosting/maintenance contracts. However, complete shutdown would be more politically controversial than content removal and requires active intervention rather than passive neglect. The short 41-day timeframe makes such dramatic action less probable. Why not higher (95%+): The administration has demonstrated willingness to make aggressive changes to climate-related government functions, and the documented data removal shows intent. Why not lower (75%-): The strong status quo, short timeframe, low technical barriers to keeping the site operational, and historical patterns all favor continuity. I would update higher if there were reports of specific plans or technical preparations to shut down the site, or lower if explicit shutdown orders were announced.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill NOAA's Climate.gov still be online on July 1, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nNational Security Archive: [Disappearing Data: Trump Administration Removing Climate Information from Government Websites](https://nsarchive.gwu.edu/briefing-book/climate-change-transparency-project-foia/2025-02-06/disappearing-data-trump)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if Climate.gov is online according to [Is It Down Right Now?](https://www.isitdownrightnow.com/climate.gov.html) when accessed by Metaculus on or after July 1, 2025.\n\nAs of May 7, 2025, the resolution source returns the message, \"Climate.gov is UP and reachable by us.\"\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nThe Trump administration has implemented significant budget and staff cuts at NOAA. According to reports, hundreds of scientists and climate experts have been laid off, sparking concern over the future of climate research and environmental policy. These actions are seen by some as aligning with the 'Project 2025' plan promoted by the Heritage Foundation, which proposes dismantling the agency. Additionally, some of NOAA's regional climate centers have been shut down, and all contributors to the National Climate Assessment have been fired.\n\nToday is 2025-05-21.\n\nBefore answering you think:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n(e) You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
