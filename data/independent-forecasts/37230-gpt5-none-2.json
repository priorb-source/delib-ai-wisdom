    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "About 1 month (through the close on Fri, May 30, 2025, the final trading day of May)",
    "status_quo_outcome": "Yes — Historically the S&P 500 finishes a given month up roughly 60% of the time; May’s hit rate is modest but still slightly positive.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Hotter-than-expected April CPI/PPI or sticky PCE in May pushes Treasury yields higher; the Fed’s May meeting tone skews more hawkish than markets expect; a few mega-cap earnings/guidance disappoint, leading to de-risking and a late-month selloff that leaves the index below the April 30 close.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Inflation prints are benign or decelerating, the Fed signals patience with potential cuts later in 2025, and earnings/guidance from key mega-caps and cyclicals meet or beat expectations; yields remain contained and breadth is steady, nudging the index modestly higher by month-end.",
    "rationale": "Base rate first: Since markets usually drift upward, the S&P 500 ends a month higher around 60% of the time. May, while not a particularly strong month on average, has still been positive more often than not. With only ~1 month until resolution and no specific new information from my assistant, I put extra weight on this status-quo tendency. Near-term event risks are balanced. Bearish catalysts include: (1) the late-Apr/early-May FOMC meeting potentially leaning hawkish; (2) April CPI/PPI mid-May coming in hot, lifting yields and compressing equity multiples; (3) narrow leadership—disappointments from mega-caps can drag the cap-weighted index; (4) any geopolitical or growth scare. Bullish catalysts include: (1) continued solid earnings and guidance, particularly among large tech/AI names that heavily influence the index; (2) inflation data that are inline/softer, allowing the Fed to maintain an easing bias for later in 2025; (3) resilient macro data supporting earnings. Why not higher than my forecast: event risk is clustered in May (FOMC, CPI, PCE, earnings) and valuations in large-cap tech are sensitive to rate surprises, raising downside risk relative to a generic month. Why not lower: the base rate favors a small positive drift, and earnings season typically provides a support unless macro surprises are negative. What would move me up: a clearly dovish Fed tone, softer-than-expected April CPI/PPI/PCE, and strong mega-cap earnings/breadth early in May. What would move me down: upside inflation surprises, a jump in yields/real rates, guidance cuts from index heavyweights, widening credit spreads, or a sharp pickup in realized volatility. Assistant’s input contained no additional info, so the estimate leans on base rates and typical event risk balance.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill the S&P 500 index go up in May 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nNY Times: [What Is a Bear Market? Are We in One?](https://www.nytimes.com/article/bear-market-stocks-tariffs.html)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question will resolve as Yes if the closing value of the S&P 500 Index on the final trading day of May 2025 is higher than that of the final trading day of April 2025.\n\nThe \"close\" values shown on the [history page of Yahoo finance](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/%5EGSPC/history?p=%5EGSPC) will be used.\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nNo additional information available.\n\nToday is 2025-04-29.\n\nBefore answering you think:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n(e) You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
