  "information": "In Ohio, Republican lawmakers introduced Senate Bill 153 (SB 153), which would create new requirements for citizen-led ballot initiatives. The bill would compel paid signature gatherers to wear visible badges, list employers on petitions, and maintain detailed records. The bill's definition of 'paid' circulators is considered broad, and it requires petition signers to be registered voters on the exact day they sign. As of early May 2025, this bill had not completed the legislative process. In February 2025, a provision requiring Ohioans to prove citizenship to register to vote at the Bureau of Motor Vehicles was removed from the state's transportation budget by Republicans. Instead, BMV employees will be prohibited from offering registration forms to individuals identified as non-citizens. This change was prompted by a report from Secretary of State Frank LaRose indicating that non-citizens were accidentally registering to vote, partly due to language barriers.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Approximately 57 days remain until July 1, 2025. This is about 8 weeks for the Ohio legislature to enact citizenship verification legislation.",
    "status_quo_outcome": "NO - No legislation expanding citizenship verification requirements will be enacted before the deadline.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Senate Bill 153 fails to complete the legislative process before July 1, 2025. Given it's already early May and hasn't passed either chamber yet, the bill runs out of time or stalls in committee. No alternative citizenship verification legislation is introduced or passes in the remaining weeks.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Senate Bill 153 or similar legislation requiring proof of citizenship to vote gains unexpected momentum, passes both chambers of the Ohio legislature quickly, and is enacted before July 1, 2025. Republican leadership prioritizes the bill and fast-tracks it through committee votes and floor consideration in both houses.",
    "rationale": "The status quo strongly favors a NO outcome for several reasons. First, the February 2025 removal of citizenship verification requirements from the transportation budget is highly significant. Ohio Republicans, who control the legislature, actively chose to remove this provision and instead implemented a much weaker alternative (BMV employees not offering forms to non-citizens rather than requiring proof of citizenship). This suggests political concerns, practical implementation issues, or lack of consensus even within the Republican party for stronger verification requirements. Second, with only 8 weeks remaining and Senate Bill 153 not yet having completed the legislative process as of early May, time is extremely limited. Legislative processes typically require committee hearings, floor debates, votes in both chambers, and potential reconciliation—all difficult to complete rapidly without strong political will. Third, there's no indication in the research that SB 153 has momentum or is being fast-tracked. The recent legislative history shows movement away from stronger requirements rather than toward them. Why not lower than 20%: SB 153 does exist and was introduced by Republican senators in a Republican-controlled state. Secretary of State Frank LaRose has documented concerns about non-citizens registering. With unified party control, rapid passage remains theoretically possible if it became a sudden priority. Eight weeks is technically enough time if there's political urgency. Why not higher: The February removal of the citizenship provision is a strong counter-signal. The lack of apparent progress on SB 153 despite its introduction suggests insufficient support. The chosen alternative approach indicates preference for softer measures. No emergency session or fast-tracking has been announced. To update upward, I would need evidence of SB 153 passing committee, statements from leadership prioritizing it, or news of expedited consideration. To update downward, legislative recess, additional compromises, or statements opposing stronger verification would be key signals.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nBefore July 1, 2025, will Ohio enact legislation expanding its verification requirements of a voter's citizenship?\n\nQuestion background:\nThe Ohio Senate: [Gavarone, Brenner Introduce Bill to Require Proof of Citizenship to Vote](https://ohiosenate.gov/members/theresa-gavarone/news/gavarone-brenner-introduce-bill-to-require-proof-of-citizenship-to-vote)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if, before July 1, 2025, the state of Ohio enacts legislation requiring voters to provide proof of US citizenship beyond the requirements at the time of this question, according to [credible sources](https://www.metaculus.com/faq/#definitions).\n\nAny subset of voters being required to provide such proof would count (for example if it only applied to first-time voter registrants or creating a new requirement for mail-in voters). An example of a bill that would count is [Senate Bill 153](https://www.legislature.ohio.gov/legislation/136/sb153). This question resolves upon enactment; therefore other questions such as when the legislation takes effect or whether it survives court challenges and is implemented is immaterial to this question's resolution. Please note that under Ohio law, a bill is considered enacted \"after both houses have passed and agreed on identical bills.\" ([Source](https://www.lsc.ohio.gov/assets/organizations/legislative-service-commission/files/chapter-5-enacting-legislation-10021971.pdf))\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nIn Ohio, Republican lawmakers introduced Senate Bill 153 (SB 153), which would create new requirements for citizen-led ballot initiatives.
