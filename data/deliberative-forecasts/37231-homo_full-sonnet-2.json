    "review": "All three forecasts cluster tightly at 85-87%, indicating strong consensus on the fundamental dynamics. The most valuable new insight from Forecasters 2 and 3 is their emphasis on Mexico's large informal sector (54.4% of workforce) as a shock absorber. When formal sector jobs are lost, workers often shift to informal employment rather than appearing as unemployed, which structurally suppresses Mexico's unemployment rate. Forecaster 2 also helpfully detailed the institutional frictions (employment contracts, severance requirements) that make rapid formal employment adjustments unlikely. However, I note that Mexico's historically low unemployment rates (typically 2-3%) already reflect this informal sector dynamic - it's a structural feature rather than a new April-specific buffer. Both forecasters reinforced the key points: the 2.2% March baseline provides substantial cushion, one-month timeframes favor status quo persistence, and tariff impacts typically require months to materialize in employment data. No one identified evidence of mass April layoffs or other data suggesting the question should resolve differently than the strong status quo suggests.",
    "rationale": "The convergence of all three forecasts at 85-87% validates the core analytical framework. The April 2025 outcome has already occurred but awaits official reporting. Starting from March's 2.2% rate, reaching 3.0% would require an unprecedented 0.8 percentage point monthly increase - historically anomalous outside major crises. The informal sector argument strengthens the Yes case slightly, as it provides structural resistance to formal unemployment rate increases. However, this is largely a feature already embedded in Mexico's baseline unemployment dynamics rather than a novel protective factor. The IMF's full-year forecast (2.8% to 3.8%) suggests deterioration will occur gradually, not abruptly in April. The 25% tariffs on autos, steel, and plastics are genuine headwinds, but employment impacts from trade shocks materialize over quarters as firms exhaust alternatives, process layoffs, and affected workers search for new employment. The one-month window is simply too short for major structural change absent an acute crisis. No evidence suggests such a crisis occurred in April. The Mexican government's Plan México and downward trend (2.5% Feb → 2.2% March) provide additional support. I'm updating slightly upward to 86% to acknowledge the informal sector buffer point while maintaining that the core logic already supported high confidence.",
