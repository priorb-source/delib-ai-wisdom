  "information": "In Canada's 338-seat House of Commons, 170 seats are required for a majority government. The analysis was conducted with 8 days remaining before the election resolution date. At that time, advance voting was underway, with reports indicating a 36% increase in turnout compared to the 2021 election.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Approximately 8 days until the April 29, 2025 Canadian federal election based on the research assistant's note",
    "status_quo_outcome": "The Liberals are unlikely to reach 172 seats. Based on typical polling trends with 8 days remaining and recent Canadian electoral patterns showing competitive races and minority governments, the status quo points toward either a Liberal minority government (if they win) or a Conservative plurality/majority",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "The Liberals finish with fewer than 172 seats, either forming a minority government with 140-169 seats, losing to the Conservatives, or being reduced to opposition. This could occur through continued voter fatigue with the long-serving Liberal government, Conservative strength in key regions, or vote splitting with the NDP and other parties",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "The Liberals surge in the final week to secure 172+ seats, potentially driven by strategic voting to prevent a Conservative government, strong ground game capitalizing on the increased advance voting turnout, or a collapse in Conservative or NDP support that consolidates center-left voters behind the Liberals",
    "rationale": "With only 8 days remaining before the election, polling and projections are typically quite stable, making dramatic shifts unlikely. The threshold of 172 seats represents a comfortable majority, 2 seats above the minimum required. Historical context is crucial: the Liberals won 160 seats in 2021 (minority), and recent Canadian elections have been characterized by competitive multi-party dynamics rather than dominant majorities. The 36% increase in advance voting indicates high engagement but doesn't inherently favor any party. The reference to 338Canada projections is telling - this aggregator would show clear majority projections if the Liberals were tracking toward 172+ seats. Without specific data suggesting Liberal majority territory, the base rate for an incumbent government (in power since 2015) achieving a strong majority after multiple elections is low. For this forecast to move higher, I would need to see: (1) 338Canada projections showing Liberals at 172+ seats with high confidence, (2) polling showing Liberal support above 40% with favorable regional distribution, or (3) evidence of Conservative collapse. For it to move lower (below 5%), I would need clear evidence of Liberal defeat or minority standing. The forecast remains in the 10-15% range because: late polls could underestimate Liberal support, vote efficiency could exceed expectations, and strategic voting dynamics can shift rapidly in Canada's multi-party system",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill the Liberal Party win 172 or more seats in the 2025 Canadian federal election?\n\nQuestion background:\n[338Canada Federal Projection](https://338canada.com/federal.htm): \"The 338Canada project is a statistical model of electoral projections based on opinion polls, electoral history, and demographic data.

Fournier, physics and astrophysics professor at Cégep de Saint-Laurent in Montreal.\"\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if the Liberal Party of Canada wins greater than or equal to 172 seats in the [2025 Canadian federal election](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2025_Canadian_federal_election).\n\n\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nIn Canada's 338-seat House of Commons, 170 seats are required for a majority government.

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
