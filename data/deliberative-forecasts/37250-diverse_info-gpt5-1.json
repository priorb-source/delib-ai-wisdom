    "review": "Forecaster 2 adds a critical constraint I underweighted: if Garcia is indeed in Salvadoran maximum-security custody and President Bukele has publicly vowed not to release him, the binding bottleneck is El Salvador’s cooperation, which U.S. courts cannot compel. That sharply reduces the near-term feasibility, especially in only ~2 months. The note that the U.S. embassy lacks instructions (if accurate) further implies low executive-branch will to push hard. Forecaster 3’s emphasis on the Trump administration’s overt resistance, including public statements and willingness to defy/slow-walk court orders, also lowers odds given the limited time and the Supreme Court’s “facilitate” (not “guarantee”) language. Both analyses strengthen the status-quo-no case and highlight barriers I didn’t emphasize enough (foreign custody and domestic political incentives to resist).",
    "rationale": "I initially put weight on the Supreme Court’s unanimous ruling and active district court oversight as paths to a rapid operational fix once the government engages. However, the added arguments about Salvadoran custody and Bukele’s public stance materially change the gating assumptions: even full U.S. compliance cannot force a release from a foreign prison on this timeline, and the U.S. executive currently has incentives not to exert maximal pressure. The missed April 7 deadline already signals sustained noncompliance/slow-rolling. With only two months left, the likelihood that court tools (contempt/sanctions) or diplomacy produce a tangible release, travel documents, and entry by July 1 is low, though not negligible. A last-minute breakthrough remains possible if (a) Salvadoran authorities reverse course or permit removal, (b) high-level White House direction orders DHS/State to execute, and (c) filings show travel docs/parole/itinerary in hand. Absent such signs, the status quo likely persists past the resolution date. Accordingly, I’m updating down substantially from 35% to align with the tighter constraints and political realities.",
