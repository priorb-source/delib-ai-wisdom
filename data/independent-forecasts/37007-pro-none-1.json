    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Approximately 1 week. The election is scheduled for April 28, 2025, and results are typically known within 24 hours of polls closing.",
    "status_quo_outcome": "The People's National Movement (PNM) is the incumbent party, having won a 22-19 seat majority in the 2020 general election. A continuation of the status quo would see them win at least a plurality of seats again.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "The primary opposition party, the United National Congress (UNC), successfully campaigns on issues such as the cost of living and crime, persuading undecided voters in key marginal constituencies. The UNC flips two or more seats from the PNM, thereby winning a plurality and forming the next government.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "The PNM leverages its incumbency advantage, mobilizing its base and retaining its hold on crucial marginal seats. The political landscape remains largely unchanged from 2020, allowing the PNM to secure a plurality of seats, similar to the previous election's outcome.",
    "rationale": "My forecast is primarily based on the principle of incumbency advantage in a stable two-party system. The PNM, as the current ruling party, holds a structural advantage. Trinidad and Tobago's politics are characterized by deeply entrenched voting patterns, and significant shifts often require a major catalyst, such as a major scandal or economic crisis. My research assistant has provided no information to suggest such a catalyst exists. Elections are frequently close and decided in a handful of marginal seats. The 2020 result was a narrow 22-19 victory for the PNM. Therefore, the probability is not higher because a small swing in voter sentiment could easily flip the outcome to the UNC. The lack of recent polling data introduces significant uncertainty. The probability is not lower because, without evidence to the contrary, the incumbent party should be considered the favorite. The burden of proof is on the challenger (UNC) to demonstrate that they have gained sufficient ground to overcome the PNM, and I have no evidence of this. I would raise my forecast with reliable polling showing a clear PNM lead. I would lower it upon seeing credible polls favoring the UNC or news of a late-breaking scandal impacting the PNM government.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill the People's National Movement win the most seats in the 2025 Trinidad and Tobago election?\n\nQuestion background:\nReuters: [Trinidad and Tobago to hold early elections in late April](https://www.reuters.com/world/americas/trinidad-tobago-hold-general-elections-april-28-2025-03-18/)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below.

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
