    "review": "Both forecasters raise important points I underweighted. Forecaster 3's claim that Sudan is suspended from the African Union is critical - if true, this creates a fundamental barrier to ratifying an AU treaty that I completely missed. This would substantially reduce the probability. Forecaster 2's procedural point about deposit with the AU Commission is well-taken and adds another layer of complexity beyond domestic ratification. Both forecasters emphasize the severity of Sudan's civil war more strongly than I did, with Forecaster 3 noting the government is so fragmented that even basic state functions are compromised. Forecaster 2's recognition that executive-led ratification remains technically possible in coup/transition contexts is reasonable but may be overoptimistic given the scale of Sudan's dysfunction. The key disagreement between Forecasters 2 and 3 seems to hinge on whether any pathway exists for executive action - Forecaster 3 views the state collapse as near-total, while Forecaster 2 sees a narrow window for legitimacy-seeking behavior.",
    "rationale": "After reviewing the other analyses, I believe I should revise downward. The AU suspension issue raised by Forecaster 3, if accurate, represents a structural barrier I failed to consider. Even if not absolute, suspension significantly complicates ratification logistics and political feasibility. Both forecasters convinced me that Sudan's civil war has created more severe governance dysfunction than I initially weighted - with competing authorities and no functioning legislature, even expedited executive action becomes highly problematic. The lack of any public signals of imminent ratification in the final 25 days is telling. However, I don't think 1% is warranted because: (1) the AU suspension needs verification and may not be absolute; (2) technically some form of recognized authority could still act; (3) unexpected diplomatic developments, while improbable, aren't impossible. Forecaster 2's 7% seems too optimistic given the compounding barriers. I'm revising to 3%, splitting the difference but leaning toward Forecaster 3's pessimism while maintaining a small probability for low-likelihood scenarios.",
