    "review": "I have reviewed the analyses from two fellow forecasters. Forecaster 2 provides a standard fight breakdown, forecasting a 35% chance for Walker based on the stylistic matchup if the fight were to happen. However, this analysis critically fails to incorporate the primary evidence provided in the research report: that Walker has reportedly withdrawn from the fight. Therefore, I find this reasoning unconvincing as it misses the central fact governing the resolution of this question. Forecaster 3's analysis, in contrast, is highly convincing. They correctly centered their entire rationale on the reported withdrawal and the explicit resolution criteria. They also introduced a crucial new piece of information I hadn't considered: a replacement opponent (Brendson Ribeiro) has already been scheduled to fight Murzakanov. This significantly strengthens the evidence that the original bout is cancelled and will not be reinstated.",
    "rationale": "My initial forecast of 1% was based on the high probability that the fight was cancelled due to Walker's reported withdrawal, while leaving a small probability for a bizarre, last-minute reversal. Forecaster 3's analysis, particularly the information that a replacement opponent has already been announced, compels me to update my forecast. The naming of a new opponent moves the status of the fight from 'cancelled' to 'replaced'. Reinstating the original fight would now require a highly improbable sequence of events: the new opponent would have to pull out, Walker's injury would have to be revealed as non-existent or trivial, and the UFC would have to agree to re-book the original fight on the same card. This chain of events is so unlikely that my previous 1% forecast now seems too high. While I agree with the spirit of Forecaster 3's 0% forecast, I will maintain a minimal, non-zero probability to account for the extreme unpredictability of combat sports scheduling, though I concede the true probability is functionally zero. I am therefore decreasing my forecast from 1% to 0.1% to reflect the increased certainty provided by the announcement of a replacement fighter.",
