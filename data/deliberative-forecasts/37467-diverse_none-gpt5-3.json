    "review": "Both forecasters emphasize the short time horizon and lack of clear acute catalysts—points I also relied on. Forecaster 2’s framing of the status quo bias over a ~7-week window matches my base-rate thinking, and their triggers (restructuring advisor hires, covenant breaches, payment issues) are the right near-term watch items. Forecaster 3 adds the idea that a recent quarterly update implies some runway, which is directionally reasonable (though timing-sensitive around Q1). Neither adds materially new evidence; both reinforce the same core thesis: absent visible imminent catalysts, bankruptcy within this narrow window is possible but not likely. I find their reasoning sound and consistent with my own.",
    "rationale": "With ~7 weeks left, the most probable path is continued operation and cash management rather than an abrupt Chapter 11, especially without a near-term maturity wall. Beyond Meat’s ongoing losses keep tail risk present, but typical precursors (missed payments, forbearances, advisor mandates, explicit minimum-liquidity warnings) have not been flagged here. The main near-term swing factor is the Q1 2025 disclosure cycle—if it reveals an acute liquidity shortfall, covenant breach, or vendors tightening terms, odds could jump quickly. Conversely, any incremental financing, improved gross margin/cash burn, or confirmation of runway beyond 12 months would reduce risk. Given no new hard signals beyond what I already considered, I’m holding my estimate. I would update upward on verifiable news of restructuring advisors, a covenant default without waiver, or inability to meet obligations; downward on fresh financing or a clearly adequate liquidity runway in the Q1 filing.",
