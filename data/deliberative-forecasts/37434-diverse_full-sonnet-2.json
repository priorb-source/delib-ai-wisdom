    "review": "Forecaster 3 raises the most compelling new argument: if cash was truly just $230K at year-end 2024 and the company has survived ~4 months into May without filing, this is strong evidence they have more ability to delay than the raw numbers suggest. This survival period demonstrates either: unreported cash sources, aggressive payment deferrals, or drastically reduced burn after the December shutdown. Forecaster 3's emphasis on the low debt-to-equity ratio (0.05) is also crucial - I underweighted this. Without aggressive creditors demanding payment or triggering covenant defaults, there's no forcing function pushing management to file immediately. The company can pursue alternatives like asset sales or out-of-court wind-downs.\n\nForecaster 2's 85% forecast emphasizes the inevitability argument - with zero operations and failed capital raises, bankruptcy is the logical endpoint. This is correct for longer timeframes, but the 8-week horizon changes the calculus. Companies in distress often survive surprisingly long when creditor pressure is minimal.\n\nHowever, I can't go as low as 45%. Management's explicit statement of insufficient liquidity, the going-concern warning, complete cessation of operations, and year-long failure to raise capital all point toward an extremely narrow path to survival. The question is whether they can delay 8 more weeks, not whether they're viable long-term.",
    "rationale": "Reviewing the arguments, I'm updating downward from 70% to 60%. Forecaster 3's survival-so-far argument is persuasive - the company has demonstrated resilience beyond what the December numbers suggested. The combination of minimal debt (creating low creditor pressure) and the short remaining timeframe (only 8 weeks) makes survival more plausible than I initially assessed. They've already managed 4+ months; 8 more weeks requires only modest additional runway extension through asset sales, micro-financing, or aggressive cost management.\n\nHowever, I'm not going below 60% because the fundamentals remain catastrophic: explicit management warnings, zero operations, zero revenue, and consistent failure to secure capital. While the low debt reduces immediate forcing functions, ongoing expenses (legal, regulatory, insurance) continue to burn cash. The longer they delay, the more likely an unexpected trigger (creditor action, tax obligation, lease dispute) precipitates a filing. At 60%, I'm acknowledging both the genuine possibility of delay tactics succeeding through July 1 and the high baseline risk that a company in this condition files for bankruptcy protection to manage its wind-down.",
