    "review": "Both forecasters reinforce the inertia case well. The most useful added angles versus my prior take: (1) Q1 ended before the April tariff-driven drawdown, so any entry would have been at still-elevated pre-shock valuations—this lowers the plausibility of a value-driven Q1 buy; (2) the reminder about Buffett’s historic optics concern around Microsoft reduces that specific path; and (3) the point that confidential treatment, if used, would lead to a No resolution even if accumulation is underway, slightly skews the odds downward for a revealed position. I already considered low turnover, net selling, and general Mag 7 skepticism, but the timing/valuation and the Microsoft optics points are incremental and persuasive.",
    "rationale": "The base case remains that Berkshire discloses no new Mag 7 beyond Apple/Amazon: multi-quarter net selling, ultra-low turnover, Buffett’s comments on capital intensity, and lack of hints at the AGM or in recent commentary. The most plausible Yes paths are a small Todd/Ted stake in Alphabet/Meta (or less likely Microsoft), or an end to a confidentiality request that reveals a position. However, with Q1 ending before the April tariff dip, valuations likely weren’t compelling enough to trigger a Q1 buy, and if they were building a sizable stake, confidentiality would likely mask it, resolving No for this quarter. Given the additional arguments from the other forecasters—especially the Q1 timing relative to the drawdown and the Microsoft optics—I’m shading my estimate slightly lower. I still allow a small chance for a disclosed, modest stake by the lieutenants in Alphabet/Meta, but see it as unlikely.",
