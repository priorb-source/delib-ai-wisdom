  "information": "On April 29, 2025, Egypt's Minister of Youth and Sports, Dr. Ashraf Sobhy, met with Gilberto Gartner, a Brazilian national who is the President of the International Traditional Karate Federation (ITKF). The purpose of the meeting was to discuss Egypt's bid to host the 2026 World Traditional Karate Championship. Dr. Sobhy stated that Egypt has organized over 440 sports events in recent years, citing its modern sports infrastructure. President Gartner expressed confidence in Egypt's ability to host the championship successfully, noting he had witnessed a high level of organization at the World Gymnastics Championship in Egypt and that the country has a large base of karate practitioners.\n\nEgypt has a recent history of hosting major international sporting events. In April 2025, the country hosted the World Karate Premier League in Cairo, which involved 384 players from 67 countries. In May 2025, Egypt hosted the Pharaohs' Championship for Rhythmic Gymnastics with 18 participating countries, the African Championship for Rhythmic Gymnastics with 8 participating countries, and the 25th World Military Equestrian Championship with 20 participating nations. Egypt is also scheduled to host the Senior World Karate Championships (an event of the separate World Karate Federation) in November 2025.\n\nAnalysis of the International Traditional Karate Federation (ITKF) indicates a pattern of announcing World Championship hosts 24 to 36 months prior to the event. As of mid-May 2025, there is no mention of Egypt's 2026 bid, nor any related bid documentation, on the ITKF's official website. There have been no public reports of other nations submitting competing bids for the 2026 championship. Egypt previously hosted an ITKF event in 2014.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "54 days, from May 8, 2025 to July 1, 2025",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No announcement has been made by the ITKF regarding Egypt hosting the 2026 Traditional Karate World Championship. If this status quo continues, the question resolves as No.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "The ITKF does not make an official announcement before July 1, 2025. This could occur because: the organizational approval process takes longer than the remaining 54 days, internal ITKF deliberations extend beyond the deadline, formal documentation and contracts require additional time, or the ITKF delays its decision to evaluate other potential hosts.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Following the April 29, 2025 meeting between Dr. Ashraf Sobhy and President Gilberto Gartner, the ITKF completes its internal approval process and formally announces within the next 7.5 weeks that Egypt will host the 2026 Traditional Karate World Championship. The announcement appears on the ITKF's official channels before July 1, 2025.",
    "rationale": "The recent April 29 meeting (just 9 days ago) between Egypt's Sports Minister and the ITKF President represents significant positive momentum. President Gartner's expressed confidence and Egypt's demonstrated capacity through hosting 440+ sporting events, including recent major karate and gymnastics championships, are strong factors in Egypt's favor. Additionally, no competing bids have been publicly reported, which suggests Egypt may be the frontrunner.\n\nHowever, several factors constrain the probability upward. Most critically, the ITKF typically announces World Championship hosts 24-36 months in advance. For a 2026 event, we're now at approximately 18-20 months out, which is shorter than the typical pattern. Despite the recent high-level meeting, no announcement has appeared on the ITKF's official website as of mid-May. This suggests the decision-making process is not yet complete.\n\nWith only 54 days remaining until the July 1 deadline, international sports federations often require time for board approvals, contract negotiations, formal documentation, and coordinated announcements. The status quo—no announcement yet—should receive substantial weight since organizational processes tend to move slowly.\n\nI'm not forecasting higher because: (1) the absence of any announcement despite the April 29 meeting suggests processes are ongoing, (2) the compressed timeline compared to typical ITKF patterns, and (3) bureaucratic processes rarely complete in under two months. I'm not forecasting lower because: (1) the very recent positive high-level engagement, (2) Egypt's strong credentials and infrastructure, (3) absence of known competing bids, and (4) sufficient time remains for an announcement if internal approvals move reasonably quickly.\n\nI would revise upward if: ITKF board meetings are scheduled or announced, preliminary communications or social media hints emerge, or Egyptian officials indicate imminent announcement. I would revise downward if: the ITKF announces delays, competing bids surface, or June passes without announcement signals.",
