  "information": "In March 2025, news outlets including The Wall Street Journal reported that the US and China were in the early stages of discussing a potential 'birthday summit' for June, as Trump's birthday is on June 14 and Xi's is on June 15. The status of these discussions is uncertain. In early May 2025, Chinese President Xi Jinping is on a state visit to Russia from May 7 to 10 to meet with President Vladimir Putin and attend Victory Day celebrations. Topics for their discussion include strategic relations and the US tariff war.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "39 days. The question asks about an event between May 12, 2025 and June 15, 2025. Today is May 7, 2025.",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No. Direct phone calls between the leaders of the US and China are infrequent, carefully orchestrated diplomatic events. The current status is that no call is scheduled, and relations are characterized by tensions over issues like tariffs. Without a significant catalyst or successful diplomatic effort, no call will occur.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "The preliminary discussions for a 'birthday summit' or call do not progress beyond the 'early stages' due to a lack of consensus on agenda items or scheduling. Alternatively, the outcomes of Xi Jinping's visit with Vladimir Putin lead to a hardening of positions, making a conciliatory call with the US politically unpalatable for one or both sides before the June 15 deadline.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "The 'birthday summit' talks accelerate, and both sides agree that a direct phone call between the two leaders around their shared birthdays in mid-June is a valuable step to manage the contentious US-China relationship, particularly concerning the tariff war. Both the White House and Beijing subsequently issue official readouts confirming the call took place.",
    "rationale": "My forecast is centered on the principle of inertia in international relations; the default outcome is that significant events like a call between the US and Chinese presidents do not happen. The baseline probability is low. However, the information provided by my research assistant introduces a specific, plausible mechanism for a 'Yes' outcome: the discussion of a 'birthday summit' for June, leveraging the proximity of Trump's (June 14) and Xi's (June 15) birthdays. This nugget of information significantly increases the probability from a near-zero baseline, as it provides a clear reason for a call to happen within the specified one-month window. The primary factors tempering my forecast are the report that these discussions are in 'early' and 'uncertain' stages, and the broader geopolitical context. Xi's current meeting with Putin and the ongoing tariff war represent significant headwinds that could easily derail these delicate, early-stage talks. The resolution criteria are also strict, requiring both sides to acknowledge the call, which filters out informal or disputed contacts. \n\nMy probability is not higher than 35% because the status quo of tense relations and the high bar for diplomatic coordination make 'No' the more likely outcome. The 'uncertain' nature of the talks means they are more likely to fizzle out than succeed in the short timeframe. \n\nMy probability is not lower than 35% because the 'birthday summit' reports provide a concrete, timely, and plausible catalyst for the event in question. Overlooking this specific intelligence would be a mistake. It indicates there is active intent and a diplomatic channel being explored for this exact purpose. \n\nI would increase my forecast if credible news sources report that the summit/call discussions have progressed to advanced stages or that a date is being finalized. I would decrease my forecast if either government formally downplays the possibility of a call, or if a new major diplomatic incident occurs that raises tensions further.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill Donald Trump and Xi Jinping speak on the phone with each other before June 15, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nCBS News: [Trump says he's talked with Xi about tariffs. China has denied talks are taking place](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/trump-xi-china-tariffs/)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if, after May 12, 2025 and before June 15, 2025, Donald Trump and Xi Jinping speak on the phone with each other, according to [credible sources](https://www.metaculus.com/faq/#definitions).\n\nBoth sides must acknowledge the phone call took place for it to count. \"Speak on the phone with each other\" is defined as both individuals, from different physical spaces, orally uttering words intended for the other individual into a telephone or equivalent device, those words being converted into electrical or digital signals in real time, and then transferred to the other individual via telecommunications links, where they are reconverted into sound waves at the other individual's listening device.\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nIn March 2025, news outlets including The Wall Street Journal reported that the US and China were in the early stages of discussing a potential 'birthday summit' for June, as Trump's birthday is on June 14 and Xi's is on June 15.

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
