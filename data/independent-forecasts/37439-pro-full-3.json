  "information": "According to media reports citing the Kremlin, Donald Trump and Vladimir Putin held phone conversations on February 12, 2025, and March 18, 2025. The February call reportedly lasted nearly 90 minutes. The March call was to discuss the war in Ukraine and a potential 30-day ceasefire proposal. On April 4, 2025, Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov stated that no phone conversations between the leaders were planned for the near future.\n\nOn May 5, 2025, Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov stated that a meeting between Putin and Trump is 'certainly necessary' and 'on everyone's lips.' However, Peskov emphasized that any such meeting requires 'adequate preparation' at 'various expert levels' and that, as of that date, there were no specific details or a set date.\n\nDonald Trump is scheduled to travel to Saudi Arabia, Qatar, and the United Arab Emirates in mid-May 2025 to participate in a Gulf summit. In late April, Trump mentioned the possibility of a meeting with Putin during this trip. On May 5, Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov stated that Putin's schedule does not currently include a trip to the Middle East.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Approximately 5 weeks.",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Diplomatic efforts continue to focus on arranging a future in-person summit, and no urgent geopolitical crisis emerges that necessitates a direct phone call between the two leaders before June 15. Communication continues through lower-level diplomatic channels as preparations for a later meeting proceed.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "A significant development in the war in Ukraine, either a major escalation or a legitimate ceasefire opportunity, prompts an urgent call. Alternatively, as part of the planning for a future in-person summit, Trump and Putin hold a preparatory call to personally discuss the agenda and key objectives.",
    "rationale": "My forecast is based primarily on recent official communications, which suggest a call is unlikely in the specified window. The Kremlin's statements as of early May 2025 emphasize the need for 'adequate preparation' for a meeting, indicating a focus on a more formal, future summit rather than an imminent phone call. Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov also stated in April that no calls were planned for the near future. This establishes a strong status quo where no call occurs. However, the probability is not lower because Donald Trump and Vladimir Putin have already established a precedent for direct communication with two phone calls earlier in 2025, demonstrating a willingness to engage. The geopolitical situation, particularly in Ukraine, remains volatile and could create an urgent need for leader-level discussion at any moment. Furthermore, Trump's personal style of diplomacy could lead him to initiate a call to expedite preparations for a summit. My forecast would increase with any intelligence suggesting a call is being actively scheduled or if a major international crisis erupts. It would decrease if either side explicitly rules out direct contact until a future summit date is set beyond the resolution period.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill Donald Trump and Vladimir Putin speak on the phone with each other before June 15, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nWikipedia: [February 2025 Putin–Trump call](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/February_2025_Putin%E2%80%93Trump_call)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if, after May 12, 2025 and before June 15, 2025, Donald Trump and Vladimir Putin speak on the phone with each other, according to [credible sources](https://www.metaculus.com/faq/#definitions).\n\nBoth sides must acknowledge the phone call took place for it to count. \"Speak on the phone with each other\" is defined as both Trump and Putin, from different physical spaces, orally uttering words intended for the other individual into a telephone or equivalent device, those words being converted into electrical or digital signals in real time, and then transferred to the other individual via telecommunications links, where they are reconverted into sound waves at the other individual's listening device.\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nAccording to media reports citing the Kremlin, Donald Trump and Vladimir Putin held phone conversations on February 12, 2025, and March 18, 2025.

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
