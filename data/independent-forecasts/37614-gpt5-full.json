  "information": "Brent Metz, a 39-year-old town councilman in Mountain View, Colorado, pleaded not guilty to felony charges related to the shooting of a 17-year-old high school student in September 2024. According to investigators, Metz shot the teen in the face while the teen was sitting in his car outside Metz's home, where he had been trying to take homecoming dance pictures. A Jefferson County Sheriff’s spokesperson stated that there was no indication the teen intended to commit any crime. Metz took a leave of absence from the council after the shooting.\n\nA recall election for Brent Metz is scheduled for May 20, 2025, after a recall petition was successfully certified. The election is being conducted by mail, and ballots were sent to voters in late April 2025. Mountain View is a small town with a population of approximately 500-600 residents and fewer than 400 active voters. No public polling data on the recall election is available.\n\nHistorical data for U.S. local recall elections shows that approximately 60% of recalls that make it to the ballot succeed in removing the official. Several recent recall efforts in other small Colorado towns have been successful. In March 2025, three council members in Dillon were removed by voters in a recall election related to a development plan. In a separate 2025 case in Loveland, the targeted council member resigned from his position after a recall petition gathered sufficient signatures.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "About 8 days (election May 20, 2025; preliminary results likely that night)",
    "status_quo_outcome": "Metz retains his seat (recall fails)",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "High-turnout, mobilized electorate votes to remove Metz, driven by negative sentiment over the shooting incident and felony charges; mail-ballot convenience and small-town organizing by recall proponents lead to a clear majority for removal.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Low-to-moderate turnout where Metz’s personal networks and name recognition carry the day; enough voters accept a wait-for-due-process argument or see the recall as excessive, producing a narrow majority against recall.",
    "rationale": "Base rates: Roughly 60% of local recall elections that reach the ballot succeed, implying a ~40% survival baseline. The facts here likely worsen Metz’s odds versus that baseline: he is charged with shooting a 17-year-old in the face, the sheriff has said there was no indication the teen intended to commit any crime, and Metz took a leave from the council. In a very small electorate (fewer than 400 active voters), the successful petition and ensuing media coverage suggest meaningful local opposition and capacity to mobilize. Colorado small-town recalls have recently succeeded (e.g., Dillon in March 2025), which is directionally consistent with removal. Countervailing considerations: status quo bias and inertia often help incumbents, and mail-only elections can cut both ways. In a tiny town, personal ties and a cohesive pro-incumbent bloc could be disproportionately influential if turnout is modest. Without polling, variance is high. Summary of assistant’s info affecting the forecast: May 20 mail-ballot recall is set; ballots mailed late April; tiny electorate; no polling; base-rate success for recalls around 60%; recent Colorado small-town recalls have succeeded; Metz pleaded not guilty to felony charges. Why not higher (i.e., why not >50% survival): The severity and optics of the incident, the certified recall petition in a tiny town, and base rates all point to removal being more likely than not. Why not lower (e.g., <20% survival): Status quo advantages, uncertainty in tiny electorates, and the possibility that Metz’s supporters are more cohesive or turnout is lower than recall proponents expect keep a nontrivial survival chance. What would move me up: Evidence of strong local endorsements for Metz; signs of low overall turnout with high return rates from precincts/demographics favorable to him; credible new exculpatory information; visible, well-funded anti-recall campaign activity. What would move me down: New damaging revelations or legal developments; indications of very high turnout driven by recall proponents; public statements from town influencers against Metz; early ballot return data showing robust participation from groups aligned with the recall.",
