    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Approximately one and a half months.",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No. The sale of hemp-derived THC products under current regulations continues.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "The Texas legislative session ends in early June 2025 without a bill fully banning THC sales passing both chambers and being sent to the governor. Legislative inertia, lobbying from the hemp industry, and a lack of unified political will prevent the bill's passage before the deadline.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "In the final weeks of the legislative session, a well-positioned lawmaker successfully attaches a THC ban as an amendment to a must-pass bill. The amendment survives conference committee, the final bill is passed by both chambers, and Governor Abbott signs it into law before July 1, 2025.",
    "rationale": "My forecast is heavily influenced by the principle of status quo bias and the significant procedural hurdles any new legislation faces, particularly on such a short timeline. The primary factor driving my low probability for a 'Yes' outcome is the legislative calendar. As of today, May 14, 2025, the 89th Texas Legislature's regular session is scheduled to adjourn sine die on June 2, 2025. This leaves less than three weeks to pass a controversial bill through both the House and Senate, reconcile any differences, and get it to the Governor's desk. This is an exceptionally narrow window for non-trivial legislation. Furthermore, similar legislative efforts to restrict THC products faced strong opposition and ultimately failed in the 2023 session. The Texas hemp industry has become an established economic and lobbying force, creating significant political headwinds against a full ban. While key conservative leaders may personally oppose THC, there is no high-profile, unified push to make this a top priority in the session's final days. The chance of a 'Yes' outcome is not zero because last-minute amendments to must-pass bills are a known, albeit uncommon, legislative tactic. A sudden public safety scandal related to THC could also galvanize political will. However, these scenarios are remote. The probability is not higher because the structural and political barriers, especially the ticking clock, are immense. I would raise my forecast if a THC ban bill suddenly cleared a major hurdle, like passing a full vote in either the House or Senate, or if the Governor publicly declared it an emergency item. My forecast would drop to near-zero upon the legislature's adjournment without such a bill passing.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill the state of Texas ban THC before July 1, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nBeaumont Enterprise: [Will THC see its final death blow in Texas this session?](https://www.beaumontenterprise.com/news/article/texas-senate-bill-aims-ban-thc-activists-call-20279801.php)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if before July 1, 2025, Texas enacts a law prohibiting the sale of THC. If no new prohibitions on the sale of THC become law in Texas before that date, this question resolves as No.\n\nFor it to count, a law must fully prohibit the sale of THC within the state. This question resolves upon a ban being signed into law, rather than when it is implemented. An enacted law being later overturned will not cause the question to re-resolve. Partial bans (for example laws prohibiting the sale of THC to persons under 21 years of age) will not count. This question pertains to the sale of THC within the state, not to the purchase of it by individuals.\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nNo additional information available.\n\nToday is 2025-05-14.\n\nBefore answering you think:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n(e) You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
