  "information": "The latest published value for Ukraine's government debt for February 2025 was 1.869 trillion UAH. The threshold for the question to resolve as 'Yes' is 1.900 trillion UAH, necessitating a month-on-month increase of at least 30.5 billion UAH. Historical data from 2024-2025 shows that the typical monthly net change in debt ranged from a decrease of 10 billion UAH to an increase of 110 billion UAH. The median monthly increase during this period was approximately 25 billion UAH, and the increase from January to February 2025 was 18.5 billion UAH. In seven of the twelve months preceding March 2025, the monthly increase was 30 billion UAH or greater.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Less than one month. The data for March 2025 is due to be published by the resolution source in the coming weeks.",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No. The most recent monthly debt increase (18.5 billion UAH from January to February 2025) and the median monthly increase over the past year (approx. 25 billion UAH) are both below the 31 billion UAH required to reach the 1.90 trillion UAH threshold.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "The monthly increase in government debt for March 2025 is less than 31 billion UAH. This scenario would materialize if the pace of borrowing aligns with the recent trend or the median, possibly due to a temporary lull in major international aid disbursements or lower-than-average domestic bond auction results for the month.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "The government debt increases by 31 billion UAH or more in March 2025. This would likely be driven by the booking of a significant tranche of foreign financial aid or a large issuance of domestic war bonds to finance ongoing wartime expenditures. An increase of this magnitude is consistent with the higher-end of monthly fluctuations observed over the past year.",
    "rationale": "My forecast is based on an analysis of recent trends, historical volatility, and the underlying macroeconomic context. The key data point is that Ukraine's government debt was 1.869 trillion UAH in February 2025, requiring an increase of at least 31 billion UAH in March to resolve this question as 'Yes'.\n\nThe research indicates two conflicting signals. The median monthly increase over the past year was approximately 25 billion UAH, and the most recent increase (January to February 2025) was even lower at 18.5 billion UAH. These figures, representing the 'status quo' trend, both point towards a 'No' outcome.\n\nHowever, a crucial piece of information is that in 7 of the 12 months preceding March 2025, the monthly debt increase was 30 billion UAH or greater. This historical frequency (7/12, or ~58%) suggests that while the median increase is low, months with large increases sufficient to meet the threshold are actually more common than not. In a volatile, war-time economy dependent on large, irregular aid packages, the historical frequency of such events is a more reliable guide than the median or a single month's data point.\n\nMy forecast of 58% is anchored directly to this historical frequency. It is not higher because the recent trend and median data provide a substantial counter-signal, indicating that smaller monthly increases are also common and possible. It is not lower because ignoring the fact that large increases have occurred more often than not over the last year would be to dismiss the most pertinent evidence for a high-variance process like wartime government financing.\n\nI would increase my forecast upon learning of a large aid disbursement or successful bond auction confirmed for March 2025. Conversely, I would decrease it if reports indicated that expected foreign financing for March was delayed into April.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill Ukraine's government debt be at least 1.90 trillion UAH in March 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\n[Ukraine is one step away from stagflation. And here's why](https://en.iz.ru/en/1868046/2025-04-10/ukraine-one-step-away-stagflation-and-heres-why)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if Ukraine's government debt is greater than or equal to 1.90 billion UAH Thousand (in other words, 1.90 trillion Ukrainian hryvnia for the month of March 2025, according to the number presented by [Trading Economics](https://tradingeconomics.com/ukraine/government-debt). Under 1.90 billion UAH Thousand resolves as **No**.\n\n\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nThe latest published value for Ukraine's government debt for February 2025 was 1.869 trillion UAH. The threshold for the question to resolve as 'Yes' is 1.900 trillion UAH, necessitating a month-on-month increase of at least 30.5 billion UAH.

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
