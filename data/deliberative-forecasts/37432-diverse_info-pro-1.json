    "review": "The other forecasters introduced two critical and conflicting arguments I had not fully considered. Forecaster 2's point about the Republican-controlled legislature actively removing a citizenship verification provision from the transportation budget in February 2025 is a powerful piece of evidence. It's a 'revealed preference' that suggests a lack of consensus or political will for this specific policy, which is a strong signal for a 'No' outcome. Conversely, Forecaster 3's identification of the state's operating budget as a must-pass legislative vehicle that aligns perfectly with the June deadline provides a very plausible pathway for a 'Yes' outcome. While both arguments are compelling, I find Forecaster 2's point more persuasive. The budget vehicle creates an opportunity, but the recent action in February calls into question the political will to seize that opportunity.",
    "rationale": "My initial forecast of 40% was based on the Republican supermajority's theoretical power and the fact a gubernatorial veto is irrelevant to the question's resolution, balanced against the very short timeline. The deliberation has significantly changed my assessment. The most impactful new piece of information is that the legislature considered and rejected a similar provision just a few months ago, in February 2025, by removing it from the transportation budget. This is a very strong signal that despite the party's platform and supermajority, there is not sufficient internal consensus to pass this type of legislation easily. While Forecaster 3 correctly identifies the state budget as a viable last-minute vehicle for this policy, the February failure makes it much less likely that leadership would risk contentious budget negotiations by inserting a rider they know lacks unified support. The procedural opportunity exists, but the political will appears to be absent. Therefore, I am significantly lowering my forecast. A 'Yes' outcome is still possible if legislative leaders make a sudden, concerted push to include it in the budget, but the probability of this is much lower than I initially believed. I am updating my forecast from 40% to 25%.",
