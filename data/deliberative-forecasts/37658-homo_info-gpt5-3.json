    "review": "Forecaster 2’s emphasis on the resolution mechanics—specifically that a Yes requires an 8-K filing before July 1, not merely a de facto termination—is an important refinement I hadn’t explicitly accounted for. The 4-business-day 8-K window and potential for companies to delay termination/filing post an adverse government action modestly lowers the near-term Yes odds. I also agree with their skepticism about an uncorroborated claim of a preexisting presidential block with delayed enforcement. Forecaster 3’s points on political headwinds, union opposition, and explicit presidential statements materially raising risk are sound, but they point more to eventual failure than to a pre–July 1 termination filing. Their use of market reaction to presidential comments as a timing signal is reasonable but not decisive for the specific 8-K-by-deadline resolution. Overall, both analyses reinforce sub-50% odds and process inertia; the main incremental value for me is the precise 8-K timing nuance and the caution on unverified claims.",
    "rationale": "I continue to see the base case as continued review and negotiation into or beyond late June, with parties reluctant to terminate immediately even under adverse signals. The spread (mid-$40s vs $55) implies material regulatory/political risk, but activist longs and reports of ongoing talks suggest the parties still see paths worth pursuing or at least reasons not to walk imminently. The key update from deliberation is the 8-K filing requirement: even if a prohibition or strong adverse signal arrives in mid-to-late June, companies often take time to evaluate legal options, mitigation, and fee mechanics before terminating, and an 8-K could slip beyond July 1. That slightly reduces the chance of a Yes resolution by the cutoff. I discount the unverified claim of a pre-issued presidential block; if such an order were public and imminent, we’d expect clearer market and media confirmation. Net: headwinds are real, and a swift June prohibition coupled with a rapid termination/8-K is plausible, but process inertia and disclosure timing keep the probability below one-quarter. I nudge my estimate slightly upward from my initial view to reflect the nontrivial chance of an early, definitive government action in June, but I remain lower than the other forecasters due to the strong tendency to delay termination and the tight window.",
