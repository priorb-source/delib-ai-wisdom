  "information": "According to the 338Canada statistical model, the Liberal Party is projected to win between 188 and 196 seats. National polling data indicates Liberal support is at 40-45%, compared to 37-38% for the Conservative Party. Polls also show strong performance for the Liberals in Ontario and Quebec, which together account for 199 of the 338 seats in Parliament.\n\nHistorical results show the Liberal Party won 160 seats in the 2021 federal election and 157 seats in the 2019 federal election. The last time the Liberal Party won a majority government was in the 2015 election, when they secured 184 seats.\n\nIn Canada's 338-seat House of Commons, 170 seats are required for a majority government. The analysis was conducted with 8 days remaining before the election resolution date. At that time, advance voting was underway, with reports indicating a 36% increase in turnout compared to the 2021 election.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "About 8 days (results expected on election night or within 24 hours)",
    "status_quo_outcome": "Yes — Liberals win 172+ seats",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Late-campaign tightening or polling error: the national race narrows to a tie or a small Conservative lead; the Bloc gains materially in Quebec; the NDP holds or gains urban seats at Liberal expense; turnout skews against Liberals in Ontario’s suburbs. Liberals end in the 160s–low 170s (e.g., 165–171).",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Current polling and model hold: Liberals maintain a mid–single-digit national lead, dominate Ontario and remain strong in Quebec, with strategic voting from NDP supporters in close ridings. Seat efficiency delivers something like ON 100+, QC 35–45, strong Atlantic results, competitive BC, totaling ~180–195 seats.",
    "rationale": "a) Time left: roughly one week, so limited room for fundamental shifts but still time for modest tightening or a late break. b) Status quo: Multiple polls show Liberals at ~40–45% vs Conservatives ~37–38%, with strong Ontario/Quebec numbers. The 338Canada model projects 188–196 Liberal seats, comfortably above the 172 threshold. c) No outcome path: A modest national polling error (2–3 points) against the Liberals or late momentum to Conservatives/Bloc could trim Liberal seat counts disproportionately in Quebec and Ontario’s 905, pushing totals just below 172. Higher-than-expected Bloc gains or NDP resilience in urban cores could also shave Liberal seats. d) Yes outcome path: If current margins persist, Liberal vote efficiency in Ontario and parts of Quebec typically translates into an 180+ seat outcome. e) Reasoning: I place extra weight on the status quo because late large swings are uncommon and the polling/model consensus points to a Liberal advantage where it matters most (Ontario and Quebec, 199 seats combined). The 338Canada projection range cited (188–196) suggests the central tendency is well above 172, and crossing below 172 likely requires either a notable late shift or a fairly unfavorable polling error concentrated regionally. However, I temper the probability for three reasons: (1) final-week volatility risk; (2) historical Canadian polling error of ~2 points can flip close seat races; (3) structural uncertainties—Bloc performance in Quebec and turnout dynamics (advance voting reportedly up ~36% vs 2021) could change the composition of voters in unpredictable ways. Why not higher: Because a small national tightening or Quebec-specific shift could easily cost 10–20 seats, enough to threaten the 172 line. Why not lower: Because the polling lead plus Ontario/Quebec seat efficiency and the model’s current projection all favor a result above 172. f) What would change my view: I would raise the probability if late polling shows the Liberal national lead expanding to 6–7 points with double-digit Ontario leads and stable Quebec numbers, or if 338 updates show a materially higher majority probability. I would lower it if multiple high-quality polls show a 1–2 point race, Quebec riding/regionals indicate Bloc gains at Liberal expense, or credible turnout indicators suggest a skew toward demographics that underperform for Liberals.",

Fournier, physics and astrophysics professor at Cégep de Saint-Laurent in Montreal.\"\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if the Liberal Party of Canada wins greater than or equal to 172 seats in the [2025 Canadian federal election](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2025_Canadian_federal_election).\n\n\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nAccording to the 338Canada statistical model, the Liberal Party is projected to win between 188 and 196 seats.

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
