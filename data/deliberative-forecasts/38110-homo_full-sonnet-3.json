    "review": "I find remarkable convergence across all three analyses. We independently arrived at nearly identical forecasts (12%, 15%, 12%) using the same analytical framework. All three of us: (1) started with the 20% historical base rate for security-related ECOWAS border closures within 60 days, (2) adjusted significantly downward due to the serious security nature (terrorism, arms smuggling), (3) noted the May 30 AFRICOM assessment showing deteriorating rather than improving conditions, (4) recognized the complete absence of progress signals despite the May 14 House resolution, (5) emphasized the extremely compressed 31-day remaining window. Forecaster 2's point about Benin EXTENDING operations to Lagos borders on May 9 reinforces this is a hardening, not softening, stance. No new evidence was introduced that I hadn't already considered. The convergence itself is actually valuable information - it suggests the analysis is robust and the key factors are clear.",
    "rationale": "Upon reflection, my original 12% forecast remains well-justified. The convergence at 12-15% validates the analytical approach. Several factors reinforce staying at the lower end of this range: First, we're already past day 23-25 of what would be a ~54-56 day total window, meaning we need resolution in the remaining 31 days. If only 20% of security closures resolve within 60 days, even fewer should resolve specifically when we're already past the midpoint with zero progress. Second, the AFRICOM May 30 assessment of deteriorating conditions is particularly damning - this was just yesterday and shows the trajectory is wrong. Third, Benin's extension of operations to other borders on May 9 signals escalation, not de-escalation. Fourth, the multiple serious concerns (new terror group, arms smuggling, agricultural disputes) require complex diplomatic and security arrangements that typically take months, not weeks. The economic pressure and ECOWAS frameworks that could facilitate resolution are real but insufficient to overcome these headwinds in 31 days. My forecast would only increase with concrete evidence of high-level diplomatic engagement or security cooperation announcements, neither of which exist. The 12% forecast appropriately reflects the low base rate further discounted by negative trajectory while acknowledging that rapid diplomatic breakthroughs, though highly unlikely, remain theoretically possible.",
