    "review": "The other forecasters raise critical points I underweighted. Most importantly, Forecaster 3 identifies that the resolution concerns the North America map page specifically, not the article page that already includes '(Gulf of America)' in its title. This is a crucial distinction - article titles and map labels may be maintained by different editorial processes. Forecaster 2 makes a similar point about map labels being more significant editorial decisions than article parentheticals. Both emphasize that cross-page consistency updates are infrequent without catalysts like redesigns or policy shifts, and note the absence of evidence for any such catalyst. The 54-day timeline is very short for implementing a map label change without a strong driver. While I correctly identified the article title as evidence of awareness, I over-weighted its significance for predicting the map page update. Their emphasis on base rates (geographic names rarely change on reference sites without broad consensus) and the lack of any announced plans or broader movement among similar sites is compelling.",
    "rationale": "Upon reflection, my 40% forecast was too optimistic. I conflated evidence that WorldAtlas acknowledges the alternative name (article title) with likelihood they'll update the specific North America map page. Key factors lowering my forecast: (1) The resolution targets a different page than where '(Gulf of America)' currently appears; (2) Map labels require more significant editorial decisions than article parentheticals; (3) No evidence of planned updates, site redesigns, or editorial policy shifts; (4) Only 54 days for implementation; (5) Strong base rate against geographic name changes without broad institutional consensus. However, I don't drop as low as 1-3% because WorldAtlas demonstrably knows about and legitimates the alternative name, creating non-trivial probability of cross-page standardization. A commercial U.S. website might update more readily than international authorities. I'm updating significantly downward to 7%, reflecting that while there's a real but small chance of update given their awareness, the specific page distinction, short timeline, and absence of catalysts make change unlikely.",
