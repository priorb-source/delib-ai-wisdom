    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Approximately 41 days. The outcome will be determined after July 1, 2025, based on June 2025 data (note: the question title mentions March 2025, but the resolution criteria specifies June 2025).",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No - Florida does not have the most pilot UFO sightings. With 50 US states competing and no strong evidence that Florida consistently leads in this specific category, the default expectation is that some other state will have more pilot sightings.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Another state with major aviation activity (such as California, Texas, Illinois, Georgia, or New York) has more pilot UFO sightings than Florida in June 2025, or Florida ties with another state for the most sightings. Given the randomness of UFO reports and the many states with significant air traffic, this is the more likely outcome.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Florida experiences an unusual cluster of pilot UFO sightings in June 2025, possibly due to military exercises, unusual atmospheric phenomena, or increased reporting rates. Florida's extensive coastline, multiple military installations, NASA operations, and heavy commercial aviation traffic could contribute to higher pilot observation rates.",
    "rationale": "This forecast requires assessing Florida's likelihood of leading all 50 states in a specific, relatively rare category of UFO reports. Key considerations: (1) Florida is the 3rd most populous state with substantial air traffic from tourism, commercial aviation, and military operations. (2) The state has significant aerospace activity including Cape Canaveral and multiple military bases. (3) However, without historical data showing Florida consistently leads in pilot UFO sightings specifically, I must consider that states like California, Texas, Illinois (Chicago O'Hare), and Georgia (Atlanta's Hartsfield-Jackson) also have major aviation hubs. (4) Pilot sightings are a narrow subset of total UFO reports, making monthly variation high and predictions difficult. (5) The research assistant provided no data suggesting Florida has any particular advantage. (6) With 50 competing states and no strong evidence of Florida's dominance in this category, the base rate for any single state leading would be around 2%, though major aviation states likely have somewhat higher probabilities. My forecast acknowledges Florida's significant aviation presence while recognizing the high uncertainty and competition from many other states. The forecast would increase with evidence of: historical patterns showing Florida leads in pilot sightings, unusual activity in Florida's airspace in June, or data showing Florida's typical ranking. It would decrease with evidence that other states consistently lead this category.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill Florida have the most pilot sightings of UFOs of any US state in March 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nAccording to the [National UFO Reporting Center](https://nuforc.org/about-us/): \"The National UFO Reporting Center was founded in 1974 by noted UFO investigator Robert J. Gribble. The Center’s primary function over the past five decades has been to receive, record, and to the greatest degree possible, corroborate and document reports from individuals who have been witness to unusual, possibly UFO-related events. Throughout its history, the Center has processed over 180,000 reports, and has distributed its information to thousands of individuals.\"\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if The National UFO Reporting Center posts more pilot reports of a UFO/UAP having occurred in the state of Florida than any other state, for the month of June 2025 at [this link](https://nuforc.org/subndx/?id=x) when accessed by Metaculus on or after July 1, 2025.\n\nIf Florida is tied with another state, resolves as No.\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nNo additional information available.\n\nToday is 2025-05-21.\n\nBefore answering you think:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n(e) You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
