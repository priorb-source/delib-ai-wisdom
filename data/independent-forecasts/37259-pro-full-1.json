  "information": "Following the March 2025 Greenlandic parliamentary elections, the Demokraatit party, which advocates for a gradual path to independence, emerged as the winner. The new Prime Minister, Jens-Frederik Nielsen, favors incremental autonomy and has emphasized economic development. While the more staunchly pro-independence Naleraq party doubled its number of parliamentary seats, it remains in the opposition. The government has initiated some formal steps, including the presentation of a draft constitution in May 2023 and the formation of a commission under the Self-Government Act to handle independence negotiations; this commission has been given a multi-year mandate.\n\nPublic sentiment in Greenland shows strong support for the principle of independence, with various polls indicating approval from over 80% of the population. However, opinions on the timing vary, with many favoring a more gradual approach. A January 2025 survey revealed that while 84% support independence, 45% of supporters would reconsider if it meant a decline in living standards. The debate over independence has been recently intensified by comments from former U.S. President Donald Trump about acquiring the island, which also prompted a solidarity visit from Danish King Frederik X in late April 2025 and a visit from a U.S. private sector delegation exploring investment opportunities.\n\nGreenland's economy is substantially dependent on an annual block grant from Denmark, which amounts to approximately 4.3 billion Danish kroner and makes up about half of the government's budget. The current government's stated priority is to develop Greenland's mineral resources to build economic self-sufficiency before moving toward political independence. The 2009 Self-Government Act provides the legal basis for Greenland to declare independence through a referendum. Past referendums, such as those in 1979 and 2008, had significantly longer preparation and lead times than the period before the July 1, 2025 deadline.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Approximately 2 months.",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No. The current government prioritizes gradual economic development over a quick independence referendum, and there are no plans to announce one within the short timeframe.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "The Greenlandic government, led by the Demokraatit party, adheres to its stated policy of focusing on economic self-sufficiency before pursuing independence. The multi-year commission on independence continues its work at a deliberate pace, and no major political or external catalyst emerges to force a change in strategy. The July 1, 2025 deadline passes without an announcement.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "A significant external event, such as a major political dispute with Denmark or a renewed, formal US proposal to purchase Greenland, creates a powerful surge of nationalist sentiment. The opposition Naleraq party successfully capitalizes on this public pressure, compelling the ruling coalition to make a symbolic concession by officially announcing a date for an independence referendum, even if that date is several years in the future.",
    "rationale": "My forecast of a low probability is primarily based on three factors: the explicit platform of the current Greenlandic government, the extremely short timeframe, and the established procedural path for independence. \n\n1.  **Government Policy**: The recently elected Demokraatit party, led by Prime Minister Jens-Frederik Nielsen, explicitly favors a gradualist approach. Their stated priority is achieving economic self-sufficiency, particularly through developing mineral resources, before taking concrete steps toward political independence. This strategy directly contradicts the idea of hastily announcing a referendum in the next two months. \n2.  **Timeframe**: The deadline of July 1, 2025, is less than two months away. Major constitutional decisions like scheduling an independence referendum typically involve lengthy political negotiation, public consultation, and legislative processes. Historical precedent from the 1979 and 2008 referendums suggests a much longer lead time. \n3.  **Process**: The government has already established a commission under the Self-Government Act with a multi-year mandate to handle negotiations. This reinforces the official strategy of a slow, deliberate process, not a sudden political move. \n\nWhile public support for independence is high (over 80%), this support is soft and conditional, with many voters expressing concern about a potential decline in living standards. This gives the government cover to pursue its cautious economic-first approach. \n\nMy probability is not lower than 5% because the political environment is volatile. A significant external shock, as outlined in the 'Yes' scenario, could theoretically force the government's hand into making a symbolic gesture to appease a sudden wave of public demand. The strong baseline support for independence means such a wave is not impossible. \n\nMy probability is not higher because the barriers to a 'Yes' outcome are substantial and rooted in the core strategy of the ruling party. It would require a major deviation from their stated plans and the established process within a very compressed timeframe. \n\nI would increase my forecast if key figures in the Demokraatit party began publicly discussing an accelerated timeline or if the opposition Naleraq party managed to orchestrate mass public protests. Conversely, I would decrease it if the government announced a new long-term economic initiative that implicitly pushes the independence question out for several years.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nBefore July 1, 2025, will the government of Greenland officially announce a date for an independence referendum?\n\nQuestion background:\nReuters: [Greenland's independence gradualists win election amid Trump control pledge](https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/greenland-election-tests-independence-ambitions-us-interest-looms-2025-03-11/)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if, before July 1, 2025, a referendum on the independence of Greenland from the Denmark is officially scheduled. If this does not occur before that date, this question resolves as **No**.\n\nFor purposes of this question, the referendum will be considered \"officially scheduled\" when it is announced by a person or entity with the authority to do so within Greenland. Please note that broader legality, such as it being overturned by the government of Denmark, will be considered irrelevant for this question.\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nFollowing the March 2025 Greenlandic parliamentary elections, the Demokraatit party, which advocates for a gradual path to independence, emerged as the winner.
