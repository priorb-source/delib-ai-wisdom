    "review": "Forecaster 2 raises the most critical point I initially underweighted: we are already ~25 days into the eligible window with ZERO days where both papers omitted tariffs. This empirical track record is extremely informative evidence about the true base rate. Forecaster 2's Bayesian hazard approach, yielding ~47% baseline with adjustments to 40%, is methodologically rigorous. Forecaster 3's emphasis on the ongoing nature of the April 2 tariff policy and its cascading consequences is valid, though the 10% forecast seems overly pessimistic given 23 remaining days. The observed 0-for-25 track record suggests my original assumption that each paper has only a 95% daily tariff mention rate was far too optimistic - the true rate appears closer to 97-98% for both papers mentioning tariffs simultaneously. Forecaster 2's insight about WSJ lacking Sunday editions, reducing eligible joint-opportunity days, is also important. The research indicating tariffs as 'immaterial' to NYT's business doesn't translate to editorial decisions about front-page newsworthiness - these are separate considerations.",
    "rationale": "I am significantly revising my forecast downward based on the empirical evidence. The observed 0/25 success rate in the window so far is the most powerful piece of evidence available and strongly suggests the daily probability of both papers omitting tariffs is approximately 2-4%, not the ~10% I implicitly assumed. Using Bayesian updating with this track record: if we treat this as ~25 failures, the posterior predictive probability of at least one success in the remaining ~23 days is approximately 45-50%. However, I adjust slightly downward from this baseline for several reasons: (1) tariffs remain a multi-faceted, continuously evolving story with new angles emerging regularly, (2) the WSJ's economic focus makes tariff omission particularly unlikely, (3) Memorial Day is late in the window (May 26), providing only limited relief. I adjust slightly upward because: (1) 23 days still provides meaningful opportunity, (2) major non-tariff events could suddenly dominate (international crisis, Supreme Court decision, etc.), (3) news cycles can pivot rapidly. My forecast of 35% reflects the sobering empirical evidence while acknowledging that only one day of simultaneous omission is needed over a remaining three-week period.",
