  "information": "In late 2024 and early 2025, Berkshire Hathaway was a net seller of stocks, increasing its cash position to $348 billion by May 2025. The company reduced its holdings in Apple by 50% and also sold shares in Bank of America and Citigroup. New positions were initiated in Constellation Brands, while existing stakes in Occidental Petroleum, SiriusXM Holdings, Pool Corp, and Verisign were increased. During the first quarter of 2025, Berkshire's purchases included additions to Verisign, Sirius XM, and Occidental Petroleum, as well as an estimated $2.7 billion investment in five Japanese trading houses.\n\nBerkshire Hathaway first purchased 1.27 million shares of Domino's Pizza in the third quarter of 2024. In the fourth quarter of 2024, it increased this stake to a total of 2,382,000 shares, with the investment's value growing from $549 million to $1 billion. Multiple news articles from early May 2025, published after Berkshire's annual meeting, reported that the company had further increased its stake in Domino's Pizza to 7%.\n\nFor its first fiscal quarter of 2025, Domino's Pizza reported a 0.5% decline in U.S. same-store sales and missed revenue forecasts, but it exceeded earnings per share expectations. During that same quarter, the company repurchased 115,000 of its own shares. The company's 'Hungry for More' strategy aims to open over 1,000 new stores annually until 2028 and achieve 7% annual sales growth. As part of this strategy, Domino's is set to begin a collaboration with DoorDash in 2025, following a previous partnership with Uber Eats in 2023.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Approximately 9 days. The Q1 2025 13F filing for Berkshire Hathaway is due 45 days after the quarter end (March 31, 2025), which means it should be filed by around May 15, 2025.",
    "status_quo_outcome": "Berkshire Hathaway reports holding exactly 2,382,000 shares of Domino's Pizza in its Q1 2025 13F filing, the same amount it held at the end of Q4 2024.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Berkshire Hathaway does not increase its Domino's Pizza position during Q1 2025, maintaining its 2,382,000 share position from Q4 2024, or possibly reducing it. The company's net selling approach during this period extends to Domino's, or the position remains static while Berkshire focuses its limited purchases on other holdings like Japanese trading houses, Occidental Petroleum, or Verisign.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Berkshire Hathaway purchases additional Domino's Pizza shares during Q1 2025, increasing its total holdings above 2,382,000 shares. The early May 2025 reports of a 7% stake reflect purchases made during Q1, which will be revealed in the Q1 2025 13F filing due mid-May.",
    "rationale": "This forecast weighs several competing factors. The strongest evidence supporting a Yes outcome is that multiple news articles from early May 2025 (after Berkshire's annual meeting) report an increased stake in Domino's to 7%. This timing is significant: these reports emerged just before the Q1 2025 13F filing deadline, suggesting the information reflects Q1 2025 activity that will soon be disclosed.\n\nHowever, several factors create uncertainty. First, Berkshire was predominantly a net seller during late 2024 and Q1 2025, increasing its cash position to $348 billion. This selling pressure included major holdings like Apple (reduced 50%), Bank of America, and Citigroup. While Berkshire made selective purchases during Q1 2025 (Verisign, Sirius XM, Occidental Petroleum, and Japanese trading houses), most capital was directed toward increasing cash reserves.\n\nSecond, mathematical ambiguity exists around the 7% figure. Domino's repurchased 115,000 shares during Q1 2025, which would reduce total shares outstanding and mechanically increase Berkshire's ownership percentage even without new purchases. If 2,382,000 shares represented approximately 7% after accounting for these buybacks, then no additional purchases would be necessary to reach the reported 7% stake.\n\nThird, Domino's Q1 2025 performance was mixed: U.S. same-store sales declined 0.5% and revenue missed forecasts, though EPS exceeded expectations. This mixed performance might have given Berkshire pause about adding to the position, though Buffett typically embraces buying quality businesses when near-term results disappoint.\n\nThe timing of the news reports is the most compelling factor. If the 7% represented only the Q4 2024 position, it seems unlikely this would be newsworthy in early May. The fact that multiple articles highlighted an \"increased stake\" suggests actual purchases occurred, likely during Q1 2025.\n\nMy forecast is not higher because: (1) the predominant net selling pattern at Berkshire during this period, (2) mathematical uncertainty about whether 7% represents more shares than 2,382,000, and (3) the possibility that April 2025 purchases (which would appear in Q2's 13F) are being conflated with Q1 activity.\n\nMy forecast is not lower because: (1) the strong timing correlation between news reports and the upcoming 13F filing, (2) Domino's fits Berkshire's investment criteria as a consumer brand with franchise economics, (3) Berkshire did make selective purchases during Q1 despite overall net selling, and (4) the specificity of the 7% figure suggests concrete information rather than speculation.\n\nTo update higher, I would need: confirmation that the 7% stake definitively represents holdings as of March 31, 2025, or explicit statements from Berkshire or SEC filings indicating Q1 purchases. To update lower, I would need: evidence that the 7% represents Q4 2024 holdings after adjusting for buybacks, or reports that recent purchases occurred in April 2025 (post-Q1).",
