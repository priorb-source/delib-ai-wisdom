    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "2 months",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No. Libya has signed but not ratified the AfCFTA agreement, and the ongoing political instability and divided government have prevented legislative action for years. If the current situation persists, Libya will not ratify the agreement by the deadline.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "The rival governments in Libya (the GNU in Tripoli and the GNS in the east) remain focused on internal power struggles and security issues. The ratification of the AfCFTA is not prioritized by either faction's legislative body, and the deadline of July 1, 2025, passes without any action being taken.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "A key political faction, likely the internationally-recognized Government of National Unity (GNU), decides to fast-track the ratification process to signal international cooperation and score a diplomatic win. They manage to secure a swift vote in a legislative session, completing the process just before the deadline.",
    "rationale": "My forecast is based primarily on the severe and persistent political fragmentation in Libya. The country has been operating with two rival governments and parliaments for years, leading to legislative gridlock. This makes the ratification of a major international treaty exceptionally difficult. The AfCFTA was signed by Libya in 2019, and the lack of ratification in the intervening years demonstrates the depth of this paralysis. The current status quo is non-ratification, and status quos are generally persistent.\n\nFurthermore, the deadline is only two months away. This is a very short timeframe for any country's legislative process, let alone one as dysfunctional as Libya's. The political priorities for Libyan leaders are overwhelmingly focused on domestic issues like security, control of oil revenues, and the perpetually-delayed national elections, not pan-African trade policy.\n\nMy forecast is not lower than 2% because unforeseen political events are always possible. A powerful external actor could apply significant pressure, or one faction might see a sudden strategic advantage in ratifying the treaty unilaterally to bolster its legitimacy. However, the probability is not higher because there is no current evidence to suggest that AfCFTA ratification is on the agenda for any significant political actor in Libya. The short timeline and the deep-seated political divisions make the chances of successful ratification exceedingly small. I would increase my forecast if there were credible reports of a legislative push for ratification or a significant breakthrough in political unification talks.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill Libya ratify AfCFTA (the pan-African free trade agreement) before July 1, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nWikipedia: [African Continental Free Trade Area](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/African_Continental_Free_Trade_Area)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if Libya ratifies the African Continental Free Trade Area (AfCFTA) Agreement before July 1, 2025.\n\n\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nNo additional information available.\n\nToday is 2025-05-01.\n\nBefore answering you think:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n(e) You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
