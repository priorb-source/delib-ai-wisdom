    "review": "The other two forecasters and I are in strong agreement, with initial forecasts falling in a tight 24-28% range. We all correctly identify the short timeline and lack of concrete campaign activity as the primary drivers for a low probability. Forecaster 2's analysis was a solid reinforcement of my own initial reasoning. Forecaster 3, however, introduced two excellent and specific arguments I had not fully weighed. First, the historical precedent for Democratic Senate candidates in Texas announcing around 16-20 months before the election makes a pre-July 1 announcement plausible in theory. More importantly and persuasively, Forecaster 3 raised the tactical disadvantage of announcing at the very end of a fundraising quarter. This was the most compelling new argument, as it provides a strong, concrete reason for a campaign to delay its launch by a few weeks.",
    "rationale": "My initial forecast was 25%. After reviewing my peers' analyses, I am lowering my probability to 20%. The reasoning provided by Forecaster 3 regarding the timing of federal fundraising quarters is the primary driver for this change. A campaign launch is a meticulously planned event, and the first fundraising report serves as a critical measure of viability and momentum. Announcing in late June, just before the June 30th Q2 deadline, would hamstring O'Rourke's campaign with a tiny, likely unimpressive, initial fundraising report covering only a few days. The strategic incentive to wait until July 1st or 2nd to announce, thereby allowing a full three months of fundraising for the Q3 report, is extremely strong. This tactical consideration provides a powerful and specific reason for delay that goes beyond the general lack of activity. While historical precedent shows an announcement in this timeframe is plausible, I believe the fundraising quarter argument presents a more immediate and compelling tactical reason to wait just past the deadline. This new factor outweighs the general plausibility and makes a 'No' resolution more likely, warranting a 5-point downward adjustment to my forecast.",
