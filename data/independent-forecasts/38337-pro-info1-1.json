  "information": "According to the U.S. Department of Labor, initial jobless claims for the week ending May 31, 2025, rose by 8,000 to 247,000, the highest level in eight months. The figure for the prior week was revised to 239,000. The four-week moving average increased to 235,000, the highest since November 2021. For the week ending May 24, the number of continuing claims was 1.904 million, a slight decrease of 3,000 from the previous week.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Approximately 20 days. The report for the week ending June 21, 2025, is scheduled to be released on Thursday, June 26, 2025.",
    "status_quo_outcome": "Yes. The most recent initial jobless claims figure (247,000 for the week ending May 31) and the four-week moving average (235,000) are both comfortably above the 220,000 threshold. If this trend continues for the next few weeks, the outcome will be Yes.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "A 'No' outcome would occur if there is an unexpected improvement in the labor market over the next two weeks. This could be driven by a surprising surge in seasonal hiring, the resolution of a large-scale labor dispute that had inflated prior claims, or a statistical revision. In this scenario, claims would need to reverse their recent upward trend and drop by more than 27,000 from the latest reading to fall below the 220,000 line.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "A 'Yes' outcome occurs if the labor market continues its recent, gradual cooling trend. Persistent high interest rates continue to moderate business activity, leading to a steady stream of layoffs. The weekly claims number remains volatile but stays within the recently established range of 230,000-250,000, easily exceeding the 220,000 threshold.",
    "rationale": "My forecast is heavily influenced by the status quo and recent trend data. The latest report for the week ending May 31, 2025, showed initial claims at 247,000, which is significantly above the 220,000 threshold. More importantly, this was noted as an eight-month high, and the four-week moving average has risen to 235,000, its highest level since November 2021. This indicates not just a one-time spike but a sustained upward trend, suggesting a softening labor market. The gap of 27,000 between the last data point and the threshold is a substantial buffer against weekly volatility.\n\nMy forecast is not higher than 80% because initial claims are a notoriously noisy weekly data series. A single large company reversing a layoff decision, or statistical quirks related to seasonal adjustments around the Juneteenth holiday (which falls within the resolution week), could cause a temporary dip below the threshold. The economy is not in a freefall; continuing claims are relatively stable, suggesting that while layoffs are up, a full-blown recession is not yet certain.\n\nMy forecast is not lower than 80% because the evidence for a cooling labor market is consistent and recent. To get a 'No' result would require a sharp reversal of an established multi-week trend, which is a lower probability event. The macroeconomic backdrop of sustained high interest rates supports the thesis of continued labor market moderation.\n\nI would update my forecast lower (towards No) if the next two weekly reports, for the weeks ending June 7 and June 14, show consecutive, sharp decreases that bring the level close to 220,000. I would update higher (towards Yes) if claims remain elevated in the 240,000+ range, confirming the new, higher baseline.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill initial jobless claims for the week ended June 21, 2025 exceed 220,000?\n\nQuestion background:\nAccording to the resolution source, \"An initial claim is a claim filed by an unemployed individual after a separation from an employer. The claim requests a determination of basic eligibility for the Unemployment Insurance program.\"\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if initial jobless claims for the week ended June 21, 2025 is greater than 220,000 according to [FRED](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/ICSA).&#x20;\n\n\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nAccording to the U.S. Department of Labor, initial jobless claims for the week ending May 31, 2025, rose by 8,000 to 247,000, the highest level in eight months. The figure for the prior week was revised to 239,000. The four-week moving average increased to 235,000, the highest since November 2021.

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
