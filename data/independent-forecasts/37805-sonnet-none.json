    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Approximately 6 weeks (from May 20, 2025 to July 1, 2025)",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No - Based on the background article mentioning Northern Marianas' struggles with flight suspensions and travel restrictions, the current number of direct flight destinations is likely at or below 4",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Saipan continues facing tourism challenges with limited airline connectivity. No new routes are established before July 1, 2025, and the existing network of 4 or fewer destinations remains stable or potentially sees route suspensions due to weak demand or airline operational decisions",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Tourism recovery accelerates in the next 6 weeks, and airlines either restore previously suspended routes or add new direct destinations. Saipan reaches 5 or more direct flight destinations by July 1, potentially through increased service from Asian carriers or restoration of previously discontinued routes",
    "rationale": "The key challenge here is the very short timeframe - only 6 weeks until resolution. Airlines typically require months of advance planning to establish new routes, including scheduling, regulatory approvals, marketing, and crew planning. The background article explicitly mentions that Northern Marianas is 'struggling to revive tourism amid flight suspensions and travel restrictions,' which strongly suggests the current connectivity is limited. In aviation, small island destinations like Saipan typically have constrained route networks due to limited demand, aircraft capacity constraints, and economic viability concerns. The status quo heavily favors No because: (1) the region faces documented tourism struggles, (2) 6 weeks is insufficient time for meaningful airline network expansion, (3) the world changes slowly, especially in aviation networks. My forecast is not higher because there's no evidence of imminent route announcements or rapid tourism recovery, and the short timeframe makes significant changes unlikely. My forecast is not lower (not closer to 10%) because there's uncertainty about the current exact number of destinations - if there are already 4 destinations, only one additional route would be needed, and there's some possibility of seasonal summer service additions I'm unaware of. To update higher, I would need evidence of: announced new routes starting by July 1, current destinations already numbering 4+, or major airlines committing to Saipan expansion. To update lower, I would need confirmation that current destinations number only 1-2 with no expansion plans",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill there be greater than 4 direct flight destinations from Saipan, Northern Mariana Islands on July 1, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nTravel and Tour World: [Northern Marianas struggles to revive tourism amid flight suspensions and travel restrictions: What you need to know?](https://www.travelandtourworld.com/news/article/northern-marianas-struggles-to-revive-tourism-amid-flight-suspensions-and-travel-restrictions-what-you-need-to-know/)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if there are greater than 4 direct flight destinations listed at the [All scheduled direct (non-stop) flights from Saipan (SPN)](https://www.flightsfrom.com/SPN) tracker when checked by Metaculus on or after July 1, 2025.\n\n\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nNo additional information available.\n\nToday is 2025-05-20.\n\nBefore answering you think:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n(e) You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
