    "review": "The other two forecasters provided excellent and congruent analyses, focusing on the central dynamic of this matchup: Johnny Walker's immense physical advantages versus Azamat Murzakanov's undefeated record and power. I found Forecaster 3's structured approach particularly compelling, as they explicitly separated the probability of the fight occurring from the conditional probability of Walker winning. Both forecasters argued convincingly that the sheer magnitude of Walker's 11-inch reach advantage is a primary factor, perhaps more significant than I had initially weighted it. They have persuaded me that while Walker's vulnerabilities are real, Murzakanov faces an unprecedented challenge in simply closing the distance to exploit them.",
    "rationale": "After reviewing my peers' analyses, I am making a slight upward revision to my forecast from 44% to 45%. My initial forecast was heavily influenced by Walker's inconsistent performances and Murzakanov's durability and power. However, the other forecasters have convinced me to place more weight on the extreme difficulty Murzakanov will face in navigating the 11-inch reach disparity. This physical reality makes Walker a slight favorite *if the fight takes place*. I will therefore adjust my conditional probability for a Walker win from ~52% to ~55%. I maintain a significant discount for the possibility of fight cancellation, which resolves as 'No'. I estimate an 18% chance the bout does not happen as scheduled. My updated forecast is now the product of these two probabilities: an 82% chance the fight occurs, multiplied by a 55% conditional probability that Walker wins, resulting in approximately 45%. This minor adjustment reflects a refinement in my weighting of the in-cage factors, not a fundamental change in my overall analysis.",
