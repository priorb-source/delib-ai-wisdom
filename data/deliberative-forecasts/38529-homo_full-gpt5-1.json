    "review": "Both forecasters largely corroborate my baseline: consistent double‑digit Cuomo lead across multiple independent polls; Marist’s RCV simulation puts him over 50% in later rounds; and Cuomo’s coalition advantages (Orthodox blocs, targeted Latino outreach, IE support) are meaningful in a low‑turnout NYC primary. New and useful emphasis from them: (1) NYC Democratic primary electorates skew older/more moderate than the city overall, which historically benefits a Cuomo‑type profile; (2) caution about municipal polling/turnout composition error and RCV transfer uncertainty; (3) a specific risk framing that non‑Cuomo voters could cohere late under RCV if anti‑Cuomo sentiment crystallizes. I find their reasoning sound. I view the “non‑Cuomo moderate coalescence” path as relatively unlikely this late, but their points on polling freshness (few high‑quality June polls yet) and RCV volatility are valid and warrant a slight trim from my prior.",
    "rationale": "Status quo: Cuomo remains the clear frontrunner with high‑30s/low‑40s first‑choice support in March–May polling and a Marist RCV simulation showing him clearing 50% in round 5. He has cohesive, high‑turnout community support, significant outside spending, and high name recognition. NYC’s Democratic primary electorate tends to be older and more moderate, aligning with his profile. Under RCV, a candidate starting near 40% typically has multiple paths to a majority, especially if transfers from other moderates break his way.\nKey risks: RCV uncertainty and turnout composition error in a low‑salience municipal primary; potential late consolidation of anti‑Cuomo voters behind Mamdani; progressive enthusiasm fueled by AOC’s endorsement; and Cuomo’s liabilities creating late‑breaking negatives. The polling we’re leaning on is mostly late May, leaving a small window for momentum shifts before June 24.\nNet: The cross‑pollster, multi‑month lead and RCV modeling still make Cuomo a clear favorite, but the lack of fresh final‑stretch polling and inherent RCV volatility argue against pushing into the mid‑80s. I’m nudging down slightly from 80% to reflect those uncertainties while keeping him a solid favorite.",
