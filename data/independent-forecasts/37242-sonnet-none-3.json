    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Approximately 5-6 weeks. The April 2025 data is expected to be published in early June 2025.",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No - arrivals do not fall. Recent trends show continued growth in Canary Islands tourism. The February 2025 report showed 2,248,198 arrivals compared to 2,199,255 in February 2024, representing a 2.2% year-over-year increase.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "April 2025 passenger arrivals equal or exceed April 2024 levels. The Canary Islands continue their post-pandemic tourism recovery trajectory, with strong bookings from key European markets (UK, Germany, mainland Spain). Any concerns about US tariff policies have minimal impact given that US tourists represent a small fraction of total arrivals. Easter timing and spring weather continue to draw visitors as expected.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "April 2025 sees a meaningful decline in arrivals due to a combination of factors: early impacts of announced Trump tariff policies creating economic uncertainty that dampens consumer confidence and travel spending, particularly from European markets concerned about broader economic impacts; potential capacity reductions by airlines; or unexpected events (weather disruptions, geopolitical concerns) that specifically affected April travel.",
    "rationale": "The status quo strongly favors continued growth or stability. The most recent comparable data (February 2025) showed a 2.2% year-over-year increase, indicating healthy tourism momentum. April is historically a strong month for Canary Islands tourism due to spring break and Easter holidays.\n\nThe mentioned concern about Trump's tariff policies is unlikely to have fully materialized by April 2025 for several reasons: (1) Most April travel is booked weeks or months in advance, before policy impacts would be felt; (2) US tourists are not a primary market for the Canaries - the main sources are Spain, UK, and Germany; (3) The mechanism by which tariffs would immediately affect April tourist behavior is unclear.\n\nApril 2025 has already concluded, so the outcome is determined but unknown. Without evidence of specific disruptions (airline strikes, volcanic activity, major weather events, pandemic resurgence), or concrete booking data showing a downturn, the default assumption should favor continuation of recent positive trends.\n\nMy forecast is not higher (closer to status quo) because: there is genuine uncertainty without access to real-time booking data, economic headwinds in Europe could affect travel, and the article does mention tourism concerns. My forecast is not lower because: the burden of proof is on something causing a decline from established trends, no specific April 2025 disruptions have been identified, and tourism has shown resilience.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill inbound airline passenger arrivals to the Canary Islands fall in April 2025 compared with April 2024?\n\nQuestion background:\n[Canarias braces for the consequences of Trump's policies on tourism, potentially leading to a decline in tourist arrivals from the US](https://diariodeavisos.elespanol.com/2025/04/turismo-aranceles/)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if the total number of passenger arrivals to the Canary Islands for the month of April 2025, as presented at the [Canary Islands Tourism Research site](https://investigacion.turismodeislascanarias.com/en/inbound-tourism-arrival-passengers/monthly-data), is lower than the total number for April 2024. If the number for April 2025 is greater than or equal to the number for April 2024, the question resolves as **No**.\n\nSpecifically, Metaculus will access \"Passenger arrivals (AENA). April 2025,\" which is expected to be posted in the beginning of June 2025. The numbers considered will be the monthly totals under Canary Islands. For example, in the [February 2025 report](https://investigacion.turismodeislascanarias.com/sites/default/files/2025-03/Promotur_AENA_febrero%202025_EN.pdf), the number shown for February 2025 is 2,248,198 and the number shown for February 2024 is 2,199,255. Thus, if the question had been comparing February 2025 with February 2024, it would have resolved as No, because the number went up.\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nNo additional information available.\n\nToday is 2025-04-30.\n\nBefore answering you think:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n(e) You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
