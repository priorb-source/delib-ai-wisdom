    "review": "Forecaster 2 adds a concrete (non-Morning Consult) Argentine data point showing Milei’s image net-negative in late April, which supports mild downside risk for Milei and reinforces the tie-as-No penalty. That’s a useful caution even if not directly comparable to Morning Consult. Forecaster 3 emphasizes the MC-relative trend from Jan to late April moving toward Milei (from Sheinbaum +1 to Milei +1) and Sheinbaum’s easing from a honeymoon peak, which I hadn’t explicitly weighed as a trend signal within the same source. I find both arguments plausible and largely offsetting: F2’s domestic poll suggests a softening Milei backdrop; F3’s within-series drift suggests Milei maintaining a competitive edge is credible. Both correctly foreground the rounding/tie risk and single-check resolution risk. Neither provides decisive new evidence that would swing me strongly in either direction.",
    "rationale": "I still see a narrow edge for No due to mechanics: the current 1-point Milei lead is fragile, Morning Consult moves are small and rounded, and a tie resolves No. Mexico’s presidential honeymoon dynamics and AMLO’s historically strong MC readings suggest Sheinbaum staying around ~60 is a reasonable baseline. Argentina’s stabilization narrative could keep Milei near ~60 as well, but domestic polls hint at vulnerability if austerity costs dominate headlines. The single “on or after June 28” check introduces additional timing/rounding risk that works against Yes. Forecaster 3’s point about intra-MC trend (Jan→Apr shifting in Milei’s favor) slightly increases the plausibility that Milei can still be a tick ahead in late June, but Forecaster 2’s evidence of late-April Argentine softness tempers that. Net, these inputs roughly balance, and I keep a modestly-below-even stance. I would move up if MC shows Milei ≥2 points ahead in mid-June, or visible macro/legislative wins land without offsetting unrest; I would move down if MC shows parity or Sheinbaum ahead prior to June 28, or if Argentine sentiment deteriorates further.",
