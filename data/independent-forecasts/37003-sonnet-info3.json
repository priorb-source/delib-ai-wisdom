  "information": "The SPÖ is the incumbent party governing Vienna and is noted to have a well-established and entrenched local party organization.",

    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Approximately 5-6 months. The 2025 Viennese state election is expected to take place in autumn 2025, likely in October or November based on historical patterns.",
    "status_quo_outcome": "The SPÖ wins the most seats. They have governed Vienna continuously since 1945 and maintain a deeply entrenched local party organization with strong institutional and cultural ties to the city.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "A major political realignment occurs where the FPÖ or ÖVP consolidates opposition voters and capitalizes on dissatisfaction with issues like housing costs, migration policy, or a significant scandal involving SPÖ leadership. The opposition would need to overcome decades of SPÖ organizational dominance and loyal voting bases in key districts.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "The SPÖ maintains its historical stronghold in Vienna by leveraging its superior organizational infrastructure, incumbent advantages, and deep roots in Vienna's political culture. Even if their vote share declines from previous elections, the fragmentation of opposition votes among multiple parties (FPÖ, ÖVP, Greens, NEOS) allows the SPÖ to retain a plurality of seats.",
    "rationale": "The SPÖ has governed Vienna for 80 consecutive years, representing one of the most stable political dominances in European urban politics. My research assistant notes their well-established local organization, which is a crucial structural advantage. While I don't have the exact poll numbers from March 24, 2025, the fact that the question references polling data suggests competitive dynamics. However, good forecasting places substantial weight on status quo outcomes because dramatic political realignments are rare. Even if the SPÖ has lost vote share nationally or faces challenges, winning a plurality (most seats, not necessarily a majority) is a lower bar than maintaining absolute dominance. The fragmentation of Vienna's opposition across multiple parties (FPÖ, ÖVP, Greens, NEOS) makes it structurally difficult for any single party to overtake the SPÖ. My forecast is not higher (90%+) because recent European trends show social democratic parties can face sudden declines, and national political dynamics in Austria may spill over to Vienna. It's not lower (60-70%) because the historical precedent is so overwhelming and organizational advantages matter enormously in state elections. I would revise upward if polls consistently showed SPÖ with 35%+ support and solid leads. I would revise downward if polls showed the FPÖ or ÖVP within 5 points of the SPÖ or if a major scandal emerged.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill the Social Democratic Party of Austria win the most seats in the 2025 Viennese state election?\n\nQuestion background:\nSee for example election polls at [Vienna: Poll by IFDD from 24.03.2025](https://politpro.eu/en/austria/polls/63413/ifdd/2025-03-24)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below.

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
