    "review": "Both forecasters present crucial new information I hadn't considered. Forecaster 2 reveals that an executive order was signed over 2 months ago (March 7), yet the objective remains 'in progress' - this is highly significant data about both the tracker maintainers' standards and the pace of implementation. Forecaster 3 provides the most damning evidence: a Negotiated Rulemaking Committee process that begins June 30 (just 1 day before the deadline) with proposed/final rules expected 'later in 2025.' Both forecasters emphasize that current actions focus on 'refinement' or 'restriction' rather than outright 'termination.' This distinction is critical - if the executive actions are narrowing eligibility rather than ending the program entirely, the tracker maintainers have strong reason to keep it marked as incomplete even if restrictions are implemented. The timeline evidence is particularly compelling: if formal rulemaking won't even begin until June 30 and rules are expected months later, completion by July 1 is essentially impossible through regulatory channels. The fact that 2+ months have passed since executive action without reaching 'complete' status strongly suggests the tracker maintainers require substantial, finalized termination - not just proposals or partial restrictions.",
    "rationale": "I am updating my forecast significantly downward based on the new evidence. My original 10% forecast failed to account for: (1) the already-elapsed time since executive action (2+ months) without completion, (2) the specific Negotiated Rulemaking Committee timeline that extends beyond July 1, and (3) the critical distinction between restriction/refinement versus outright termination. The rulemaking timeline is particularly decisive - with the first session on June 30 and final rules expected 'later in 2025,' there's essentially no procedural path to completion by July 1. The tracker maintainers' behavior over the past 2+ months reveals they have a high bar for 'complete' status, likely requiring finalized termination rather than just announcements or proposals. The only remaining scenario for a 'Yes' outcome would be some dramatic, immediate executive action that completely halts PSLF operations and that the tracker maintainers subjectively judge as 'complete termination' despite potential legal challenges or implementation questions. This scenario is theoretically possible but highly unlikely given the evidence. I'm settling on 7% rather than going lower to account for the inherent uncertainty in predicting subjective human judgment and the small possibility of unexpected dramatic action.",
