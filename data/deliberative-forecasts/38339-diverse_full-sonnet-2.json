    "review": "The other forecasters raise several compelling points I underweighted:\n\n1. **Legal/arbitration risk**: Both emphasize that unilateral cancellation would trigger costly arbitration Bulgaria would likely lose. This makes a desperate unilateral move significantly more costly than I initially considered.\n\n2. **The \"blocked\" statement**: The former Deputy Energy Minister's characterization that termination is \"blocked until debt is settled\" is more definitive than I treated it. This isn't just difficult - there appears to be a specific procedural/legal barrier.\n\n3. **Leverage dynamics**: Forecaster 3 correctly notes Turkey benefits from keeping the contract alive to preserve claims on the €2 billion debt. Cancellation would potentially weaken Turkey's legal position on collecting arrears.\n\n4. **Absence of preparation signals**: Both forecasters emphasize that there's no public indication of termination proceedings being prepared. With only 25 days remaining, we would expect to see some signals (cabinet discussions, leaked termination drafts, breakdown announcements) if cancellation were imminent.\n\n5. **Negotiation focus**: The May 2025 talks explicitly focused on renegotiation, suggesting both parties view modification rather than cancellation as the active path forward.\n\nTheir reasoning is more thorough on the legal constraints and procedural barriers. My 20% may have overweighted the \"desperate political decision\" scenario without fully accounting for the legal costs and barriers that make such a decision much less attractive.\n\nThat said, all three of us acknowledge the genuine tail risk from Bulgargaz's financial crisis and the possibility of a politically-motivated announcement even if legally problematic.",
    "rationale": "Upon reflection, I should lower my forecast. The other forecasters make strong arguments about legal barriers I underweighted:\n\n**Key factors lowering probability:**\n- The former minister's statement about termination being \"blocked\" until debt settlement is more definitive than I initially treated\n- Unilateral cancellation would trigger international arbitration with significant costs and likely loss\n- Turkey has strong incentive to maintain the contract to preserve its €2 billion claim\n- Zero public signals of termination proceedings with only 25 days left\n- Recent negotiations explicitly focused on renegotiation, not cancellation\n\n**Key factors preventing lower forecast:**\n- Bulgargaz's financial crisis is severe (\"verge of bankruptcy\")\n- Daily costs of ~$580k create ongoing political pressure\n- The resolution criteria allows for unilateral announcement \"even if denied by the other side\"\n- Political decisions can happen quickly under extreme pressure\n\nThe legal and procedural barriers are more significant than I initially weighted. The absence of any recent signals about imminent termination is particularly telling - with 25 days left, we would expect to see preparation if cancellation were coming. However, the genuine financial crisis creates real tail risk that prevents going below 15%.",
