    "review": "Both forecasters provide sound reasoning, agreeing on the core tension between a low base rate of resignation and the specific catalyst of the Huawei scandal. Forecaster 3’s analysis closely mirrors my initial thoughts, but perhaps slightly underweights the scandal's impact. Forecaster 2’s analysis provides the most valuable new insight by estimating a quantitative base rate for a 'random' resignation in a 22-day period at 25-30%. This is a significant improvement over my more qualitative assessment of the base rate being 'low'. Their argument that the total probability is a combination of this base rate and the scandal-specific risk is very convincing and highlights a flaw in my initial reasoning where I may have implicitly double-counted or blended these two distinct factors.",
    "rationale": "After reviewing my peers' analyses, I am updating my forecast upward. My initial forecast of 35% was anchored on a qualitative sense that resignations are rare. Forecaster 2's quantitative estimate of a ~25-30% base rate for a resignation for any reason in a given three-week period, based on historical precedent, is a compelling piece of evidence I had not considered. Accepting this ~26% baseline as a starting point, the question becomes how much additional probability the Huawei scandal adds. Forecaster 3's 30% implies the scandal adds very little, which I now believe is an underestimate. Forecaster 2's 55% implies the scandal is a massive, almost decisive factor, making resignation more likely than not. I find this too aggressive, as politicians often successfully ride out scandals and the 21-day resolution window is very short. My revised view is that the scandal creates a significant, but not overwhelming, additional risk. Combining the ~26% base rate with an estimated ~20% probability of a resignation specifically due to the scandal in this window yields a combined probability of approximately 41% (P(A or B) = 1 - (1-P(A))*(1-P(B))). This revised forecast better reflects the two separate pathways to a 'Yes' outcome: a random event and a scandal-driven one.",
