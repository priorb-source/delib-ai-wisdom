    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "About 33 days (until July 1, 2025)",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No — he continues to caucus with Senate Democrats through July 1, 2025.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Fetterman remains a Democratic senator and stays in the Democratic caucus; no resignation, no expulsion from the caucus, and no switch to caucusing with Republicans or with neither.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Before July 1, Fetterman either resigns his seat, formally switches to caucus with Republicans, declares he will caucus with neither party, or is removed from the Democratic caucus.",
    "rationale": "- Baseline and time horizon: With only ~33 days left, large political realignments are uncommon. Mid-session caucus changes are rare, and resignations on short notice without clear precipitating events are also uncommon.\n- Public signals: The provided background notes Fetterman says he won’t resign, despite blowback from recent coverage. That direct denial lowers the immediate hazard of a resignation. While reporting suggests strained relations with fellow Democrats, that alone usually does not lead to an abrupt caucus break.\n- Incentives and context: Switching caucuses (to GOP) would be a major ideological and political shock in Pennsylvania and would likely harm Fetterman’s brand with core supporters. Becoming an independent who caucuses with Republicans or with neither would cost him influence and committee positioning without clear offsetting benefits. If he became an independent but still caucused with Democrats, this question would resolve No.\n- Base rates: In the past few decades, only a handful of senators have changed party/caucus alignment, and almost never on such a compressed timeline without strong, visible catalysts. Resignations do occur but are typically driven by health, scandal, or appointment to another role—none of which is evidenced here. \n- Why not higher: Clear statement of “won’t resign,” lack of concrete reporting on a party/caucus change, and the short window make a near-term change unlikely. \n- Why not lower: Non-zero risk remains due to: (1) ongoing intra-party tension (which, in an extreme case, could lead to a break or expulsion from the caucus); (2) tail risks from health or unforeseen scandal; (3) the theoretical possibility of a strategic move to independence that includes not caucusing with Democrats. \n- What would move me up: Credible reports that Fetterman is exploring independence without caucusing with Democrats, talks with GOP leadership, moves by Democratic leaders to sanction or strip him of roles, serious new health or ethics developments, or signals from his office prepping a major announcement. \n- What would move me down: Continued routine participation with Democrats, explicit reaffirmations of caucusing status, or the controversy fading with no new developments.\n- Research assistant summary: No additional information available, so the forecast relies on public base rates, short-horizon dynamics, and the provided articles’ high-level signals.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill Senator John Fetterman cease caucusing with the Democrats before July 1, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\n[Fetterman says he won’t resign, gets support from McCormick as article blowback continues](https://www.pennlive.com/news/2025/05/fetterman-says-he-wont-resign-gets-support-from-mccormick-as-article-blowback-continues.html) | [An isolated, angry Fetterman is yet another challenge for Democrats](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2025/05/16/john-fetterman-senate-relationships/)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if, before July 1, 2025, John Fetterman ceases caucusing with the [Senate Democrats](https://www.democrats.senate.gov/about-senate-dems/our-caucus) for any reason, whether because he switches parties, resigns, or any other reason.\n\n\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nNo additional information available.\n\nToday is 2025-05-29.\n\nBefore answering you think:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n(e) You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
