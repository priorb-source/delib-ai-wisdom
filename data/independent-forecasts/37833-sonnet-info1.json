  "information": "The relationship between Elon Musk and Donald Trump has recently shown signs of strain. After investing heavily in Trump's 2024 campaign, Musk was appointed co-director of the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE). However, disagreements arose over Musk's proposals for drastic government spending cuts and his support for policies like H-1B visas, which conflicted with Trump's agenda. In May 2025, Musk announced he would reduce his political involvement and spending to focus on his businesses, leading to a mutually agreed-upon withdrawal from his role in DOGE. Correspondingly, analyses show that Trump has not mentioned Musk on his Truth Social account in over a month, a significant decrease from his previous frequency.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Approximately 40 days remain until July 1, 2025, when the question will be resolved by checking whether either Donald Trump or Elon Musk has posted using the exact phrase 'diversity visa' on X/Twitter.",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No - neither Trump nor Musk has posted about 'diversity visa' yet, and absent a specific triggering event, the status quo would continue with this topic not being addressed in the remaining 40 days.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Neither Trump nor Musk posts about diversity visas during the remaining period. This could occur if: immigration debates focus on other aspects (border security, H-1B visas, etc.) without specifically mentioning the diversity visa lottery program; both continue to distance themselves from each other politically; Musk maintains his reduced political engagement; or no major news event brings the diversity visa lottery specifically into the spotlight.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Either Trump or Musk posts using the exact phrase 'diversity visa' before July 1, 2025. This could happen if: a significant news story emerges about the diversity visa lottery program; there's a terrorist attack or crime linked to a diversity visa recipient that generates political controversy; legislative action is proposed regarding the program; or either figure decides to make a policy statement about eliminating or reforming the diversity visa lottery specifically.",
    "rationale": "My forecast weighs several competing factors. On one hand, both Trump and Musk are extremely active on X/Twitter and have historically engaged with immigration topics. The diversity visa lottery has been controversial, and Trump previously called for its elimination. The fact that Musk follows an account that recently tweeted about diversity visas suggests the topic is at least in his information ecosystem. On the other hand, several factors reduce the probability significantly: (1) The requirement for the exact phrase 'diversity visa' is quite specific - general immigration discussion wouldn't count; (2) My research assistant reports that Musk announced in May 2025 he would reduce political involvement, making political commentary less likely; (3) The Trump-Musk relationship has strained, with Trump not mentioning Musk in over a month, reducing the likelihood of coordinated messaging; (4) Only 40 days remain, which is a relatively short window; (5) There's no apparent immediate trigger event making diversity visas a hot topic right now. The status quo heavily favors 'No' since neither has posted about this yet. For me to increase my forecast, I would need to see: a major news event specifically about diversity visas, evidence that immigration discussions are trending toward this specific program, or signs that either Trump or Musk is preparing immigration policy statements. For me to decrease it further, I would need evidence that both have completely stopped discussing immigration entirely or that other immigration topics are dominating the conversation to the exclusion of visa lottery discussions. Given the specific phrasing requirement, short timeframe, reduced Musk political engagement, and strained Trump-Musk relations, I assign a low but non-negligible probability.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill Donald Trump or Elon Musk tweet (X post) about the Diversity Visa before April 1, 2025\n\nQuestion background:\n[Federal judge’s order leaves many visa lottery winners out of luck](https://www.siliconvalley.com/2020/10/01/judges-order-leaves-many-visa-lottery-winners-out-of-luck/) | Recent tweet [here](https://x.com/fentasyl/status/1894451029934039492) from a Twitter/X account followed by Elon Musk.\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if, before July 1, 2025 either Donald Trump or Elon Musk tweet using the exact words \"diversity visa\" as shown through [this search](https://x.com/search?f=top&q=%22diversity%20visa%22%20(from%3Arealdonaldtrump%20OR%20from%3Aelonmusk)&src=typed_query) on Twitter/X, which will be checked by Metaculus on or after July 1, 2025. If a tweet (now renamed to X post) containing the phrase is seen by a Metaculus Admin at that time, this question resolves as **Yes**. If not, it resolves as **No**.\n\n\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nThe relationship between Elon Musk and Donald Trump has recently shown signs of strain.

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
