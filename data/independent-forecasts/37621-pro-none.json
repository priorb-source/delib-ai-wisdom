    "status_quo_outcome": "No. The 'Tush-Push' remains a legal play as per the current NFL rulebook.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "The NFL's primary window for rule changes, the Annual League Meeting in March, passes without a ban being enacted. No special meeting is called, or if one is, the proposal fails to get the required 24 votes from owners before the June 1, 2025 deadline.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Following renewed discussion or pressure, the NFL convenes a special owners' meeting or conducts an electronic vote before June 1, 2025. A proposal to ban the 'Tush-Push' is formally approved by at least 24 of the 32 team owners.",
    "rationale": "My forecast is heavily influenced by the status quo and procedural timing. Today is May 12, 2025, leaving only 20 days until the resolution date. The NFL's primary cycle for approving rule changes for the upcoming season is the Annual League Meeting, which occurs in March. The fact that a vote was tabled in mid-2024 and no ban was enacted during the main 2025 off-season meeting indicates a lack of consensus among the 32 owners, who require a 3/4 majority (24 votes) to pass a new rule. For a 'Yes' outcome to occur now, the league would need to schedule a special meeting or an emergency vote in a very short timeframe. Such actions are rare for on-field rule changes and there is currently no public information, including from my research assistant, to suggest such a vote is planned. The absence of news about an impending vote is strong evidence against one occurring. Therefore, the most probable outcome is that the rules remain unchanged for the 2025 season, and the question resolves as 'No'. My forecast is not lower (e.g., 0%) because there is always a minuscule chance of an unexpected procedural action by the league. It is not higher because the practical window for this rule change has effectively closed, and there is no evidence of the political will among owners to force an emergency vote before June 1st. I would significantly increase my forecast towards 'Yes' only if credible reports emerged of a special vote being scheduled before the deadline.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill the NFL ban the \"Tush-Push\" before June 1, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nESPN: [Vote on tush push ban tabled by NFL owners for more discussion](https://www.espn.com/nfl/story/_/id/44490292/sources-tush-push-ban-vote-tabled-nfl-owners) | CBS Sports: [Expansive 'Tush Push' ban could have strong support at NFL's next owners meeting, per report](https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/news/expansive-tush-push-ban-could-have-strong-support-at-nfls-next-owners-meeting-per-report/)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if the National Football League officially approves or announces a rule restricting the quarterback sneak known as the [Tush-Push](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quarterback_sneak#Tush_push) before June 1, 2025. If there are no reports of this occurring before that date, this question resolves as **No**.\n\n\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nNo additional information available.\n\nToday is 2025-05-12.\n\nBefore answering you think:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n(e) You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
