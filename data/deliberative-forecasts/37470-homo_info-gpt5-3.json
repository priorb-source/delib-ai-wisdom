    "review": "Both forecasters emphasize mechanisms I underweighted: (1) a small federation can approve a host via an executive vote without waiting for a congress; (2) Egypt’s recent high-capacity hosting track record (even if WKF, not ITKF) lowers execution risk and could speed internal approval. They also correctly stress that the criterion demands an official ITKF announcement by July 1, which remains the main bottleneck. I find their arguments partially persuasive on the mechanism for a quick decision, but they don’t add concrete evidence of an imminent ITKF meeting, MoU, or tease—so 38% feels high given the short runway and silence on official ITKF channels.",
    "rationale": "- Time remaining: ~7 weeks.\n- Status quo: No ITKF announcement; historically hosts selected 24–36 months out, so we’re late.\n- Yes path: ITKF executive committee/President finalizes and announces Egypt in May/June (possibly after a site visit or rapid MoU), leveraging Egypt’s capacity and political backing.\n- No path: Decision deferred to a later congress/event (Q3/Q4 2025) or prolonged contracting/communications lag; or another host surfaces.\n- Evidence balance: We have minister-level engagement and positive remarks from the ITKF President, and Egypt is a credible host. But there are no official ITKF signals of a pending decision window, no published bid/shortlist, and no meeting agenda. Given the need for an explicit ITKF announcement before July 1, procedural/communication delays are a significant drag.\n\nUpdate: I raise my forecast modestly to reflect the plausible executive-vote pathway and Egypt’s strong hosting profile, but keep it well below even odds due to timing, lack of formal signals, and the federation’s tendency (like many) to align such decisions with congresses or major events.\n\nKey updaters before July 1:\n- Up: ITKF schedules an executive meeting/assembly in May–June with host selection on the agenda; reports of a signed MoU; credible leak naming Egypt pending announcement; ITKF teasers referencing 2026 host.\n- Down: ITKF indicates decision will occur later in 2025; credible competing bid emerges; continued silence through mid-June.",
