  "information": "The middleweight bout between Joe Pyfer and Kelvin Gastelum is scheduled for the main card of UFC 316, which will take place on June 7, 2025, at the Prudential Center in Newark, New Jersey. This is a rebooked fight, originally scheduled for UFC Mexico on March 29 before being cancelled. According to UFCStats 'tale of the tape' data, Pyfer has a slight grappling and reach advantage, while Gastelum fights from a southpaw stance.\n\nJoe Pyfer has won six of his last seven professional fights, holding a 4-1 record within the UFC. His most recent victory was a first-round knockout of Marc-Andre Barriault at UFC 303, which earned him a Performance of the Night bonus. Pyfer had to withdraw from the originally scheduled fight against Gastelum in Mexico due to an illness.\n\nKelvin Gastelum is a veteran fighter and the winner of 'The Ultimate Fighter 17'. The fight at UFC 316 will mark his 24th appearance in the UFC Octagon. He has won two of his last three fights, with his most recent competition being a unanimous decision victory over Daniel Rodriguez in June 2024 at UFC Saudi Arabia.",

    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "12 days until UFC 316 on June 7, 2025",
    "status_quo_outcome": "The fight between Joe Pyfer and Kelvin Gastelum is scheduled to proceed as planned on the UFC 316 main card",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Either fighter withdraws due to injury or illness in the final days before the event (Pyfer already withdrew once from this matchup), the fight is cancelled by the UFC, or the fight proceeds but Pyfer loses to Gastelum via knockout, submission, or decision",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "The fight proceeds as scheduled on June 7, 2025, and Joe Pyfer defeats Kelvin Gastelum by knockout, technical knockout, submission, or decision, adding to his 4-1 UFC record",
    "rationale": "This forecast requires assessing two probabilities: (1) whether the fight happens, and (2) if it happens, whether Pyfer wins. For the fight occurring, the status quo is that it's scheduled 12 days out. The main risk is that Pyfer already withdrew once due to illness from this same matchup in March, which suggests some vulnerability to last-minute issues. However, most scheduled UFC fights do proceed, so I estimate approximately 87% chance the fight happens. Regarding the fight outcome, Pyfer presents compelling advantages: he's won 6 of his last 7 fights with a spectacular first-round KO in his most recent outing at UFC 303, earning Performance of the Night. He possesses reach and grappling advantages per the tale of the tape. At 4-1 in the UFC, he appears to be a rising prospect with momentum. However, Gastelum is a highly experienced veteran with 23 prior UFC fights, winner of The Ultimate Fighter 17, and won 2 of his last 3 including a recent decision victory. His experience against elite competition cannot be dismissed. This appears to be a competitive matchup between a rising fighter with momentum versus an experienced gatekeeper. Given Pyfer's recent form, physical advantages, and finishing ability, I estimate he has approximately 60% chance of winning if the fight occurs. Combined probability: 0.87 × 0.60 = 52%. This forecast is not higher because Gastelum's veteran savvy could exploit any mistakes, Pyfer has shown unreliability by withdrawing previously, and 12 days still allows time for complications. It's not lower because Pyfer clearly has momentum, physical advantages, and knockout power that makes him a legitimate favorite. I would adjust higher with news of Gastelum struggling in training or Pyfer looking sharp, and lower with any health concerns for Pyfer or reports of Gastelum's excellent preparation.",
