    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Facing acute pressure (e.g., large protests, military elite splits, donor leverage, or a negotiated roadmap), the government issues a new decree explicitly restoring dissolved parties and allowing new parties to register again before July 1.",
    "rationale": "- Context: Mali’s military government under Assimi Goïta has steadily tightened political controls (suspending party activities in 2024, then dissolving parties on May 13, 2025). Mali withdrew from ECOWAS and aligns with the AES bloc (with Burkina Faso and Niger), reducing regional leverage to compel quick liberalization. The government has shown willingness to bear international criticism. \n- Timeframe: Only ~6 weeks remain. Rapid reversals of such high-salience authoritarian measures are uncommon absent immediate crises. \n- Incentives: Reinstating parties would reopen organized opposition channels. With no imminent, externally enforced election timeline and limited regional leverage, the junta’s incentive to reverse soon is low. \n- Mechanisms for reversal: A court-ordered reversal is unlikely given regime control over institutions. A negotiated concession could occur if there is a domestic security or legitimacy shock (e.g., widespread unrest, elite fracture, or donor conditionality threatening critical support). Such triggers are possible but infrequent and often take longer to translate into formal policy reversals. \n- Why not higher: The prevailing trend is toward consolidation, not liberalization; short window; weak external pressure; no reported signs of backtracking since the decree. \n- Why not lower: Authoritarian politics can shift abruptly. A tactical U-turn could be used to ease tensions or unlock aid, and a simple decree could technically restore parties quickly. Also, unexpected internal rifts or major protests could force a concession. \n- Updates that would move me up: Credible reports of negotiations with domestic opposition or key external partners tied to restoring parties; signs of significant unrest or elite splits; official hints of a new political roadmap explicitly restoring party life. \n- Updates that would move me down: Further repressive steps (arrests of opposition figures, legal codification of a party-less system), rhetoric rejecting party politics as a matter of principle, or consolidation within the security apparatus indicating low risk of internal challenge. \n- Research assistant summary: No additional information provided beyond the dissolution decision; no signals of imminent reversal identified.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nBefore July 1, 2025, will the government of Mali reverse its decision to dissolve all political parties?\n\nQuestion background:\n[Mali's Military Government Shuts Down All Political Parties](https://www.legit.ng/world/africa/1654992-malis-military-government-shuts-political-parties/)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if the government of Mali announces a reversal of its May 13, 2025 presidential decree dissolving all political parties in the country.\n\nA partial reversal, such as allowing the reinstatement of a limited number of parties, will only count as long as new parties are generally allowed to be formed again.\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nNo additional information available.\n\nToday is 2025-05-22.\n\nBefore answering you think:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n(e) You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
