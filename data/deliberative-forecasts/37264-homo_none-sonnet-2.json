    "review": "All three forecasts converge tightly between 18-25%, suggesting strong agreement on the core dynamics. The key insight from Forecaster 2 that I hadn't fully weighted is the '2 years since coup' argument: if conditions truly warranted Level 4, the upgrade likely would have occurred already rather than waiting nearly 2 years post-coup. This strengthens the status quo case considerably. Forecaster 2's comparison to Mali and Burkina Faso (which DO have Level 4 advisories) is also valuable context - it demonstrates the State Department actively distinguishes between Sahel countries and has chosen NOT to elevate Niger to Level 4 despite similar regional challenges. Both other forecasters emphasize the same core factors I identified: short timeframe, status quo bias, and Level 4's reservation for extreme circumstances. Forecaster 3's slightly higher 25% seems less justified given the 2-year stability argument. None of us have concrete information about Niger's current advisory level, which all three analyses acknowledge as a limitation. The convergence of reasoning despite independent analysis increases my confidence that 18-20% is the appropriate range.",
    "rationale": "After reviewing the other analyses, I find Forecaster 2's '2 years since coup' argument particularly compelling and underweighted in my initial forecast. The July 2023 coup provided ample time for the State Department to upgrade Niger to Level 4 if conditions warranted. The fact that they haven't done so - despite nearly 2 years and ongoing security challenges - is strong evidence that Niger doesn't meet their threshold for Level 4. The comparison to Mali and Burkina Faso further reinforces this: the State Department clearly makes distinctions between Sahel countries, and Niger apparently falls below the Level 4 bar. With only 2 months remaining, the probability of a dramatic enough deterioration to trigger an upgrade is lower than I initially estimated. Status quo bias over short timeframes is extremely strong for government advisory systems. I'm adjusting my forecast downward to 18% to align with Forecaster 2's stronger reasoning, while maintaining that the probability isn't negligible given genuine regional volatility and the possibility of unexpected triggering events.",
