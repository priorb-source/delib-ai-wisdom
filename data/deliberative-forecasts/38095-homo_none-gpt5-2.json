    "review": "Forecaster 2 and 3 both emphasize the low threshold (only three grants) and Trump’s episodic style, which I already accounted for. Useful additions: (1) late-June Supreme Court decision window as a potential news-cycle catalyst, and (2) disclosure timing risk—actions signed late June could be packaged and announced in early July, which would not count. They also note July 4 as a more natural target date for a higher-impact clemency package. I find the disclosure-timing point particularly persuasive because this market resolves on public disclosure in June. That said, the lack of credible advance reporting is not strongly informative given Trump’s propensity to announce clemencies with little lead time. Forecaster 2’s 47% feels high versus historical month-level base rates; Forecaster 3’s 34% aligns more closely with my prior and incorporates the timing/slippage risk well.",
    "rationale": "Base rate: In Trump’s first term, months with >2 clemencies were a minority, implying a month-level base probability in the ballpark of the high teens to low twenties. The second term appears active per early-2025 reporting, and the threshold here is low; either a small batch or a narrow blanket action (e.g., a subset of Jan 6 cases) would clear the bar. June offers plausible hooks (Trump’s birthday, Juneteenth, potential reactions to late-term Supreme Court decisions), and Trump often seeks headline-grabbing moves. Countervailing factors: July 4 is a more obvious stage for a larger package; recent critical coverage could encourage a tactical pause; and the requirement that actions be publicly disclosed in June introduces slippage risk into early July. With no concrete signals of a June batch yet, I keep the forecast anchored near base rates but nudge it up modestly for the low threshold and Trump’s style. Net effect: slight upward adjustment from 30% to 35%. I would move higher on credible reporting of a June tranche or hints of a June-timed blanket action; I would move lower on indications that a package is slated for early July or that internal vetting has pushed disclosure past June.",
