    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "16 days (from June 15, 2025 to July 1, 2025)",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No. Donald Trump is not the current President and has no official state functions that would necessitate a trip to China. High-profile international travel is not a default activity, and with no trip currently planned, the status quo is that he will not visit.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "The deadline of July 1, 2025, passes without Donald Trump having traveled to China. No news or official reports emerge about such a trip being planned or undertaken, and he continues his activities outside of China.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "An unannounced and highly secretive trip, perhaps for a private business summit or an informal back-channel discussion, is revealed and takes place in the last two weeks of June. This would require the logistics and permissions to have been arranged covertly well in advance.",
    "rationale": "The core of this forecast is the extremely limited timeframe. With only 16 days left until the deadline, the logistical and diplomatic hurdles for a former U.S. President to arrange a visit to China are immense. Such visits are typically planned months, if not years, in advance to handle security, diplomatic protocols, and scheduling. The status quo, which I weigh heavily, is that a private citizen, even one as prominent as Donald Trump, does not spontaneously visit a major geopolitical power. My research assistant's report of no additional information is critical; the absence of any rumors, flight tracking data, or preliminary reports from media sources strongly suggests no such visit is being planned. A trip of this nature is exceptionally difficult to keep secret this close to its execution. My probability is not zero to account for a low-probability 'black swan' event, such as a secret trip that has already been fully arranged and is about to occur. For me to increase my forecast, there would need to be credible reports from reputable news sources or a statement from his team or the Chinese government indicating a visit is planned. As each day passes without new information, this forecast will trend even closer to zero.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill Donald Trump visit China before July 1, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nFox News: [Trump touts 'very positive' breakthrough with Xi after slamming China for trade violation](https://www.foxnews.com/politics/trump-touts-very-positive-breakthrough-xi-after-slamming-china-trade-violation) | Wikipedia: [List of international presidential trips made by Donald Trump](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_international_presidential_trips_made_by_Donald_Trump)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if, after this question opens and before July 1, 2025, President Donald Trump personally visits China.\n\n\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nNo additional information available.\n\nToday is 2025-06-15.\n\nBefore answering you think:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n(e) You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
