    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Approximately one and a half months.",
    "status_quo_outcome": "As of mid-May 2025, Walmart's market capitalization is slightly higher than Tesla's, making the status quo outcome Yes.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Tesla's market cap becomes higher than Walmart's. This could be driven by a significant positive catalyst, such as the unveiling of a functional Robotaxi, a major breakthrough in FSD technology that gets regulatory approval, or Q2 delivery numbers that vastly exceed pessimistic expectations, causing a sharp rally in Tesla's stock.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Walmart's market cap remains higher than Tesla's. This scenario unfolds if the current trends continue: Tesla struggles with slowing demand and increased competition, meeting or slightly missing analyst expectations, while Walmart's stock remains stable or grows modestly, reflecting its consistent retail performance.",
    "rationale": "My forecast is based on the current market conditions, company-specific momentum, and the short time horizon remaining. As of today, May 13, 2025, Walmart has a narrow lead in market capitalization over Tesla. With only about six weeks until the resolution date, this status quo carries significant weight. The negative sentiment surrounding Tesla, as indicated by the March 2025 JP Morgan analysis, points to fundamental business challenges—namely slowing EV demand growth and intense competition—that are unlikely to be resolved in the short term. These factors have been priced in and are likely to continue suppressing Tesla's valuation relative to its past performance. In contrast, Walmart is a mature, stable business whose valuation is less volatile and more predictable over a short period. For a 'Yes' outcome, things simply need to continue on their current trajectory. \n\nMy forecast is not higher than 70% because Tesla's stock is famously volatile and highly sensitive to news and sentiment. The market cap gap between the two companies is likely to be relatively small, meaning a single, unexpected positive catalyst for Tesla could cause a rally sufficient to overtake Walmart. Potential catalysts include a major announcement regarding its Robotaxi, a breakthrough in its Optimus robot program, or unexpectedly strong Q2 delivery numbers. \n\nConversely, my forecast is not lower than 70% because the headwinds Tesla faces are significant and structural. It would take more than just minor positive news to reverse the current negative momentum. Meanwhile, Walmart's stability provides a strong anchor. A significant negative event would be required to meaningfully decrease Walmart's valuation in such a short period, which is a lower probability event. Therefore, the path of least resistance leads to a 'Yes' outcome.",

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower.
