    "review": "All three forecasters have identified the same core dynamics: a high potential for large-scale protests in India driven by multiple active grievances (Waqf Act, farmer issues), set against significant constraints, namely a short two-month timeframe, the specific resolution source (Global Protest Tracker), and active government suppression. Forecaster 3 and I initially arrived at the same 75% probability, weighing the drivers more heavily than the constraints. Forecaster 2 arrived at a more cautious 65%, giving more weight to the deterrent effect of government suppression and potential reporting lags. Forecaster 2's explicit emphasis on suppression tactics as a force that can actively limit a protest's scale, rather than just being a background uncertainty, was particularly convincing and a factor I had not weighted heavily enough.",
    "rationale": "I am revising my forecast slightly downward from 75% to 70%. My initial reasoning remains largely intact: India is experiencing several potent social and political conflicts with a demonstrated history of mass mobilization, and there is specific intelligence about a planned 10,000-person farmers' march. These factors strongly support a 'Yes' outcome. However, the deliberation, particularly with Forecaster 2, highlighted the significance of active government suppression. Tactics like surveillance and passport confiscation are not just a general risk but a direct countermeasure designed to prevent protests from reaching the very threshold specified in this question. While I still believe a qualifying protest is the most likely outcome due to the sheer number of potential triggers, I now assign a greater probability to these suppression efforts succeeding in keeping crowd sizes down or delaying mobilization past the deadline. This slight decrease in confidence from 75% to 70% reflects an updated assessment that gives more weight to the obstacles facing protest organizers.",
