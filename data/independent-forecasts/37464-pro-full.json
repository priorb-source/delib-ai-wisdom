  "information": "LPK1, a Renton, Washington establishment, is recalling approximately 303 pounds of ready-to-eat chicken Caesar wrap products. The recall was initiated due to misbranding and an undeclared allergen, as the Caesar dressing packet contains fish (anchovies) which is not declared on the product label. The recall is designated as Class II. The affected products were produced on February 15, 17, and 19, 2025. The corresponding 'best by' dates were February 21, 23, and 25, 2025, and the lot codes were LPK1WA046, LPK1WA048, and LPK1WA050.\n\nThe recalled chicken Caesar wraps were distributed to vending machines located in office buildings within the state of Washington. The labeling issue was discovered by the company during a routine quality assurance check of ingredient labels. As of early May 2025, there have been no confirmed reports of adverse reactions or illnesses due to the consumption of these products. The U.S. Department of Agriculture’s Food Safety and Inspection Service (FSIS) has urged consumers and offices not to consume or serve the products and to either return them or dispose of them.\n\nThe recall was issued on February 24, 2025. According to the FSIS recall webpage, the status of the recall remained 'Active' as of May 8, 2025. The general FSIS process for closing a recall requires verification that all affected product has been accounted for and removed from commerce, and confirmation that the company has implemented appropriate corrective actions to prevent a recurrence.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Approximately 24 days, as the question resolves on June 1, 2025, and the current date is May 8, 2025.",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No. The recall's status is currently 'Active' on the USDA-FSIS website. If it does not change by the resolution date, the question resolves as No.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Administrative or bureaucratic delays at either LPK1 or the FSIS prevent the final verification paperwork from being processed in time. As a result, the recall status remains 'Active' when checked on or after June 1, 2025.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "The FSIS completes its recall verification activities, confirming that LPK1 has accounted for the product and implemented corrective actions. The agency updates the recall status to 'Closed' on its website at some point before June 1, 2025.",
    "rationale": "My forecast is based on weighing the administrative inertia against the fundamental simplicity of this recall case. The most significant factor supporting a 'No' outcome is the status quo: the recall has already been 'Active' for over two months (since February 24, 2025). With only about 24 days remaining, the fact that it has not been closed in the preceding 73 days suggests a high likelihood of continued administrative delay. However, several factors support a 'Yes' outcome, preventing the probability from being lower. The recall involves a very small quantity of product (303 pounds) with a limited, local distribution (vending machines in Washington). Critically, the product's 'best by' dates were in late February 2025, meaning the product is long-since expired and would have been removed from sale channels through normal spoilage control. This should make product recovery verification very straightforward. The recall is Class II with no reported illnesses, reducing complexity. My forecast of 40% leans towards 'No' primarily because of the demonstrated slowness of the process to date, but it grants a significant chance of resolution because the practical steps required to close the recall are simple and should have already been completed. I would increase my forecast if I learned that LPK1 had recently submitted its final corrective action plan to the FSIS. I would decrease it if I learned that the FSIS has a significant backlog in processing recall closures.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill the USDA-posted recall by LPK1 of its ready-to-eat chicken caesar wrap for misbranding and an undeclared allergen issued February 24, 2025 be closed before June 1, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nFood Safety News: [Chicken Caesar wraps sold in vending machines in Washington recalled over undeclared fish](https://www.foodsafetynews.com/2025/02/chicken-caesar-wraps-sold-in-veding-machines-in-washington-recalled-over-undeclared-fish/)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if the status of the recall posted by the U.S. Department of Agriculture’s Food Safety and Inspection Service (FSIS) is changed from Active to Closed on [this page](https://www.fsis.usda.gov/recalls-alerts/lpk1-recalls-ready-eat-chicken-caesar-wrap-products-due-misbranding-and-undeclared) before June 1, 2025. If the recall is still shown as Active when the link is accessed by Metaculus on or after that date, this question resolves as **No**.\n\n\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nLPK1, a Renton, Washington establishment, is recalling approximately 303 pounds of ready-to-eat chicken Caesar wrap products.

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
