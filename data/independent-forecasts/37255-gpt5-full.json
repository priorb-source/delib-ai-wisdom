  "information": "Libya's Economy and Trade Minister, Muhammed Huveyc, announced in May 2025 that the country aims to increase its trade volume with Turkey from $3.7 billion to $10 billion. To facilitate this, joint committees have been established to address issues such as the return of Turkish companies to projects in Libya and the resolution of bank guarantees. The two countries are also working towards eliminating taxes and establishing a free trade zone, with the stated goal of using Libya's strategic location to facilitate the transport of Turkish industrial products to the broader African market.\n\nAs of late April 2025, the African Continental Free Trade Area (AfCFTA) has achieved a 92% consensus on trade rules. Forty-nine of the 54 African countries have joined the agreement, with 23 having commenced implementation of the new trade rules. Supporting infrastructure includes the Pan-African Payment and Settlement System (PAPSS), which now connects over 20 central banks and 160 commercial banks, enabling easier payment for goods in local currencies. Additionally, Afreximbank is organizing specialized training programs to help African businesses understand the AfCFTA's commercial implications and regulatory landscape.\n\nImplementation of the AfCFTA faces several challenges. Six years after its inception, key decisions regarding tariff liberalization and rules of origin remain pending for a number of state parties. Some countries, including South Africa, have not yet submitted full tariff offers for sensitive goods, pending the finalization of rules of origin for key sectors such as automotive and textiles. The deadline for finalizing these rules is October 2025. The overall target for the removal of tariffs on 90% of goods has been moved back to 2034. Some analysts note that production-related challenges, like low industrial output and poor infrastructure, must be addressed before the full benefits of tariff removal can be realized.",

    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "About 2 months (until July 1, 2025)",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No — Libya remains a signatory/non-party without completing ratification by July 1, 2025",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Political fragmentation between Tripoli and the eastern-based House of Representatives prevents swift treaty ratification. With limited parliamentary sittings and competing priorities, no ratification bill is passed or no instrument is deposited with the AU Commission by the deadline.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "The GNU fast-tracks approval and coordinates with the HoR (or proceeds under its claimed authority), enabling a rapid parliamentary vote and timely deposit of the instrument of ratification with the AU Commission before July 1, possibly tied to a diplomatic push around an AU/AfCFTA event or framed as supporting Libya–Turkey trade ambitions and regional integration.",
    "rationale": "Baseline: As of 2025-05-01, Libya has not ratified AfCFTA. Only about 61 days remain. In Libya’s divided political environment, formal ratification typically requires parliamentary action by the HoR, which is irregular and politically contentious. There are no public signs of imminent ratification (e.g., draft bill on the HoR agenda, cabinet announcement of transmission to parliament, or AU statements about Libya’s pending deposit). Absent such signals, the status quo (no ratification by July 1) is the most likely outcome.\n\nFactors from the research assistant influencing the forecast:\n- AfCFTA progress is real (92% consensus on rules; PAPSS connectivity; training programs), but key rules of origin for major sectors won’t be finalized until Oct 2025 and the 90% tariff liberalization target has slipped to 2034. This reduces Libya’s immediate payoff from rushing ratification in the next two months.\n- Libya’s May 2025 rhetoric on boosting trade with Turkey and serving as a gateway to Africa signals pro-trade intent, but it focuses on bilateral facilitation and a free trade zone. That’s compatible with AfCFTA ratification but doesn’t constitute concrete steps to ratify now.\n\nWhy not higher: Very short timeline, institutional split, lack of concrete procedural signals, and diminished urgency given AfCFTA’s staggered implementation. Ratification requires legal formalities and deposit with the AU Commission; doing all of that within two months without prior public movement is uncommon.\n\nWhy not lower: There is continent-wide momentum (49 of 54 reportedly joined), and Libya may seek quick symbolic wins that align with its stated regional trade ambitions. The AU sometimes catalyzes last-minute ratifications around summits. If the GNU is recognized for deposit purposes, it could potentially move faster than a fully contested legislative path.\n\nWhat would move me up: Credible reports of (1) cabinet approval of the AfCFTA ratification bill, (2) the HoR scheduling and advancing the ratification vote, (3) official statements from Tripoli or the AU/AfCFTA Secretariat indicating imminent deposit, or (4) linkage to a specific AU event before July.\n\nWhat would move me down: Renewed political crisis reducing parliamentary sitting time, explicit statements deprioritizing AfCFTA, procedural obstacles over which authority can validly ratify, or signs that the AU would not accept a deposit without HoR approval.",

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
