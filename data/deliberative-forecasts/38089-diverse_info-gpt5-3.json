    "review": "Both forecasters present new and crucial evidence I hadn’t incorporated: recent Morning Consult readings showing Sánchez narrowly ahead of Erdoğan (by ~2–3 points in May). If accurate, that flips my baseline and is the dominant consideration given the ~1-month horizon and the tracker’s 7-day moving average. I find their inertia argument broadly convincing: approval ratings typically drift slowly absent major shocks. That said, I think 65–68% is a bit high given (a) the very small margin, (b) tie resolves No, (c) Morning Consult’s rounding to whole percentages, and (d) plausible near-term tailwinds for Erdoğan (gradual disinflation, modest upticks in consumer sentiment) or downside risk for Sánchez from Spain’s ongoing political/judicial frictions. Forecaster 2’s emphasis on Turkey’s structural economic drag is valid, but I’d temper it with the potential for short-run sentiment improvements. Forecaster 3’s framing of a narrow but real edge for Sánchez is strongest; I’d just discount a bit for tie/noise risk.",
    "rationale": "I’m updating meaningfully from my prior (which assumed Erdoğan leading) to reflect the recent data indicating Sánchez ahead by ~2–3 points. With ~33 days to go and a 7-day average, the status quo carries substantial weight. Historical month-to-month moves of 1–3 points are common; flipping a 3-point lead is certainly possible but not the base case. Countervailing considerations that keep me below mid-60s: (1) ties resolve No and Morning Consult reports integer percentages, increasing the chance a narrow edge disappears in rounding; (2) Turkey’s modest improvements in sentiment/disinflation could lift Erdoğan a bit; (3) Spain is politically volatile, so a small negative news cycle could shave a point or two from Sánchez. Netting these, I think a modest edge for Yes is warranted but not as high as mid-to-high 60s. I would move higher if the late-June reading shows Sánchez maintaining or widening a ≥3-point lead; I’d move lower if the gap narrows to ≤1 point or flips, or if Turkish sentiment data continues to improve into late June.",
