  "information": "South Sudan signed the African Continental Free Trade Area (AfCFTA) agreement in 2019 but, as of early May 2025, is one of the few states that have not deposited their instruments of ratification with the African Union. The ratification process requires a bill to pass the Transitional National Legislative Assembly, be signed by the President, and have the formal instrument lodged with the AU Commission. Historically, South Sudan's legislative processes can be lengthy; for example, the country took six years to ratify the Maputo Protocol.\n\nThe government of South Sudan is currently focused on several pressing domestic issues, including a delayed peace roadmap and preparations for national elections scheduled for December 2025. The country is also facing a fiscal crisis following a collapse in oil revenue due to a shutdown of a Red Sea pipeline. Further complicating the political landscape, the Vice-President and other senior officials were arrested in late April 2025. The national legislature has been meeting infrequently, sitting for only 32 days in the second half of 2024, and its published calendar for May-June 2025 includes no trade-related bills. Additionally, the Finance Ministry has not budgeted for the obligations associated with AfCFTA ratification, such as tariff reductions.\n\nOn the continental level, the AfCFTA has achieved 92% consensus on trade rules, with 49 of 54 African countries having joined the agreement. To support implementation, initiatives such as the Pan-African Payment and Settlement System (PAPSS) have been introduced. Within South Sudan, both the Chamber of Commerce and the Ministry of Trade have publicly advocated for ratification, with the Trade Minister reaffirming the government's commitment at an April 2025 summit. In February 2025, the East African Community (EAC) launched a new trade committee in South Sudan to help harmonize standards with the AfCFTA framework.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Less than two months, as the deadline is July 1, 2025.",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No. South Sudan will not ratify the AfCFTA before the deadline as the government is focused on pressing domestic crises and the legislature has not scheduled the bill for consideration.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "The South Sudanese government and legislature remain preoccupied with the upcoming December 2025 elections, a severe fiscal crisis, and internal political instability. The AfCFTA ratification bill is not brought forward for a vote, and the July 1, 2025 deadline passes without South Sudan depositing its instrument of ratification with the African Union.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Spurred by intense diplomatic pressure from the African Union and the East African Community, the President's office makes AfCFTA ratification an urgent priority to signal stability. The bill is fast-tracked through an emergency legislative session in June, signed immediately, and the ratification instrument is swiftly deposited with the AU Commission just before the deadline.",
    "rationale": "The forecast is based on the extremely short timeframe and the overwhelming weight of evidence indicating government inaction on this file. The primary factors supporting a 'No' outcome are: 1) Legislative Inertia: The national legislature is meeting infrequently and, crucially, its published calendar for May-June 2025 contains no trade-related bills, making it procedurally difficult to pass the ratification bill in time. 2) Competing Priorities: The government is consumed by more pressing issues, including a delayed peace roadmap, national elections in December 2025, a fiscal crisis from an oil pipeline shutdown, and recent high-level political arrests. These existential threats command far more attention than a trade agreement. 3) Lack of Preparedness: The Finance Ministry has not budgeted for the financial obligations of AfCFTA membership, suggesting a lack of practical planning beyond political statements. 4) Historical Precedent: South Sudan's legislative processes are historically slow, as evidenced by the six years it took to ratify the Maputo Protocol. While there is public support for ratification from the Trade Minister and the Chamber of Commerce, these statements are not supported by concrete actions. My forecast is not lower than 5% because a surprise, high-speed ratification driven by unforeseen political incentives or external pressure is not impossible, merely highly improbable. My forecast is not higher because the observable facts—the legislative calendar, the focus on domestic crises, and the lack of budget allocation—present formidable, near-term barriers to ratification. I would increase my probability if there were a public announcement that the bill was added to the legislative agenda for an upcoming session. I would decrease it further if the end of May passes with no movement.",
