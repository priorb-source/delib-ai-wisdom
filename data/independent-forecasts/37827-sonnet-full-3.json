  "information": "A historical analysis of the National UFO Reporting Center (NUFORC) database from 2015 to 2024 identified between four and six pilot reports originating from Africa over the ten-year period. The specific countries mentioned for these past reports include South Africa, Egypt, Nigeria, Kenya, and Rwanda. Globally, pilot reports typically account for approximately 1% of the 5,000 to 6,000 total UFO sightings logged by NUFORC annually.\n\nOn January 1, 2025, a pilot report was logged in the NUFORC database describing a sighting of a four-craft inline formation of UFOs in Rwanda. Additionally, a separate, non-pilot sighting of a glowing sphere was reported over Cape Town, South Africa, on January 22, 2025.\n\nAccording to U.S. government data, 757 Unidentified Aerial Phenomena (UAP) incidents were reported between May 2023 and June 2024, with 708 of these occurring in the air. One notable incident from January 2023 involved a U.S. Air Force F-16 fighter jet colliding with an unidentified object over Arizona, resulting in damage to the aircraft's canopy.",

    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Approximately 40 days. We are currently on May 22, 2025, and the question resolves based on activity during June 2025, which will be determinable by July 1, 2025.",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No - the status quo is that no pilot report from Africa occurs in June 2025, given how rare these events are historically.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "June 2025 passes with typical UFO reporting patterns, but no pilots flying over African airspace report UAP/UFO sightings to NUFORC during that month. This aligns with the historical pattern where African pilot reports are extremely sparse, with only 4-6 occurring over an entire 10-year period.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "A commercial or private pilot flying over African airspace - perhaps over South Africa, Egypt, Nigeria, Kenya, or another African nation - observes an unexplained aerial phenomenon in June 2025 and submits a report to NUFORC, which subsequently appears in their database when accessed after July 1, 2025.",
    "rationale": "The historical base rate strongly suggests these events are rare. With 4-6 pilot reports from Africa over 10 years (2015-2024), the average rate is approximately 0.4-0.6 reports per year from the entire African continent. This translates to roughly 0.033-0.05 reports per month, or about 3-5% probability for any given month. The January 1, 2025 Rwanda pilot report demonstrates the reporting mechanism remains active and that 2025 has already produced one African pilot report. However, this doesn't meaningfully increase the probability for June specifically, as these reports appear to be independent events distributed across time. Pilot reports globally represent only 1% of total UFO reports, making them inherently rare. Africa accounts for roughly 0.8-1.2% of all pilot reports worldwide based on the historical data. The question requires a very specific conjunction: (1) a pilot rather than civilian observer, (2) in Africa specifically, (3) during June specifically, and (4) reported to NUFORC. My forecast of 5% reflects the monthly base rate derived from historical data, acknowledging both that these events do occasionally occur and that they remain quite rare. The forecast would increase if we saw multiple pilot reports from Africa in the coming weeks (suggesting an elevated reporting period) or decrease if reliable information suggested reduced air traffic or reporting patterns in June.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill a pilot report of UFOs come from a country in Africa in June 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nFor example, the resolution source [reports](https://nuforc.org/sighting/?id=186297) a 4 craft inline formation of UFOs having been sighted on January 1, 2025 in Rwanda.\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if The National UFO Reporting Center posts a pilot report of a UFO/UAP having occurred in a country on the African continent, during the month of June 2025 at [this link](https://nuforc.org/subndx/?id=x) when accessed by Metaculus on or after July 1, 2025.\n\n\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nA historical analysis of the National UFO Reporting Center (NUFORC) database from 2015 to 2024 identified between four and six pilot reports originating from Africa over the ten-year period.

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any).
