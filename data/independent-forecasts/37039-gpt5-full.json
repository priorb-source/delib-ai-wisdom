  "information": "On April 2-3, 2025, the U.S. President announced comprehensive tariffs. The policy included a 10% base tariff on goods from almost all countries, effective April 5, and additional country-specific tariffs to take effect on April 9. For Switzerland, the total tariff was set at 31%. The stated justifications included that Switzerland had been 'taking advantage' of the US and as a response to alleged 61% tariffs imposed by Switzerland on American products.\n\nThe Swiss government, including President Karin Keller-Sutter, expressed 'incomprehension' regarding the tariff calculation. Swiss officials stated that the country imposes a 0% tariff on US imports, and that Swiss companies have created 500,000 jobs in the US. Switzerland's trade surplus with the US was $38.5 billion in 2024. The Swiss watch industry was noted as being particularly affected, with share prices for major exporters like Richemont and Swatch falling after the announcement.\n\nThe 31% additional ad valorem duty for Swiss products was officially listed under subheading 9903.01.60 of the U.S. Harmonized Tariff Schedule (HTS). On April 10, 2025, the U.S. administration announced that the country-specific tariffs, including the one for Switzerland, would be suspended for 90 days to allow for negotiations. This suspension period is scheduled to run until July 9, 2025, covering the June 1 resolution date. The HTS listing for Switzerland under subheading 9903.01.60 reflects the 31% rate but is marked as 'suspended'.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "~38 days (until June 1, 2025)",
    "status_quo_outcome": "Yes",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Before June 1, the administration or USITC updates the HTS to modify subheading 9903.01.60 so that it no longer shows an additional 31% rate for articles the product of Switzerland—e.g., Switzerland is removed from that line, the rate is changed to another percentage, or the subheading is retired/repurposed.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "The HTS remains as currently posted through June 1, with subheading 9903.01.60 showing an additional ad valorem duty rate of 31% for Swiss-origin goods (even if marked as suspended).",
    "rationale": "- What I know: According to the research assistant, the HTS currently lists a 31% additional ad valorem duty for Switzerland under 9903.01.60, and the administration announced a 90-day suspension of country-specific tariffs on April 10, running to July 9. The question’s resolution explicitly states that suspension status does not matter; if the row shows 31% for Switzerland, that resolves Yes.\n- Status quo: The row exists and shows 31%, marked suspended. With the suspension window extending beyond June 1, there is little procedural pressure to change the posted rate before the negotiation window closes.\n- Base rates vs. country-specific line: The criterion is narrowly about subheading 9903.01.60 showing 31% for Switzerland in the 1, General column. Even if other tariffs or base rates are adjusted, that would not affect this unless USITC/Administration edits or removes this specific entry.\n- Risks (why not higher): The administration could revise the proclamation or direct USITC to update the HTS mid-suspension (for example, to de-escalate with Switzerland), change the percentage, or move Switzerland off 9903.01.60. There is also a smaller risk of HTS housekeeping changes (renumbering or rewording) or legal action prompting an edit before June 1. Given the volatility around tariff policy, an early change is possible, though not the base case during a declared suspension/negotiation period.\n- Why not lower: The listing already exists, and the 90-day suspension suggests the policy is parked until July 9. Historically, similar tariff tables are not frequently revised mid-suspension absent a new formal action. The short time horizon (about five weeks) and the explicit resolution rule (suspension doesn’t matter) both favor a Yes.\n- What would move me: Upward—official signals that no changes will occur pre–July 9 (e.g., USTR/USITC notices indicating next update timing), or repeated HTS snapshots showing stability. Downward—any proclamation, USTR notice, or USITC change record indicating modification/removal of Switzerland’s 31% line before June 1; credible reports of an early bilateral deal; or a court order directing immediate edits.",

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any).
