    "review": "The analyses from the other two forecasters are highly aligned with my own. All three of us identify the same central tension: a strong status quo, where Muqtada al-Sadr maintains his boycott, versus his well-documented history of political unpredictability and the strategic risk of being sidelined. We all agree on the core drivers for both a 'Yes' and 'No' outcome, and on the lack of current evidence pointing to a change in Sadr's position. The only substantive difference is a minor variation in the final probability (15% vs. 20%), reflecting a slightly different weighting of the 'wild card' factor of Sadr's personality and strategic calculus.",
    "rationale": "My original reasoning stands, but the deliberation has caused me to refine my assessment. Both other forecasters' analyses confirmed the validity of my initial framework. However, Forecaster 3's slightly higher probability of 20% has prompted me to reconsider the weight I assigned to Sadr's penchant for dramatic reversals. His entire political career is characterized by such moves, which he uses as a strategic tool. The risk of his movement being permanently marginalized if he sits out another election is an existential threat. This strategic imperative might be a stronger driver than I initially calculated, potentially powerful enough for him to reverse his boycott even without a perfect face-saving pretext. The short timeframe remains a strong argument for 'No,' but an announcement can be made at any point before the deadline. Therefore, I am increasing my forecast to better reflect the non-trivial probability of a last-minute strategic reversal, a hallmark of Sadr's political style. This change represents a modest adjustment based on the collective reasoning that Sadr's unpredictability is a slightly more significant factor than I first assessed.",
