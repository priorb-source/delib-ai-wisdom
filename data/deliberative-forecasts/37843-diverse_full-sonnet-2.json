    "review": "Forecaster 2 and I agree on the strength of signals from credible reports, bank selection, and CEO hiring. However, Forecaster 2's 65% appears to conflate 'Discord is preparing for a 2025 IPO' with 'Discord will announce before July 1.' These are distinct - the evidence supports IPO preparation but doesn't necessitate a pre-July announcement. Forecaster 3 raises crucial technical points I underweighted: (1) Companies rarely pre-announce on blogs due to quiet-period considerations - the S-1 filing itself is typically the announcement; (2) Many companies submit confidentially first, which wouldn't satisfy our resolution criteria; (3) If targeting a fall listing, a public S-1 would likely appear AFTER July 1, not before; (4) The July 4 week creates awkward timing for major corporate milestones. These resolution mechanics significantly constrain the probability. While Forecaster 2's point about signal strength has merit - Goldman/JPMorgan engagement and CEO hire suggest advanced preparation - this doesn't dictate the specific timing of public announcement. The most likely scenario remains continued preparation with a later public filing, keeping status quo at No.",
    "rationale": "After deliberation, I'm making a modest upward adjustment from 25% to 28%. Forecaster 3's analysis of resolution mechanics reinforces that the question's specific requirements make a Yes outcome less likely than simply assessing IPO readiness. The blog announcement path is highly improbable given quiet-period norms. The S-1 path requires Discord to: (1) choose not to file confidentially first (or have already done so), (2) target a late-July/early-August IPO warranting June filing, (3) navigate July 4 week timing, and (4) see market conditions stabilize in the next 39 days. While Forecaster 2 correctly notes the strength of preparation signals, I maintain these don't overcome the timing constraints and procedural realities. The 2+ months since March reports without movement, combined with market volatility and seasonal considerations, support a probability below 35%. My slight increase from 25% acknowledges there is a realistic if narrow path to a June S-1 filing, but the weight of evidence favors announcement timing falling after the July 1 cutoff.",
