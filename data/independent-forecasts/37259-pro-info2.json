  "information": "Public sentiment in Greenland shows strong support for the principle of independence, with various polls indicating approval from over 80% of the population. However, opinions on the timing vary, with many favoring a more gradual approach. A January 2025 survey revealed that while 84% support independence, 45% of supporters would reconsider if it meant a decline in living standards. The debate over independence has been recently intensified by comments from former U.S. President Donald Trump about acquiring the island, which also prompted a solidarity visit from Danish King Frederik X in late April 2025 and a visit from a U.S. private sector delegation exploring investment opportunities.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Less than 2 months, as the question resolves on July 1, 2025.",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No. Greenland's government will not officially schedule an independence referendum before the deadline, continuing its current gradual approach to eventual sovereignty.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "The ruling coalition, while ideologically pro-independence, continues to prioritize economic stability. Citing public concerns about potential declines in living standards and the need for further economic development, the government decides that the conditions are not yet right to set a firm date, pushing the decision beyond the July 1, 2025 deadline.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "A surge in nationalist sentiment, possibly triggered by a new international incident regarding Greenland's status or sovereignty, pressures the government to take a decisive step. To consolidate its political support and capitalize on the moment, the Premier officially announces a future date for a referendum, framing it as a necessary step to affirm Greenland's right to self-determination.",
    "rationale": "My forecast places significant weight on the status quo. The deadline of July 1, 2025, is less than two months away, which is a very short timeframe for such a momentous political decision. The current government is described as 'gradualist,' suggesting a cautious approach that is fundamentally at odds with a rushed announcement of a referendum. \n\nThe research indicates that while support for the principle of independence is high (over 80%), this support is soft and conditional. The fact that nearly half of these supporters would reconsider if it meant a lower standard of living is a powerful deterrent for any government, especially one that relies on a substantial block subsidy from Denmark. This economic dependency is the central hurdle to independence and cannot be resolved in two months. \n\nRecent international attention from the U.S. and Denmark likely reinforces the need for caution rather than haste; it highlights the complex geopolitical and economic stakes, encouraging leaders to secure a stronger economic footing before making any irreversible moves. \n\nMy forecast is not lower than 15% because the high public support for independence creates a volatile political environment where a symbolic gesture, like announcing a referendum far in the future, could become politically expedient, especially in response to an unforeseen external event. \n\nMy forecast is not higher than 15% due to the combination of the extremely short timeline, the government's stated gradualist policy, and the deep-seated, unresolved economic concerns that make immediate action on a referendum highly improbable. \n\nI would increase my probability if key figures in the Greenlandic government began publicly discussing a concrete timeline for a referendum announcement. Conversely, I would decrease it if the government signed a new long-term economic or strategic agreement with Denmark that signaled a commitment to the current framework for the foreseeable future.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nBefore July 1, 2025, will the government of Greenland officially announce a date for an independence referendum?\n\nQuestion background:\nReuters: [Greenland's independence gradualists win election amid Trump control pledge](https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/greenland-election-tests-independence-ambitions-us-interest-looms-2025-03-11/)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if, before July 1, 2025, a referendum on the independence of Greenland from the Denmark is officially scheduled. If this does not occur before that date, this question resolves as **No**.\n\nFor purposes of this question, the referendum will be considered \"officially scheduled\" when it is announced by a person or entity with the authority to do so within Greenland. Please note that broader legality, such as it being overturned by the government of Denmark, will be considered irrelevant for this question.\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nPublic sentiment in Greenland shows strong support for the principle of independence, with various polls indicating approval from over 80% of the population.

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
