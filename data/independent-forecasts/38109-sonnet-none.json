    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "31 days - outcome will be determined by end of June 2025",
    "status_quo_outcome": "Uncertain - question asks about future continuous daily activity starting tomorrow",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Either Kalshi fails to maintain consistent daily baseball market offerings throughout June, experiences regulatory/operational disruptions, or there are one or more days in June with no MLB games scheduled (league-wide off-days)",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Kalshi successfully offers baseball prediction markets every single day in June 2025, MLB plays games every day in June with no league-wide off-days, and no regulatory or operational issues prevent continuous market offerings",
    "rationale": "This question has an extremely stringent requirement: markets must be offered EVERY SINGLE DAY in June 2025. Several factors create uncertainty. First, MLB scheduling: while June is peak baseball season, MLB typically includes occasional league-wide off-days even during the regular season for events like drafts or travel days. If there is even one day in June with no MLB games being played, Kalshi cannot offer a market on a game being played that day, causing this to resolve No. Second, operational consistency: Kalshi would need to maintain perfect daily market offerings for 30 consecutive days without any gaps due to technical issues, staffing problems, or business decisions. Third, regulatory risk: the background mentions ongoing legal proceedings around Kalshi prediction markets, suggesting potential regulatory uncertainty. The status quo is difficult to assess since we're at the very beginning of the evaluation period (May 31st). My forecast is not higher because: (1) the 'every single day' requirement is very strict with no room for error, (2) MLB likely has at least 1-2 off-days in June, (3) maintaining 30 consecutive days of operations without any lapses is challenging. My forecast is not lower because: (1) June is peak baseball season with games most days, (2) if Kalshi is already offering these markets, operational continuity is likely. I would update higher if I learned: MLB's official June 2025 schedule shows games every single day, Kalshi has demonstrated consistent baseball market offerings recently, or resolution of favorable legal/regulatory status. I would update lower if: confirmed MLB off-days exist in June 2025, evidence of recent operational gaps in Kalshi's market offerings, or adverse regulatory developments.",

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
