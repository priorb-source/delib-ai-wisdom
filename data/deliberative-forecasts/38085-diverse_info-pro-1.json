    "review": "The other forecasters provided critical insights that refined my initial analysis. Forecaster 2 introduced a crucial data point I had missed: the current drought-affected population is 14.5 million, not 14.0 million. This 500,000-person buffer above the threshold significantly strengthens the case for a 'Yes' outcome. Forecaster 3's reasoning, while leading to a lower probability, was also highly valuable. They presented a very specific and plausible scenario for a 'No' resolution: a strong onset of the wet season focused on the densely populated Southeast Florida metro area could quickly drop the count below the threshold. This highlighted a key vulnerability in the 'Yes' case that I had not fully appreciated.",
    "rationale": "I am updating my forecast upward from 65% to 72%. The primary driver for this change is the new information from Forecaster 2 that the starting point is 14.5 million residents in drought. This creates a 500,000-person buffer that must be overcome in just one month for the question to resolve 'No'. Given the typical inertia of drought conditions, which take sustained rainfall over weeks to alleviate, this higher starting point makes persistence much more likely. However, I am not increasing my forecast to Forecaster 2's level of 78% due to the compelling counterargument raised by Forecaster 3. The concentration of Florida's population in coastal areas means that geographically targeted, heavy rainfall—a distinct possibility with the onset of the wet season—could rapidly reduce the affected population count. My revised 72% forecast balances the strong evidence for drought persistence from the high starting point against the significant, plausible risk of rapid improvement in key population centers.",
