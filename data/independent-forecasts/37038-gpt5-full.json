  "information": "A 17% 'reciprocal' tariff on Israeli goods was announced by the US on April 2, 2025, and codified under heading 9903.01.48 of the Harmonized Tariff Schedule (HTS) with an effective date of April 9. Subsequently, the implementation of this tariff was suspended for 90 days, deferring the collection of duties until July 9, 2025. Reports state that the official HTS website has been updated to list a '+17%' duty for Israel, which is currently marked as 'suspended'.\n\nThe US is Israel's largest trading partner, with bilateral trade valued at $34 billion in 2024. The two countries have a 40-year-old free trade agreement. On April 1, 2025, the Israeli government announced the immediate cancellation of all its remaining tariffs on U.S. imports. Following the US tariff announcement, Israeli Economy Minister Nir Barkat stated that officials from both countries are optimistic about reaching a new trade agreement before the suspension period expires on July 9, 2025. Ongoing discussions also aim to address the trade deficit between the nations.\n\nThe United States recently implemented a general 10% tariff on imports from most trading partners. Concurrently, the administration has pursued other trade actions, including imposing a 25% tariff on imported automobiles and certain auto parts, and increasing tariffs on Chinese goods to over 100% in response to retaliatory measures. Additionally, new tariffs ranging from 41% to over 3,500% have been announced on solar imports from several Southeast Asian countries, pending a final decision in June 2025.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "About 38 days (until June 1, 2025)",
    "status_quo_outcome": "Yes — the HTS already shows +17% for Israel (currently marked “suspended”), and suspension status does not affect resolution.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "The U.S. and Israel conclude a new trade arrangement in May, leading to a Presidential Proclamation and USITC update before June 1 that revokes or supersedes HTS 9903.01.48, removing the +17% line (or changing the applicable Israel duty to 0%), so the HTS no longer lists +17% for Israel on June 1.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "The HTS continues to display +17% for Israel under 9903.01.48 (even if flagged as “suspended”) through June 1, with any deal or revocation taking effect later (e.g., on or after the current July 9 suspension date).",
    "rationale": "The research assistant reports that a 17% “reciprocal” tariff on Israeli goods is codified at HTS 9903.01.48, effective April 9, 2025, and that implementation/collection has been suspended for 90 days (until July 9). The official HTS site reportedly already lists “+17%” for Israel and labels it “suspended.” The question resolves Yes if the HTS lists +17% on or after June 1, regardless of suspension. Given that the measure is already codified and visible on the HTS, the status quo is a Yes. To become a No by June 1, there would need to be a new legal action (e.g., Presidential Proclamation, implementing an agreement) that removes or alters the applicable subheading for Israel before June 1, followed by an HTS update. While both governments signal interest in a deal before the July 9 suspension expiry, there is little incentive for the U.S. to rescind the tariff early; keeping the entry in place (suspended) preserves leverage during negotiations. Procedurally, revocations can be fast, but still require formal action and coordination to update the HTS in time. The broader trade environment (e.g., general 10% tariff posture) also points toward maintaining pressure rather than early removal. Why not higher than this forecast? A rapid bilateral deal in May with an immediate or near-immediate revocation and quick HTS update is plausible, given the longstanding trade relationship and public optimism from Israeli officials. Why not lower? The tariff is already listed and explicitly suspended until July 9, which suggests the default to keep the HTS entry intact at least through that date unless a deal is finalized and implemented sooner. What would move me up? Signals that talks have stalled, or official indications that the suspension will remain through July 9 (or be extended) without removing the listing. What would move me down? Concrete reporting of a concluded agreement with immediate rescission, a White House/UST/USITC notice of imminent revocation before June 1, or a Federal Register notice that removes or zeroes out 9903.01.48 for Israel effective in May.",
