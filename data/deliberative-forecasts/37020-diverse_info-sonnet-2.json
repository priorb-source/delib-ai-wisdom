    "review": "Forecaster 2 raises a crucial point I overlooked: Post Malone's 0-for-18 Grammy record suggests a pattern of recognition without conversion. This is significant evidence of potential systemic voter resistance or tough competition, though ACM voters may differ from Recording Academy members. Forecaster 3's mathematical framework (cumulative probability across categories) is useful, though the independence assumption is flawed since collaboration categories are correlated. Their emphasis on 'I Had Some Help' as a blockbuster hit and the specific paths through Music Event/Video and Single/Song categories is compelling. Both forecasters correctly identify that collaboration categories offer Post Malone's strongest chances, particularly given Morgan Wallen's 7 nominations and established country credibility.",
    "rationale": "After deliberation, I'm adjusting down slightly from 65% to 63%. The Grammy pattern is genuinely concerning - 18 nominations without a win suggests Post Malone may systematically underperform in competitive voting despite strong nominations. However, I'm not moving as low as Forecaster 2 (40%) because: (1) ACM voters operate differently than Grammy voters and may value commercial country success more heavily, (2) 'I Had Some Help' was a dominant country hit specifically, not just crossover success, (3) the multiple Nashville collaborations (Wallen, Combs, Shelton, Jelly Roll) provide legitimate country credibility beyond pure crossover appeal, and (4) the cumulative probability across 5 nominations remains substantial even if individual category odds are modest. I'm not going as high as Forecaster 3 (68%) because the Grammy record and fierce competition (Ella Langley with 8 nominations, multiple artists with 6-7) suggest we shouldn't be overly confident. The 63% forecast reflects that winning at least one award is more likely than not, but acknowledges meaningful doubt based on historical underperformance and strong competition.",
