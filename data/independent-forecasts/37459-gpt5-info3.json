  "information": "First-quarter earnings reports for the 'Magnificent Seven' showed varied performance. Meta's earnings per share beat analyst estimates, and Microsoft's revenue and profit exceeded expectations. In contrast, Amazon's cloud business showed decelerating growth, while Apple reported a 4.8% increase in earnings on 5.1% higher revenues. Both Amazon and Apple cited tariffs as a potential headwind. Around the same period, Warren Buffett announced his plan to retire as CEO at the end of 2025, with Greg Abel set to take over. On March 17, 2025, Berkshire Hathaway Class B shares reached a record high of $523.01.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "About 8 days (13F due by May 15, 2025; could file earlier)",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No — Berkshire’s 13F does not report a position in Alphabet, Meta, Microsoft, Nvidia, or Tesla.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Berkshire remains a net seller in Q1 2025, trims existing positions (e.g., Apple) and adds no new Mag 7 names; or begins building a stake but obtains confidential treatment so the Q1 13F does not report it.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Berkshire (more likely one of Todd/Ted than Buffett) initiates a modest, non-confidential position in Alphabet or Meta that appears on the Q1 2025 13F. A Microsoft position is less likely given long-standing optics concerns; Nvidia and Tesla are least likely given valuation/cyclicality and auto-industry skepticism.",
    "rationale": "- Status quo/base rate: Berkshire rarely adds new mega-cap tech names. Outside Apple (core) and a small Amazon position historically, new Mag 7 additions have been uncommon. Buffett has often emphasized circle-of-competence and has been cautious on AI-driven names and semis (e.g., quick exit from TSMC). He’s also historically avoided Microsoft due to optics with Bill Gates, and has long expressed skepticism about the auto industry, making Tesla unlikely.\n- Recent behavior/context: Berkshire has repeatedly used SEC confidential treatment when building large stakes (e.g., Chubb), which, if applied here, would prevent the position from appearing on the Q1 13F and thus resolve this question as No. Reports around the 2025 annual meeting indicate Berkshire was again a net seller in Q1 2025 and comfortable letting cash build, which reduces the odds of initiating a new high-profile tech position.\n- Valuation/fit considerations: Nvidia and Microsoft remained richly valued into Q1; Nvidia also carries cyclicality and supply-chain concentration risks. Tesla has fundamental/competitive uncertainties and industry economics Buffett/Munger have criticized. Alphabet or Meta are the more plausible candidates given durable cash flows and moats, but initiating even small positions is still a low-probability event in any given quarter.\n- Research assistant summary used: Earnings were mixed among the Mag 7; Meta and Microsoft beat, Apple and Amazon had mixed signals. Buffett plans to step down end-2025, but he remains in charge now; BRK.B hit record highs in March. None of this specifically points to a new Mag 7 buy in Q1.\n- Why not higher: Low base rate for Berkshire adding new Mag 7 names; tendency to request confidentiality when accumulating; net-seller stance and rising cash; specific frictions (MSFT optics, Tesla skepticism, Nvidia/semis caution).\n- Why not lower: Todd/Ted have latitude for smaller positions (e.g., past Amazon buy). Alphabet or Meta could plausibly appear as a small disclosed initiation without confidentiality.\n- What would move me up: Credible indications from Berkshire commentary or well-sourced reporting that Todd/Ted initiated a disclosed stake in Alphabet/Meta during Q1 and did not seek confidentiality; unusual options activity or block trades linked to Berkshire; hints in the shareholder meeting transcript suggesting a new disclosed mega-cap tech position.\n- What would move me down: Confirmation that Berkshire sought/received confidential treatment on any new large position; further confirmation they were sizable net sellers with no new positions; direct remarks affirming no new large-cap tech buys in Q1.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill Berkshire Hathaway reveal a purchase of any Magnificent 7 stock other than Amazon and Apple in its Q1 2025 13F filing?\n\nQuestion background:\nInvestopedia: [Berkshire Hathaway Doesn't Hold Nvidia Stock—Will Warren Buffett Come to Regret it?](https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/warren-buffetts-secret-portfolio-dumping-shares-3-supercharged-artificial-intelligence-ai)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if the 13F filing for Berkshire Hathaway, Inc., filed for the period ending 2025-03-31, reports the company holding shares of Alphabet, Meta Platforms, Microsoft, Nvidia, or Tesla.\n\n\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nFirst-quarter earnings reports for the 'Magnificent Seven' showed varied performance.

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
