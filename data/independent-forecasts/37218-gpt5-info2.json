    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "~12 days, until the evening of Saturday, May 10, 2025 (Montreal local time)",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No — he does not attend",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Trump remains in the U.S. due to campaign/events, legal or scheduling constraints, or does not obtain/seek Canadian entry permission; he is not anywhere on Bell Centre grounds on May 10.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "UFC/Dana White extend an invitation, Canada grants a discretionary entry (e.g., Temporary Resident Permit), Secret Service coordinates security, and Trump flies in and is seen at the Bell Centre (cageside or elsewhere on venue grounds).",
    "rationale": "Baseline: The event is in Montreal, Canada. Historically, per the research assistant, no sitting or former U.S. president has attended a UFC event outside the U.S. That precedent points toward a No by default. Trump has a strong relationship with UFC and has attended multiple U.S.-based cards, sometimes leveraging them for visibility, but those appearances have been domestic and logistically simpler. Frictions for a Canadian appearance: (1) Cross-border travel and security coordination are more complex than domestic trips. (2) Canada’s admissibility rules can render individuals with felony convictions inadmissible absent a waiver/Temporary Resident Permit; while such permits are discretionary and possible, they add uncertainty and lead time. (3) There is limited political upside to appearing at an event abroad during a busy campaign period, relative to U.S. rallies/media. Timing: We are ~12 days out. For past UFC appearances, credible chatter often surfaces close to the event when travel and security are being set. The absence (so far) of strong, public signals of planned attendance modestly tilts toward No. Why not higher: International venue, immigration hurdles, and lack of clear pre-event signaling reduce the chance well below Trump’s domestic UFC attendance rate. Why not lower: Trump’s pattern of attending high-profile UFC cards, his closeness to Dana White, and UFC’s ability to facilitate VIP logistics keep a non-trivial tail for a last-minute plan, especially if he’s already in the Northeast that weekend and can secure a permit. What would move me up: Credible reports of a Canadian entry waiver/permit, on-the-record hints by Dana White/UFC, Secret Service coordination visible in Montreal, or Trump scheduling nearby events that weekend. What would move me down: Reports of conflicting commitments, legal/travel restrictions precluding Canada travel, Canadian officials signaling denial of entry, or firm statements from UFC/Trump indicating he will not attend.",

These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if President Donald Trump is anywhere within the grounds of the venue where [UFC 315](https://www.ufc.com/event/ufc-315) takes place.

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
