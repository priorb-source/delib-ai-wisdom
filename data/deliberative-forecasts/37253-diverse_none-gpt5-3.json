    "review": "Both forecasters appropriately weight the strong status quo and short horizon. Forecaster 2 adds the useful point that intelligence has long assessed Punggye-ri as ready, implying low lead-time if a political decision is made; they also highlight Russia–DPRK ties as a modest upward pressure. Forecaster 3 emphasizes the unprecedented 8-year gap and lack of indicators, rightly pushing down the near-term hazard. Where I differ: (1) I think the risk of “new UN sanctions” is less binding than in earlier cycles given Russia’s likely shielding and the UNSC’s dysfunction, which modestly reduces the expected penalty; (2) given repeated “could test any time” assessments, I give slightly less weight to the predictive value of that phrase absent fresh site activity. Still, the absence of any reported OSINT cues and the very short window argue for a lower probability than my initial estimate. Overall their reasoning nudges me down, but not as low as 5% because Russia’s cover and potential tactical warhead validation still create some upside risk.",
    "rationale": "- Time left: ~2 months. Short windows favor the status quo. \n- Base rates/status quo: No tests since 2017 despite multiple provocation cycles suggests a low per-month hazard. \n- Readiness vs indicators: US/ROK have for years said a test could occur with little warning, so technical capacity is likely in place; however, absent fresh Punggye-ri activity or specific warnings, the immediate hazard remains modest. \n- Costs/benefits: Costs include alienating China and risking additional unilateral sanctions; benefits include validating new designs (e.g., tactical warhead) and signaling resolve, with Russia’s support reducing multilateral punishment risk. On balance, costs likely still outweigh benefits in most states of the world over the next 60 days. \n- Update from peers: Their emphasis on the long moratorium and lack of indicators is persuasive; I slightly reduce my prior (12%) to better align with the short-horizon base rate while retaining some extra weight for Russia–DPRK dynamics and the possibility of a political decision without much visible lead time. \n- What would move me up: credible reports of sustained test-site activity (tunneling, cabling, water pumping), explicit DPRK signaling of a nuclear test milestone, or coordinated allied warnings. Down: signs of Chinese pressure, renewed engagement, or visible site inactivity into mid-June.",
