  "information": "The U.S. Department of Agriculture’s Food Safety and Inspection Service (FSIS) oversees the recall process. For a recall to be formally closed, the FSIS must complete effectiveness checks and verify that the company has removed all affected products from commerce, notified customers, and implemented corrective actions. Historical data for similar recalls show varied timelines; medium-scale allergen recalls (10,000-100,000 lbs) typically take 60 to 120 days to close. Other analyses suggest a mean closure time of 45 days for allergen/misbranding recalls, with about half of comparable recalls in 2023-2024 closing within 70 days.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "57 days until July 1, 2025",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No - the recall remains Active",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "The FSIS effectiveness checks and verification processes extend beyond the typical timeline. The company faces delays in fully removing affected products from distribution channels or completing corrective actions. By July 1, 2025, the recall status is still listed as Active on the FSIS website, as the bureaucratic process has not yet concluded despite the company's efforts.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "ACC Central Kitchen LLC acts swiftly to remove all affected pork bun products from commerce and implements corrective actions within 2-3 weeks. FSIS conducts effectiveness checks efficiently, verifying removal and corrective measures by early-to-mid June. The recall is formally closed and updated to 'Closed' status on the FSIS website by late June 2025, well before the July 1 deadline.",
    "rationale": "The recall was issued on April 24, 2025, giving a total window of 68 days until the July 1 resolution date. As of today (May 5), 11 days have passed, leaving 57 days remaining. The research assistant provides conflicting signals: a mean closure time of 45 days (which would result in closure around June 8, supporting Yes) versus a median of approximately 70 days and typical range of 60-120 days for similar recalls (both suggesting No or borderline). The 65,000-pound scale places this in the medium category where historical timelines vary significantly. The status quo is that the recall remains Active, and good forecasting practice emphasizes this baseline since bureaucratic processes rarely accelerate without specific reason. The conflicting data points are critical: if half of comparable recalls close within 70 days, then July 1 (day 68) sits just before that median threshold, suggesting slightly less than 50% probability. However, the 45-day mean indicates a substantial portion close much faster. The straightforward nature of allergen misbranding (versus contamination or safety issues) may favor faster resolution, but administrative verification processes are inherently variable. My forecast is not higher because the median closure time exceeds our deadline and the typical 60-120 day range suggests 68 days would be faster than average. It's not lower because the 45-day mean and the fact that nearly half of recalls close around this timeframe indicates meaningful probability of Yes. I would update higher if evidence emerged of expedited FSIS processing or company progress reports, and lower if delays or complications were reported.",

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower.
