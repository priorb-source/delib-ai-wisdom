    "review": "Forecaster 2’s reasoning aligns closely with mine: the policy environment and current downtime point strongly to No, with only a small chance DoD quietly restores or redirects for readiness/continuity reasons. Forecaster 3 adds potential countervailing forces (national security framing, congressional pressure) and a six-week window, but provides no concrete signals of restoration and, in my view, overweights the likelihood that such pressures would translate into reviving this specific public-facing domain in that timeframe. Neither forecaster introduced new evidence (e.g., DNS changes, internal DoD pushback, or public commitments) that would materially raise odds. Importantly, the resolution hinges on climate.mil being up per the external monitor; even if resilience content exists elsewhere or internally, that won’t count, and leaving climate.mil as NXDOMAIN or nonresponsive is a low-effort way to comply with the purge. This domain-specific, monitor-dependent criterion makes a Yes less likely than the general “resilience work continues” thesis suggests.",
    "rationale": "Status quo: As of May 5, IsItDownRightNow reports climate.mil down for everyone, consistent with a deliberate removal under a top-down directive to purge climate-branded content. With ~6 weeks until July 1 (and the check occurring on/after that date), the base case is continued downtime absent a policy reversal or a pragmatic redirect. DoD’s institutional interest in resilience is real, but it can be served via internal systems or differently branded public pages without restoring climate.mil. The narrow resolution criterion (this specific domain must appear up to the monitor) and the political salience of the “climate” label both suppress odds. A path to Yes exists (reactivating DNS and serving a simple 200/301 to a rebranded page), but we have no signals it’s underway. I would move up on evidence of DNS changes, certificate issuance, or reports of a redirect/republish plan; down on indications of permanent decommissioning or continued “down for everyone” into late June. Given no new hard evidence from the other forecasters, I’m maintaining a low probability.",
