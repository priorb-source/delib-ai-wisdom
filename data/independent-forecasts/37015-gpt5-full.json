  "information": "Han Duck-soo is required by law to resign from his post as acting president by May 4, 2025, to be eligible for the presidential election. He has already missed the April 15 deadline to register for the People Power Party (PPP) primary. Consequently, PPP leadership has publicly stated he will not be included in their primary process. South Korean constitutional norms and historical precedent discourage caretaker heads of state from running for office.\n\nMultiple polls conducted in April 2025 show Han Duck-soo's public support ranging between 2% and 12%. Lee Jae-myung of the opposition Democratic Party leads in polls with approximately 46% support. One poll from April 20 indicated that 66% of respondents found Han's potential candidacy 'unacceptable'. Despite low public support, a faction within the People Power Party, with reports of over 50 lawmakers and a 'National Candidate Support Committee', are actively urging him to run.\n\nIn multiple public statements and interviews with news outlets such as the Financial Times and Yonhap in late April 2025, Han Duck-soo has consistently maintained that he 'has not yet decided' on a presidential run. His stated immediate priority is the US-South Korea trade negotiations scheduled for April 24. No visible campaign infrastructure or preparations for a presidential bid have been observed.",

    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "About 13 days (until 23:59 KST on May 4, 2025)",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Han keeps saying he is undecided, does not resign by May 4, PPP proceeds with its existing primary/selection process around another figure, and he remains an explicitly non-candidate caretaker until the election timeline advances—resulting in no announcement before May 5.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "A PPP draft movement triggers an emergency change to the party’s nomination process or Han opts to run as an independent backed by PPP figures; he files or signals resignation by May 4 and publicly declares his candidacy before May 5, framing it as a ‘national emergency’ decision.",
    "rationale": "Baseline: The status quo points to no announcement. Han has missed the PPP primary registration, party leadership says he will not be in their primary, and caretaker norms strongly discourage a sitting acting president from running. A close precedent is 2017, when acting president Hwang Kyo-ahn declined to run amid neutrality concerns and similar timing/resignation constraints. Legal and logistical hurdles are real: to be eligible he must resign by May 4, which imposes a high switching cost in the next ~two weeks. Reputational risk and likely public backlash are suggested by polling cited by the research assistant: Han polls in the low single digits to low teens, with a large share viewing a candidacy as unacceptable, and Lee Jae-myung currently leading comfortably. There is no visible campaign infrastructure. These all favor no announcement by the deadline. Countervailing factors: A faction within the PPP (reportedly 50+ lawmakers with a support committee) is urging him to run, and Korean parties can move quickly under emergency conditions. Because the resolution criterion is merely an announcement (not formal nomination or ballot access), the threshold is somewhat lower than actually qualifying—he could, in theory, announce even if logistics lag. If PPP leaders reverse course and coalesce around Han as a unity/draft candidate, that could precipitate a last-minute resignation and announcement. Why not higher: Strong legal, institutional, and normative frictions; missed primary; leadership pushback; poor polling; public acceptability concerns; minimal prep time; and a compelling 2017 precedent all point toward inaction. Why not lower: The PPP draft effort is nontrivial, Korean party decision-making can be rapid, and political crises can produce late, elite-driven candidacies; the time window still allows a resignation and announcement if momentum shifts after the April 24 trade talks. What would move me up: Credible reports that PPP’s emergency committee is preparing to anoint Han or suspend/override the primary; clear endorsements from top PPP figures/governors; leaks that resignation paperwork is being prepared or his schedule is being cleared; a polling surge showing Han competitive; or Han signaling he is ‘positively considering’ and outlining conditions under which he would run. What would move me down: PPP finalizing another nominee; renewed public statements from Han ruling out a run; legal or NEC guidance narrowing eligibility; continued weak polling and negative elite signals; or absence of any preparatory steps by April 28–30.",

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
