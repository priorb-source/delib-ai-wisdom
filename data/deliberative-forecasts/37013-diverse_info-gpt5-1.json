    "review": "New information raised: (1) a claimed £100k Lib Dem fundraising effort and near-full candidate slate; (2) retirements of high‑profile Conservative councillors, possibly including the council leader; (3) a reference to an Electoral Calculus MRP suggesting a Lib Dem win; (4) reminder of strong Independent tradition and potential Conservative–Reform vote split. I find (1)–(2) directionally plausible and supportive of a higher Lib Dem ceiling, but they need sourcing to judge magnitude; (3) is weakly evidenced—Electoral Calculus typically models parliamentary, not local council, outcomes, so I’m cautious; (4) is salient and constrains the Lib Dem path to the most seats. Forecaster 2’s 60% leans too hard on national headwinds and unverified modeling while underweighting Independents and Labour competition. Forecaster 3 more appropriately balances national tailwinds with Cornwall’s fragmented local dynamics; their 40% still looks high absent local polling or clear evidence that Independents are running fewer/less competitive slates. Overall, I accept there are stronger pro-Lib Dem indicators than I initially incorporated, but I’m not persuaded the plurality is “most likely.”",
    "rationale": "Core view unchanged: Cornwall’s multi‑party/Independent landscape makes “most seats” a high bar for any single opposition party, even with a Conservative slump. However, credible signs of a well‑resourced Lib Dem campaign and weakened Conservative incumbency slightly raise the odds that Lib Dems convert second places and benefit from a right‑of‑centre split. Seat arithmetic still bites: from 13 seats, the Lib Dems likely need mid‑20s to ~30 to top the table, which requires broad, coordinated gains while Labour and Independents don’t surge past them. Without ward‑level polling, by‑election evidence, or confirmed widespread Independent retrenchment, a plurality remains possible but not baseline. I’m nudging up to reflect the additional campaign‑capacity and incumbency‑retirement arguments, while discounting the unsupported MRP claim and keeping substantial weight on Independents/Labour fragmenting the anti‑Conservative vote.",
