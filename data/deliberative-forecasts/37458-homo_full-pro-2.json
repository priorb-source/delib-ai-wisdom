    "review": "The analyses from the other two forecasters are well-reasoned and align closely with my own initial assessment. We all concur on the primary factors: the status quo of non-communication strongly favors a 'No' outcome; the high-level talks in Geneva on May 10-11 represent the most significant potential catalyst for a 'Yes'; and the resolution's requirement for mutual acknowledgement sets a very high bar, particularly given the recent history of U.S. claims and Chinese denials. Forecaster 2's point about Xi's visit with Putin potentially signaling a hardened anti-US stance is a valuable addition and reinforces the bearish case. The core difference between my forecast (25%) and theirs (30%, 35%) is not a matter of identifying different factors, but rather a slight disagreement on the weighting of those factors—specifically, how likely the Geneva talks are to produce a breakthrough sufficient to warrant a leader-to-leader call.",
    "rationale": "After reviewing my peers' analyses, I am maintaining my forecast of 25%. Their reasoning has reinforced my view of the key variables at play but has not convinced me that the probability is higher than I initially estimated. While I agree that the Geneva talks are a critical inflection point, I believe a 25% probability appropriately balances the potential for a positive surprise against the significant diplomatic inertia and mutual distrust. The pattern of China publicly denying President Trump's claims of phone calls is significant, suggesting Beijing will only acknowledge a call that serves a major strategic purpose, such as cementing a concrete trade deal. This makes the outcome highly contingent on a 'breakthrough' in Geneva, not just 'constructive talks.' My 25% forecast already assigns a meaningful, roughly one-in-four chance, to the entire causal chain: a breakthrough in Geneva occurs, this breakthrough necessitates a leader-level call, and both sides publicly acknowledge it before June 15. I find this to be a realistic but not overly optimistic assessment, especially considering the current geopolitical environment, including Xi Jinping's concurrent meetings in Moscow. The slightly higher forecasts from my colleagues seem to place more weight on the possibility of a breakthrough, a judgment call on which I remain slightly more conservative.",
