    "review": "The other forecasters raised several important points I hadn't fully considered. Forecaster 2 provides crucial specific information about 'I Had Some Help' with Morgan Wallen being a commercial behemoth and notes that 'Music Event of the Year' frequently honors high-profile collaborations - this category-specific insight strengthens the case considerably. The collaboration with Wallen, a major country star, adds more legitimacy than I initially weighted. Forecaster 3's explicit discussion of correlation risk is well-taken - if voters lean traditionalist, Post Malone could lose across all categories, which reduces the naive mathematical probability. Both forecasters emphasize that ACMs historically reward commercially dominant records, which supports a higher probability. The forecasts cluster tightly (62-70%), suggesting convergence on a probable range. My initial 65% was in the middle of this range, but I now believe the specific collaboration details and commercial dominance warrant a modest upward adjustment.",
    "rationale": "After reviewing the other analyses, I'm updating my forecast slightly upward. The key new information is the specific collaboration with Morgan Wallen on 'I Had Some Help' and its massive commercial success. This strengthens the probability in two ways: (1) Morgan Wallen's involvement adds significant legitimacy within the country music establishment, and (2) the 'Music Event of the Year' category specifically favors high-profile collaborations, giving Post Malone a particularly strong shot in at least one category. The commercial dominance mentioned by Forecaster 2 combined with ACMs' track record of rewarding big hits suggests the Academy is commercially-minded rather than purely traditionalist. However, Forecaster 3's correlation risk argument prevents me from going as high as 70% - if there's voter resistance to crossover artists, that sentiment could affect multiple categories simultaneously. The specific competition in each category remains uncertain. Balancing the stronger-than-initially-assessed collaboration advantage against correlation risk and competitive uncertainty, I'm moving from 65% to 67%.",
