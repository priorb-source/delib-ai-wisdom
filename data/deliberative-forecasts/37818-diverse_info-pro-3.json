    "review": "The other forecasters and I align on the core difficulties for a 'Yes' outcome: the small number of monthly pilot reports makes the outcome highly variable, and the 'tie resolves as No' rule creates a significant hurdle. Forecaster 2 introduced a crucial point I had not fully weighed: the emergence of Arizona and other Southwestern states as hotspots in separate government UAP datasets. While not the resolution source, this suggests a wider field of strong contenders beyond just California, which further increases the likelihood of a tie or a non-Florida winner. This is a very convincing argument. Forecaster 3's analysis anchors on a recent military incident to justify a higher probability; however, they seem to have mistakenly placed this incident in Florida when the provided research states it occurred in California. This factual error undermines their justification for a higher forecast.",
    "rationale": "I am lowering my forecast from 25% to 20%. The primary driver for this change is the reasoning provided by Forecaster 2. My initial analysis framed this primarily as a contest between Florida and California. Forecaster 2's argument that other states, particularly Arizona, are also very strong contenders based on recent military/government UAP activity broadens the competitive landscape. With a larger pool of plausible winners (CA, FL, AZ, TX), the probability of any single state achieving a *unique* lead decreases. This heightened competition makes a tie, which resolves as 'No', even more likely. The flawed reasoning from Forecaster 3, who based their higher confidence on a misattributed incident, further reinforces my view that a forecast in the high 20s is too optimistic. The 5-point reduction reflects the increased difficulty for Florida in a more competitive environment than I had initially modeled.",
