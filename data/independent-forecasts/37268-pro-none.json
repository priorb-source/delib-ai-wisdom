    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Less than 2 months (today is May 3, 2025; the deadline is July 1, 2025).",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No. Muqtada al-Sadr's movement is currently boycotting the political process, and the status quo is that this boycott will continue through the deadline without an announcement of participation.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Muqtada al-Sadr maintains his position that the Iraqi political system is too corrupt for his movement to participate in. He continues to exert influence through extra-parliamentary means, such as sermons and social mobilization. No significant political shifts occur that would compel him to reverse his stance, and the July 1, 2025 deadline passes without any announcement of participation.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Faced with the prospect of his rivals in the Coordination Framework further consolidating power, or in response to a major political crisis, al-Sadr makes a tactical reversal. He frames his return to electoral politics as a necessary move to 'save the nation' or achieve reforms from within, energizing his base for a major electoral push. An official announcement is made by a representative of his movement before the July 1, 2025 deadline.",
    "rationale": "My forecast is heavily weighted towards the status quo. Muqtada al-Sadr has been consistent in his boycott of the formal political process since ordering his 73 MPs to resign in 2022. As recently as February 2024, reports indicated he reaffirmed this boycott, rejecting pleas from the Iraqi President. This public and sustained stance makes a reversal difficult without him appearing inconsistent. The deadline of July 1, 2025 is very close, leaving a short window for the kind of significant political developments that might trigger such a major change in strategy. The path of least resistance and greatest consistency for him is to continue the boycott.\n\nHowever, my forecast is not lower than 15% because al-Sadr is notoriously unpredictable and has a history of dramatic political U-turns. He is a pragmatic leader who may calculate that allowing his rivals, particularly the Iran-aligned Coordination Framework, to dominate parliament for another term is a greater long-term risk than compromising on his boycott. A sufficiently enticing political deal or a severe national crisis could provide him with the justification needed to reverse his position.\n\nMy forecast is not higher than 15% because the evidence for the boycott is strong, recent, and public. Reversing such a firm position in less than two months would require an extraordinary catalyst, and there are currently no clear signs of one emerging. \n\nI would increase my forecast if there were credible reports of high-level negotiations between the Sadrists and other political blocs. I would decrease it if al-Sadr or his office issues another statement in the coming weeks explicitly reaffirming the election boycott.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nBefore July 1, 2025, will Muqtada al-Sadr's Alliance Towards Reforms party announce that it will participate in the 2025 Iraqi parliamentary election?\n\nQuestion background:\nbasnews: [Sadr Rejects Iraqi President’s Plea, Reaffirms Election Boycott](https://www.basnews.com/en/babat/881132)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if, before July 1, 2025, the Alliance Towards Reforms announces that it will field candidates in Iraq's [2025 parliamentary elections](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2025_Iraqi_parliamentary_election).\n\n\"Alliance Towards Reforms\" refers to the \"**تحالف سائرون للإصلا**ح\" or \"سائرون\" coalition, party or movement headed by Muqtada al-Sadr, as decribed at [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alliance_Towards_Reforms). Name changes will not affect resolution.\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nNo additional information available.\n\nToday is 2025-05-03.\n\nBefore answering you think:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n(e) You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
