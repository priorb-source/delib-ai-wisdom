  "information": "The US government documented 757 UFO sightings between May 2023 and June 2024. A notable concentration of these incidents occurred in Arizona, which has become a hotspot for sightings, particularly involving military aircraft. On January 19, 2023, a US Air Force F-16 fighter jet was hit by an object described as an 'orange-white uncrewed aerial system' over Arizona, damaging the plane's canopy. This was one of 22 UFO sightings reported by Air Force pilots between October 2022 and June 2023. Some US officials have suggested that the mysterious objects could be advanced drones used by foreign drug cartels for surveillance and smuggling operations.\n\nAccording to news reports, Florida ranks among the top three US states for total UFO sightings, with 8,623 reported cases documented by the National UFO Reporting Center (NUFORC). On March 28, 2025, a US military aircraft encountered a large group of unidentified objects described as glowing spheres in the sky over Florida. A leaked audio recording of the pilot's radio conversation with an air traffic controller indicated the pilot saw several high-speed objects, experienced communication disruptions, and observed an unusual glow around the plane. A Lockheed AC-130 Spectre gunship was reportedly dispatched to the area in response to the incident.\n\nData from the National UFO Reporting Center (NUFORC) indicates that California has the most reported UFO sightings in the US, with 36,286 sightings since 1974. Following California in total sightings are Washington, Florida, Oregon, and New York. NUFORC's public archive shows approximately 100-150 pilot-flagged reports are logged nationwide in a typical year, which averages 8-12 per month. The distribution of these pilot reports is skewed, with California and Florida being the two most common states for such reports, followed by a tier including Arizona, Texas, and Washington. In March 2025, a US Air Force pilot in California reported seeing 'three orange-like lights' hovering above Los Angeles.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Effectively now for March 2025 (NUFORC’s March page should already be posted). Note: the provided resolution text mentions June 2025 checked on/after 2025-07-01; if that is the intended month, time left is ~6 weeks from today (2025-05-21).",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No — California typically leads monthly pilot-flagged NUFORC reports, and ties resolve as No.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "California logs 2 pilot-flagged reports in March 2025 while Florida logs 1; or Florida ties with California/another state; or the Florida March 28 incident is not posted to NUFORC as a pilot report (e.g., retained within military channels or categorized as offshore/unknown location).",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Multiple Florida pilots/crews file NUFORC reports tied to the March 28 event (e.g., the intercepting aircraft and/or other aircrews), giving Florida 2–3 pilot-flagged reports, while other states each have fewer and no ties occur.",
    "rationale": "Base rate: NUFORC logs ~100–150 pilot-flagged reports per year (~8–12/month). Distribution is skewed: California and Florida are the two most common states for pilot reports, followed by a tier including Arizona, Texas, and Washington. With ties resolving to No, Florida must strictly exceed every other state in March. Status quo favors California leading in a given month, making No the default. March 2025 specifics: The assistant’s research notes at least one Florida military encounter on March 28 (glowing spheres, comms disruptions, AC-130 dispatched) and at least one California pilot report over Los Angeles. The Florida event could plausibly generate multiple pilot-flagged reports if more than one crew reported to NUFORC. However, many military events never appear in NUFORC (they may remain in military/AARO channels), and even if reported, a single high-profile incident may yield only one NUFORC entry. Moreover, ocean-adjacent events might be logged as offshore or with ambiguous location, potentially reducing Florida’s count. Given base rates and tie-breaker rules, Florida being the unique top state in any given month is plausible but not the most likely outcome. I give Florida an elevated but still sub-50% chance due to the high-profile March 28 Florida event, while discounting for the possibility it is not captured as a NUFORC pilot report and for California’s strong baseline. What would move me up: Evidence NUFORC posted multiple Florida pilot-flagged March 2025 entries (e.g., separate reports from different aircrews), or confirmation that the March 28 event produced several independent NUFORC pilot submissions. What would move me down: Confirmation the March 28 incident did not appear in NUFORC as a pilot report, or evidence California (or another state) logged multiple pilot-flagged reports in March, or any tie involving Florida.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill Florida have the most pilot sightings of UFOs of any US state in March 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nAccording to the [National UFO Reporting Center](https://nuforc.org/about-us/): \"The National UFO Reporting Center was founded in 1974 by noted UFO investigator Robert J. Gribble. The Center’s primary function over the past five decades has been to receive, record, and to the greatest degree possible, corroborate and document reports from individuals who have been witness to unusual, possibly UFO-related events. Throughout its history, the Center has processed over 180,000 reports, and has distributed its information to thousands of individuals.\"\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if The National UFO Reporting Center posts more pilot reports of a UFO/UAP having occurred in the state of Florida than any other state, for the month of June 2025 at [this link](https://nuforc.org/subndx/?id=x) when accessed by Metaculus on or after July 1, 2025.\n\nIf Florida is tied with another state, resolves as No.\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nThe US government documented 757 UFO sightings between May 2023 and June 2024.

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
