  "information": "According to data from the Federal Reserve Economic Data (FRED), the inventory of new single-family homes for sale in the United States stood at 503,000 units in March 2025, an increase from 500,000 in February 2025. This level represents a multi-year high since November 2007. Historically, the number of new one-family homes for sale has only exceeded 550,000 during the 2006-2007 housing market peak, when levels reached between 570,000 and 580,000 units.\n\nData from the U.S. Census Bureau and the Department of Housing and Urban Development for March 2025 showed that new single-family home sales reached a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 724,000, which is up 6% year-over-year. The median sales price of new homes sold was $403,600, a decrease of 7.5% from the same period in the previous year. According to Freddie Mac, the 30-year fixed mortgage rate averaged 6.65% in March 2025 and rose to 6.83% in April 2025.\n\nAccording to the US Census Bureau, housing starts declined by 14.2% month-over-month in March 2025 to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 940,000 units. In the same month, building permits for single-family homes decreased by 2% month-over-month. Builder confidence, as measured by the NAHB Housing Market Index (HMI), was reported to be around 42.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Approximately 5-6 weeks. FRED typically publishes monthly housing data with about a one-month lag, so May 2025 data should be available in mid-to-late June 2025.",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No - the question will NOT resolve as Yes. The current inventory level of 503,000 units in March 2025 would need to grow by 47,000 units over approximately 2 months to exceed 550,000 in May. Based on the recent growth rate of 3,000 units from February to March, the status quo trajectory would put May inventory around 509,000-512,000 units, falling short of the 550,000 threshold.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Inventory continues growing at the current modest pace of 3,000-5,000 units per month, reaching approximately 509,000-515,000 by May 2025. This steady growth reflects continued builder completions being absorbed by moderate sales activity (currently at 724,000 annual rate). Alternatively, if the slight uptick in mortgage rates dampens inventory accumulation or if sales remain robust, inventory growth could plateau or even decline, keeping levels well below 550,000.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Inventory growth accelerates dramatically to approximately 23,500 units per month - roughly 8 times the current rate. This could occur if: (1) a sudden demand shock freezes the market as mortgage rates spike further, causing completed homes to pile up unsold; (2) builders rush to complete projects despite weak builder confidence, flooding the market; or (3) economic conditions deteriorate rapidly, causing buyers to withdraw while the supply pipeline continues flowing from previous construction activity.",
    "rationale": "The current inventory of 503,000 units in March 2025 represents a significant multi-year high, but reaching 550,000 by May would require an unprecedented acceleration. The recent growth rate of just 3,000 units from February to March is far too modest - we would need roughly 8 times that rate sustained over two months. Several indicators suggest this acceleration is unlikely: housing starts declined 14.2% in March, building permits decreased 2%, and builder confidence remains weak at 42 on the HMI. Most importantly, new home sales remain relatively healthy at 724,000 annual rate (up 6% YoY), indicating decent demand absorption that would prevent inventory from surging. The historical context is also telling - inventory has only exceeded 550,000 during the 2006-2007 housing bubble peak. The modest mortgage rate increase from 6.65% to 6.83% could slow demand slightly but is unlikely to cause a market freeze. For my forecast to be higher, I would need evidence of: collapsing sales, surging completions despite declining starts, or a major demand shock. For it to be lower, I would need more confidence that the current growth rate is entirely stable. Given housing market volatility and elevated inventory levels already at 18-year highs, I maintain some probability of an unexpected surge, but the weight of evidence strongly suggests May inventory will fall short of 550,000.",
