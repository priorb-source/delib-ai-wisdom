  "information": "The composition of the Cornwall Council prior to the 2025 election consisted of 44 seats for the Conservatives, 13 for the Liberal Democrats, 4 for Labour, 1 for Reform UK, and 1 for the Greens, with the remainder held by others or independents. This represents a 31-seat lead for the Conservatives over the Liberal Democrats. Historically, the Liberal Democrats have never been the largest party on the Cornwall Council.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Approximately 10 days. The 2025 Cornwall Council election is scheduled for May 1, 2025, with results typically known within 24-48 hours of polling closing.",
    "status_quo_outcome": "The Conservatives remain the largest party on Cornwall Council, maintaining their current dominance with the most seats.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "The Conservatives retain their position as the largest party despite potentially losing some seats. Even if the Liberal Democrats make gains, they fail to overcome the 31-seat deficit. Alternatively, a surge by Independents or another party prevents the Lib Dems from winning the most seats.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "An unprecedented electoral swing occurs where the Liberal Democrats gain approximately 16+ seats net while the Conservatives lose a similar number, driven by factors such as extreme national Conservative unpopularity, highly effective local Liberal Democrat campaigning, tactical voting coordination, and strong local issues favoring the Lib Dems.",
    "rationale": "The research assistant's report reveals a substantial 31-seat Conservative lead over the Liberal Democrats (44 vs 13 seats), and crucially notes that the Liberal Democrats have never been the largest party on Cornwall Council historically. For the Lib Dems to win the most seats, they would need to overcome this deficit in a single election cycle, requiring a net swing of at least 16 seats - an extraordinarily rare occurrence in local elections. While UK local elections have produced surprises, and the Liberal Democrats have historically performed well in certain local contexts, a reversal of this magnitude would be unprecedented for Cornwall. National factors like Conservative unpopularity could help the Liberal Democrats, but translating that into a 31-seat reversal in a single election is exceptionally unlikely. The forecast is not lower (say, 1%) because wave elections can occasionally produce shocking results, and we lack current polling data that might confirm the status quo is stable. The forecast is not higher (say, 10%) because the historical precedent is unequivocal, the deficit is massive, and there's no evidence presented of the kind of groundswell support that would be necessary for such a dramatic shift. To revise upward, I would need to see recent polling showing the Lib Dems within striking distance, evidence of a major scandal affecting Conservatives locally, or data showing exceptional Lib Dem ground campaign effectiveness. To revise downward, confirmation that the Conservative vote remains solid would suffice.",
