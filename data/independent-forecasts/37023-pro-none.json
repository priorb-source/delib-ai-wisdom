    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Less than one month",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Inflation data for April, released in early May, comes in higher than expected, reinforcing consumer concerns about the cost of living and the potential for further Federal Reserve interest rate hikes. This, combined with stagnant wage growth or a slight rise in gasoline prices, keeps consumer sentiment depressed at or below the historically low April level.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "The May report shows a modest rebound from the extreme pessimism of April. This is driven by slightly better-than-expected inflation data and a stable labor market, leading consumers to feel marginally less pessimistic about their financial outlook. The number only needs to increase by 0.1 to resolve as Yes, and even a minor improvement in the news cycle could be sufficient to cause this small bounce.",
    "rationale": "The forecast hinges on the tension between the powerful inertia of the current negative economic sentiment and the statistical principle of mean reversion from an extreme low point. The April 2025 reading of 50.8 is the second-lowest on record, indicating a deeply pessimistic consumer base likely concerned with persistent inflation and high interest rates. The status quo, where these conditions persist, would lead to a 'No' outcome, and this is a significant possibility as economic fundamentals change slowly. However, extreme data points like this are often followed by a reversion toward the mean. The threshold for a 'Yes' outcome is exceptionally low; any reading above 50.8, even 50.9, will suffice. It is statistically more probable to see a small bounce from such a low floor than to see a further decline or perfect stagnation. This forecast gives a slight edge to a modest rebound. My probability is not higher because the underlying negative economic drivers remain firmly in place, and a significant turnaround is unlikely in just one month. My probability is not lower because betting on a historic low to worsen or hold steady is a strong claim against the tendency for volatile sentiment indicators to mean-revert. I would increase the probability with a surprisingly positive CPI report or a sharp drop in gas prices before the May survey period. I would decrease the probability if inflation accelerates or jobs data weakens.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill the May 2025 University of Michigan Consumer Sentiment number be greater than it was for April 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nCNN: [US consumer sentiment plummets to second-lowest level on records going back to 1952](https://www.cnn.com/2025/04/11/economy/us-consumer-sentiment-april/index.html)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if the University of Michigan's reported Index of Consumer Sentiment, expected to be located [here](http://www.sca.isr.umich.edu/), is greater than 50.8 for May 2025. Less than or equal to that amount resolves the question as **No**.\n\nPreliminary results are sufficient to resolve the question. If there is any confusion about the number, Metaculus will resolve based on whatever number is posted at [this pdf](http://www.sca.isr.umich.edu/files/tbcics.pdf) that is labelled as May 2025, including preliminary. For example, on April 11, 2025 the number displayed was 50.8 for April 2025 (P).\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nNo additional information available.\n\nToday is 2025-04-22.\n\nBefore answering you think:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n(e) You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
