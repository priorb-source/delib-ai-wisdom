    "review": "Forecaster 3 raises an important empirical claim that I hadn't fully weighted: that small-scope FSIS allergen/misbranding recalls 'tend to be closed within 1-3 months.' If accurate, this base rate would significantly favor a Yes outcome given we're at day 74 of approximately 97 days total. However, this claim lacks cited evidence, and critically, the recall remains Active despite being 2.5 months post-issuance. Forecaster 2's emphasis on bureaucratic inertia aligns with my original thinking but may be overly pessimistic given the specific characteristics of this recall. The key tension is between the theoretical base rate (favoring closure) and the observed current status (Active after 74 days). Forecaster 3's optimism would be more justified if we had evidence the recall was entering final verification stages, but we lack such information. The fact that it's still Active at day 74 suggests either: (a) this recall is taking longer than typical, (b) the '1-3 month' base rate claim is overstated, or (c) we're approaching closure in the final weeks. All three forecasters agree on the favorable factors (limited scope, short shelf-life, vending machine distribution), but disagree on how much weight to give bureaucratic lag versus base rates.",
    "rationale": "After reviewing both analyses, I'm updating my forecast upward but remaining more conservative than Forecaster 3. The critical insight is that we're now 74 days post-recall with only 24 days remaining. If similar recalls typically close within 60-100 days, we're in a plausible closure window. The limited distribution and expired shelf-life of ready-to-eat wraps are genuinely favorable factors I may have underweighted. However, the current Active status is concrete observed data that tempers optimism. If the recall were on track for typical closure, we might expect to see it closed by now or very soon. The remaining 24 days represents roughly 25% of the total window, which is tight but not impossible for final verification steps. I'm increasing my probability to account for: (1) the plausible base rate argument for 60-100 day closures, (2) the genuinely limited scope making closure more feasible, and (3) the substantial elapsed time. I'm not going as high as 76% because: (1) the Active status after 74 days is a concerning signal, (2) 24 days is a short window for government processes, and (3) status quo bias favors No. A forecast around 45% balances these considerations.",
