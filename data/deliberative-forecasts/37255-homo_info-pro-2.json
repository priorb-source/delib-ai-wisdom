    "review": "The deliberation strongly reinforced the initial consensus that a 'No' outcome is overwhelmingly likely. Both other forecasters and I identified Libya's deep political fragmentation and the extremely short timeline as the primary drivers. Two new and compelling arguments strengthened this view. Forecaster 2 highlighted that ongoing trade negotiations with Turkey are a significant distraction, consuming the limited political and bureaucratic capital available. Forecaster 3 convincingly argued that Libya's nearly six-year inaction since signing the agreement demonstrates a profound lack of political will, and that long implementation timelines across the continent reduce any external pressure on Libya to ratify urgently. These points effectively diminish the already small probability of a surprise Yes outcome.",
    "rationale": "I am updating my forecast downward based on the strong arguments presented by the other forecasters. I initially estimated a 5% probability, focusing primarily on the general political paralysis in Libya. The other experts introduced specific evidence that I had not fully weighed. Forecaster 2's point about the Turkish trade deal provides a concrete example of where Libyan political attention is currently directed, making a pivot to AfCFTA less likely. Forecaster 3's points about the long history of inaction (signing in 2019 with no progress) and the lack of external pressure due to slow continent-wide implementation are particularly persuasive. Together, these arguments paint a picture of an issue that is not only stalled by institutional disfunction but is also simply not a priority. The combination of these factors makes the path to ratification in the next two months even more improbable than I had initially assessed. Therefore, I am lowering my forecast from 5% to 3% to reflect a more robust understanding of the barriers in place.",
