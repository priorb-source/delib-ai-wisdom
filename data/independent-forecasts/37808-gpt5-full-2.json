  "information": "The U.S. Department of State released the results for the Diversity Visa Program (DV-2026) lottery in early May 2025. Applicants can check their status online through the Entrant Status Check page until September 30, 2026. This followed the release of the DV-2025 results on May 3, 2025. The registration period for the DV-2026 lottery ran from October to November 2024. The program awards up to 55,000 permanent residence visas annually. The State Department has emphasized that the official website, dvprogram.state.gov, is the only channel for results.\n\nThe Diversity Visa program was established by the Immigration Act of 1990. The Trump administration, which began in January 2025, has previously expressed opposition to the program. The administration issued executive orders in January 2025 concerning Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion (DEI) related websites across federal agencies. In April 2025, a bill was introduced in the House of Representatives with the goal of terminating the statutory DV program.\n\nIn May 2025, the US Department of State imposed visa restrictions on Indian travel agency executives and staff who were found to have knowingly enabled unlawful entry into the US. In a separate action, the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) announced the termination of Temporary Protected Status (TPS) for Afghanistan, scheduled to take effect on July 14, 2025. Concurrently, a federal court issued a preliminary injunction that blocked a DHS attempt to terminate TPS for Venezuelan nationals.",

    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "About 42 days (until July 1, 2025)",
    "status_quo_outcome": "Yes",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "The State Department removes or restructures the DV entry pages before July 1, 2025 (e.g., deprecates the specific URL, replaces it with a generic visas page, or the content no longer provides registration instructions), or an unusual website outage/redirect prevents access at that location when checked.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "The existing Step 1 “Submit an Entry” page remains at the same URL, continuing to host the standard instructions for DV registration (even though the entry period is closed until the fall), as has been typical between application windows.",
    "rationale": "- Status quo and inertia: The DV program is active and mid-cycle. DV‑2026 registration closed months ago, and results were released in early May 2025, indicating normal operations. Historically, the Step 1 page remains online year‑round with instructions, noting when the entry period is closed. Federal sites, especially travel.state.gov, tend to keep stable URLs for core processes.\n- Legislative/administrative risk appears low on this timeframe: Although the administration opposes DV and a House bill was introduced in April 2025 to terminate it, ending a statutory program requires Congress. Passage, enactment, and web changes before July 1 are unlikely. Even if the program were terminated, agencies often retain or revise pages rather than immediately removing them.\n- Research assistant highlights: DV‑2026 results posted in May 2025; Entrant Status Check open through 2026; only official results site is dvprogram.state.gov. Mentions executive orders on DEI‑related websites and a bill to end DV—these signal intent but not immediate operational change. Other immigration actions (TPS decisions, targeted visa restrictions) are not directly relevant to the DV webpage’s availability.\n- Why not higher: Small risk of State Department web reorganization or a path/slug change that breaks the exact URL; possibility the page is replaced with a notice lacking “instructions for registering,” depending on how strictly the criterion is interpreted; low‑probability outages or access issues at the time of checking.\n- Why not lower: Short horizon (≈6 weeks), strong institutional inertia, and ongoing DV processing make sudden removal unlikely. Even policy changes usually lag and preserve archival guidance.\n- What would move me: Upward—explicit confirmation from State maintaining the current URL structure; evidence of content updates at that URL after mid‑June. Downward—real movement in Congress toward DV repeal with administration implementation guidance to pull pages; a visible travel.state.gov site redesign that alters DV paths; or a notice that consolidates DV content to a different location before July 1.",

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
