    "review": "Forecaster 2's analysis is unconvincing because it rests on a flawed premise. They argue that a Q1 earnings report will almost certainly trigger a news post, basing this on a general expectation for public companies. However, this ignores the most critical piece of specific evidence from the research assistant: Virgin Galactic's Q4 2024 earnings release was *not* posted on the main News page. This recent, specific precedent for this exact type of event invalidates Forecaster 2's core argument. Forecaster 3's analysis, in contrast, is excellent and aligns closely with my own. They correctly identify the key variables: the current 3-month posting hiatus, the operational pause for the Delta-class development, and the crucial precedent of the Q4 earnings not being posted to the News page. Their reasoning is sound, and our initial forecasts were only 10 percentage points apart, indicating we are weighing the same evidence in a similar manner.",
    "rationale": "My core analysis remains unchanged. The strongest evidence points towards a 'Yes' resolution. The company is in a multi-month period of silence on its News page, which is consistent with its operational hiatus while it develops the Delta-class fleet. Most importantly, the most predictable catalyst for a news post in May—the Q1 2025 earnings release scheduled for May 15—is highly unlikely to appear on this specific page. The direct precedent from the Q4 2024 financial results, which were distributed via Investor Relations and not the main News page, is the deciding factor that neutralizes this potential 'No' trigger. However, the deliberation has caused me to moderate my confidence slightly. Forecaster 3's probability of 75% serves as a useful check on my initial 85%. While I believe the Q4 precedent is a very strong signal, it is only a single data point. Corporate communication strategies can change, and there remains a non-trivial chance of an unrelated announcement regarding the final VSS Unity flight or a Delta-class development milestone. To better account for this residual uncertainty, I am reducing my forecast slightly.",
