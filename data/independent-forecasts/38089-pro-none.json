    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "About one month.",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No. Based on Morning Consult's latest available data from late May 2025, President Erdoğan's approval rating is approximately 47%, while Prime Minister Sánchez's is approximately 36%. Therefore, if nothing changes, Sánchez's rating will be lower than Erdoğan's.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Political and economic trends in both Spain and Turkey continue on their current trajectory. Sánchez's approval rating remains in the mid-to-high 30s due to persistent political polarization and challenges within his governing coalition. Erdoğan's approval, despite economic pressures, remains resilient in the mid-40s, buoyed by his core base of support. As a result, on July 1, 2025, Erdoğan's approval rating is higher than Sánchez's.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "A significant event or combination of events shifts public opinion in the next month. For example, Turkey suffers a sudden economic shock, such as a currency crisis, which causes Erdoğan's approval to drop sharply below 40%. Concurrently, Sánchez presides over a widely celebrated policy success or a notable diplomatic achievement, boosting his approval rating past Erdoğan's by the resolution date.",
    "rationale": "My forecast is primarily based on the large existing gap in approval ratings and the short time remaining until resolution. According to the latest Morning Consult data, Erdoğan has a substantial lead of approximately 11 percentage points over Sánchez. Public approval ratings for national leaders tend to exhibit significant inertia and do not typically swing by such a large margin in a single month without a major catalyst. \n\nFor Sánchez, his approval has been relatively stable, constrained by a highly polarized political landscape in Spain and the complexities of managing a minority coalition government. It is difficult to envision a scenario in the next month that would generate the kind of strong, broad-based support needed for a double-digit surge in his approval. \n\nFor Erdoğan, while he faces significant economic headwinds, particularly high inflation, his approval has proven resilient. He maintains a solid political base and has weathered numerous political and economic storms. While a drop is possible, a collapse of over 11 points (relative to Sánchez) in just one month seems unlikely.\n\nThe probability is not lower than 15% because Turkey's economic situation is volatile, and a sudden crisis that damages Erdoğan's standing is a tangible possibility. A 'black swan' event could rapidly change the calculus. The probability is not higher because the starting gap is very large, and the baseline expectation is for the status quo to persist over such a short timeframe. \n\nI would increase my forecast for a 'Yes' outcome if we see concrete signs of a sharp economic downturn in Turkey or a major, unifying political victory for Sánchez's government in Spain. Conversely, I would lower it if the Spanish government faces a significant new crisis or if Turkish economic indicators show unexpected improvement.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill Spanish Prime Minister Pedro Sánchez have a higher approval rating than Turkey's President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan on July 1, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nResolution source updates monthly. According to Morning Consult for January 2025: \"The latest approval ratings are based on data collected from Jan. 21-27, 2025. Ratings reflect a trailing seven-day simple moving average of views among adults in each country surveyed.\"\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if Pedro Sánchez has a higher approval rating than Recep Tayyip Erdoğan according to [Morning Consult](https://pro.morningconsult.com/trackers/global-leader-approval) when checked by Metaculus on or after July 1, 2025. If this not the case (including due to a tie), this resolves as **No**.\n\n\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nNo additional information available.\n\nToday is 2025-05-29.\n\nBefore answering you think:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n(e) You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
