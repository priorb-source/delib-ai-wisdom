  "information": "According to NOAA data cited in reports, the warmest May on record was in 2020 with a temperature anomaly of +0.95°C versus the 1901-2000 mean, followed by 2016 at +0.93°C. For the current year, preliminary data showed January 2025 was the hottest January on record, March 2025 ranked first or tied for first, and April 2025 ranked as the second warmest. The first three months of 2025 were the second-warmest first quarter recorded. The strong El Niño event that persisted from May 2023 to April 2024 has transitioned to a neutral ENSO (El Niño–Southern Oscillation) state.\n\nSeveral regional weather events were reported globally during May 2025. In Ahmedabad, India, the month was one of the coolest in recent years, with an average maximum temperature 3.3 degrees Celsius below normal due to record rainfall. In contrast, Europe experienced several heat events. On May 1, the UK recorded its warmest start to May on record with temperatures reaching 28°C. Scotland saw its hottest day of the year so far on May 13, reaching 25.4°C. On May 30, a heatwave in Brittany, France broke local heat records for May, reaching 31.1°C in La Noë-Blanche. In the United States, International Falls, Minnesota, recorded temperatures around +32°C in early May.\n\nThe U.S. National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's (NOAA) Climate Prediction Center released an outlook stating that the summer of 2025 was expected to be 'overwhelmingly above normal' across the United States. The forecast indicated that nearly all states were favored to see a warmer-than-average summer, with the highest probabilities for extreme heat in the West and Southwest. The outlook also noted an increased risk of drought and wildfires. Separately, Roman Vilfand, the scientific director of the Russian Hydrometeorological Center, stated that preliminary forecasts suggested 2025 could rank among the top three or five hottest years on record.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Approximately 2 weeks. NOAA typically releases its monthly global temperature reports around mid-month for the previous month, so official May 2025 data should be published around mid-June 2025.",
    "status_quo_outcome": "May 2025 ranks among the top 3-5 warmest Mays on record but does not exceed the May 2020 record of +0.95°C anomaly above the 1901-2000 mean.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "May 2025 is very warm but falls short of the May 2020 record. The transition from El Niño to neutral ENSO conditions moderates global temperatures enough that the anomaly stays below +0.95°C. While some regions experienced heat events, these are balanced by cooling events like those in India, and the global average remains under the 2020 threshold.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "May 2025 achieves a temperature anomaly exceeding +0.95°C, breaking the 2020 record. The warming momentum from the record-breaking January and near-record March continues through May. Heat events in Europe, the United States, and other regions are sufficiently widespread globally to push the monthly average above the 2020 record, with background climate warming providing additional boost.",
    "rationale": "Several factors point to May 2025 being very warm but create uncertainty about whether it will break the specific 2020 record. Supporting evidence for high warmth includes: January 2025 was the hottest January on record, March tied for first place, and multiple regional heat events occurred in Europe and the US during May. Additionally, forecasts suggest 2025 will rank among the hottest years on record. However, critical moderating factors include: April 2025 ranked only as the second warmest April (not first), suggesting the peak warming earlier in the year may have moderated. Most importantly, ENSO has transitioned from El Niño to neutral state. El Niño conditions typically boost global temperatures significantly, and their absence makes breaking records more difficult. The May 2020 record was set during favorable ENSO conditions. Regional cooling events, such as Ahmedabad, India experiencing one of its coolest Mays in recent years with temperatures 3.3°C below normal, indicate that warmth is not uniform globally. The lack of preliminary May 2025 anomaly data in the research report prevents direct comparison to the +0.95°C threshold. Applying status quo bias, which good forecasters emphasize, the world changes slowly. While 2025 has been exceptionally warm, the April moderation and ENSO transition suggest May is more likely to be very warm (top 3-5) rather than record-breaking. For my forecast to increase, I would need preliminary data showing May 2025 anomalies approaching or exceeding +0.95°C, or evidence of more extensive global heat coverage than reported regional events suggest. For my forecast to decrease, I would need confirmation of more widespread cooling events or preliminary data showing May well below the 2020 record. Balancing these factors, I estimate roughly a one-in-three chance of breaking the specific May 2020 record.",
