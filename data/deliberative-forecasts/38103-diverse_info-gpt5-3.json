    "review": "Both forecasters make solid points about policy inertia, the short timeline, and the broader ‘buy-Canadian’ context, which all support continuity. Forecaster 2 adds market/brand dynamics (Tesla’s weakening consideration and registrations, protests) that marginally reduce political pressure to reverse course. Forecaster 3 cites parallel actions (e.g., liquor policy) reinforcing the government’s stance. However, neither explicitly engages with the resolution quirk: the question resolves Yes only if that specific BC Hydro page still explicitly names Tesla as ineligible. Even if the policy remains, a shift to brand-neutral wording or a page restructure could yield a No. Their arguments thus overstate the link between policy persistence and the scoring criterion.",
    "rationale": "Baseline: The policy is very likely to persist through early July; reversal odds look low over a ~1-month window. Premier and ministerial signaling has been firm, and the exclusion is framed within a wider trade stance. That supports a high likelihood that Tesla remains ineligible. Resolution risk: The key risk is communications, not policy. A change to generic language (e.g., “U.S.-produced goods are excluded”) or moving details into an external eligibility list without an explicit “Tesla is ineligible” mention would resolve this question as No, even if nothing changes substantively. Against that, the page was recently updated to name Tesla and, given customer confusion risk, BC Hydro has reason to keep the explicit callout at least through the summer. Updated view: I slightly raise my forecast from 75% to 80% on the basis of the short horizon and typical web-content inertia. I do not go as high as 87–97% because the explicit-mention requirement introduces a meaningful communications-risk tail (page rewrite, consolidation, or legal/comms preference for brand-neutral phrasing). Triggers to move higher: a June update that still names Tesla. Triggers to move lower: a site refresh trending to generic origin-based language or moving details into a brand-agnostic eligible list.",
