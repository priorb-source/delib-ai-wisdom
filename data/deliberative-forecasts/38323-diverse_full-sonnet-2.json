    "review": "Both forecasters provide thoughtful analyses that align closely with mine (12% vs 15% and 16%). They raise several important points I should consider more carefully: First, Forecaster 3's observation about post-2020 volatility being higher than the 2010-2019 baseline is valid - using pre-pandemic patterns may underestimate the probability of large swings in the current environment. Second, both forecasters place more weight on the Conference Board divergence as a signal that consumer sentiment may not be uniformly negative, with Forecaster 2 noting that UMich's inflation sensitivity could be causing temporary depression. Third, Forecaster 3's point that 'after sharp declines, partial rebounds are not unusual' highlights a mean-reversion dynamic I underweighted. However, I'm skeptical of moving significantly higher because: (1) we're already four days into June with no major positive catalyst emerging, (2) the fundamental economic data remains quite weak (37k job additions, rising unemployment expectations, elevated inflation expectations), and (3) even with higher post-2020 volatility, an 8-point jump from such depressed levels requires specific positive news that hasn't materialized yet.",
    "rationale": "After reviewing the other analyses, I'm adjusting my forecast modestly upward. The strongest argument for revision is the post-2020 volatility point - sentiment has been more volatile than the 2010-2019 baseline suggests, making large monthly swings somewhat more likely. The Conference Board's sharp May increase (85.7 to 98) also deserves more weight as evidence of potential improvement in consumer mood that UMich may eventually capture. Additionally, the pattern of partial rebounds after sharp declines creates some upside risk. However, I'm not moving to the 15-16% range because the negative fundamentals remain firmly in place: May's anemic 37k job additions suggest labor market weakness is real (not just ADP noise), inflation expectations are at multi-decade highs, and we're four days into June without any clear positive catalyst emerging. The required 7.9+ point jump remains historically rare even in high-volatility periods. My updated forecast of 14% reflects greater acknowledgment of volatility and mean-reversion potential while maintaining that the status quo strongly favors remaining below 60.0.",
