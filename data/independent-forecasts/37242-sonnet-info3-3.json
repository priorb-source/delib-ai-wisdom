  "information": "On April 28, 2025, a massive power outage occurred on the Iberian Peninsula, affecting mainland Spain and Portugal. While the Canary Islands' power grid was not directly hit, the event caused significant disruptions to air travel. Reports indicated that air traffic at major hubs was operating at reduced capacity, leading to widespread flight delays and cancellations. Canary Islands airports experienced knock-on effects, with numerous flights connecting to the mainland being cancelled or delayed. One government official stated that 344 out of 6,000 scheduled flights in Spain were cancelled on that day.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Approximately 5-6 weeks. The April 2025 passenger arrival data is expected to be published in early June 2025, and today is April 30, 2025.",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No - arrivals do not fall. Based on the February 2025 data provided, tourism to the Canary Islands showed year-over-year growth (2,248,198 in Feb 2025 vs 2,199,255 in Feb 2024, an increase of ~2.2%). The baseline expectation is that this growth trend continues.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "April 2025 arrivals equal or exceed April 2024 levels. The power outage on April 28 affected only the final 3 days of the month and caused limited disruptions (344 cancelled flights out of 6,000, or ~5.7%). The first 27 days of April proceeded normally, with tourism continuing its growth trajectory. Any Trump tariff concerns either didn't materialize significantly or had minimal impact on primarily European tourism flows to the Canaries.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "April 2025 arrivals fall below April 2024 levels. Trump administration policies cause a significant drop in US tourist arrivals throughout April. The April 28 power outage had more severe cascading effects than initially reported, causing substantial cancellations and delays in the final days. Additionally, other unreported factors such as economic weakness in European source markets, adverse weather, or regional instability contributed to reduced bookings throughout the month.",
    "rationale": "I assign a low probability to a year-over-year decline based on several factors. First, the timing and scope of the power outage severely limits its impact: occurring on April 28, it affected only the final 3 days of a 30-day month, representing at most 10% of the month's traffic. The outage was centered on mainland Spain with only 'knock-on effects' to the Canaries, suggesting indirect rather than direct disruption. The cancellation rate of ~5.7% on that single day is notable but not catastrophic. Second, the February 2025 data shows continued year-over-year growth, establishing a positive baseline trend. Tourism typically exhibits momentum and doesn't reverse quickly absent major shocks. Third, April is a peak tourism month for the Canaries (Easter holidays, spring break season), suggesting strong underlying demand. The Trump tariff concerns mentioned in the background are uncertain in their materialization and impact. US visitors likely represent a smaller proportion of Canary Islands tourism compared to European sources, limiting the potential effect. For arrivals to fall year-over-year would require the power outage's limited impact plus tariff effects to overcome both the baseline growth trend and 27 days of normal operations. This seems unlikely. My forecast is not higher because: (1) the power outage did occur and could have amplified effects not yet fully reported, (2) Trump policies remain an uncertainty, and (3) I lack complete information about April's daily trends before the outage. My forecast is not lower because the evidence points strongly toward continuation of the growth trend, with only 3 days of potential disruption. To revise upward, I would need evidence of: severe cascading effects from the outage, major US tourism declines, broader European economic weakness, or adverse weather. To revise downward, I would need confirmation of strong bookings throughout April or minimal power outage impacts.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill inbound airline passenger arrivals to the Canary Islands fall in April 2025 compared with April 2024?\n\nQuestion background:\n[Canarias braces for the consequences of Trump's policies on tourism, potentially leading to a decline in tourist arrivals from the US](https://diariodeavisos.elespanol.com/2025/04/turismo-aranceles/)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if the total number of passenger arrivals to the Canary Islands for the month of April 2025, as presented at the [Canary Islands Tourism Research site](https://investigacion.turismodeislascanarias.com/en/inbound-tourism-arrival-passengers/monthly-data), is lower than the total number for April 2024. If the number for April 2025 is greater than or equal to the number for April 2024, the question resolves as **No**.\n\nSpecifically, Metaculus will access \"Passenger arrivals (AENA). April 2025,\" which is expected to be posted in the beginning of June 2025. The numbers considered will be the monthly totals under Canary Islands. For example, in the [February 2025 report](https://investigacion.turismodeislascanarias.com/sites/default/files/2025-03/Promotur_AENA_febrero%202025_EN.pdf), the number shown for February 2025 is 2,248,198 and the number shown for February 2024 is 2,199,255. Thus, if the question had been comparing February 2025 with February 2024, it would have resolved as No, because the number went up.\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nOn April 28, 2025, a massive power outage occurred on the Iberian Peninsula, affecting mainland Spain and Portugal.
