    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "About 8 days (13F due by May 15, 2025)",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Berkshire’s Q1 2025 13F shows only Apple (and possibly Amazon) from the Magnificent 7, with no reported holdings in Alphabet, Meta, Microsoft, Nvidia, or Tesla. Any exploratory buys—if they occurred—remain under SEC confidential treatment and thus are not reported.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "A small new stake initiated by Ted Weschler or Todd Combs in Alphabet or Meta appears on the 13F; less likely, Berkshire discloses a new position in Microsoft (despite Buffett’s historic optics concerns), Nvidia (despite valuation caution), or Tesla (very unlikely).",
    "rationale": "- Timing/base rates: Berkshire’s 13F should post around May 15. Historically, additions to mega-cap tech beyond Apple and a modest Amazon stake have been rare. Buffett has generally avoided Microsoft (optics with Gates), Tesla (valuation/execution risk), and Nvidia (has praised the business but signaled reluctance to bet on AI “arms races”).\n- Recent behavior/cues: Over the past year Berkshire has been a net seller, building a record cash pile and trimming Apple exposure, per public commentary around the annual meeting. That stance makes a fresh, high-profile M7 initiation less likely in Q1. When Berkshire is accumulating a new position, it often requests confidential treatment; if that’s happening, the Q1 13F would likely still mask it, resolving this question as No.\n- Most plausible “Yes”: If any, Alphabet or Meta via Ted/Todd. Buffett has acknowledged past regret not buying Google and the lieutenants have bought growth/tech before (e.g., Amazon, Snowflake). Still, current valuations and Berkshire’s caution argue for a low single-quarter probability.\n- Why not higher: Low base rate of new M7 positions; explicit caution from Buffett; continued net selling/cash buildup; ability to keep any new accumulation confidential, which would not appear on the Q1 13F and thus resolve No.\n- Why not lower: Ted/Todd have discretion and have previously initiated tech positions; Alphabet/Meta remain conceivable fits if seen as durable cash generators at acceptable prices.\n- What would change my view: Credible reporting or hints of a new disclosed position (not under confidentiality), unusual pre-13F disclosures, or Buffett/Ted/Todd remarks indicating a completed buy in one of Alphabet/Meta/Microsoft/Nvidia/Tesla would move me higher. Confirmation they were substantial net sellers with no new positions beyond known names, or news of continued confidential treatment for a large unidentified stake, would move me lower.\n- Research assistant: No additional info available; forecast based on historical behavior and public cues around the May 2025 meeting.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill Berkshire Hathaway reveal a purchase of any Magnificent 7 stock other than Amazon and Apple in its Q1 2025 13F filing?\n\nQuestion background:\nInvestopedia: [Berkshire Hathaway Doesn't Hold Nvidia Stock—Will Warren Buffett Come to Regret it?](https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/warren-buffetts-secret-portfolio-dumping-shares-3-supercharged-artificial-intelligence-ai)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if the 13F filing for Berkshire Hathaway, Inc., filed for the period ending 2025-03-31, reports the company holding shares of Alphabet, Meta Platforms, Microsoft, Nvidia, or Tesla.\n\n\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nNo additional information available.\n\nToday is 2025-05-07.\n\nBefore answering you think:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n(e) You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
