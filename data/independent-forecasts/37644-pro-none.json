    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Approximately 1.5 months, until July 1, 2025.",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No. Anthropic will remain a privately held company and will not make any official announcement about planning an IPO before the deadline.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Anthropic continues its current strategy of raising capital from its significant private and strategic investors, such as Google and Amazon. The company's leadership decides that remaining private best serves their long-term research goals by avoiding the short-term pressures of public market quarterly reporting, and thus makes no IPO announcement by the deadline.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "In a surprise move, Anthropic's management, having been secretly preparing for months, decides that current market conditions are optimal for a major capital raise. They either file an S-1 with the SEC or post an official announcement on their website declaring their intent to pursue an initial public offering.",
    "rationale": "My forecast is overwhelmingly guided by the short timeframe. The deadline is July 1, 2025, leaving less than two months. Preparing for an IPO and the associated S-1 filing is a complex and lengthy process, typically taking many months, not weeks. The inertia of the status quo—Anthropic as a well-funded private entity—is therefore extremely strong. The company has demonstrated a strong ability to raise massive sums from the private markets, reducing the urgency for a public offering. While the AI sector is popular with public investors, there are no public signals, rumors, or reports (as confirmed by the lack of additional information from my research assistant) that Anthropic is in the late stages of IPO preparation. My probability is not lower than 2% because the tech industry, particularly AI, can move with surprising speed, and a well-kept secret plan for an IPO is not impossible. The probability is not higher because the logistical hurdles combined with the lack of any supporting evidence make a 'Yes' outcome a significant outlier event within this short window. I would significantly raise my probability upon credible news reports of Anthropic engaging investment banks for an IPO or preparing a draft S-1. Conversely, I would lower my forecast if they were to announce another large private funding round.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nBefore July 1, 2025, will Anthropic announce that it is planning an IPO?\n\nQuestion background:\nIn its most recent funding talks, Anthropic [floated](https://www.theinformation.com/articles/openai-rival-anthropic-has-floated-40-billion-valuation-in-early-talks-about-new-funding) a valuation of $40 billion. Although there has been speculation that the company could IPO, nothing concrete has been announced yet.\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question will resolve as **Yes** if Anthropic, Inc., announces before July 1, 2025, that it is planning an initial public offering. In order to streamline the resolution of this question, there are two resolution sources for the IPO announcement: 1) The company filing an [SEC Form S-1](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/sec-form-s-1.asp) or 2) An announcement at the [News](https://www.anthropic.com/news) section of its website. If there is no such announcement before that date, this question resolves as **No**.\n\n\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nNo additional information available.\n\nToday is 2025-05-15.\n\nBefore answering you think:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n(e) You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
