  "information": "Several of the candidates named in the question have officially announced their intention to run in the 2025 presidential election. Jean-Louis Billon, a member of the PDCI-RDA party, announced his candidacy in late May 2025, positioning himself as an alternative within his party following the disqualification of its leader, Tidjane Thiam. Simone Gbagbo, former first lady, has also announced her candidacy under the banner of her party, the Movement of Capable Generations (MGC). Pascal Affi N'Guessan is also presented as a candidate for the FPI party.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "About 32 days (until July 1, 2025)",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No disqualification is formally confirmed for any of the five by July 1, 2025.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "The electoral roll revision and any legal challenges drag on past July 1, or none of the five are struck from the voter roll or declared ineligible before that date. Candidate vetting by the Constitutional Council happens later, and any exclusions occur after July 1.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Before July 1, the electoral commission or courts confirm that at least one of the five (most plausibly Laurent Gbagbo or Simone Gbagbo) is not on the electoral roll or otherwise lacks legal eligibility (e.g., unresolved conviction/civil-rights issues or nationality compliance), or credible outlets report their formal removal from the list in the 2025 revision. Alternatively, Jean‑Louis Billon faces a nationality-related exclusion that results in a confirmed ineligibility before July 1.",
    "rationale": "Baseline: The default is that nothing new is formally confirmed within the next month. Ivory Coast typically finalizes eligibility closer to the formal candidacy validation stage, and administrative/legal processes can take time. So status quo favors No by July 1.\n\nRecent signals raising risk: Credible media have reported the removal of a major opposition figure (Tidjane Thiam) from the voter list during the current revision, showing authorities’ willingness to exclude high-profile opponents. While Thiam is not one of the five in scope, his case increases the hazard that others could be confirmed as ineligible in the same revision cycle. There has been longstanding uncertainty around Laurent Gbagbo’s civil rights and voter registration following domestic convictions despite ICC acquittal, and questions around Simone Gbagbo’s status post‑amnesty. Jean‑Louis Billon could face scrutiny over nationality requirements. Affi N’Guessan and Gnangbo Kacou appear lower risk historically.\n\nTiming considerations: The window is short (about a month). Formal candidate validation typically occurs later, which limits the chance of an explicit legal ineligibility ruling by July 1. However, the voter roll revision and its publication/appeals can generate credible reports confirming that a named individual is not on the electoral list—sufficient to resolve Yes under the question’s criteria.\n\nWhy not higher: The key gating factor is timing. Even if exclusions are likely eventually, it may not be formally confirmed for these specific five by July 1. Some of the strongest risks (e.g., nationality challenges for Billon) are more likely to crystallize at the candidacy validation stage rather than immediately.\n\nWhy not lower: The regime’s recent removal of a prominent opponent from the electoral list signals elevated near-term exclusion risk. Past cycles (e.g., 2020) saw broad disqualifications. Laurent Gbagbo’s unresolved status keeps a nontrivial probability that credible sources confirm his exclusion from the roll during June’s list finalization/appeals.\n\nUpdates that would move me up: Official CEI communication or credible reporting that the provisional/final revised voter list excludes Laurent Gbagbo, Simone Gbagbo, or Billon; court decisions affirming that a named candidate lacks civil rights; credible confirmation of dual nationality issues rendering Billon ineligible; any government statement foreshadowing their ineligibility for 2025.\n\nUpdates that would move me down: Credible reports that civil rights have been restored for Laurent or Simone and they are on the voter list; CEI statements indicating these five remain registered; de-escalation signals or legal reversals favoring opposition participation before July 1.\n\nResearch assistant summary used: Billon, Simone Gbagbo, and Affi N’Guessan have announced candidacies; Thiam’s disqualification prompted Billon’s move—evidence of an active exclusion environment but not yet applying to the five listed here.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill any of these candidates be disqualified from running in the 2025 Ivorian presidential election before July 1, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nBBC: [Main opposition leader removed from Ivory Coast electoral list](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c0l0j849143o)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if before July 1, 2025, according to [credible sources](https://www.metaculus.com/faq/#definitions) any of these candidates has been removed from the electoral list or otherwise become legally ineligible to run in the [2025 presidential election](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2025_Ivorian_presidential_election) of the Ivory Coast (Côte d'Ivoire) under the laws of the country: Gnangbo Kacou, Laurent Gbagbo, Pascal Affi N'Guessan, Jean-Louis Billon, or Simone Gbagbo.\n\n\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nSeveral of the candidates named in the question have officially announced their intention to run in the 2025 presidential election.

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
