    "review": "Forecaster 2 introduces a crucial piece of information I had not incorporated: that a new government won a confidence vote in mid-April. If accurate, that materially reduces the near-term impetus for snap elections and shifts the baseline strongly toward No. Their argument about political inertia within a 6–7 week window is compelling. Forecaster 3’s analysis correctly emphasizes the short window and status quo bias, but leans more on protest dynamics and public sentiment; those factors can influence political calculations but are weaker predictors of an immediate election announcement than the institutional fact of a recently installed cabinet. The claim of 59% protest support and a mid‑May escalation deadline may be real, but absent evidence of coalition fracture or procedural steps toward dissolution, they don’t outweigh the stabilizing effect of a new government. Overall, F2’s specific institutional update is the most decision-relevant and pushes the probability down from my prior. I remain a bit above F2’s 10% because Serbia’s leadership has a track record of tactical snap elections and Vučić’s “decision within ten days” rhetoric on May 14 keeps a nontrivial chance of a sudden pivot, but I move notably lower than my original 38%.",
    "rationale": "Update: Lowering from 38% to 22%.\nKey update is the reported mid-April confidence vote establishing a new cabinet, which substantially reduces the need to call elections before July 1. With ~47 days left, the path to a Yes now requires either a rapid coalition breakdown or a deliberate tactical choice by leadership to seek renewed mandate—possible in Serbia’s context but not the default. Vučić’s “decision within ten days” language on May 14 suggests the option isn’t off the table, but could also serve as leverage or signaling without intent to dissolve. Time decay also favors No: each quiet week makes a sudden announcement less likely absent a clear trigger. I stay above 10% to reflect Serbia’s history of snap polls and the leadership’s capacity to move quickly if polling or intra-coalition dynamics shift, but I discount protest-driven scenarios unless they visibly translate into coalition fractures or formal steps toward dissolution. I would move up on credible reporting of coalition rifts, formal consideration of dissolution, or top-level statements favoring elections; I would move down if the government proceeds with routine governance (key appointments/legislation) or if we see explicit messaging that they will govern without early polls.",
