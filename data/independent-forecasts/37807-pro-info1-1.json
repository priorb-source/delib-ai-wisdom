  "information": "The current U.S. Secretary of Agriculture is Brooke Rollins, who was sworn in around February 2025. Secretary Rollins has expressed support for SNAP reforms as part of a 'Make America Healthy Again' initiative, which is also championed by Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. In legislative developments, the House Budget Committee has cleared a Republican spending package that includes proposed cuts to SNAP and stricter work requirements. Separately, Secretary Rollins plans to announce a USDA reorganization plan and further staff reductions in late May 2025.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Approximately six weeks.",
    "status_quo_outcome": "Yes, 'snack foods' would remain specifically listed on the USDA's 'What Can SNAP Buy?' page, as it is on May 20, 2025.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "The new USDA leadership under Secretary Brooke Rollins acts swiftly on its 'Make America Healthy Again' initiative. As part of a department reorganization in late May, a new policy restricting 'unhealthy' foods is announced and the USDA website is immediately updated to reflect this change, removing the term 'snack foods' before the July 1, 2025 resolution date.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Despite the administration's clear intent to reform SNAP, the practical, legal, and bureaucratic process of changing the rules for a major federal program takes longer than six weeks. Formal rulemaking under the Administrative Procedure Act, including a public comment period, delays any changes. As a result, the website's text remains unchanged on July 1, 2025.",
    "rationale": "My forecast heavily weights the status quo due to the short timeframe. While there is strong political will from the new administration, evidenced by Secretary Rollins's support for the 'Make America Healthy Again' initiative, implementing such a significant policy change to SNAP is a complex and slow process. Removing a category of food like 'snack foods' would likely require a formal rulemaking process to amend the Code of Federal Regulations, which includes proposal, a public comment period (typically 30-60 days), and finalization. It is highly improbable that this entire process could be completed in the roughly six weeks before July 1, 2025. Bureaucratic inertia and the high likelihood of legal challenges from advocacy groups and the food industry create significant friction against rapid change.\n\nMy probability is not higher than 85 because the new administration appears motivated to act quickly, as shown by the planned USDA reorganization in late May. It is possible they could attempt to bypass the full rulemaking process by issuing an interim final rule or simply updating the website's guidance as a symbolic first step, accepting the legal risk. The question resolves on the text of the webpage, not the underlying regulation, making a fast, cosmetic change a non-trivial possibility.\n\nMy probability is not lower than 85 because the procedural hurdles of the Administrative Procedure Act are substantial and designed to prevent such rapid, unilateral changes to major programs. The default expectation for any federal agency, even under a new administration, is that established processes will be followed, and those processes take much longer than six weeks. For me to lower my forecast, I would need to see evidence that the administration is explicitly planning to bypass the standard rulemaking process for this specific change before the resolution date.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill the USDA still list \"snack foods\" on its \"What Can SNAP Buy?\" page on July 1, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nNY Post: [Americans on food stamps could be banned from buying ‘bad food and sugary drinks,’ Trump USDA chief says](https://nypost.com/2025/02/14/us-news/americans-on-food-stamps-could-be-banned-from-buying-bad-food-and-sugary-drinks-trump-usda-chief-says/)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if \"snack foods\" is specifically listed on the United States Department of Agriculture's [What Can SNAP Buy?](https://www.fns.usda.gov/snap/eligible-food-items) webpage as something that is explicitly mentioned as something that can can be purchased by recipients of the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program. (Forecasters please note that it *is* explicitly mentioned as of May 5, 2025.) If it is *not* explicitly mentioned when checked by Metataculus on or after July 1, 2025, this resolves as **No**.\n\nIn order to streamline resolution, synonyms will not count; the phrase must specifically be \"snack foods.\" The question will resolve as soon as the page is accessed by Metaculus Admins on the resolution date. However, if there are issues accessing the page, then resolution will wait up to the end of the question resolutions period, at which point if Metaculus has still not been able to access the resolution source, this question will be **annulled**.\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nThe current U.S. Secretary of Agriculture is Brooke Rollins, who was sworn in around February 2025.

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
