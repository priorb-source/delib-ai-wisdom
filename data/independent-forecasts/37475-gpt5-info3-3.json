  "information": "Historical data on similar FSIS recalls provides context for typical closure timelines. Many previous recalls handled by Johnsonville were closed within 4 to 8 weeks. Broader data for Class I meat recalls of a similar size often shows closure within 2 to 4 months after the announcement. However, some cases can take longer; a recall for Tyson Fun Nuggets in 2023 took approximately four months to close. A January 2025 report from the Plastic Pollution Coalition also mentioned that several recalls from 2024 involving plastic contamination remained ongoing for several months after their initiation.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "About 52 days (until July 1, 2025)",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No — the recall remains listed as Active on the FSIS page when checked on/after July 1, 2025",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Effectiveness checks take longer than expected, additional consumer complaints emerge, or the recall is expanded to more lots/states, keeping FSIS status at Active into July.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Johnsonville completes product recovery/accounting and corrective actions, FSIS verifies effectiveness without expansion or new incidents, and the status changes to Closed in mid-to-late June.",
    "rationale": "The recall was posted on April 5, 2025. As of May 9, we are ~34 days in, with ~52 days remaining until July 1. Closure before July 1 would imply a total duration of up to ~12.5 weeks, which fits within historical ranges for similar recalls. The research assistant notes: (1) Johnsonville recalls often close within 4–8 weeks; (2) similar Class I meat recalls of this size often close in 2–4 months; (3) some foreign-matter/plastic cases have lasted several months (e.g., Tyson Fun Nuggets ~4 months; several 2024 plastic-related recalls lingered). These facts create a mixed base rate: Johnsonville’s own history suggests a good chance of closure by late May to mid-June, while broader data leave meaningful tail risk that pushes closure past July 1. On balance, with 7+ weeks left and a moderate recall size (~22,000 lb), closure by July 1 is more likely than not, but not a lock. I weight the current Active status (status quo) to avoid overconfidence; if processes drag or the recall expands, the outcome flips to No. Why not higher: foreign-matter recalls can be extended by new complaints, expanded scope, or slow retail checks; broader base rates show many take up to 4 months. Why not lower: Johnsonville’s track record (4–8 weeks common) and the ample time remaining favor closure. Upward updates: evidence of no expansion, no new reports, completion of effectiveness checks, or FSIS/firm communications suggesting wrap-up. Downward updates: any expansion, new injuries/complaints, added lot codes/states, or signs of slow effectiveness verification.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill the USDA-posted recall by Johnsonville LLC of cheddar bratwurst for foreign matter contamination issued April 5, 2025 be closed before July 1, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nReal Simple: [Over 22,000 Pounds of a Popular Sausage Brand Recalled Due to Contamination](https://www.realsimple.com/sausage-recall-2025-11711268)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if the status of the recall posted by the U.S. Department of Agriculture’s Food Safety and Inspection Service (FSIS) is changed from Active to Closed on [this page](https://www.fsis.usda.gov/recalls-alerts/johnsonville-llc-recalls-cheddar-bratwurst-product-due-possible-foreign-matter) before July 1, 2025. If the recall is still shown as Active when the link is accessed by Metaculus on or after July 1, 2025, this question resolves as **No**.\n\n\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nHistorical data on similar FSIS recalls provides context for typical closure timelines.

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
