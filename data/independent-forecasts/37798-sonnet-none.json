    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Approximately 27 days from May 19, 2025 to June 15, 2025",
    "status_quo_outcome": "Based on the article mentioning the Dodgers 'keep coming' with wins despite challenges, they appear to be performing well currently, suggesting a continuation would favor a Yes outcome",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "The Dodgers face a difficult stretch of schedule or key injuries worsen, while another strong team (such as the Phillies, Yankees, or Braves) goes on a hot streak and overtakes them in winning percentage by mid-June",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "The Dodgers continue their strong performance through favorable matchups and roster depth, maintaining their position at or near the top of MLB standings while other contending teams experience their own challenges or regression to the mean",
    "rationale": "The question asks about a specific date roughly 27 days away, which represents approximately 20-27 games per team - enough time for meaningful changes in standings but not so long that early season trends completely evaporate. The provided article indicates the Dodgers are winning consistently despite injury and pitching management challenges, suggesting organizational strength and depth. Historically, the Dodgers are perennial contenders with strong roster construction. However, several factors introduce uncertainty: (1) I lack specific current standings data as of May 19, 2025, (2) baseball has significant short-term variance, (3) the question requires the HIGHEST percentage specifically, meaning any tie likely resolves as No, (4) multiple teams could be competitive at the top, and (5) the mentioned injuries and pitcher management issues could escalate. Status quo bias suggests weighting current strong performance, but 27 days allows substantial movement. The forecast is not higher because of baseball's inherent unpredictability, unknown current exact standings, and the binary nature of 'highest' (not top-3 or top-5). It's not lower because the article suggests current success, the Dodgers' organizational excellence, and the relatively short timeframe favoring continuation of existing trends. I would update higher with data showing the Dodgers currently have a commanding lead in winning percentage, or lower if evidence showed they're currently behind and/or facing an especially difficult upcoming schedule.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill the LA Dodgers have the highest winning percentage in the MLB on June 15, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nYahoo Sports: [Even as Dodgers navigate injuries and manage pitcher usage, the wins keep coming](https://sports.yahoo.com/mlb/article/even-as-dodgers-navigate-injuries-and-manage-pitcher-usage-the-wins-keep-coming-053322413.html)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if the Los Angeles Dodgers have the highest winning percentage in Major League Baseball according to the [MLB official standings](https://www.mlb.com/standings/) when checked by Metaculus on or after June 15, 2025.\n\nNo other resolution source will be used to resolve the question. Question resolves based on how the page appears when checked by a Metaculus Admin.\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nNo additional information available.\n\nToday is 2025-05-19.\n\nBefore answering you think:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n(e) You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
