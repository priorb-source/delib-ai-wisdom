  "information": "On March 13, 2025, the government of Chad officially granted Starlink an operating license. The stated goal is to enhance internet connectivity, particularly in remote areas where the existing 6,000 km of fiber optic infrastructure is insufficient, and to support educational and healthcare institutions. Government officials have stated that negotiations were conducted to ensure affordable pricing for the service.\n\nThe time between Starlink receiving a license and its service becoming 'Available' on its map varies in other African nations. For the Democratic Republic of Congo, the process took approximately 10 weeks in 2025. For Malawi and Zambia, it was about 16 weeks, and for Benin, it was 24 weeks. Niger's service was officially launched on March 13, 2025, the same day Chad's license was announced. In May 2025, a pan-African partnership between SpaceX and Airtel was announced to potentially accelerate kit distribution.\n\nStarlink's expansion faces both technical advantages and logistical challenges. The use of optical inter-satellite links reduces the need for local ground stations in every country. However, high demand has led to service pauses and waiting lists in other regions, including some African countries like Nigeria and Kenya. For Chad specifically, potential obstacles include its landlocked geography, limited retail infrastructure, and the need to finalize details such as import rules and spectrum fees.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Approximately 47 days or 6.5 weeks until July 1, 2025",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No - Chad remains unlisted as 'Available' on Starlink's map, as it is not currently listed",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Starlink encounters logistical delays in Chad due to its landlocked geography and limited retail infrastructure, or prioritizes resource allocation to other markets with higher demand. Import regulations and spectrum fee negotiations drag beyond the deadline, preventing service activation by July 1.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Starlink leverages its recent pan-African Airtel partnership and accumulated African market experience to rapidly deploy service in Chad. Following a similar 10-week timeline as DRC or benefiting from regional coordination (like Niger's same-day launch), Chad's service goes live and the availability map is updated in June 2025.",
    "rationale": "Chad received its Starlink license on March 13, 2025, meaning 9 weeks have already elapsed as of today (May 15). The question allows 15.5 total weeks until July 1. Historical African deployment timelines show significant variation: DRC took 10 weeks, Malawi and Zambia took 16 weeks, and Benin took 24 weeks. Niger's same-day launch on March 13 suggests possible regional coordination. The median timeline of ~16 weeks would place activation right at or slightly after the July 1 deadline. Favorable factors include: we've already passed the shortest deployment timeline, the May 2025 Airtel partnership could accelerate distribution, and optical inter-satellite links reduce technical barriers. Challenging factors include: Chad's landlocked status and limited infrastructure, potential ongoing negotiations over import rules and spectrum fees, evidence of capacity constraints in other African markets (Nigeria, Kenya waiting lists), and general status quo bias suggesting deployments often take longer than expected. The 16-week median timeline puts us in a borderline situation - just at the resolution boundary. Given the mix of moderately favorable conditions but specific Chad-related challenges and tight timeline, I weight toward the status quo (not available) but acknowledge meaningful probability of activation. I'm not higher because 6.5 weeks remaining is less than most historical examples and Chad faces infrastructure constraints. I'm not lower because we're already 9 weeks in and the shortest example was 10 weeks. Updates would come from deployment news, kit distribution reports, or evidence of regulatory delays.",

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
