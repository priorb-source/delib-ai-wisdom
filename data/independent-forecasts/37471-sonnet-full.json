  "information": "According to data from the Federal Reserve Economic Data (FRED), the inventory of new single-family homes for sale in the United States stood at 503,000 units in March 2025, an increase from 500,000 in February 2025. This level represents a multi-year high since November 2007. Historically, the number of new one-family homes for sale has only exceeded 550,000 during the 2006-2007 housing market peak, when levels reached between 570,000 and 580,000 units.\n\nData from the U.S. Census Bureau and the Department of Housing and Urban Development for March 2025 showed that new single-family home sales reached a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 724,000, which is up 6% year-over-year. The median sales price of new homes sold was $403,600, a decrease of 7.5% from the same period in the previous year. According to Freddie Mac, the 30-year fixed mortgage rate averaged 6.65% in March 2025 and rose to 6.83% in April 2025.\n\nAccording to the US Census Bureau, housing starts declined by 14.2% month-over-month in March 2025 to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 940,000 units. In the same month, building permits for single-family homes decreased by 2% month-over-month. Builder confidence, as measured by the NAHB Housing Market Index (HMI), was reported to be around 42.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Approximately 1.5 months. May 2025 data will typically be released by FRED in late June 2025.",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No - inventory continues gradual increase but remains below 550,000",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Inventory increases modestly from the March level of 503,000 units, reaching approximately 506-515,000 by May 2025. The recent slow pace of increase (+3,000 units from February to March) continues, and declining housing starts (-14.2% MoM) and building permits (-2% MoM) prevent a surge in available inventory. Sales absorb new completions at a steady rate despite higher mortgage rates.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "The upward trend in inventory accelerates significantly due to a demand-supply mismatch. Rising mortgage rates (6.83% in April, up from 6.65% in March) further dampen buyer demand while builders continue completing homes from earlier permits. This causes inventory to accumulate rapidly, rising by 20,000-25,000 units per month in April and May to exceed 550,000 units.",
    "rationale": "Current inventory stands at 503,000 units in March 2025, requiring a 47,000 unit increase (9.4%) to reach the 550,000 threshold in just two months. The recent trend shows only a 3,000 unit monthly increase from February to March. At this pace, May inventory would reach approximately 509,000 - well short of 550,000. Several factors argue against reaching the threshold: (1) Housing starts declined sharply by 14.2% MoM in March, and building permits for single-family homes fell 2%, indicating constrained future supply; (2) Builder confidence is weak at 42 on the HMI; (3) Historically, inventory above 550,000 has only occurred during the 2006-2007 housing bubble peak. However, there are demand-side risks: rising mortgage rates (now 6.83%) could slow sales while completed homes enter the market, causing faster inventory accumulation. The base rate strongly favors No - this level has been exceeded only during an extreme bubble period. For my forecast to move higher, I would need to see April data showing inventory jumping by 15,000+ units, indicating a sharp acceleration. For it to move lower, I would need evidence of inventory flattening or declining despite the recent trend. Given the slow recent pace, weak supply indicators, and low historical base rate, I assign this outcome a low probability.",
