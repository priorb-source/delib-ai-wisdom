    "review": "Both forecasters correctly lean toward No based on Berkshire’s multi‑quarter net‑seller posture, very low turnover, and Buffett’s recent remarks about the Mag 7’s capital intensity. I find Forecaster 3’s timing point especially persuasive: the major tariff‑driven tech selloff happened after Q1, reducing the odds of opportunistic Q1 buying. I’m less convinced by Forecaster 2’s “pressure to deploy cash” argument; Berkshire has repeatedly shown comfort holding T‑bills at ~5% rather than forcing equity deployment. Neither forecaster discussed Berkshire’s recurring use of confidential treatment requests on 13F filings, which further lowers the chance of a Q1 reveal even if a position were initiated. On the other hand, both rightly note that Todd/Ted could put on a small starter stake—Alphabet or Meta are the most plausible among the five; Nvidia and Tesla are unlikely, and Microsoft has additional perceived‑conflict optics Buffett has cited historically. Overall, their inputs nudge me slightly lower than my prior.",
    "rationale": "I started at 12%. The balance of evidence still favors No: persistent net selling, Buffett’s comments on capital intensity, and the fact that Q1 ended before the April downdraft all argue against a new Mag 7 stake being opened and disclosed in Q1. Berkshire’s willingness to request confidential treatment means even a genuine new position might not appear in the Q1 13F, which also tilts to No. Among candidates, Microsoft is unlikely due to Buffett’s long‑standing reluctance tied to perceived conflicts; Nvidia/Tesla don’t fit well with recent comments; Alphabet/Meta are the only plausible Yes paths via a modest Todd/Ted starter stake. Forecaster 3’s emphasis on timing makes me shade down slightly from 12% to 10%. I would adjust up if we learned Berkshire were net equity buyers in Q1 or hinted at a new large‑cap tech position without confidentiality; I’d adjust down if we see confirmation they were net sellers in Q1 or explicit post‑Q1 remarks dismissing Mag 7 valuations.",
