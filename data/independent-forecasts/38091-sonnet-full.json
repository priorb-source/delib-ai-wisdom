  "information": "In the first five months of 2025, three countries signed the Artemis Accords: Finland (January 23), Bangladesh (April 8), and Norway (May 15), bringing the total number of signatories to 55. This follows the signings of Panama and Austria in December 2024. In a statement on May 22, 2025, acting NASA Administrator Janet Petro said that NASA anticipates additional countries will sign the accords in the coming weeks and months.\n\nThe United Arab Emirates hosted an international Artemis Accords workshop in Abu Dhabi on May 21-22, 2025. Representatives from over 30 of the 55 signatory countries attended to discuss the implementation of the Accords' principles, including transparency, data sharing, and sustainability in space. In addition, the 2025 Humans to the Moon & Mars Summit (H2M2) was held in Washington, D.C., on May 28-29, bringing together leaders from government, industry, and international space agencies to discuss the future of human space exploration.\n\nAs of late May 2025, there have been no public announcements of a specific country planning to sign the Artemis Accords during the month of June. In a parallel development in international space exploration, China and Russia have announced a joint plan to build a nuclear reactor on the Moon by 2035 to power their International Lunar Research Station (ILRS). The ILRS project is positioned as a rival to the US-led Artemis program and has secured partnerships with 17 countries.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "32 days (from May 29, 2025 to June 30, 2025)",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No - no country signs the Artemis Accords in June 2025",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Countries currently in negotiations with NASA about joining the Artemis Accords continue their diplomatic processes but do not finalize and schedule signing ceremonies during the specific month of June. Interested countries may still be seeking domestic approvals or prefer to wait for more opportune timing, perhaps aligning with other space-related events or summits later in the year.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "At least one country that participated in the recent UAE Artemis Accords workshop (May 21-22) or the H2M2 Summit (May 28-29) accelerates its decision-making process and schedules a formal signing ceremony in June. NASA's anticipation of signings 'in the coming weeks' materializes with quick diplomatic action, potentially announced and executed before month's end.",
    "rationale": "The base rate analysis is instructive: in the first five months of 2025, there have been 3 signings (Finland, Bangladesh, Norway), yielding approximately 0.6 signings per month. Using this rate in a Poisson framework suggests roughly 45% probability of at least one signing in any given month. Several factors modulate this baseline. On the positive side, acting NASA Administrator Janet Petro's May 22 statement explicitly anticipating additional signings 'in the coming weeks and months' provides recent signal of active negotiations. The timing is notable - two major international gatherings just occurred (UAE workshop with 30+ signatory countries on May 21-22, and the H2M2 Summit on May 28-29), which could catalyze decisions. The steady cadence of signings (3 of 5 months in 2025 had signings) suggests ongoing momentum. However, significant countervailing factors exist. Most importantly, there are no public announcements of any specific country planning to sign in June - diplomatic ceremonies typically require advance planning and announcement. The status quo strongly favors no signing, as this is the default state requiring no action. The phrase 'coming weeks and months' is deliberately vague and doesn't specifically indicate June. Even if the recent meetings sparked interest, diplomatic processes take time, and converting interest into a formal signing within a 32-day window is challenging. This forecast is not higher because of the absence of specific announcements and the strength of status quo bias. It's not lower because the recent NASA statement and timing of international meetings provide meaningful positive signal beyond the base rate. I would revise upward if any country publicly announces plans to sign in June or if credible reporting emerges of imminent signings. I would revise downward if June passes its midpoint without announcements or if reporting suggests interested countries are targeting later timeframes.",

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
