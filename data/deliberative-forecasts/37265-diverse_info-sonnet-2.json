    "review": "Both forecasters provide valuable insights that strengthen the case for a lower probability than my initial 18%. Forecaster 2's most compelling point is that Mtwara already has a localized Level 3 advisory, indicating the State Department's deliberate strategy is geographic containment rather than country-wide escalation. This is a crucial detail I didn't emphasize enough. The March 2025 coastal security alert that did NOT trigger an immediate advisory upgrade is also telling - it suggests the State Department recently assessed the situation and determined Level 2 remains appropriate.\n\nForecaster 3's point about regional precedent (Uganda and Burundi upgrades) is valid but cuts both ways - it shows the State Department will act when warranted, but Tanzania's stability at Level 2 despite years of proximity to Mozambique's insurgency suggests a higher threshold for country-wide upgrade.\n\nThe most convincing argument across both analyses is the dual time constraint: with only 60 days remaining, we need both (1) a significant triggering event AND (2) sufficient time for bureaucratic reassessment and policy change. This is more constraining than I initially weighted.",
    "rationale": "I'm adjusting my forecast downward from 18% to 15%. The key factors driving this update are:\n\n1. **Geographic containment strategy**: The existing Level 3 for Mtwara shows the State Department prefers localized warnings over country-wide upgrades. This is a deliberate policy choice that suggests a higher bar for national escalation.\n\n2. **Recent non-escalation**: The March 2025 coastal alert occurred without triggering an advisory change, indicating a recent reassessment that concluded Level 2 is appropriate.\n\n3. **Dual time constraint**: The 60-day window requires both an incident severe enough to warrant upgrade AND sufficient time for the bureaucratic process. This is more limiting than I initially assessed.\n\nHowever, I'm not going as low as 12% because:\n\n1. **Recency of threats**: The April 2025 terrorist activity in the border region is only one month old - this is very recent.\n\n2. **Dynamic situation**: Security environments can deteriorate rapidly, and a single high-profile incident targeting tourists or Western interests could trigger swift action.\n\n3. **Active monitoring**: The coastal alert and Mtwara Level 3 show the State Department is actively watching Tanzania, which could facilitate faster response to new threats.\n\nA 15% probability reflects high confidence in the status quo while acknowledging meaningful tail risk of escalation in a monitored, somewhat volatile security environment.",
