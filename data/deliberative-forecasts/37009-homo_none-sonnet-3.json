    "review": "All three forecasts converge on similar reasoning and probabilities (15-20%), which increases my confidence in the analytical framework. Forecaster 3 makes the strongest point about weighting the status quo and the significance of zero reported signals - major Senate announcements typically generate advance media buzz, staff movements, or fundraising activity, none of which have been reported. Forecaster 2 adds valuable context about the 11-day gap since the April 10 dropouts, noting that if Stevens were serious about capitalizing on this opening, she likely would have moved by now. Both forecasters correctly emphasize that Senate campaigns require extensive preparation that would show visible signs. The party pressure argument from Forecaster 2 is somewhat speculative but plausible. The key insight I'm taking from this deliberation is that the complete absence of any preparatory signals this close to the deadline is stronger evidence than I initially weighted.",
    "rationale": "Upon reflection, I'm updating slightly downward from 18% to 16%. The other forecasters have reinforced the importance of the status quo and the significance of the 11-day information vacuum since the CNN article. If Stevens were preparing to announce, we would expect some leaked information about campaign infrastructure, fundraising calls, staff recruitment, or at minimum media speculation from political reporters who typically catch wind of such moves. The complete silence is telling. However, I'm not going as low as 15% because: (1) 10 days remains sufficient time for an announcement, especially if party leaders are applying pressure behind the scenes, (2) the Democratic field appears genuinely unsettled, creating opportunity, and (3) politicians occasionally make rapid decisions when circumstances demand it. The forecast remains in the low probability range, strongly favoring No, but leaves reasonable room for a surprise late entry.",
