    "review": "The other two forecasters presented compelling and convergent analyses, both arriving at a 15% probability. Their core arguments, which I found persuasive, placed a much stronger emphasis on two key constraints that I had previously underweighted: 1) the imminent and critical May 4, 2025 registration deadline for political alliances, and 2) the historical pattern of Muqtada al-Sadr's reversals occurring much closer to election dates to maximize political leverage. Forecaster 2's point that a reversal before July 1 would be out of character with his 2021 timeline (reversing in August for an October election) was particularly effective. Both forecasters correctly framed the May 4 deadline not just as a date on the calendar, but as a 'critical logistical barrier' and a 'significant structural barrier', making a 'Yes' outcome considerably more complex if it does not happen in the next 24 hours.",
    "rationale": "After reviewing the other analyses, I am updating my forecast downward from 25% to 15%. The primary reason for this change is that my initial forecast overweighted al-Sadr's general unpredictability and did not sufficiently account for the specific constraints of the timeline imposed by the question. The other forecasters convinced me that the May 4 registration deadline is a more significant obstacle than I had assessed. With the deadline being tomorrow, the window for a straightforward announcement is nearly closed. Any announcement after May 4 but before July 1 would likely require a special extension from the IHEC, adding another layer of difficulty and reducing the probability. Furthermore, their arguments highlighting Sadr's strategic tendency to use brinkmanship and reverse decisions much closer to the actual election date (e.g., two months prior in 2021) are very strong. Announcing his participation five to six months before the November election would be an uncharacteristic move that would cede strategic advantage. Therefore, while a reversal remains possible given his history, the probability of it occurring specifically before the July 1 deadline is lower than I initially believed. The 15% forecast better reflects the small but non-trivial chance of an early, unexpected move, while giving appropriate weight to the strong logistical and strategic factors favoring a continued boycott past the resolution date.",
