  "information": "At UFC 314 in Miami on April 13, 2025, Donald Trump was seen with Dana White and Elon Musk. Reports also mentioned the presence of political figures such as Kash Patel, Robert F. Kennedy Jr., Tulsi Gabbard, Kristi Noem, Ted Cruz, and Marco Rubio. Trump was greeted by Shaquille O'Neal and Joe Rogan, and he entered the arena to the song 'American Bad Ass' by Kid Rock, receiving a positive reaction from the crowd.",

    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "About 2–3 months, until UFC 316 takes place (likely early summer 2025).",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "UFC 316 is scheduled outside the continental U.S. (e.g., UK, Middle East, Australia) or the President’s schedule/security posture blocks discretionary travel that weekend, leading him to skip the event.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "UFC 316 lands in a favorable location (most likely Las Vegas for International Fight Week) and President Trump makes a brief in-venue appearance with Dana White—ringside or backstage—satisfying the “anywhere on the grounds” criterion.",
    "rationale": "Baseline: For any specific UFC PPV, the default is that a given individual does not attend; thus status quo leans No. Countervailing factors: President Trump has a long, public relationship with Dana White and has attended numerous UFC cards over the years. Importantly, as President he attended UFC 314 in Miami on Apr 13, 2025, indicating that Secret Service and scheduling hurdles are surmountable and that he’s still inclined to make these appearances. He was greeted positively and appeared with high-profile figures, which suggests PR value he may wish to replicate. Timing/location: UFC 316 is likely an early-summer PPV; if it corresponds to International Fight Week in Las Vegas (a common pattern), that meaningfully raises attendance odds because Vegas is logistically straightforward for the UFC, media-rich, and a venue he has attended before. Key uncertainties: We don’t yet have a confirmed UFC 316 location/date. If it’s international or in a politically inconvenient location, odds drop sharply. Presidential schedule remains a wild card; major domestic/international obligations around that weekend could preclude attendance. Why not higher: The base rate for attending any single PPV is still well below 50%—even for a frequent attendee—plus unresolved uncertainty about location and potential scheduling conflicts. Why not lower: Recent demonstrated behavior (UFC 314 attendance as President), strong relationship with UFC/Dana White, and the likelihood of a favorable venue (e.g., Las Vegas) support materially higher-than-base odds. What would move me up: Official announcement of UFC 316 in Las Vegas or South Florida; public hints from Dana White; Trump’s schedule placing him in or near the host city that weekend. What would move me down: UFC 316 announced for an international site or distant U.S. city; a conflicting summit/state visit or domestic emergency; reports of tightened security posture limiting large-venue appearances.",
