  "information": "Specific actions have been taken to dismantle climate-related military programs. The U.S. Navy officially rescinded its 'Climate Action 2030' plan, a Biden-era initiative to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. Navy Secretary John Phelan announced the decision, emphasizing a renewed focus on \"lethality and our warfighters.\" Furthermore, the Department of Defense has removed $377 million in funding for climate change reduction programs. Other initiatives, such as the Air Force's 'Sustainable Aviation Fuel' program and the Army's plan for tactical vehicle electrification, have also been put in doubt or deemed impractical.",

    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "About 42 days (≈6 weeks) from May 20, 2025 to July 1, 2025.",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No — climate.mil remains offline per Is It Down Right Now.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "The administration continues scrubbing climate-related programs and web presence. The climate.mil DNS or hosting remains disabled (or times out), with no placeholder or redirect added. On/after July 1, Is It Down Right Now still reports climate.mil as down for everyone.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "DoD restores climate.mil in some form before July 1—most plausibly as a minimal placeholder or redirect (e.g., to defense.gov or a rebranded “installation resilience” page). Even without legacy content, if the domain resolves and serves/redirects properly, Is It Down Right Now would likely report it as up.",
    "rationale": "- Status quo: As of May 5, Is It Down Right Now says climate.mil is down for everyone, implying DNS/connection failure rather than just a 404. With only ~6 weeks left and ongoing political direction to remove climate content, inertia favors continued downtime.\n- Political/organizational signals: The research assistant reports concrete dismantling actions—rescission of the Navy’s Climate Action 2030, removal of $377m in DoD climate-related funding, and other program retrenchments. These actions reduce the incentive to restore a climate-branded portal and suggest deliberate decommissioning rather than a transient outage.\n- Base rates: Federal domains that are intentionally taken offline typically remain down for months unless there’s a clear directive to restore. Rapid reinstatement would require coordination (DNS, hosting, approvals) that is unlikely absent a policy push.\n- Pathways to Yes: A quick, low-effort redirect or placeholder to avoid broken links or negative press could flip the site to “up” in the checker. Evidence of such intent (press guidance, DISA/network changes, DNS records reappearing) would warrant an increase.\n- Why not higher: Current signals point toward permanent removal and reduced climate emphasis, the domain has already been down for weeks, and there’s little time left for reversal.\n- Why not lower: Bureaucratic or comms-driven decisions sometimes create last-minute placeholders/redirects. Technical restoration is feasible on short notice if ordered.\n- Update triggers:\n  • Upward: Any DoD communication about consolidating/migrating resilience content, observable DNS A/CNAME records for climate.mil reappearing, or reports of a redirect being set up.\n  • Downward: Explicit confirmation of domain decommissioning, removal from internal .mil domain inventories, or further public statements emphasizing elimination of climate-branded assets.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill the US military's climate resiliance portal be back online on July 1, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nThe Guardian [Scientists brace ‘for the worst’ as Trump purges climate mentions from websites](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/feb/04/trump-climate-change-federal-websites)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below.

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
