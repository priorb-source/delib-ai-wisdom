  "information": "According to statements from Paul Gunning, the EPA's Director of the Office of Atmospheric Protection, the Energy Star program and other climate-related work are being 'de-prioritized and eliminated.' Gunning's office, along with the EPA's climate change division and climate protection partnership division, are slated for closure as part of a broader agency reorganization. The stated goal of the restructuring is to bring the agency to 'Reagan-era staffing levels,' aiming for a savings of $300 million a year by 2026.\n\nThe Energy Star program was launched in 1992 as a voluntary public-private partnership to certify energy-efficient products. Over its 33-year history, government figures and expert analyses estimate the program has saved consumers over $500 billion in energy costs and prevented 4 billion metric tons of greenhouse gas emissions. The program's annual cost is approximately $32 million, while it is credited with saving the average household around $450 per year.\n\nDecommissioning a federal .gov domain typically requires a process lasting several months for internal approvals, security reviews, and coordination with the General Services Administration (GSA). Federal laws, including the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) and record-retention statutes overseen by the National Archives and Records Administration (NARA), mandate archiving procedures. Historically, websites for discontinued federal programs have often remained online as static archives or with placeholder notices for years after the program ended. When other EPA climate-related webpages were targeted for removal in 2017, the outcome was a redirect or a static page, not a complete shutdown of the domain.",

    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Approximately 48 days (from May 14, 2025 to July 1, 2025)",
    "status_quo_outcome": "The website remains online. As of May 7, 2025, EnergyStar.gov is UP and reachable according to the resolution source.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "The EPA rapidly takes down EnergyStar.gov as part of the program elimination, possibly replacing it with a redirect or error page. This would require expedited decommissioning processes and prioritization of the website takedown as a symbolic or cost-cutting measure within the next 6-7 weeks.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "The website remains accessible on July 1, 2025. This occurs because: (1) federal website decommissioning processes take several months for GSA coordination, security reviews, and NARA archiving requirements, making a complete takedown within 48 days unlikely; (2) the website transitions to a static archive or placeholder notice rather than being completely taken offline; (3) bureaucratic inertia and legal requirements delay action; or (4) elimination plans are slowed or reconsidered.",
    "rationale": "The status quo strongly favors the website remaining online. The resolution source confirmed the site was operational just one week ago, and there are only 48 days until the resolution date. My research assistant's report highlights that federal .gov domain decommissioning typically requires months of internal approvals, security reviews, GSA coordination, and compliance with FOIA and NARA record-retention requirements. This timeline significantly exceeds the 6-7 weeks available. Historical precedent is particularly informative: when EPA climate webpages were targeted in 2017, the outcome was redirects or static pages rather than complete domain shutdowns. Federal websites for discontinued programs often persist as archives for years after program termination. Even with genuine political will to eliminate Energy Star and cost-cutting pressures, the mechanical process of properly taking down a federal website is slow and procedural. The program elimination and website decommissioning are separate processes with different timelines. I'm not forecasting higher (near 95-100%) because there is documented intent to eliminate the program, and emergency procedures could theoretically expedite website takedown if treated as a high-priority symbolic action. The EPA has shown willingness to make rapid changes to climate-related content. I'm not forecasting lower (below 80%) because 48 days is genuinely insufficient time for proper federal website decommissioning, legal archiving requirements create barriers to rapid takedown, and historical evidence shows federal domains persist even when programs end. The path of least resistance for bureaucrats is typically to leave things as-is rather than rush through complex decommissioning procedures. I would update higher with evidence of other rapid federal website takedowns, visible technical preparations for shutdown, or the site converting to archive mode. I would update lower with reports of expedited shutdown plans, evidence this is treated as urgent symbolic action, or successful precedents of rapid .gov decommissioning.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill the EPA's EnergyStar.gov still be online on July 1, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nAccording to the [New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/06/climate/epa-energy-star-eliminated.html), \"'The Energy Star program and all the other climate work, outside of what’s required by statute, is being de-prioritized and eliminated,' Paul Gunning, the director of the E.P.A. Office of Atmospheric Protection, told employees during the meeting, according to the recording obtained by The New York Times. Mr. Gunning’s office itself is also slated for elimination.\n\nFor the past 33 years, Energy Star has been known for its recognizable blue label, which shows that an appliance has met energy efficiency standards set by the federal government.\"\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below.

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any).
