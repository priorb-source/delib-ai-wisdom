    "review": "Both forecasters largely align with my prior view and add useful specifics. F2 highlights post-Hajj schedule thinning as a possible short-term drag and enumerates Syria and multiple KSA/Iran/Turkey links—good stress test for the margin over 31. F3 questions the easyJet ATH claim (sensible) and notes that FlightsFrom often lists season-wide routes, which could help the count on July 1 even if some start later in summer. The detailed Turkish leisure and Caucasus seasonals (AYT/ADB/TZX/BUS/TBS) called out by both strengthen the summer-upside case. None introduced disconfirming evidence; if anything, the seasonality treatment on FlightsFrom nudges the probability up slightly, while the post-Hajj taper is a modest downside consideration.",
    "rationale": "My base was 72%. The incremental arguments that FlightsFrom may reflect season-wide scheduled destinations and the typical breadth of Turkish summer leisure routes slightly increase the chance that the listing exceeds 31 on or after July 1. Even without easyJet ATH, the confirmed Aegean ATH and Eurowings CGN adds, combined with robust Gulf and Saudi networks and usual Turkish/Iran/Caucasus links, make clearing 31 plausible. I’m not moving higher because: (1) episodic security/airspace disruptions in the region can prompt quick suspensions; (2) some seasonal routes might begin after early July or be pulled late; (3) post-Hajj reductions could temporarily trim Saudi counts around end-June/early July. Net: a small upward adjustment to reflect the FlightsFrom seasonality point and the consensus view among the group.",
