  "information": "According to multiple news outlets, U.S. government bodies have documented 757 cases of Unidentified Aerial Phenomena (UAP) between May 2023 and June 2024. Of this total, 708 occurred in airspace, and only 49 cases had been officially closed as of early 2025. The Department of Defense's All-Domain Anomaly Resolution Office (AARO) is the primary body for receiving these reports. The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) also investigates UAP sightings, especially those confirmed by radar, and shares its findings with the Department of Defense.\n\nA specific incident in January 2023 involved a U.S. Air Force F-16 Viper fighter jet colliding with an unidentified object during a training mission over Arizona, causing damage to the aircraft's canopy. The object was described as an 'orange-white uncrewed aerial system' (UAS). This is one of numerous encounters reported by military pilots in the region, establishing Arizona as a hotspot for UAP sightings, particularly near military training areas and the border with Mexico. Former government intelligence officer Luis Elizondo confirmed that there has been significant reported activity in the area.\n\nSome U.S. officials speculate that a portion of the UAP sightings, especially in the Southwest, could be attributable to advanced drone technology used by drug cartels for espionage or smuggling. Ron Vitiello, an advisor to U.S. Customs and Border Protection, noted that the 'unlimited funding' of cartels could enable them to deploy technologies previously unseen in the drone sector. This theory has been presented as a potential explanation for some of the unidentified objects observed in restricted military airspace.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Approximately 41 days - June 2025 begins in 10 days, plus the 30 days of June, plus potentially a few days for reports to be posted to the NUFORC website after the month ends.",
    "status_quo_outcome": "Yes - The status quo suggests this question will resolve as Yes. December 2024 recently had 6 cube-shaped UFO sightings reported to NUFORC, establishing a recent precedent that such reports do occur despite being described as rare.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "June 2025 sees typical levels of UFO reporting activity to NUFORC, but none of the reported sightings are described as cube-shaped. Other geometric shapes (spheres, triangles, cigars, discs) are reported instead, or witnesses describe objects with less specific shapes. The month simply represents natural variation where this rare shape category happens to have zero reports.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "At least one witness observes and reports what they describe as a cube-shaped UFO/UAP to NUFORC during June 2025. This could occur anywhere in the United States and continues the pattern established in recent months. Given summer weather and increased outdoor activity, sighting opportunities may actually increase.",
    "rationale": "The critical piece of evidence is that December 2024 had 6 cube-shaped sightings reported to NUFORC. While described as rare, this recent data point establishes that such reports do occur with some regularity. The question's resolution criteria only require ONE such report in June 2025, not multiple, which significantly increases the probability compared to asking for multiple sightings. Key factors supporting a higher probability: (1) Recent precedent of 6 in a single month, (2) Only needs 1 occurrence not 6, (3) June represents typical conditions for sightings, (4) NUFORC has been active for decades with consistent reporting patterns. Factors preventing a higher forecast: (1) The 'rare' descriptor suggests these don't happen every month, (2) December 2024 could represent an outlier month, (3) Month-to-month variation in specific shape categories could be substantial. Factors preventing a lower forecast: (1) The December 2024 data is very recent and relevant, (2) Only requiring 1 sighting makes this a much lower bar than multiple sightings. I would update upward if I learned that January-April 2025 also had multiple cube sightings, suggesting an ongoing trend. I would update downward if I learned December 2024 was a significant anomaly and no other recent months had cube sightings.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill the National UFO Reporting Center report a sighting of a cube-shaped UFO in June 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nAccording to the [National UFO Reporting Center](https://nuforc.org/about-us/): \"The National UFO Reporting Center was founded in 1974 by noted UFO investigator Robert J. Gribble. The Center’s primary function over the past five decades has been to receive, record, and to the greatest degree possible, corroborate and document reports from individuals who have been witness to unusual, possibly UFO-related events. Throughout its history, the Center has processed over 180,000 reports, and has distributed its information to thousands of individuals.\"\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if The National UFO Reporting Center posts a report of a sighting of a UFO/UAP shaped like a cube in June 2025 at [this link](https://nuforc.org/ndx/?id=event) when accessed by Metaculus on or after July 1, 2025.\n\nFor example, although rare in the history of NUFORC, the month of December 2024 [had](https://nuforc.org/subndx/?id=e202412) six sightings with a cube shape.\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nAccording to multiple news outlets, U.S. government bodies have documented 757 cases of Unidentified Aerial Phenomena (UAP) between May 2023 and June 2024.

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
