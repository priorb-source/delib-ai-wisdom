  "information": "Virgin Galactic announced it will release its financial results for the first quarter of 2025 on Thursday, May 15, 2025, followed by a conference call. The company's Q4 2024 earnings release on February 26, 2025, was not posted on the main News page, nor was the press release announcing the date for the Q1 2025 results. These communications were issued via the Investor Relations section and PR wires.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "About 33 days (now through June 1, 2025)",
    "status_quo_outcome": "Yes — no new posts appear on the News page in May 2025.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Virgin Galactic publishes at least one News page item between May 1–31, 2025 (e.g., cross-posting Q1 results, announcing a partnership, leadership change, program milestone, or other corporate update).",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "They continue their recent pattern of not using the main News page for routine investor communications; no flights or marketing pushes occur; any May announcements are confined to the Investor Relations site and PR wires, resulting in zero new News posts in May.",
    "rationale": "- Evidence and base rates: The News page has been sparse: last post Jan 30, 2025; prior post Dec 12, 2024; nothing for Feb–Apr. This indicates a low current cadence. Virgin Galactic paused flights to focus on Delta-class development, which historically drove many News posts; without flights, the pipeline for News content is thinner.\n- Investor Relations separation: The research assistant notes the Q4 2024 earnings release (Feb 26) and the Q1 2025 results date announcement were not placed on the main News page, but only in IR/PR wires. Q1 2025 results are set for May 15, but the recent pattern suggests these will not be mirrored to the News page, reducing the natural trigger for a May News post.\n- Status quo weighting: Given the recent 3-month dry spell and the company’s shift away from frequent operational updates, the default expectation is no new News post in May.\n- Why not higher than my forecast: There remains a meaningful chance of a one-off News post in May—e.g., a strategic update tied to earnings, a manufacturing milestone on the Delta-class, a partnership, leadership news, or a branding/marketing piece. A single such post would resolve the question as No.\n- Why not lower: Multiple recent IR communications were not cross-posted to News, and there have been no flights or evident PR campaigns to drive News content. The company’s cost-cutting and refocus suggest less proactive News-page activity.\n- What would move me up (toward Yes): Additional confirmation that Virgin Galactic never cross-posts earnings/IR items to News; signs of further communications pullback; another month-end with no April News posts (reinforcing cadence) before May begins.\n- What would move me down (toward No): Any late-April or early-May indication of a PR push (site redesign, fresh News content, media teasers), hints of significant May announcements beyond earnings, or evidence they intend to cross-post the May 15 results or a strategic update to the News page.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill Virgin Galactic fail to make any new posts on its News page in May 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nAs of April 19, 2025, Virgin Galactic's most recent post was timestamped January 30, 2025. The most recent one before then was December 12, 2024.\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if no new posts appear at Virgin Galactic's News page, which can be accessed at [this address](https://www.virgingalactic.com/news), timestamped after April 30, 2025 and before June 1, 2025. If there is a new post, then this question resolves as **No**.\n\n\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nVirgin Galactic announced it will release its financial results for the first quarter of 2025 on Thursday, May 15, 2025, followed by a conference call. The company's Q4 2024 earnings release on February 26, 2025, was not posted on the main News page, nor was the press release announcing the date for the Q1 2025 results. These communications were issued via the Investor Relations section and PR wires.\n\nToday is 2025-04-29.\n\nBefore answering you think:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n(e) You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
