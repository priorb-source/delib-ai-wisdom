    "review": "My colleagues' analyses were highly persuasive and well-reasoned. We all correctly identified the central tension: the Republican majority's political desire to pass this legislation versus the immense procedural and time constraints imposed by the biennial budget deadline. The other forecasters provided a valuable clarification by explicitly framing the \"budget amendment\" strategy as the most, and perhaps only, plausible path to a 'Yes' outcome. Their arguments that this strategy is politically risky—potentially complicating negotiations and creating internal caucus dissent—were particularly compelling and highlighted a factor I had underweighted in my initial analysis. While I had considered the possibility of the GOP pushing the bill through, I did not sufficiently account for leadership's potential aversion to jeopardizing a smooth budget process for a non-fiscal policy item.",
    "rationale": "I am lowering my forecast from 25% to 18%. The other forecasters have convinced me that the obstacles presented by the biennial budget process are more significant than I initially assessed. My initial forecast overweighted the raw power of the Republican supermajority and underweighted the procedural friction and political incentives that guide legislative leadership, particularly the desire to avoid complicating the must-pass budget bill. The arguments that attaching a controversial, non-germane rider is a politically risky move that leadership may be hesitant to make are strong. Therefore, a significant downward adjustment is warranted.\n\nHowever, I am remaining slightly higher than their forecasts of 10% and 15%. I believe the political salience of \"election integrity\" issues for the GOP base provides a very strong incentive to take this risk. With supermajorities in both chambers, the Republican leadership can afford to absorb more internal dissent and push through controversial measures with less fear of outright failure than a party with a slim majority. The risk of the budget *actually* failing over this is minimal; the risk is primarily one of political optics and internal friction, which I believe the current leadership is willing to accept to score a policy win for its base. My revised 18% forecast better reflects the high procedural difficulty, while still accounting for the potent political will of the unified Republican government.",
