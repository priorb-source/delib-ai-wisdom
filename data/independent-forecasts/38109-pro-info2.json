  "information": "The platform faces legal and regulatory challenges. A judge in Nevada is expected to rule quickly on a case involving Kalshi's prediction markets. Major sports leagues have voiced concerns; the NBA has cited 'substantial integrity risks' due to a perceived lack of regulatory oversight compared to traditional sportsbooks, and Major League Baseball has highlighted the need for consumer protections equivalent to state-level regulations. In response, Kalshi has announced plans to enhance user protections, including voluntary opt-outs, self-imposed trading breaks, and deposit caps.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "1 month",
    "status_quo_outcome": "Yes. Kalshi currently offers daily baseball markets and their business model incentivizes continuing to do so.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "A federal judge rules against Kalshi in the case brought by sports leagues before or during June 2025, issuing an injunction that forces the platform to suspend its daily baseball markets. This results in at least one day in June where no such market is offered.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "The judge's ruling is delayed past June 2025, or the ruling is favorable to Kalshi, or any unfavorable ruling is stayed pending appeal. This allows Kalshi to continue its operations uninterrupted, offering daily baseball markets every day throughout the month.",
    "rationale": "This forecast balances the powerful force of the status quo against a significant and immediate legal threat. Currently, Kalshi operates under CFTC oversight and offers sports-related markets, making the continuation of this practice the default outcome. However, the legal challenge from major sports leagues, as highlighted in the research, presents a critical uncertainty. The judge's stated intention to 'move quickly' elevates the probability of a resolution that could impact operations within the specified timeframe of June 2025. The core of my forecast is that while the legal threat is substantial, the bar to issue an injunction to halt an ongoing, regulated business activity is high, and legal processes often face delays. My probability is not higher because the question's 'every day' criterion makes it fragile; a negative judicial ruling at any point in June would flip the outcome to 'No'. The vocal opposition from powerful leagues like the MLB suggests they will press for a swift, decisive outcome. My probability is not lower because Kalshi has existing regulatory approval for its event contract model and will vigorously defend its position. Legal battles can be protracted, and it is plausible that Kalshi could continue operations through June even with the case pending or under appeal. My forecast would increase with news of a delayed ruling or a settlement favorable to Kalshi. Conversely, my forecast would decrease significantly upon the issuance of an injunction against Kalshi.",

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
