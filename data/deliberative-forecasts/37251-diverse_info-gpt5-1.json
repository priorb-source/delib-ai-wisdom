    "review": "Forecaster 2 adds a concrete (though now-missed) timeline: reports in Jan 2025 that the deal was in “final stages” and expected by Q1. That’s useful signal that substantive hurdles may have been cleared, but the slip past Q1 is a negative for our before-July window. Forecaster 3’s strongest new claim is that Vietnamese troops completed K9 training in Nov 2024; if accurate, that materially raises the likelihood of an eventual deal. However, I’m cautious: pre-acquisition training could reflect trials/familiarization rather than a finalized purchase, and I haven’t seen corroboration. Both forecasters argue above-50% despite only ~2 months left and the requirement for a government announcement; I think they underweight (a) Vietnam’s sensitivity about publicizing new, first-of-kind arms buys that could irk China, and (b) the possibility of a quiet signing with deferred disclosure. They also don’t incorporate Hanwha’s own guidance that more orders are expected in 2H 2025, which tilts timing against our cutoff. Still, their points nudge the base probability of an agreement existing upward relative to my prior.",
    "rationale": "I continue to see a clear strategic fit and credible reporting (20 K9s, ~$300M) that negotiations are real and advanced. The new-to-me elements—Jan “final stages/Q1” chatter and the claimed Nov 2024 training—raise the probability that an agreement is close or even substantially negotiated. However, the key constraint is the resolution requirement: a public government announcement before July 1. Vietnam often prefers discretion on sensitive acquisitions; as a first Korean defense sale, with China sensitivities and Vietnam’s internal approval scrutiny, a public G2G announcement within ~60 days is not the base case. Hanwha signaling more orders in 2H 2025 also biases timing beyond our window. Net, I move up modestly from 22% to 28% to reflect a higher chance that the deal is materially ready, while still giving heavy weight to the announcement/timing risk. Upward triggers: credible reports of imminent signing, a scheduled high-level visit with defense deliverables, or explicit DAPA/MND statements that negotiations are concluded and disclosure authorized. Downward triggers: reporting of confidentiality requests pushing announcement to 2H 2025, competing system selection, or signs of procurement slowdown tied to internal politics/anti-corruption.",
