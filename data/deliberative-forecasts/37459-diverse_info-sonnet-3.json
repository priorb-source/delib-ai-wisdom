    "review": "Forecaster 2 and 3 raise several critical points I underweighed. Most importantly, Forecaster 3's observation about SEC confidential treatment is crucial: Berkshire routinely requests confidentiality when building large positions (as with Chubb), and if granted, such positions wouldn't appear on the Q1 13F, automatically resolving this question as No even if purchases occurred. This significantly suppresses the probability of a Yes outcome.\n\nForecaster 2's evidence about 10 consecutive quarters of net selling through Q4 2024 and Buffett's specific recent comments criticizing the Mag 7 for increasing capital requirements are strong behavioral indicators I should have weighted more heavily. This isn't just historical reluctance - it's active, ongoing aversion paired with specific public commentary.\n\nForecaster 3 contradicts themselves slightly by raising the strongest argument against disclosure (confidential treatment) while maintaining the highest forecast at 12%. Forecaster 2's 5% feels more internally consistent with the evidence presented.\n\nThe Microsoft/Gates optics argument is interesting but probably overstated as a differentiator. The key distinction among candidates remains: Alphabet and Microsoft have business characteristics that could theoretically appeal to value-oriented managers, while Nvidia, Tesla, and Meta face more fundamental friction with Berkshire's philosophy.",
    "rationale": "After reviewing the other forecasters' analyses, I'm updating downward based on three key factors:\n\n1. **Confidential treatment mechanism**: This is the strongest new argument. If Berkshire were building a position in any Mag 7 stock, they would likely request SEC confidential treatment to avoid market impact during accumulation. This would prevent the position from appearing on the Q1 13F, meaning even actual purchases could resolve as No. This significantly reduces the probability of observing a Yes outcome.\n\n2. **Net selling pattern**: The evidence of 10 consecutive quarters of net selling through Q4 2024 is stronger than I initially weighted. Combined with reports that Berkshire was again a net seller in Q1 2025, this suggests systematic avoidance of new equity positions at current valuations, not just caution about specific sectors.\n\n3. **Specific public commentary**: Buffett's recent remarks specifically criticizing Mag 7 stocks for increasing capital requirements represents explicit, recent negative commentary that goes beyond historical patterns.\n\nThe primary remaining probability comes from: (a) a small disclosed position by Todd Combs or Ted Weschler in Alphabet or Microsoft that didn't warrant confidential treatment, and (b) the inherent uncertainty in forecasting specific portfolio decisions.\n\nI'm moving from 8% to 6%, aligning closer to Forecaster 2's conservative stance while maintaining slightly higher probability to account for the Todd/Ted latitude factor.",
