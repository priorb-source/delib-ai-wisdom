  "information": "In April 2025, China conducted the \"Strait Thunder-2025A\" military exercises, which involved dozens of aircraft and warships. According to a spokesperson for the Chinese Eastern Theater Command, the operation aimed to test China's capabilities in \"controlling zones\" and \"blockading\" Taiwan, and included simulations of \"strikes on key ports and energy infrastructure.\" Following these and other drills, US military officials, including US Pacific Army Commander Ronald P. Clark and US Indo-Pacific Command Commander Admiral Samuel Paparo, stated that China's exercises simulating a blockade of Taiwan have become a \"regular occurrence\" and that Beijing is rehearsing the \"full spectrum of military operations.\"",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Approximately 56 days, from May 6, 2025 to July 1, 2025",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No - China continues conducting military exercises that simulate blockades without implementing an actual blockade, and the US does not formally accuse China of an actual blockade",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "China continues its pattern of military exercises and demonstrations of force near Taiwan, including simulated blockade operations, but stops short of actually preventing ships from accessing Taiwanese seaports. The US continues monitoring and commenting on these exercises but does not make a formal accusation of an actual blockade being implemented.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "A crisis or escalation occurs where China transitions from simulated exercises to actually preventing commercial or other vessels from entering or leaving one or more of Taiwan's seaports. This could be triggered by a political event, incident, or deliberate Chinese decision to escalate pressure on Taiwan. The US government responds by publicly and formally accusing China of implementing an actual blockade.",
    "rationale": "The critical distinction in this question is between simulating a blockade (which China is currently doing in exercises) and actually implementing one (which would constitute an act of war). The research assistant's report confirms that China conducted exercises in April 2025 explicitly practicing blockade operations, and US military officials have acknowledged these are now a 'regular occurrence.' However, this represents the current status quo of intimidation through exercises rather than actual blockade implementation. Several factors suggest a low probability: (1) The short 56-day timeframe makes major geopolitical escalations statistically unlikely; (2) An actual blockade would carry enormous risks for China, potentially triggering US military intervention and causing massive economic disruption; (3) China is currently achieving its intimidation objectives through exercises without crossing into actual conflict; (4) The base rate for such dramatic escalations is very low - China has conducted exercises for years without implementing actual blockades. Factors that prevent an even lower estimate include: the recent April 2025 escalation showing increased activity, China's explicit practice of blockade operations suggesting preparation, and the reality that unexpected crises can emerge. For me to update significantly upward, I would need evidence of actual ships being denied port access, a major political trigger (like a Taiwan independence declaration), or intelligence suggesting imminent action. The status quo bias is strong here - the world changes slowly, and the gap between exercises and actual blockade represents an enormous threshold that would require deliberate high-level decision-making in Beijing to cross.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill the United States accuse the People's Republic of China of blockading Taiwan before July 1, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nWSJ via MSN: [China Is Ready to Blockade Taiwan. Here’s How.](https://www.msn.com/en-us/news/world/china-is-ready-to-blockade-taiwan-here-s-how/ar-AA1BvnW8)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if, before July 1, 2025, the US government publicly accuses the People's Republic of China of blockading at least one of Taiwan's seaports without consent from the Taiwanese government in Taipei.\n\n\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nIn April 2025, China conducted the \"Strait Thunder-2025A\" military exercises, which involved dozens of aircraft and warships.

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
