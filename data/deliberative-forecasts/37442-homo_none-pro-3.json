    "review": "My initial analysis was flawed because I accepted the premise of the question—that Berkshire had an existing stake in Domino's—without questioning the source. Forecaster 3's analysis was exceptional and transformative for my own. They correctly identified the critical, overriding factor: the entire basis for a 'Yes' outcome rests on a single, uncorroborated article from 'RetailWire', a non-specialist financial source. The lack of confirmation from any reputable financial news outlet is a massive red flag that I completely overlooked. This shifts the question from 'Will Berkshire add to a known position?' to 'Did Berkshire secretly initiate a large position based on a rumor?' The latter is a far lower probability event. Forecaster 2's reasoning about institutional inertia is sound, but it applies to the scenario where a stake is already known to exist; it's less relevant now that the existence of the initial stake is the primary uncertainty. Forecaster 3's reasoning is profoundly convincing and forces a major revision of my forecast.",
    "rationale": "I am significantly updating my forecast downward based on the deliberation. My original forecast of 35% was predicated on the faulty assumption that Berkshire Hathaway's initial purchase of Domino's stock was a confirmed fact. Forecaster 3 correctly pointed out that this premise is based on a single, unverified source, and my research assistant's report of 'No additional information available' should be interpreted as a lack of any corroborating evidence.\n\nThe probability of an unsubstantiated rumor from a non-financial news source about a secret Berkshire investment turning out to be true is extremely low. Large purchases, even when filed confidentially, often leave detectable traces like unusual trading volume that would be noted by the financial press. The complete absence of such reports is telling.\n\nTherefore, I am lowering my forecast from 35% to 10%. The new forecast is anchored on the very high likelihood that the founding premise is false. I am not lowering my forecast to near-zero because the scenario is not impossible. As Forecaster 3 noted, Domino's does fit the profile of a potential Berkshire investment (strong brand, simple business, franchise model), and Berkshire is known for making large, unexpected purchases. A 10% probability appropriately reflects that this would be a major surprise, contingent on a flimsy rumor coincidentally being correct, but is not entirely outside the realm of possibility.",
