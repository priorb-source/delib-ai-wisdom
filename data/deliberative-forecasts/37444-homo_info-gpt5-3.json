    "review": "Forecaster 2 adds materially new and persuasive information: on-record denials by SecState Rubio and opposition from Interior Sec Burgum, plus reporting that the President is weighing a 500% tariff package on Russian energy alongside expanded sanctions. These are strong, recent, public signals against any delisting and go beyond the earlier Politico report of internal debate. Forecaster 3’s analysis is broadly consistent with my prior reasoning—status quo, tight timeline, limited upside—but doesn’t add as much new evidence beyond acknowledging proposals to revive NS2. Overall, F2’s points meaningfully reduce the likelihood versus my initial 15%.",
    "rationale": "With ~8 weeks left, inertia dominates. The added signals—senior officials’ explicit denials and movement toward tougher measures (500% tariffs/expanded sanctions)—make a near-term delisting politically incoherent absent a major diplomatic breakthrough. The EU/German stance, the pipeline’s damage, and NS2 AG’s legal/financial troubles further cut the policy payoff from delisting. While the executive could move quickly, such a reversal would likely be telegraphed; current signaling runs the other way. I therefore lower my forecast from 15% to 8%. I would move up only on credible, multi-source reports of imminent sanctions relief tied to a Ukraine ceasefire/peace framework or explicit Treasury/State signals of a review; I would move down further if the tariff/sanctions package advances or additional Russia energy sanctions are announced.",
