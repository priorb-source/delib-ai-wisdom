    "review": "Both forecasters largely mirror my prior view: headline CPI remains on a knife-edge, with core slightly positive and food/energy dragging. They emphasize two points worth foregrounding: (1) May seasonality—holiday-related services strength vs potentially softer food—keeps the print close to zero; and (2) FRED rounding/display risk when values hover near 0.0, which could flip an actual small negative to a displayed 0.0, affecting resolution. They also note the lack of a decisive base-effect push in May and the modest impact of the mid-May RRR cut. No materially new hard data were added, but their emphasis on rounding/display and seasonal nuance is valid.",
    "rationale": "My baseline remains that weak demand (PMI <50, soft property), deep PPI deflation, and continued y/y drags from pork and domestic energy make another small negative headline slightly more likely than not. However, May Day services strength and firmer crude vs a year ago raise the odds of 0.0%/+0.1%. Given the resolution hinges on FRED’s displayed percent change from a year ago, rounding near zero is a material downside risk to a Yes even if the true value is slightly negative. I’m trimming my probability modestly to reflect that knife-edge/rounding risk and the plausible services offset. Change: 62% -> 60%.",
