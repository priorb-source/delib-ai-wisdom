  "information": "The preliminary University of Michigan Consumer Sentiment Index for April 2025 was 50.8, the second-lowest level since records began in 1952. This represented the fourth consecutive monthly decline, a drop of 11% from the March 2025 reading of 57.0, and a cumulative decline of over 30% since December 2024. According to Surveys of Consumers Director Joanne Hsu, the decline was 'pervasive and unanimous across age, income, education, geographic region, and political affiliation.'",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "About 2–3 weeks (Michigan prelim for May typically posts around May 10, 2025)",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No (a reading at or below April’s 50.8 would resolve No, and “no change” equals No)",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Inflation and gas-price headlines stay negative into early May; equities wobble; April jobs report (May 2) or Fed tone keeps rate-cut hopes dim. Sentiment dips again or stays around 50–51, coming in ≤50.8.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Some relief on prices at the pump or calmer inflation narrative; stable/positive markets and decent labor data. From a near-record trough, modest mean reversion nudges the index a point or two higher (e.g., 51–54).",
    "rationale": "Knowns: April 2025 preliminary Consumer Sentiment was 50.8—near a record low and the fourth straight monthly decline. The drop was broad-based across demographics. That establishes a very low base. The question resolves Yes only if May > 50.8; equal or lower is No. Timing-wise, the May preliminary will reflect early-May conditions, before the April CPI release but after the April jobs report and the late-April/early-May Fed meeting.\n\nBalancing forces:\n- Momentum/negatives (toward No): Four consecutive declines and recent upside inflation surprises have hurt sentiment, and gasoline prices have been rising seasonally. If that narrative persists into early May, another small downtick or flat print is plausible. With the threshold at 50.8, even “unchanged” resolves No.\n- Mean reversion/positives (toward Yes): At such depressed levels, the index has historically tended to bounce within 1–2 months in past troughs (e.g., 1980, 2008, 2022). The hurdle is very low: a 0.1+ increase yields Yes. Typical month-to-month volatility of several points makes a small uptick quite plausible, even without a major macro improvement.\n\nNet view: I put extra weight on the status quo because conditions don’t change rapidly most of the time, and the recent narrative (inflation sticky, gas up) leans negative. However, the extremely low level and small threshold slightly tilt the odds toward a modest rebound. That produces a probability just above 50%.\n\nWhy not higher: Persistent negative inflation news, rising gasoline prices, and four straight declines argue against confidently calling a rebound. If early-May data/news stay adverse or markets slide, ≤50.8 is quite plausible.\n\nWhy not lower: The base is near a record trough, and only a marginal improvement is required. Random month-to-month variation and mild normalization could easily lift the reading above 50.8.\n\nWhat would move me up: Clear decline in average gas prices into early May; positive market tone; April jobs report that reassures households (solid employment without reigniting inflation fears); a dovish Fed tone reducing rate/inflation anxiety.\n\nWhat would move me down: Further rise in pump prices; negative market shock; geopolitical escalation; April jobs report that spooks consumers (either notable cooling and layoff headlines or reacceleration that revives inflation fears).",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill the May 2025 University of Michigan Consumer Sentiment number be greater than it was for April 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nCNN: [US consumer sentiment plummets to second-lowest level on records going back to 1952](https://www.cnn.com/2025/04/11/economy/us-consumer-sentiment-april/index.html)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if the University of Michigan's reported Index of Consumer Sentiment, expected to be located [here](http://www.sca.isr.umich.edu/), is greater than 50.8 for May 2025. Less than or equal to that amount resolves the question as **No**.\n\nPreliminary results are sufficient to resolve the question. If there is any confusion about the number, Metaculus will resolve based on whatever number is posted at [this pdf](http://www.sca.isr.umich.edu/files/tbcics.pdf) that is labelled as May 2025, including preliminary. For example, on April 11, 2025 the number displayed was 50.8 for April 2025 (P).\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nThe preliminary University of Michigan Consumer Sentiment Index for April 2025 was 50.8, the second-lowest level since records began in 1952. This represented the fourth consecutive monthly decline, a drop of 11% from the March 2025 reading of 57.0, and a cumulative decline of over 30% since December 2024. According to Surveys of Consumers Director Joanne Hsu, the decline was 'pervasive and unanimous across age, income, education, geographic region, and political affiliation.'\n\nToday is 2025-04-22.\n\nBefore answering you think:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n(e) You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
