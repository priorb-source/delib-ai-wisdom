  "information": "According to a March 25, 2025 report, the Telecommunications Regulatory Commission of Sri Lanka (TRCSL) denied reports of plans to suspend Starlink's satellite broadband service. The TRCSL Director General stated that a 'dashboard system' is required to regulate the service and that its implementation had been delayed. The Director General mentioned that the service was expected to become operational in April 2025 once the necessary systems were in place.\n\nA separate report from March 23, 2025, stated that the Sri Lankan government had put Starlink services on hold until the company guarantees government agencies the right to intercept data or communication details for national security reasons. According to the Deputy Minister of Information Technology, discussions between the Defence Ministry, TRCSL, and Starlink were still at a preliminary stage. The report also noted that the TRCSL had already approved tariff plans for Starlink services.\n\nReports from late April and early May 2025 provide context on Starlink's expansion in the region. Bangladesh's telecommunication regulator granted Starlink two 10-year operating licenses, making it the second South Asian country after Sri Lanka to approve the service. Officials indicated that Starlink was preparing to launch service in Bangladesh by May 2025. In contrast, Starlink's full license in Pakistan is delayed pending permanent registration and the clearance of technical and security checks.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Approximately 6 weeks, from May 16, 2025 until July 1, 2025",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No - Starlink is not currently shown as available in Sri Lanka on the availability map",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "The security and data interception negotiations between the Sri Lankan government and Starlink continue to drag on beyond July 1st. The required dashboard system for regulation remains unimplemented due to technical or bureaucratic delays. Even though the license was granted and tariff plans approved, the service doesn't actually launch before the deadline, mirroring the delays seen in Pakistan's approval process.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "The preliminary security discussions rapidly conclude in late May with an agreement on data interception capabilities. The dashboard regulatory system gets implemented quickly in June. Starlink launches service in Sri Lanka by mid-to-late June and updates their availability map to show Sri Lanka as 'Available' before July 1st, following a similar timeline to Bangladesh which moved from approval to near-launch within weeks.",
    "rationale": "The status quo strongly favors a No outcome since Starlink is not currently available in Sri Lanka. While the license was granted in August 2024 and tariff plans were approved, significant obstacles remain. Most critically, as of late March 2025, the government put services on hold pending data interception guarantees for national security, with discussions described as still in 'preliminary stage.' Additionally, the required dashboard regulatory system has faced implementation delays. The fact that officials expected the service to be operational in April 2025 but it's now mid-May without launch is a negative signal indicating delays are running longer than anticipated. This mirrors Pakistan's situation where security and technical checks continue to delay final approval. On the positive side, there are still 6 weeks remaining, which is technically sufficient time for a launch if issues resolve quickly. The license and tariff approvals are already in place, removing some bureaucratic hurdles. Bangladesh's recent rapid progress from approval to near-launch shows regional feasibility. However, resolving complex government security requirements typically takes longer than 6-8 weeks, especially when discussions were still preliminary in late March. For my forecast to increase, I would need evidence that security negotiations have concluded or are near completion, and that the dashboard system implementation is underway. For it to decrease further, I would need reports of continued stalemates or new regulatory hurdles emerging. Given the missed April timeline and ongoing security negotiations, I weight the status quo heavily while acknowledging the non-zero possibility of rapid resolution.",
