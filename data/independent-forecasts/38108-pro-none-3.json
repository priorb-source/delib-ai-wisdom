    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Approximately one month.",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No. The Department of Government Efficiency (Doge) would likely still be in its early stages, identifying potential savings. Claiming a verified total of $200 billion by July 1, 2025, would be exceptionally fast for a government agency, making the status quo outcome a failure to meet this high threshold.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Doge identifies numerous areas of waste, but bureaucratic hurdles, inter-agency resistance, and the complexity of quantifying savings delay the official reporting process. By July 1, 2025, the total claimed savings on their website are a more modest figure, such as $50 billion, falling well short of the $200 billion target.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Driven by intense political pressure for a major, early victory, Doge employs an aggressive and highly optimistic accounting methodology. They may count the entire projected multi-year cost of a canceled program as 'saved' immediately. A top-down directive ensures a headline figure of $200 billion or more is published on the website by the deadline, prioritizing the political announcement over rigorous, time-consuming verification.",
    "rationale": "My forecast is based primarily on the extremely short timeframe and the immense scale of the claimed savings. Today is May 31, 2025, leaving only one month until the resolution date. For a government department, even a new one designed for speed, to identify, verify, and officially claim $200 billion in savings within such a short operational window is a monumental task. The status quo for any government process is slow and methodical. This sheer bureaucratic inertia is the strongest factor supporting a 'No' outcome. The research assistant's report contained no information, which I interpret as the absence of any public indications that Doge is on an accelerated track to meet this goal; such a massive success would likely be preceded by favorable leaks or press releases. However, the probability is not close to zero because the resolution criteria hinge on a 'claim' on a website, not on audited, realized savings. This creates an opening for a politically motivated outcome, where a large number is published to declare victory, regardless of the underlying accounting rigor. A 'Yes' scenario would almost certainly be driven by a high-level political directive to hit a specific number for public relations purposes. My forecast is not lower because the potential for such a political maneuver is non-trivial in the current political environment. It is not higher because even politically-driven claims require some bureaucratic foundation to seem credible, and the timeline severely constrains the ability to build that foundation. I would increase my forecast if there were official statements or credible leaks in June suggesting Doge was preparing a landmark announcement. I would decrease it if reports emerged of internal delays or political opposition effectively stalling the department's work.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill Doge claim a total savings of $200 billion or more on July 1, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nNY Post: [Tech guru admired by Elon Musk estimates ‘over $100 billion’ in taxpayer money is being wasted or stolen](https://nypost.com/2025/02/25/us-news/tech-guru-admired-by-elon-musk-estimates-over-100-billion-in-taxpayer-money-is-being-wasted-or-stolen/)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if the Department of Government Efficiency [claims](https://doge.gov/savings) a total estimated savings of greater than or equal to $200 billion when checked by Metaculus on or after July 1, 2025.\n\n\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nNo additional information available.\n\nToday is 2025-05-31.\n\nBefore answering you think:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n(e) You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
