    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Approximately 46 days until July 1, 2025",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No announcement is made",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Following the PM's resignation, President Vučić and the ruling SNS party manage to stabilize the government by appointing a new Prime Minister without calling for general elections. The political coalition holds together, or the decision-making process extends beyond July 1, 2025, with any election announcement coming later.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "The PM's resignation triggers sufficient political instability or pressure that the Serbian government decides to call snap elections. Within the next 46 days, President Vučić or the appropriate government authority officially announces a specific date for general elections, even if that election date itself is after July 1, 2025.",
    "rationale": "The question hinges on whether a Prime Minister's resignation will trigger an election announcement within 46 days. Key considerations: (1) Serbia recently held parliamentary elections in December 2023, making snap elections relatively soon afterward less typical but not unprecedented. (2) PM resignations can but don't always lead to elections - often a replacement PM is appointed from the ruling coalition. (3) President Vučić and the SNS party have significant control over the timing of elections and may prefer governmental stability over snap elections. (4) The timeframe of 46 days is sufficient for an announcement if the decision is made quickly, but political processes can extend longer. (5) The background explicitly mentions snap elections as a possibility, suggesting this is being discussed in Serbian politics. Without additional current information about the political dynamics, coalition stability, or statements from Serbian leaders about their intentions, I weight toward the status quo (no announcement) but give substantial probability to the significant political disruption caused by a PM resignation. The forecast is not higher because: PM resignations don't always trigger elections, recent elections reduce likelihood, and the ruling party may prefer stability. It's not lower because: PM resignations are major political events, 46 days is adequate time for an announcement decision, and the source material explicitly mentions this possibility. I would update higher with: statements from Vučić or government officials suggesting elections, coalition fracturing, or formal election processes beginning. I would update lower with: appointment of a new PM, coalition stability statements, or explicit denials of near-term elections.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill Serbia announce a general election before July 1, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\n[Serbia could face snap elections as PM’s resignation confirmed](https://tvpworld.com/85681783/serbia-could-face-snap-elections-as-pms-resignation-confirmed-)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if, before July 1, 2025, a specific date on which a general election will be held is officially announced by the government of Serbia or any of its agencies that have the authority to do so. If no such announcement occurs before July 1, 2025, this question resolves as **No**.\n\nThe election does not have to be held before July 1, 2025; this question resolves based on an announcement.\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nNo additional information available.\n\nToday is 2025-05-15.\n\nBefore answering you think:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n(e) You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
