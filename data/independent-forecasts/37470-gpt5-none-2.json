    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "About 54 days (until July 1, 2025)",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No announcement by ITKF before the deadline (thus the market resolves No).",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "ITKF continues discussions and formal bidding/ratification into later 2025, or selects/announces the 2026 host after July 1 (or chooses a different country).",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Within the next 1–2 months, ITKF’s board ratifies Egypt’s bid and issues an official announcement (website, press release, or official social channels) explicitly naming Egypt as the 2026 Traditional Karate World Championship host.",
    "rationale": "- Timing: Only ~7–8 weeks remain. Federations typically award world championships months to years in advance at a congress or executive meeting scheduled on a known calendar. Without evidence of an imminent ITKF decision window before July 1, the status quo favors no announcement in time.\n- Signal quality: The linked report states Egypt’s sports minister discussed hosting with the ITKF president—positive interest but not a formal bid acceptance or board ratification. Such talks often precede a longer process (bid submission, site inspections, executive approval) rather than an immediate award.\n- Governance/communications: Smaller federations can be slower or less standardized in communications. The criterion requires an explicit ITKF announcement; media speculation or local statements wouldn’t count. That raises the bar.\n- Event naming/federation ambiguity: Traditional karate has multiple international bodies (e.g., ITKF, WTKF). The article mentions a “World Cup,” whereas the resolution requires ITKF to announce Egypt hosting the 2026 World Championship. Mismatch risk lowers odds.\n- Why not higher: No corroborated timetable for an ITKF decision before July 1; only a discussion reported; potential for process/ratification to slip beyond the window.\n- Why not lower: Government-level engagement can accelerate decisions; Egypt frequently hosts international sports events and can provide strong guarantees, which could prompt a quicker-than-usual award.\n- Updates that would raise the forecast: ITKF publishes a decision date before July 1; reports of an executive board meeting this May/June; a signed MoU plus statements from ITKF indicating pending ratification; credible leaks naming Egypt as the chosen host.\n- Updates that would lower the forecast: ITKF indicates the host will be decided at a later congress (e.g., autumn 2025); emergence of competing bids with a later decision timeline; clarification that 2026 event belongs to another federation or that ITKF’s 2026 championship structure is undecided.\n- Research assistant: No additional information available, so the forecast leans on general process/base rates and the single article’s weak-positive signal.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nBefore July 1, 2025, will the International Traditional Karate Federation announce that Egypt has been chosen to host the 2026 Traditional Karate World Championship?\n\nQuestion background:\nVetoGate Egypt: [Ashraf Sobhi discusses hosting the 2026 World Cup with the President of the International Traditional Karate Federation](https://www.vetogate.com/5400045)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if, before July 1, 2025, the International Traditional Karate Federation announces that Egypt has been chosen to host the 2026 Traditional Karate World Championship.\n\n\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nNo additional information available.\n\nToday is 2025-05-08.\n\nBefore answering you think:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n(e) You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
