    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "A few weeks. NOAA typically releases its global climate report for a given month around the middle of the following month. Since today is June 2, 2025, the report for May 2025 is expected shortly.",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No. The long-term global warming trend continues, but the strong El Niño event of 2023-2024 has dissipated and transitioned to ENSO-neutral or La Niña conditions. This removes the short-term temperature boost, so May 2025 is extremely warm but falls just short of breaking a record set during the El Niño peak.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "The global climate system has transitioned into a moderate La Niña phase by May 2025. This natural, short-term cooling phenomenon temporarily suppresses global average temperatures enough that, despite the strong underlying warming trend, May 2025 does not surpass a previous record-warm May (such as May 2024) which occurred during a strong El Niño.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "The underlying long-term warming trend, fueled by record-high ocean heat content, proves to be overwhelmingly strong. Despite the absence of an El Niño, this powerful baseline warming, possibly combined with other minor warming factors like low aerosol concentrations, is sufficient to push the global average temperature for May 2025 just beyond the previous record.",
    "rationale": "My forecast is based on the interplay between the strong, persistent long-term warming trend and short-term natural variability, primarily the El Niño-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) cycle. The background trend of anthropogenic climate change makes any given month a plausible candidate for a new record. However, the record-breaking months of 2023 and early 2024 were amplified by a strong El Niño event. By May 2025, climate models overwhelmingly indicate that this El Niño has ended, with the climate system being in either an ENSO-neutral or a La Niña state. La Niña has a temporary global cooling effect. Therefore, for May 2025 to be the hottest on record, the underlying warming trend would have to be strong enough to overcome the absence of the El Niño 'boost' and surpass a previous record that likely had it. While possible, this makes a new record less likely than not. The research assistant's report provided no new information, so this forecast relies on established climate science principles. My forecast is not higher because the transition away from El Niño represents a significant headwind against setting a new record. It is not lower because the long-term warming trend is exceptionally powerful, and record-high ocean heat content provides a persistent source of warmth, giving the month a non-trivial chance of becoming the new record holder even without El Niño. I would increase my forecast if data for April 2025 came in at a record high, or if other unforeseen warming factors emerged. I would decrease it if a strong La Niña developed more rapidly than currently anticipated.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill NOAA report that May 2025 is the hottest May on record?\n\nQuestion background:\n[NOAA Climate change impacts](https://www.noaa.gov/education/resource-collections/climate/climate-change-impacts)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if NOAA at its [Climate at a Glance Global Rankings](https://www.ncei.noaa.gov/access/monitoring/climate-at-a-glance/global/rankings/globe/tavg/land_ocean/202504) tracker reports that May 2025 is the 1st warmest on record.\n\nEnsure that Region is set to Global. Ensure that Surface is set to Land and Ocean.\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nNo additional information available.\n\nToday is 2025-06-02.\n\nBefore answering you think:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n(e) You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
