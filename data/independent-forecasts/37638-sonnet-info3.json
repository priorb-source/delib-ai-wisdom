  "information": "The Texas Legislature's regular session is scheduled to end on May 26, 2025, leaving a narrow window for new legislation to pass through all required procedural steps in both chambers and be signed by the governor. While Lieutenant Governor Dan Patrick has threatened to force a special session, only Governor Greg Abbott can officially call one and set its agenda. As of mid-May, Governor Abbott's stated public priorities for the session did not include a THC ban. Public opinion appears to favor more access; a University of Houston survey found that 62% of Texans support marijuana legalization and 79% support a comprehensive medical marijuana program. Veterans' groups have also testified in opposition to a ban, citing THC products as an alternative to opioids.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Approximately 48 days until July 1, 2025. The Texas Legislature's regular session ends May 26, 2025 (12 days away), leaving only about 5 additional weeks for any potential special session activity.",
    "status_quo_outcome": "NO - No comprehensive THC ban is currently in effect in Texas. If nothing changes, no new law prohibiting THC sales will be enacted before the deadline.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "The regular legislative session ends on May 26 without passing a comprehensive THC ban. Governor Abbott does not call a special session, or if he does, the agenda does not include a THC ban, or the legislature fails to pass such legislation before July 1, 2025.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "In the remaining 12 days of the regular session, both chambers of the Texas Legislature rapidly pass a comprehensive THC ban bill through all required procedural steps, and Governor Abbott signs it into law. Alternatively, Abbott calls a special session specifically to address THC prohibition, the legislature passes the bill, and he signs it - all before July 1.",
    "rationale": "Multiple factors strongly suggest a NO outcome. First, the timeline is extremely compressed - only 12 days remain in the regular session, and legislative processes typically require multiple readings, committee approvals, and floor votes in both chambers. My research assistant notes that Governor Abbott's stated public priorities for this session do not include a THC ban, which is a critical factor since only he can call a special session and set its agenda. While Lieutenant Governor Patrick has threatened to force a special session, he lacks the constitutional authority to do so. Second, public opinion creates significant political headwinds: 62% of Texans support marijuana legalization and 79% support comprehensive medical marijuana programs. Veterans' groups have actively opposed a ban, citing THC as an alternative to opioids. This level of opposition makes it politically costly to pursue such legislation. Third, the status quo heavily favors continuation of current policy - no comprehensive ban exists, and changing the status quo requires coordinated action across multiple institutional actors within a very narrow timeframe. The forecast is not lower (e.g., 2-3%) because Lieutenant Governor Patrick's public statements indicate some political will exists, and legislatures can occasionally move quickly on priority items in closing days. Emergency procedures could theoretically accelerate passage. The forecast is not higher (e.g., 20-30%) because all the structural and political factors would need to align perfectly in an extremely short timeframe, against clear public opposition and without evident gubernatorial support. For me to update toward YES, I would need to see: Governor Abbott explicitly calling for a THC ban, rapid movement of specific legislation through committee in both chambers, or announcement of a special session with THC prohibition on the agenda. For me to update further toward NO: The regular session ending without action, or explicit statements from Abbott declining to pursue this issue.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill the state of Texas ban THC before July 1, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nBeaumont Enterprise: [Will THC see its final death blow in Texas this session?](https://www.beaumontenterprise.com/news/article/texas-senate-bill-aims-ban-thc-activists-call-20279801.php)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if before July 1, 2025, Texas enacts a law prohibiting the sale of THC. If no new prohibitions on the sale of THC become law in Texas before that date, this question resolves as No.\n\nFor it to count, a law must fully prohibit the sale of THC within the state. This question resolves upon a ban being signed into law, rather than when it is implemented. An enacted law being later overturned will not cause the question to re-resolve. Partial bans (for example laws prohibiting the sale of THC to persons under 21 years of age) will not count. This question pertains to the sale of THC within the state, not to the purchase of it by individuals.\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nThe Texas Legislature's regular session is scheduled to end on May 26, 2025, leaving a narrow window for new legislation to pass through all required procedural steps in both chambers and be signed by the governor.

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
