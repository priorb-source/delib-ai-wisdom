  "information": "According to the U.S. Department of Labor, initial jobless claims for the week ending May 31, 2025, rose by 8,000 to 247,000, the highest level in eight months. The figure for the prior week was revised to 239,000. The four-week moving average increased to 235,000, the highest since November 2021. For the week ending May 24, the number of continuing claims was 1.904 million, a slight decrease of 3,000 from the previous week.\n\nBroader labor market indicators suggest a softening trend. A report from Challenger, Gray & Christmas showed that U.S.-based employers announced 93,816 job cuts in May, which is 47% higher than in May 2024. Separately, the ADP employment report revealed that only 37,000 jobs were created in the private sector in May, the lowest figure in a year. Both the Federal Reserve's Beige Book report and an Institute for Supply Management (ISM) survey pointed to weakening conditions, with widespread comments about economic uncertainty delaying new hiring.\n\nThe recent rise in jobless claims was not uniform across the country. The largest increases in initial claims for the week ending May 31 were in Michigan, Nebraska, California, Florida, and Virginia. The largest decreases were reported in Massachusetts, Illinois, Texas, Washington, and New York. Several major corporations have announced layoffs in 2025, including Procter & Gamble, Microsoft, Citigroup, Walmart, Meta, and Disney.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "The data for the week ending June 21, 2025, will be released by the Department of Labor, likely on Thursday, June 26, 2025. This is approximately 3 weeks from today's date of June 6, 2025.",
    "status_quo_outcome": "Yes. The most recent initial jobless claims report was 247,000, and the four-week moving average is 235,000. Both figures are substantially higher than the 220,000 threshold. If this current state persists, the outcome will be Yes.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "A 'No' outcome would involve a reversal of the recent upward trend. This could happen if the recent spike in claims was a temporary anomaly caused by a few large, isolated layoffs. A brief pause in new layoffs combined with stronger-than-anticipated seasonal hiring could cause the number for this specific week to dip below the 220,000 threshold.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "A 'Yes' outcome is realized if the current, clear trend of a softening labor market continues. The cumulative effect of previously announced corporate layoffs continues to be reflected in the data, and persistent economic uncertainty prevents a rebound in hiring, keeping the weekly initial claims number elevated above 220,000.",
    "rationale": "My forecast is based on strong evidence that the labor market is cooling, making it highly likely that initial claims will remain above the 220,000 threshold. The primary evidence is the recent claims data itself: the latest weekly figure of 247,000 is the highest in eight months, and the four-week moving average of 235,000 is the highest since late 2021. This indicates a sustained upward trend, not just a one-week anomaly. This trend is corroborated by multiple other indicators provided in the research report. Announced job cuts are up 47% year-over-year, the ADP report showed anemic private sector job creation, and qualitative reports like the Fed's Beige Book confirm widespread business caution in hiring. The announced layoffs from major corporations like Microsoft, Walmart, and Meta will likely continue to filter into the weekly data over the coming period. My probability is not higher than 85% because initial jobless claims are a volatile, high-frequency dataset. A single week can be noisy, and a random dip below the threshold, while unlikely given the trend, cannot be entirely ruled out. My probability is not lower because doing so would require ignoring the compelling and consistent evidence from multiple independent sources all pointing towards a weaker labor market. A forecast below 80% would be underweighting the clear status quo. I would raise my forecast if the next two weekly claims reports also come in above 230,000. Conversely, I would lower my forecast if the next report shows a sharp, unexpected drop below 225,000, especially if paired with other positive economic surprises.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill initial jobless claims for the week ended June 21, 2025 exceed 220,000?\n\nQuestion background:\nAccording to the resolution source, \"An initial claim is a claim filed by an unemployed individual after a separation from an employer.

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any).
