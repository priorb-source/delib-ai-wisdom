  "information": "The 2025 Derbyshire County Council election is scheduled for May 1, 2025. This election will use new divisional boundaries, increasing the total number of seats from 61 to 64. Elections for the council operate under a First-Past-The-Post system. According to an assessment, the Conservative Party holds 57 of the 64 seats under the new boundaries. Reform UK currently holds zero seats on the council.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "The election is on May 1, 2025. Results are expected within a day or two, so approximately 11 days.",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No. The Conservative Party holds a notional 57 of the 64 seats under the new boundaries, while Reform UK currently holds zero seats. A continuation of the status quo would see the Conservatives win the most seats.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "The Conservative Party retains control of the council, possibly with a reduced majority, or another established party like Labour makes significant gains. Reform UK wins a handful of seats at most, or none at all, falling far short of the number needed to have the most seats.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "An unprecedented political realignment occurs where the Conservative vote completely collapses and transfers almost entirely to Reform UK. This wave of support is highly concentrated in enough individual divisions to allow Reform UK to win a plurality of seats, going from zero to over 20 seats in a single election.",
    "rationale": "My forecast is based on the extremely high structural barriers facing Reform UK. The starting position is the most critical factor: under the new boundaries, the Conservatives notionally hold 57 of 64 seats, while Reform UK holds zero. To win the most seats, Reform would need an electoral swing of historic proportions, likely winning over 20, and possibly over 32 seats. The First-Past-The-Post electoral system heavily favors incumbent parties and parties with geographically concentrated support. It is a major obstacle for a new challenger party whose support may be spread thinly across many divisions rather than being concentrated enough to win any single one. While national political sentiment may be shifting, translating that into effective local campaigns that can unseat established councillors is a monumental task. There is no historical precedent for a party coming from zero seats to win a county council election in one cycle in these circumstances. Therefore, the probability of a 'Yes' outcome is exceptionally low. My forecast is not zero because a sudden, dramatic shift in voter allegiance, while highly improbable, is not strictly impossible in a volatile political climate. I would need to see credible, division-level polling for Derbyshire showing a commanding and concentrated lead for Reform UK to increase my forecast.",

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
