    "review": "The other two forecasters provided highly convincing arguments that I had previously underweighted. Both correctly pointed out that a single favorable poll is unlikely to be a sufficient catalyst for a major strategic shift, as leaders typically require sustained polling leads. Their emphasis on the severe political risks of a unilateral announcement—such as a unionist boycott and lack of international recognition, potentially damaging the independence cause long-term—was a crucial point. Forecaster 3 also introduced a key piece of context I had overlooked: the SNP's alternative strategy of framing general elections as 'de facto' referendums. This provides the Scottish government with another avenue to pursue its goals, making a high-risk, unilateral referendum announcement less likely and necessary in the immediate term. These arguments collectively paint a much clearer picture of why the status quo is overwhelmingly likely to hold.",
    "rationale": "After reviewing the other analyses, I am revising my forecast downward significantly. My initial assessment over-weighted the political pressure from a single opinion poll and the leniency of the resolution criteria. The other forecasters correctly highlighted the immense strategic risks and downsides for the Scottish National Party (SNP) in calling a referendum that would be legally unenforceable and politically divisive without broad support.\n\nThe core of my updated reasoning is that the political and legal barriers are more formidable than I first assessed. The 2022 UK Supreme Court ruling effectively requires consent from the UK government, which is not forthcoming from either major UK party. While the question allows for a purely symbolic announcement, the potential for such a move to backfire on the independence movement is substantial—it could be easily dismissed, boycotted by unionists, and damage the SNP's credibility. Furthermore, the SNP has pursued an alternative strategy of treating UK general elections as 'de facto' referendums, which diverts political capital away from organizing a separate, unsanctioned vote. Given the extremely short timeframe of less than two months and the complete absence of any political groundwork or signaling for such an announcement, the path of least resistance and greatest strategic sense for the Scottish government is to not act before the deadline. I have reduced my probability from 20% to 5% to reflect this, with the remaining 5% accounting for the small, but not zero, possibility of a surprise political gambit.",
