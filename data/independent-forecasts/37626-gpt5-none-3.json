    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "About 4 weeks (BLS typically releases May CPI/average prices around mid-June 2025).",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No — recent banana average prices have generally been at or above $0.6300/lb, so the default is a reading ≥ $0.6300.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Supply-chain and grower/shipper cost pressures persist into May (fuel, labor, port fees), retailers keep pass-through in place, and the May average price lands around $0.635–$0.655.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Improved supply and logistics plus retailer promotions nudge prices down; a strong USD softens import costs; May lands at $0.626–$0.629.",
    "rationale": "Banana average prices move slowly and with low month-to-month volatility. The threshold ($0.6300) sits near recent levels, but recent narratives (e.g., producer price increases, logistics costs) lean slightly upward. With limited time left and typically small monthly changes, the status quo (≥ $0.6300) deserves extra weight. Countervailing forces exist: seasonal supply, a relatively firm dollar, and potential retail promotions could tip a reading just below $0.6300. However, given reports of upward pricing pressure and the tendency for average prices to be sticky, sub-$0.6300 requires a modest but not typical downside move. My research assistant provided no additional data, so I’m relying on historical stability, recent upward bias, and standard seasonality. Not higher: seasonality and potential easing logistics can cap prices and create some chance of a dip below $0.6300. Not lower: recent price hikes and sticky retail pricing make a sub-$0.6300 print less likely. I would update upward if the April 2025 BLS banana price (to be released mid-May) is clearly above $0.635 or if there’s fresh evidence of continued pass-through of higher costs. I would update downward if April prints near/below $0.630, if fuel/shipping costs drop notably, or if widespread retail promotions are reported.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill the price of bananas reported by the US BLS for May 2025 be under 63 cents a pound?\n\nQuestion background:\nQuartz: [Move over, eggs – bananas are the next victim](https://qz.com/bananas-dole-price-hikes-inflation-port-fees-trump-tari-1851772583)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if the price reported by the Bureau of Labor Statistics [here](https://data.bls.gov/toppicks?survey=ap) for Bananas, per lb. - APU0000711211, to the thousandths of a decimal point, is under $0.6300 for May 2025.\n\n\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nNo additional information available.\n\nToday is 2025-05-13.\n\nBefore answering you think:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n(e) You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
