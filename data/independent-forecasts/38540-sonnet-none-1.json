    "no_outcome_scenario": "Anthropic's Claude, Google's Gemini, or another competitor's model holds the #1 overall rank on July 1, 2025, with OpenAI models ranked #2 or lower. This could occur if recent releases from competitors have outperformed OpenAI's offerings or if OpenAI hasn't released a competitive update recently.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "An OpenAI model (such as GPT-4 Turbo, GPT-4.5, or GPT-5) is ranked #1 overall or tied for #1 on the Chatbot Arena Leaderboard on July 1, 2025. This could result from a recent strong release, sustained performance of existing models, or improvements that have elevated OpenAI to the top position.",
    "rationale": "With only 16 days until resolution, the status quo carries heavy weight since major leaderboard shifts are unlikely in such a short timeframe unless a new model is released. The Chatbot Arena Leaderboard has historically shown intense competition between OpenAI, Anthropic, Google, and other frontier AI labs, with rankings at the top often separated by small margins. The fact that ties count as #1 increases the probability somewhat, as multiple models can share the top position. Without current leaderboard access, I must weigh OpenAI's historical competitiveness (they've often been at or near the top) against the multi-polar nature of the current AI landscape. Key uncertainties: (1) whether OpenAI currently holds #1 or is close to it, (2) whether any competitor is planning an imminent release, (3) the specific evaluation criteria weights in the 'overall' ranking. My forecast is not higher because multiple strong competitors exist and OpenAI doesn't consistently dominate every leaderboard metric. It's not lower because OpenAI remains a frontier lab with strong models and ties count as Yes. I would update upward if I knew OpenAI currently held #1 or had just released a strong model; downward if competitors clearly dominated or OpenAI was trailing significantly.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill an OpenAI model be ranked #1 overall on the Chatbot Arena Leaderboard at the end of the 2nd Quarter of 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nMethodology: [Chatbot Arena: An Open Platform for Evaluating LLMs by Human Preference](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.04132)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if a model owned by OpenAI is in the number 1 overall rank (ties count) at the [Chatbot Arena Leaderboard](https://lmarena.ai/leaderboard) when accessed by Metaculus on or after July 1, 2025. If this is not the case, this question resolves as **No**.\n\nScroll down to Arena Overview and the resolution is based on the \"overall\" rank.\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nNo additional information available.\n\nToday is 2025-06-15.\n\nBefore answering you think:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n(e) You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
