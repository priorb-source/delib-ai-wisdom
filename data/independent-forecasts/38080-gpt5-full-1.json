  "information": "On May 22, 2025, the U.S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS) revoked Harvard University's certification for the Student and Exchange Visitor Program (SEVP). Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem announced the decision was due to Harvard's repeated failure to comply with federal law and reporting requirements. The administration accused Harvard of fostering violence, antisemitism, and coordinating with the Chinese Communist Party. Other justifications cited by DHS included creating an 'unsafe environment' hostile to Jewish students, failing to address incidents of campus harassment, and not providing requested government information regarding the conduct of foreign students.\n\nThe SEVP certification revocation would prohibit Harvard from enrolling new international students holding F or J visas for the 2025-2026 academic year. The decision affects approximately 6,800 current international students, who constitute about 27% of Harvard's student body. These students would be required to transfer to other SEVP-certified institutions or risk losing their legal status in the United States. Following the announcement, the University of Tokyo stated it is considering accepting affected Harvard students, and the Chinese Foreign Ministry pledged to protect the rights of its overseas students.\n\nIn response to the DHS action, Harvard University filed a lawsuit against the administration. On May 23, 2025, a federal judge granted Harvard a temporary restraining order (TRO), which has halted the enforcement of the SEVP certification revocation. As a result of the TRO, Harvard's certification is currently considered active. The university's lawsuit alleges that the administration's actions are unconstitutional retaliation that violates the First Amendment, the Due Process Clause, and the Administrative Procedure Act. A court hearing to determine whether a preliminary injunction will be issued is scheduled for May 29.",

    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "33 days",
    "status_quo_outcome": "Yes — Harvard’s SEVP certification is currently active under a court-issued TRO; if nothing material changes before July 1, certification would still be in effect.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "The court denies a preliminary injunction on or after the May 29 hearing, dissolving the TRO; the district court declines to stay its order, and the First Circuit also denies Harvard’s request for an emergency stay pending appeal. DHS promptly enforces the revocation in June (terminating Harvard’s SEVP school record and DSO authority), so by July 1 Harvard lacks certification.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "The court grants a preliminary injunction keeping Harvard’s certification active through July 1 (and likely until merits). Alternatively, even if the PI is denied, Harvard secures an emergency administrative stay from the First Circuit that preserves certification through July 1. A negotiated administrative pause by DHS that keeps certification in effect through July 1 would also yield Yes.",
    "rationale": "Key facts from the research assistant: DHS revoked Harvard’s SEVP certification on May 22; a TRO granted May 23 has halted enforcement, so Harvard’s certification is currently active; a preliminary-injunction hearing is set for May 29. The decision affects ~6,800 international students (27% of the student body).\n\nReasoning: With only 33 days to the resolution date, courts typically preserve the status quo where irreparable harm is clear and the merits are nonfrivolous. Here, irreparable harm to thousands of students and the institution is substantial, and Harvard alleges APA and constitutional defects. Even if the district court denies a preliminary injunction, it may briefly stay its ruling to allow appellate review, and the First Circuit could issue an emergency stay. Any of these outcomes would keep certification in effect on July 1.\n\nWhy not higher: The administration is signaling willingness to push aggressive measures and will argue campus safety/national-security rationales that some judges may credit. If the district court denies a PI and the First Circuit declines a stay, DHS could implement the revocation in June, producing a No by July 1. The short runway cuts both ways: it gives courts time to act but also gives the government time to enforce if relief is denied.\n\nWhy not lower: The status quo is that certification remains active under the TRO. Courts often maintain the status quo in cases with large-scale, immediate harms to third parties (students) while litigation proceeds. The 33-day window makes it more likely that some form of interim judicial relief (PI or appellate stay) persists through July 1, even if merits are contested.\n\nUpdate triggers:\n- Upward: District court grants PI; DHS signals administrative pause/reinstatement through summer; indications that DHS’s process skipped required procedures.\n- Downward: District court denies PI without a stay; swift First Circuit denial of emergency relief; credible government showing that procedural requirements were met and immediate enforcement is necessary for safety/national security.\n\nOverall, I place extra weight on the status quo and the propensity of courts to prevent disruptive changes pending full adjudication. That yields a moderately high chance Harvard still has SEVP certification on July 1.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill Harvard University have a Student and Exchange Visitor Program certification on July 1, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nThe Trump administration and Harvard University have been through a significant confrontation, since Trump took office for the second time. This [started](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/22/us/politics/harvard-university-trump.html) with a task force commissioned by Trump to address antisemitism on campus, but quickly spiralled out of control. The administration asked Harvard to provide detailed records on foreign students, including disciplinary actions and involvement in protests, and demanded that Harvard implement changes to its admissions, hiring, and diversity policies. Harvard refused, citing concerns over academic freedom and student privacy. In response, the administration froze or pulled almost \\$4 billion in federal grants and contracts to Harvard and its research partners. Harvard filed a lawsuit against the administration, accusing it of attempting to interfere in academic decision-making and penalising the institution for resisting politically motivated demands.\r\n\r\nThe situation escalated on May 22, 2025, when the Department of Homeland Security [revoked](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/22/us/politics/trump-harvard-international-students.html) Harvard's certification under the Student and Exchange Visitor Program, effectively barring the university from enrolling international students for the 2025–2026 academic year. This action affects approximately 6,800 international students or 27% of Harvard's student body, who must now transfer to other institutions or risk losing their legal status. The administration justified the move by accusing Harvard of fostering a \"toxic campus climate,\" failing to protect Jewish students, and allegedly collaborating with the Chinese Communist Party.\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question will resolve as **Yes** if, on July 1, 2025, Harvard University has a certification under the Student and Exchange Visitor Program (SEVP) programme allowing international students to enroll, according to [credible sources](https://www.metaculus.com/faq/#definitions).\n\n* An announcement that Harvard's certification will be restored on a date after July 1, 2025 will not suffice to resolve this question. The certification needs to be in effect for this to resolve.\r\n* Getting the certification at any point on July 1, 2025 would resolve this question as **Yes**.\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nOn May 22, 2025, the U.S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS) revoked Harvard University's certification for the Student and Exchange Visitor Program (SEVP).

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any).
