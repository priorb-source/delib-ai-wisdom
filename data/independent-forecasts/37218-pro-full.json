  "information": "Donald Trump has a history of attending UFC events in the United States, typically appearing at 2 to 4 cards per year since 2019. All of his previous appearances have been at domestic events. He has a strong personal relationship with UFC President Dana White. Trump recently attended a UFC event in Miami in April 2025. Historically, he has not attended two consecutive numbered UFC cards within a one-month span; UFC 315 is scheduled to take place four weeks after the Miami event.\n\nUFC 315 is scheduled for May 10, 2025, at the Bell Centre in Montreal, Quebec, Canada. The event's fight card includes two title fights, with a welterweight championship bout between Belal Muhammad and Jack Della Maddalena as one of the main events. No sitting or former U.S. president has previously attended a UFC event held in Canada or any other foreign country.\n\nJoe Rogan, a prominent UFC commentator, has publicly announced he will not be attending UFC 315 in Montreal. He cited his discontent with the Canadian government as the reason, stating he 'doesn't go to Canada anymore' and would 'rather go to Russia.' Rogan also mentioned that he had discussed US-Canada relations with Donald Trump, who had joked about Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "12 days",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Donald Trump adheres to his established pattern of exclusively attending domestic UFC events and does not travel to Montreal for UFC 315.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "At the special invitation of UFC President Dana White, Donald Trump decides to break precedent and make a political statement by attending the international event in Montreal, Canada.",
    "rationale": "My forecast is heavily weighted towards a 'No' outcome, primarily based on precedent and location. The key factor is that UFC 315 is being held in Montreal, Canada. No sitting or former U.S. president has ever attended a UFC event outside of the United States. This represents a significant break from established behavior. Furthermore, as noted by my research assistant, Trump attended a UFC event in Miami just four weeks prior to UFC 315. His historical pattern shows he does not typically attend two numbered cards in such quick succession. The public statements from Joe Rogan, a prominent UFC figure and acquaintance of Trump, about his own refusal to travel to Canada due to political disagreements with the government, hint at a potentially unfavorable view of such a trip within Trump's circle. The status quo is for Trump to attend domestic events only, and the evidence strongly suggests this pattern will continue.\n\nMy probability is not lower than 5% because Trump's actions can be unpredictable, and his personal relationship with Dana White is very strong. It is conceivable, though unlikely, that he would make the trip for political or personal reasons, using the international stage to his advantage. Therefore, the possibility cannot be completely dismissed.\n\nMy probability is not higher than 5% because the combined weight of the unprecedented international location and the timing so close to his last appearance makes attendance highly improbable. The logistical and potential diplomatic complexities of a former president attending an event in a foreign country are significant barriers compared to a domestic appearance.\n\nI would increase my forecast upon credible reports of Trump planning to travel to Canada, or an announcement from his team or Dana White confirming his attendance. Conversely, I would decrease my forecast if his official schedule showed a conflicting event.",

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any).
