  "information": "Donald Trump has a history of attending UFC events in the United States, typically appearing at 2 to 4 cards per year since 2019. All of his previous appearances have been at domestic events. He has a strong personal relationship with UFC President Dana White. Trump recently attended a UFC event in Miami in April 2025. Historically, he has not attended two consecutive numbered UFC cards within a one-month span; UFC 315 is scheduled to take place four weeks after the Miami event.\n\nUFC 315 is scheduled for May 10, 2025, at the Bell Centre in Montreal, Quebec, Canada. The event's fight card includes two title fights, with a welterweight championship bout between Belal Muhammad and Jack Della Maddalena as one of the main events. No sitting or former U.S. president has previously attended a UFC event held in Canada or any other foreign country.\n\nJoe Rogan, a prominent UFC commentator, has publicly announced he will not be attending UFC 315 in Montreal. He cited his discontent with the Canadian government as the reason, stating he 'doesn't go to Canada anymore' and would 'rather go to Russia.' Rogan also mentioned that he had discussed US-Canada relations with Donald Trump, who had joked about Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau.",

    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "About 12 days (until the evening of May 10, 2025)",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Trump remains in the U.S. for political, legal, or personal schedule reasons and does not attempt Canadian entry; or he considers attending but does not obtain/seek Canadian admissibility and stays away.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Dana White extends a high-profile invitation, Trump secures a Canadian Temporary Resident Permit or otherwise gains entry, and he makes a surprise appearance at the Bell Centre on fight night.",
    "rationale": "Baseline: Trump frequently attends UFC events in the U.S. (roughly 2–4 per year since 2019) and has a close relationship with Dana White. He attended a Miami UFC card in April 2025. However, he has never attended a UFC event outside the U.S., and no sitting or former U.S. president has attended a UFC event in a foreign country. UFC 315 is in Montreal, Canada, on May 10.\n\nKey friction: Canada generally deems foreign nationals with certain criminal convictions inadmissible. Trump was convicted in New York in 2024, which would typically require a Temporary Resident Permit (TRP) or similar dispensation to enter Canada. While high-profile exceptions are possible, attending a sporting event is a relatively weak justification compared to business or diplomatic necessity. There is no public indication that such a permit has been pursued or granted.\n\nAdditional headwinds:\n- Quick turnaround: He rarely attends two numbered cards within a ~1-month window. UFC 315 is four weeks after the Miami event.\n- Logistical/security complexity of a foreign appearance (especially unprecedented in UFC context) versus the ease of recurring U.S. appearances.\n- Joe Rogan is not attending Montreal and has publicly criticized Canada, which slightly lowers the social pull for a marquee entourage-style appearance.\n\nStatus quo weighting: The world changes slowly; historically he attends domestic UFCs and skips international cards. With only ~12 days left and no credible signals of Canadian entry clearance or UFC promotion teasing his attendance, the default is No.\n\nWhy not higher: Border/admissibility risk is a major gating factor; foreign travel for a leisure event is atypical; no warm-up signals (permits, security planning leaks, UFC promo hints). The precedent of zero foreign UFC attendances is strong.\n\nWhy not lower: Trump is unpredictable, has a strong relationship with Dana White, and can act on short notice. A TRP could theoretically be arranged quickly for a high-profile visitor. The card has title fights, which increases event prestige.\n\nWhat would move me up: Credible reporting that (1) Canada has issued or will issue a TRP for Trump, (2) Trump’s team or Dana White hints at a Montreal appearance, (3) flight/manifest sightings of Trump heading to Montreal, (4) coordination details from local authorities/venue suggesting a VIP visit, or (5) UFC 315 venue change to the U.S.\n\nWhat would move me down: Confirmed conflicting commitments (rallies, events) in the U.S. on May 10; explicit statements from Trump/Dana White that he won’t attend; indications Canada would deny entry; or reports he’s elsewhere that evening.",
