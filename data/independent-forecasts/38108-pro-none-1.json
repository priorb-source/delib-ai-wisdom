    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "About 1 month.",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "The Department of Government Efficiency (Doge) identifies and claims substantial savings, perhaps in the range of $100-150 billion, by July 1, 2025. While this would be a significant achievement, the total would fall short of the $200 billion threshold required for a 'Yes' resolution.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Driven by intense political pressure to show a major victory, Doge employs an aggressive and broad definition of 'savings'. This includes long-term projections and annualized figures from early initiatives. They announce a headline figure exceeding $200 billion, leveraging a few large-scale findings related to waste in major departments to justify the number, even if the savings are not yet fully realized.",
    "rationale": "My forecast is low due to the extremely short timeline and the immense difficulty of identifying, implementing, and formally claiming $200 billion in government savings. The question asks for the claimed savings by July 1, 2025, a little over four months after the initiative was publicized in late February. Government Accountability Office (GAO) reports typically identify large potential savings, but these are identified over a full year and are recommendations, not realized savings. Actually implementing changes and accounting for them is a slow, bureaucratic process. The initial estimate mentioned was 'over $100 billion,' making a leap to $200 billion in such a short period a significant stretch. The most probable outcome is that Doge will claim a large number to demonstrate success, but it will likely be closer to the initial estimate, falling below the $200 billion mark.\n\nMy forecast is not lower than 15% because there is a non-trivial chance that political incentives will drive an optimistic or creatively-accounted-for announcement. A 'tech-guru' led initiative may operate with more agility than traditional government bodies, and the definition of 'claimed savings' can be flexible. They could, for instance, annualize the savings from a single month's change or include multi-year projections in the total to quickly reach the target number on paper.\n\nMy forecast is not higher than 15% because the sheer scale of $200 billion represents a significant portion of federal spending, and claiming such a sum after only a few months of operation strains credulity. Even with political will, there are limits to how fast the machinery of government can move and how far accounting can be stretched without facing significant backlash or scrutiny.\n\nI would increase my forecast if there were credible leaks or interim reports from Doge showing they have already identified specific savings approaching the target. I would decrease it if reports emerged of internal delays, bureaucratic resistance, or officials publicly tempering expectations.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill Doge claim a total savings of $200 billion or more on July 1, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nNY Post: [Tech guru admired by Elon Musk estimates ‘over $100 billion’ in taxpayer money is being wasted or stolen](https://nypost.com/2025/02/25/us-news/tech-guru-admired-by-elon-musk-estimates-over-100-billion-in-taxpayer-money-is-being-wasted-or-stolen/)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if the Department of Government Efficiency [claims](https://doge.gov/savings) a total estimated savings of greater than or equal to $200 billion when checked by Metaculus on or after July 1, 2025.\n\n\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nNo additional information available.\n\nToday is 2025-05-31.\n\nBefore answering you think:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n(e) You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
