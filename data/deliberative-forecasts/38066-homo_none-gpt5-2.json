    "review": "Both forecasters reinforce the same core base-rate logic I used: headliners usually don’t share a stage unless pre-announced, and Altman–Musk relations plus security/logistics push against a joint segment. New/useful additions: (1) Forecaster 3’s explicit decomposition into P(both attend in person) × P(shared stage | both present) is a helpful framing and highlights the disqualifying risk of a remote appearance; (2) Forecaster 2’s point that YC might avoid a joint session to prevent overshadowing and operational risk. Both also note a narrow “Yes” path via a short opening/closing all-speaker moment. I didn’t explicitly parameterize attendance vs. conditional overlap; their ranges are reasonable and largely consistent with my priors.",
    "rationale": "I adopt the decomposition: P(Altman in person) ~0.95, P(Musk in person) ~0.75 → P(both) ~0.71. Conditional on both present, P(shared stage) ~0.20–0.25 given norms, tensions, and security, with a small tail for an orchestrated brief joint moment. That yields ~14–18%. Allowing for YC’s promotional incentives nudges me to the upper end but not to Forecaster 2’s 24%, given lack of any schedule hints and the adversarial dynamic. Net: a slight uptick from my prior to align with the structured decomposition and to reflect a small chance of a choreographed opening/closing. I will update materially only if the published agenda or credible signals indicate a joint segment, or if either’s participation status changes.",
