  "information": "According to statements from Paul Gunning, the EPA's Director of the Office of Atmospheric Protection, the Energy Star program and other climate-related work are being 'de-prioritized and eliminated.' Gunning's office, along with the EPA's climate change division and climate protection partnership division, are slated for closure as part of a broader agency reorganization. The stated goal of the restructuring is to bring the agency to 'Reagan-era staffing levels,' aiming for a savings of $300 million a year by 2026.\n\nThe Energy Star program was launched in 1992 as a voluntary public-private partnership to certify energy-efficient products. Over its 33-year history, government figures and expert analyses estimate the program has saved consumers over $500 billion in energy costs and prevented 4 billion metric tons of greenhouse gas emissions. The program's annual cost is approximately $32 million, while it is credited with saving the average household around $450 per year.\n\nDecommissioning a federal .gov domain typically requires a process lasting several months for internal approvals, security reviews, and coordination with the General Services Administration (GSA). Federal laws, including the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) and record-retention statutes overseen by the National Archives and Records Administration (NARA), mandate archiving procedures. Historically, websites for discontinued federal programs have often remained online as static archives or with placeholder notices for years after the program ended. When other EPA climate-related webpages were targeted for removal in 2017, the outcome was a redirect or a static page, not a complete shutdown of the domain.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "About 48 days (until July 1, 2025)",
    "status_quo_outcome": "Yes — the site remains online (possibly as a static archive or with a redirect)",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "EPA or GSA rapidly decommissions the energystar.gov domain before July 1, taking DNS offline or returning hard errors (no redirect), or a prolonged outage coincides with Metaculus’s check and IsItDownRightNow reports it as down.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "The domain continues responding normally, even if the program is halted. The site may be frozen, display a sunset notice, or redirect to an EPA/archival page, but still serves HTTP(S) responses that IsItDownRightNow deems “UP and reachable.”",
    "rationale": "- Base rate/status quo: As of May 7, 2025, IsItDownRightNow reports energystar.gov as up. Government program sites often persist well past program changes due to archiving, FOIA/NARA requirements, and GSA .gov decommissioning procedures. Historical precedent (e.g., EPA climate pages in 2017) was to redirect or post static notices rather than fully drop domains. With only ~7 weeks until July 1, inertia favors the site remaining reachable.\n- Organizational/ procedural friction: Decommissioning a federal .gov typically takes months of approvals, security and records reviews, and coordination with GSA and NARA. Even when programs are eliminated, agencies commonly keep domains online as archives or redirects to satisfy record-retention and public-notice obligations.\n- Political push to eliminate: The NYT-reported plan to de-prioritize/eliminate Energy Star and related offices increases the chance of an aggressive shutdown, but eliminating the program does not require immediate domain takedown. Keeping a static page or redirect is consistent with a “program ended” message and is low effort.\n- Resolution-source nuance: The question resolves via IsItDownRightNow. A site that serves a redirect or static notice will likely still be reported as “UP,” whereas only DNS removal, hard network errors, or a server that does not respond would produce a “DOWN.” This makes a Yes outcome more likely than if the criterion required the full site to operate as before.\n- Risks keeping the forecast below the mid-90s:\n  • Intentional rapid decommission driven by leadership to visibly demonstrate the program’s end (including DNS changes) before July 1.\n  • Operational or cyber incidents causing a coincident outage when Metaculus checks.\n  • An unusual implementation that blocks the IsItDownRightNow checker specifically.\n- Why not lower: Short time horizon, strong institutional/records incentives to retain or archive, and precedent of redirects/static notices after program changes all favor continued reachability.\n- What would move me up: Public statements indicating the site will be archived/redirected rather than removed; evidence of GSA/NARA archiving plans; technical signs of stability (no DNS changes, normal TLS/hosting renewals) into late June.\n- What would move me down: An official EPA/GSA notice of domain decommission before July 1; observable DNS changes (e.g., name servers altered toward decommission), a posted shutdown date prior to July 1 on the site, or reports of imminent takedown as part of the reorg; significant security incidents affecting EPA web infrastructure.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill the EPA's EnergyStar.gov still be online on July 1, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nAccording to the [New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/06/climate/epa-energy-star-eliminated.html), \"'The Energy Star program and all the other climate work, outside of what’s required by statute, is being de-prioritized and eliminated,' Paul Gunning, the director of the E.P.A. Office of Atmospheric Protection, told employees during the meeting, according to the recording obtained by The New York Times. Mr. Gunning’s office itself is also slated for elimination.\n\nFor the past 33 years, Energy Star has been known for its recognizable blue label, which shows that an appliance has met energy efficiency standards set by the federal government.\"\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if EnergyStar.gov is online according to [Is It Down Right Now?](https://www.isitdownrightnow.com/energystar.gov.html) when accessed by Metaculus on or after July 1, 2025.\n\nAs of May 7, 2025, the resolution source returns the message, \"Energystar.gov is UP and reachable by us.\"\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nAccording to statements from Paul Gunning, the EPA's Director of the Office of Atmospheric Protection, the Energy Star program and other climate-related work are being 'de-prioritized and eliminated.'

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
