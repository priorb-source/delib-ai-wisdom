    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "2 months (until July 1, 2025)",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No - no agreement has been announced yet",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "The negotiations between Vietnam and South Korea continue past July 1, 2025 without an official announcement, or they stall over pricing, technical specifications, or political considerations. Given this would be South Korea's first defense arms sale to Vietnam, complications around financing terms, technology transfer, training arrangements, or domestic political approval processes could delay the deal beyond the deadline.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Vietnam and South Korea successfully conclude their ongoing negotiations within the next 2 months and jointly announce an agreement for the export of K9 self-propelled howitzers. With negotiations reportedly already underway for 20 units valued at $300 million, both governments expedite the process due to strategic priorities - Vietnam's desire to diversify its military suppliers away from Russia, and South Korea's ambition to expand its defense exports in Southeast Asia.",
    "rationale": "Active negotiations are reportedly underway for 20 K9 howitzers in a $300 million deal, which is a positive signal. However, several factors create uncertainty: (1) Only 2 months remain until the resolution date, which is relatively short for finalizing major defense agreements; (2) This would be the first defense arms sale between these countries, adding complexity due to its precedent-setting nature; (3) Major arms deals typically require extensive negotiations covering technical specifications, financing, training, logistics, and political approvals; (4) The research assistant found no additional updates, suggesting either confidential ongoing negotiations or lack of recent progress. Favoring the forecast upward: South Korea has successfully exported K9 howitzers to multiple countries and has strong export infrastructure; both countries have strategic motivations (Vietnam diversifying suppliers, South Korea expanding markets). Favoring the forecast downward: the status quo shows no announced agreement yet; first-time defense deals are inherently more complex; no public indication negotiations are in final stages. I would update higher with news of negotiations reaching final stages or high-level meetings focused on this deal. I would update lower with reports of obstacles, delays, or continued silence as July 1 approaches. The balance suggests modest probability given active negotiations but significant time and complexity constraints.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill Vietnam and South Korea announce an agreement for South Korea to export self-propelled howitzers to Vietnam?\n\nQuestion background:\nThe Korea Herald: [South Korea-Vietnam ties enter new strategic terrain, but need more detailed road map: Seoul envoy](https://www.koreaherald.com/article/10464718) \"Vietnam is reportedly in negotiations to import 20 units of K9 self-propelled howitzers from Korea in a deal valued at $300 million. If finalized, it would mark Korea’s first defense arms sale to the country.\"\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if, before July 1, 2025, the governments of Vietnam and/or South Korea announce an agreement for South Korea to export 2 or more self-propelled howitzers to Vietnam. If no such agreement is announced after the launch of this question and before July 1, 2025, this question resolves as **No**.\n\n\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nNo additional information available.\n\nToday is 2025-05-01.\n\nBefore answering you think:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n(e) You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
