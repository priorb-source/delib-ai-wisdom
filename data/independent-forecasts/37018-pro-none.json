    "no_outcome_scenario": "Despite receiving three nominations, Kelsea Ballerini does not secure enough votes in any of her categories to win. Voters may favor other artists who have had greater commercial success, critical acclaim, or a stronger narrative in the past year, continuing her trend of being nominated but not winning a competitive ACM award.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Kelsea Ballerini's recent work, particularly her nominated album or single, resonates strongly with Academy voters. The industry decides to recognize her artistic growth and sustained commercial success, and she converts one of her three nominations into a win, marking her first competitive ACM award.",
    "rationale": "My forecast is based primarily on Kelsea Ballerini's history at the ACM Awards and the competitive nature of the field. The status quo is that she is consistently nominated but does not win in competitive categories; she has a long history of nominations without a win. Most nominees do not win, and this historical pattern is the strongest indicator. The 'No' outcome is the path of least resistance. The probability is not lower than 25% because having three separate nominations significantly increases her chances compared to having just one. A win in any of the three categories would resolve the question as 'Yes'. She is a major, respected artist, and a win would not be a major upset. My forecast is not higher than 45% because she faces incredibly stiff competition from artists who have dominated recent award cycles. Without specific information on the categories and her fellow nominees, I must assume she is up against the genre's other top performers, making any single win a difficult achievement. To update my forecast higher, I would need to see information that one of her categories is less competitive or that there is significant industry buzz suggesting this is 'her year'. To update lower, I would need to see that she is nominated against a clear frontrunner in all three of her categories.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill Kelsea Ballerini win an award at the 60th Academy of Country Music Awards?\n\nQuestion background:\nThe awards are scheduled to be held on May 8, 2025. Ballerini has 3 nominations.\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if Kelsea Ballerini wins an award at the [60th Academy of Country Music Awards](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/60th_Academy_of_Country_Music_Awards).\n\n\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nNo additional information available.\n\nToday is 2025-04-22.\n\nBefore answering you think:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n(e) You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
