    "review": "All three forecasters converged remarkably on 85-87%, which increases my confidence in this range. Forecaster 2 provides useful quantification that normal monthly volatility 'rarely exceeds 0.1-0.2 percentage points,' which reinforces how exceptional a 0.8 pp jump would be. Both forecasters emphasize the substantial buffer and the early-in-year timing relative to the IMF's full-year projection. Forecaster 3's analysis closely mirrors mine, hitting the same key points about status quo persistence, timeframe constraints, and the informal sector buffer. No forecaster presented evidence of April layoffs or plant closures that would suggest immediate deterioration. The consensus reasoning is compelling: April has already occurred, the March baseline is strong at 2.2%, monthly unemployment changes are typically small and sticky, and tariff impacts manifest over months not weeks. The convergence around 85-87% from three independent analyses using similar logic validates the reasoning rather than suggesting overconfidence.",
    "rationale": "After reviewing the other forecasters' analyses, I find strong agreement on the core logic and no new evidence that changes my assessment. The key points remain: (1) April 2025 has concluded with March's unemployment at a historic low of 2.2%, (2) reaching 3.0% would require an unprecedented 0.8 percentage point increase in one month, (3) typical monthly volatility is 0.1-0.2 pp, making such a jump extremely rare absent major crisis, (4) tariff impacts on employment take months to materialize, not weeks, (5) the IMF's 2.8% to 3.8% projection spans the full year, and April represents early stages, (6) Mexico's informal sector provides some labor market cushioning. The slight uncertainty (not forecasting 95%+) appropriately reflects genuine economic headwinds from US tariffs and the IMF's dire outlook, but these factors are unlikely to manifest in April's data given the timeframe. The convergence of three independent forecasts at 85-87% strengthens rather than weakens my confidence in this range, as it suggests the reasoning is sound and not idiosyncratic.",
