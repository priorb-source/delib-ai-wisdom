    "review": "All three forecasts cluster tightly between 28-35%, suggesting strong consensus on the core dynamics. Forecaster 2 makes an important point about COVID-19 relief fraud as a potential source of massive single-scheme discoveries that could enable a sudden jump. Forecaster 3 raises a particularly valuable consideration I hadn't fully explored: DOGE might count multi-year savings projections (e.g., 'this policy saves $20B/year over 10 years = $200B'). This is how government accounting often works (CBO uses 10-year windows), and could dramatically lower the bar for reaching $200B in claims. Both forecasters appropriately emphasize our critical information gap: we don't know the current claimed total. If DOGE already claims $150B+, the probability should be much higher; if they're below $100B, much lower. The complete absence of this information from the research assistant is striking and forces us to rely on base rates. All three analyses correctly note that 'claims' rather than 'verified savings' significantly increases feasibility, but one month remains an extremely short window even for creative accounting.",
    "rationale": "After reviewing both analyses, my core reasoning remains intact but with enhanced appreciation for certain dynamics. The multi-year projection angle Forecaster 3 raises is genuinely important - if DOGE can aggregate 10-year savings estimates across multiple programs, reaching $200B becomes more plausible than I initially weighted. However, several factors keep me from moving significantly higher: (1) We have zero information about current claim totals, and the absence of reporting suggests they haven't hit major milestones yet; (2) The February reference point of 'over $100B' in potential waste suggests thinking was well below $200B months ago; (3) Even with creative accounting, one month is extraordinarily compressed for doubling such claims; (4) Government reporting cycles are typically slow, making a sudden July 1 spike unusual without prior signals. The tight clustering of all three forecasts (28-35%) reinforces that the fundamentals point to low-but-not-negligible probability. Political incentives and the low bar of 'claims' prevent this from being single-digit probability, but the short timeline, lack of evidence of progress toward the threshold, and sheer magnitude of $200B prevent it from being above 40%.",
