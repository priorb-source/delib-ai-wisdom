    "review": "The deliberation reveals a critical factual disagreement that resolves the forecast. Forecaster 2's analysis is predicated on Ukraine's government debt being 1.869 trillion UAH in February 2025, just below the 1.90 trillion UAH threshold. This is a fundamental misreading of the source data. According to Trading Economics, the debt in February 2025 was over 6.0 trillion UAH. Because Forecaster 2's entire reasoning is built on this incorrect premise, their analysis and 58% forecast can be disregarded. In contrast, Forecaster 3's analysis aligns perfectly with my own initial assessment. They correctly identify that the actual debt is multiples of the question's threshold, making a 'Yes' outcome a near-certainty. Forecaster 3 also adds a valuable point I hadn't explicitly stated: the depreciation of the hryvnia further increases the nominal UAH value of foreign-denominated debt, adding another layer of upward pressure. Their reasoning is highly convincing and reinforces my initial high-confidence forecast.",
    "rationale": "I will not be changing my forecast of 99%. The deliberation process has strongly reinforced my initial analysis. Forecaster 3's reasoning, which is nearly identical to my own, confirms that the question's threshold is not a relevant benchmark for the current state of Ukraine's public finances. The central fact is that Ukraine's government debt was already over 6 trillion UAH in February 2025, more than three times the 1.90 trillion UAH threshold. The new information provided by both my research assistant and the other forecasters—including an IMF loan, an EU loan, domestic bond issuance, and currency depreciation in March—all point towards a further *increase* in the total debt stock, not a decrease. For the question to resolve as 'No', the government would have had to shed over 4 trillion UAH of debt in a single month. This is a fiscal impossibility, especially during an active war requiring massive deficit financing. My forecast remains at 99% rather than 100% solely to account for the extremely remote possibility of a major retroactive data revision or a gross error in the source data, a possibility acknowledged by both myself and Forecaster 3.",
