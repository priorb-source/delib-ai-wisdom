  "information": "According to multiple news reports from late May 2025, former Ivorian President Laurent Gbagbo is considered disqualified from the 2025 presidential election. This is due to a 2018 conviction for the looting of the Central Bank of West African States (BCEAO), which resulted in a 20-year prison sentence and the loss of his civic rights. Sources such as Le Point, tunisienumerique.com, and Abidjan.net state that he remains struck from the electoral list. His political party, the People's African Party-Côte d'Ivoire (PPA-CI), announced in late April 2025 that it would evaluate the situation in the first half of June 2025 and consider a 'new level in the fight' if his status on the electoral list does not change.\n\nThe political climate in Côte d'Ivoire is marked by the disqualification of several opposition figures ahead of the October 2025 election. In April 2025, Tidjane Thiam, leader of the main opposition party PDCI-RDA, was disqualified after a court ruled he did not meet eligibility conditions due to his prior dual French-Ivorian nationality, despite having renounced his French citizenship. This and other exclusions have led to protests and accusations of electoral manipulation. Reports also mention that other political figures like Charles Blé Goudé and Guillaume Soro have been excluded from the electoral process due to judicial convictions. In response to the political tensions, various groups, including religious leaders and the UN, have called for peaceful dialogue.\n\nSeveral of the candidates named in the question have officially announced their intention to run in the 2025 presidential election. Jean-Louis Billon, a member of the PDCI-RDA party, announced his candidacy in late May 2025, positioning himself as an alternative within his party following the disqualification of its leader, Tidjane Thiam. Simone Gbagbo, former first lady, has also announced her candidacy under the banner of her party, the Movement of Capable Generations (MGC). Pascal Affi N'Guessan is also presented as a candidate for the FPI party.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "About 32 days (until July 1, 2025)",
    "status_quo_outcome": "Yes — Laurent Gbagbo is reported to remain off the electoral list and thus legally ineligible to run.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Between now and July 1, 2025, Laurent Gbagbo is formally reinstated on the electoral list (or otherwise regains civic rights), and none of the other named candidates are removed from the list or ruled ineligible; or platforms judge existing reports insufficient to meet the criterion.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Credible sources continue to state (or newly reaffirm) that Laurent Gbagbo is struck from the electoral list and ineligible; or any of the others (Gnangbo Kacou, Pascal Affi N’Guessan, Jean-Louis Billon, Simone Gbagbo) is removed from the list or ruled ineligible before July 1.",
    "rationale": "- Status quo: Multiple late-May 2025 reports (e.g., Le Point, Abidjan.net, Tunisienumerique) say Laurent Gbagbo remains struck from the electoral list due to a 2018 conviction that carried loss of civic rights, making him legally ineligible. That alone satisfies the question’s criterion (“removed from the electoral list or otherwise become legally ineligible to run”) if accepted by the resolver as a credible-source confirmation before July 1.\n- Assistant’s summary: Confirms the above and notes a broader pattern of opposition figures being excluded (e.g., Tidjane Thiam, though not one of the named candidates). Jean‑Louis Billon, Simone Gbagbo, and Pascal Affi N’Guessan have announced intentions to run; none is currently reported disqualified, but that’s not necessary for a Yes if Gbagbo’s status holds.\n- Why not higher: Small residual risk that (a) Gbagbo is somehow reinstated very quickly (court/administrative action restoring civic rights and electoral list status) before July 1, and the resolver requires the disqualification status to hold at any point before July 1 in a way they judge unambiguous; or (b) the resolver deems current reporting insufficiently definitive for the 2025 presidential race context and waits for a formal candidacy-stage ruling by the Constitutional Council (typically later). The prompt notes “criteria have not yet been satisfied,” suggesting some ambiguity in what the resolver will count.\n- Why not lower: The preponderance of credible reporting already indicates Gbagbo’s ineligibility via removal from the electoral list, which directly matches the resolution criterion. Reversal within ~1 month seems unlikely given past failed attempts and the current political environment.\n- What would move me up: Clear, official confirmation from the Ivorian CEI, Justice Ministry, or Constitutional Council reiterating Gbagbo’s current ineligibility, or any new disqualification among the other named candidates before July 1.\n- What would move me down: Evidence that Gbagbo has been reinstated on the electoral list or had civic rights restored before July 1; or credible, authoritative reporting clarifying that prior removal does not constitute disqualification for the 2025 presidential contest under the resolver’s standard.",

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower.
