    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "2 months (outcome to be determined by July 1, 2025)",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "The political landscape remains relatively stable through May and June 2025. The incumbent Labour government maintains a significant polling lead, and no major political or economic crisis occurs to dramatically shift public opinion. Reform UK's polling numbers remain steady, but they do not experience the massive surge required to overtake both Labour and the Conservatives to become the leading party.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "A major crisis, such as a severe economic downturn or a major government scandal, causes a catastrophic collapse in the Labour party's support. The Conservative party fails to present itself as a credible alternative, leading disillusioned voters from both major parties to shift their support to Reform UK in a rapid and unprecedented surge. This political realignment is significant enough for Reform to top the Politico poll of polls by at least 4 percentage points.",
    "rationale": "My forecast is based on the principle of political inertia and the extremely high bar set by the question's resolution criteria. As of early May 2025, a year after a general election, the political landscape is likely to be relatively settled, with the new Labour government still enjoying a substantial polling lead. For Reform UK to become the highest polling party by a 4-point margin within the next two months would require a political realignment of historic proportions. Such a dramatic shift is rare and would likely necessitate a perfect storm: a catastrophic failure of the incumbent government, the continued impotence of the official opposition, and a flawless campaign by Reform UK to capitalize on the situation. While Nigel Farage is a formidable political operator and modern politics is volatile, the probability of all these factors aligning perfectly in such a short timeframe remains very low. My probability is not lower than 8% to account for the possibility of a 'black swan' event, as recent political history has shown that sudden shifts can occur. However, my probability is not higher because the status quo, in which the governing party leads in the polls, is a very strong prior. I would increase my forecast if early polling in May showed a dramatic and sustained surge for Reform (e.g., >10 points in a few weeks) coupled with a collapse in Labour's numbers. I would decrease it if the polls remain stable over the next month.",

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
