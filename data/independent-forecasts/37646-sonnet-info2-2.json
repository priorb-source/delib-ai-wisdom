  "information": "The time between Starlink receiving a license and its service becoming \"Available\" varies. For several African nations, the lag has been several months: Nigeria's service went live approximately four months after licensing in 2023, while Rwanda's took about four months. The median time for recent African launches has been estimated at 4–8 months. However, some rollouts have been much faster; for example, Bangladesh's service became available in about two weeks in May 2025. Conversely, some countries, such as Zambia, India, and Vietnam, have remained in a \"Coming Soon\" status for many months after receiving licenses.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Approximately 47 days (from May 15, 2025 to July 1, 2025)",
    "status_quo_outcome": "Somalia does not appear as 'Available' on the Starlink map by July 1, 2025",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Starlink follows its typical African deployment timeline of 4-8 months from licensing to availability. Given infrastructure challenges in Somalia and the short timeframe remaining, the service remains in 'Coming Soon' status or unlisted through July 1, 2025. Deployment may be delayed by ground station setup, equipment distribution logistics, or regulatory finalization.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Starlink fast-tracks Somalia's deployment similar to Bangladesh's rapid 2-week rollout in May 2025. Alternatively, the license was actually granted several months before Musk's public announcement, meaning deployment preparations were already underway. Musk's public announcement indicates strategic prioritization, leading to accelerated activation before July 1, 2025.",
    "rationale": "The base rate strongly suggests a low probability of availability by July 1. My research assistant reports that African Starlink deployments typically take 4-8 months from licensing to 'Available' status (Nigeria and Rwanda each took approximately 4 months). With only 1.5 months remaining until the resolution date, meeting this timeline would require significantly faster deployment than the African median. However, several factors prevent this from being near-zero probability: (1) Bangladesh achieved availability in just 2 weeks in May 2025, demonstrating technical capability for rapid deployment when prioritized; (2) we lack precise information about when the license was actually granted versus when it was announced - there could be a gap of weeks or months; (3) Musk's public announcement might signal strategic importance and potential prioritization. The counterarguments are substantial: Somalia faces significant infrastructure challenges, multiple countries remain stuck in 'Coming Soon' status for many months (Zambia, India, Vietnam), and there's no public evidence of advanced deployment preparations. The forecast is not higher because the base rate is strongly against such rapid deployment, particularly in a challenging operating environment. It's not lower because the Bangladesh precedent shows rapid deployment is technically feasible, and we have genuine uncertainty about the timeline between licensing and announcement. I would update higher if evidence emerged of pre-announcement licensing or active ground station deployment. I would update lower if Starlink publicly indicates Somalia is in early planning stages.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill Starlink's website show Somalia as a country with Starlink availability before July 1, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\n[Musk announces Starlink license for Somalia](https://www.spacedaily.com/reports/Musk_announces_Starlink_license_for_Somalia_999.html)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if, before July 1, 2025, the [Starlink Availability Map](https://www.starlink.com/us/map) has anywhere in Somalia listed as \"Available.\"\n\n\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nThe time between Starlink receiving a license and its service becoming \"Available\" varies.

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
