  "information": "Protests have been ongoing in Turkey since the arrest of Istanbul Mayor Ekrem İmamoğlu on March 19, 2025, on corruption charges. Reports from various news outlets cited turnouts in the hundreds of thousands. The Republican People's Party (CHP) claimed that over 2 million people participated in a protest in Istanbul on March 29. The party announced plans for continued protests. Following the initial wave of demonstrations, Turkish authorities detained 1,133 people between March 19 and March 23. In response to the protests, nearly 1,900 people, including journalists, had been rounded up by late March.\n\nOn May 1, 2025, Labor Day events in Istanbul included authorized marches and unauthorized protests. According to the Istanbul Governor's Office, authorized marches in the Kadıköy and Kartal districts had a combined participation of around 65,000 people. Authorities deployed over 52,000 police officers. Clashes occurred during attempts to hold unauthorized demonstrations, particularly near Taksim Square, leading to the detention of 384 people. A court later ordered the release of 374 of those detained, while others were released on bail or remained in custody.\n\nTurkey's high inflation rate was reported at approximately 48.6% in early 2025. In the legal sphere, an indictment was prepared for 14 youths arrested during the Saraçhane protests, with their first hearing scheduled for May 30, 2025. Separately, the trial for manager Ayşe Barım, related to her alleged role in the 2013 Gezi Park protests, is scheduled for July 7, 2025. Amnesty International's 2024-25 report highlighted what it described as human rights violations in Turkey, including restrictions on peaceful protests and the prosecution of journalists and opposition figures. The organization also condemned the arrests made ahead of the May 1st protests and called for the lifting of the ban on demonstrations in Taksim Square.",

    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "55 days (from May 7 to July 1, 2025)",
    "status_quo_outcome": "Yes - the question will likely resolve as Yes given current trends",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Turkish authorities successfully suppress all large-scale protests through intensified crackdowns and mass detentions, preventing any gathering from reaching 10,000 participants. Alternatively, the Global Protest Tracker fails to document protests that do occur, either due to reporting lags or selective coverage decisions.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "The ongoing political mobilization around Mayor İmamoğlu's arrest continues, combined with economic pressures from 48.6% inflation. The Republican People's Party (CHP) follows through on announced plans for continued protests. Any of several large demonstrations in the next 55 days reaches the 10,000-participant threshold and is documented by the Global Protest Tracker, which has shown it tracks Turkish protests using the name Türkiye.",
    "rationale": "The evidence strongly favors a Yes resolution. Recent protests (March-May 2025) have vastly exceeded the 10,000 threshold, with hundreds of thousands participating and CHP claiming 2 million at one Istanbul protest. Even the authorized May 1st marches alone had 65,000 combined participants. This demonstrates both organizational capacity and public willingness to protest despite government crackdowns (1,133+ detentions in March, 384 on May 1). The underlying grievances remain acute: a major opposition mayor's arrest on corruption charges, 48.6% inflation causing economic distress, and systematic human rights concerns documented by Amnesty International. CHP has explicitly announced plans for continued protests. The 55-day window provides ample opportunity for multiple large-scale events. The key uncertainty is whether the Global Protest Tracker will document these protests. The question background confirms they use 'Türkiye' in their database, suggesting active coverage. Given the international attention on Turkish protests and their scale, documentation seems very likely. Why not higher: Intensive government crackdowns could prevent gatherings from reaching the threshold, there may be reporting lags, and authorities detained 52,000+ police officers for May 1st showing suppression capacity. Why not lower: The momentum is extraordinarily strong, recent protests far exceeded thresholds, multiple trigger events remain (scheduled trials on May 30 and July 7), and the organizational infrastructure is demonstrated and committed. The combination of ongoing political crisis, economic hardship, and proven mobilization capacity makes large protests in the next 55 days highly probable.",
