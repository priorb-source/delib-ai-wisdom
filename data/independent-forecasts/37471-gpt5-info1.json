  "information": "According to data from the Federal Reserve Economic Data (FRED), the inventory of new single-family homes for sale in the United States stood at 503,000 units in March 2025, an increase from 500,000 in February 2025. This level represents a multi-year high since November 2007. Historically, the number of new one-family homes for sale has only exceeded 550,000 during the 2006-2007 housing market peak, when levels reached between 570,000 and 580,000 units.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "About 7 weeks (FRED will post May 2025 data in late June 2025).",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No — the inventory remains near ~500k and below 550k.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "April and May see small-to-moderate gains typical for this series (e.g., +2k to +10k per month), leaving May at roughly 505–525k. Demand and supply conditions change gradually; no sharp shock occurs.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "A rare, abrupt two-month surge: April jumps by ~30–40k and May adds another ~15–20k, driven by a sudden sales drop (e.g., rate spike) alongside a wave of completions/listings, or an unusual methodological/seasonal-factor revision that lifts the level above 550k.",
    "rationale": "The latest FRED reading cited is 503k for March 2025 (up from 500k in February). To exceed 550k by May would require a gain of roughly 47k over two months (~9% in two months), which is far larger than typical month-to-month movements in the New One Family Homes for Sale series. Historically, levels above 550k occurred only during the 2006–2007 housing peak. This suggests a high bar for a Yes outcome absent an extraordinary shock. The base rate and recent trend therefore point strongly to No. Why not higher: Achieving >550k by May would require two unusually large consecutive increases, which are rare for this inventory series. Why not lower: While very unlikely, a Yes could occur if April prints unexpectedly high (e.g., ≥535k) and is followed by another sizable May increase, perhaps due to a sharp sales slowdown combined with a surge in completions, or a sizable seasonal-factor/benchmark revision. What would move me up: April reading at or above ~535k; evidence of a marked sales drop and rising months’ supply; a spike in completions or starts that would quickly feed inventory; announcement of methodological or seasonal factor revisions that materially raise levels. What would move me down: April near flat (≤510k), stable sales, and no sign of unusual revisions. Summary of assistant’s info used: March 2025 at 503k (up from 500k in Feb); only 2006–2007 exceeded 550k historically. This supports a low probability of breaching 550k by May 2025.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill the number of new single family homes for sale in the US exceed 550 thousand in May 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\n[The Kobeissi Letter](https://x.com/KobeissiLetter/status/1912142359577403619): \"BREAKING: The number of new single-family homes for sale has surged to 500,000 in February, the highest since November 2007.\n\nThe number of new homes on the market has more than TRIPLED over the last 13 years, from a low of 142,000.\n\nExcluding the 2006 housing bubble this is, by far, the largest supply of new homes in history.\"\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if the number of New One Family Homes for Sale in the United States reported for May 2025 is greater than 550 thousand, according to what is presented by [FRED](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/HNFSEPUSSA).\n\nEnsure units is set to \"Thousands of Units, Seasonally Adjusted\" and frequency is set to \"Monthly, End of Month\". Question resolves based on the number presented by FRED, and no other resolution source will be considered.\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nAccording to data from the Federal Reserve Economic Data (FRED), the inventory of new single-family homes for sale in the United States stood at 503,000 units in March 2025, an increase from 500,000 in February 2025.

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
