  "information": "The time between Starlink receiving a license and its service becoming 'Available' on its map varies in other African nations. For the Democratic Republic of Congo, the process took approximately 10 weeks in 2025. For Malawi and Zambia, it was about 16 weeks, and for Benin, it was 24 weeks. Niger's service was officially launched on March 13, 2025, the same day Chad's license was announced. In May 2025, a pan-African partnership between SpaceX and Airtel was announced to potentially accelerate kit distribution.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "About 47 days (until 2025-07-01)",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No — Chad remains shown as Coming Soon/Waitlist on Starlink’s availability map by July 1, 2025.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Regulatory or operational steps in Chad take longer than expected (e.g., final spectrum/landing-rights conditions, import approvals, local compliance, or a requirement for a local gateway). Starlink prioritizes larger markets and defers Chad until after Q2, leaving the map as Coming Soon through June.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "SpaceX flips at least part of Chad (e.g., N’Djamena area) to Available in a late‑Q2 batch launch, enabled by completed compliance and the new Airtel Africa partnership handling on‑the‑ground distribution and customs. Kits become orderable and the map shows Available for some tiles in Chad before July 1.",
    "rationale": "- What we know: As of May 15, 2025, the Starlink map does not yet show Chad as Available. Starlink reportedly secured a license to operate in Chad (reported Nov 12, 2024; another report pegs a public announcement on Mar 13, 2025). The assistant’s research notes license-to-availability lags in Africa lately: DRC ≈10 weeks, Malawi/Zambia ≈16 weeks, Benin ≈24 weeks. Niger launched Mar 13, 2025. In May 2025, SpaceX announced a pan‑African distribution partnership with Airtel, which could speed kit availability in Airtel countries (Airtel operates in Chad).\n- Timing math: If we treat Mar 13, 2025 as the operative license announcement for Chad, July 1 is ~16 weeks later—squarely in the midrange of recent Africa lags (10–24 weeks), making a Q2 flip plausible. If we treat Nov 12, 2024 as the operative date, we are already past even the long tail (24+ weeks), implying some blocker exists; that would lower the near‑term probability unless the blocker was recently cleared.\n- Status quo weight: Right now the map is not Available. World changes slowly; if the underlying blocker is regulatory (e.g., import rules, gateway/landing-rights conditions, content controls), slippage into Q3 is common. That argues for caution.\n- Reasons for Yes before July 1: (1) Starlink’s recent cadence of African launches and the practice of batching map flips near quarter ends; (2) Airtel partnership could remove distribution/import friction in Chad; (3) Neighboring country launches (e.g., Niger) suggest regional beams and operational readiness are not the bottleneck.\n- Reasons for No: (1) The apparent delay since at least Nov 2024 suggests additional conditions beyond the license (e.g., enforcement of government controls, local gateway or landing obligations) that may take longer. (2) Chad’s small market and complex regulatory environment may lower its priority relative to bigger African markets in Q2.\n- Why not higher: The possibility of unresolved regulatory or compliance requirements in Chad, plus the fact that it hasn’t flipped yet despite a reported license months ago, keeps the chance well below 70%.\n- Why not lower: Recent African launch lags often fall within 10–16 weeks; July 1 sits near that window if the practical go‑ahead only came in March. The Airtel partnership and end‑of‑Q2 incentives for SpaceX provide tangible reasons to expect a June batch addition.\n- What would move me up: Any of (a) Starlink updating the map label for Chad to a concrete 2025 date window or showing waitlist/order interest; (b) Airtel Chad announcing sales/onboarding; (c) regulator communiqué confirming final operational clearance/import approvals; (d) sightings of kits clearing customs in N’Djamena.\n- What would move me down: (a) Reports of additional regulatory prerequisites (e.g., mandated local gateway, data‑routing controls) or delays; (b) Starlink map revising Chad to a later timeframe (e.g., H2 2025); (c) indications of government hesitation or new restrictions on satellite internet in Chad.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill Starlink's website show Chad as a country with Starlink availability before July 1, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\n[SpaceX’s Starlink Secures License to Operate in Chad](https://spaceinafrica.com/2024/11/12/spacexs-starlink-secures-license-to-operate-in-chad/)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if, before July 1, 2025, the [Starlink Availability Map](https://www.starlink.com/us/map) has anywhere in Chad listed as \"Available.\"\n\n\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nThe time between Starlink receiving a license and its service becoming 'Available' on its map varies in other African nations.

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
