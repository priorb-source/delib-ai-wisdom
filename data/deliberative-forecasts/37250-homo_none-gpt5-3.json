    "review": "Both forecasters emphasize the same core constraints I raised: multi‑year inadmissibility bars (I‑212 consent needed), humanitarian parole as the main discretionary path, and very short timelines. Forecaster 2’s 4% aligns closely with my prior; Forecaster 3’s 10% leans more on the tail from publicity. The one incremental point I’ll incorporate is the signal value of a dedicated Wikipedia page as a proxy for heightened advocacy/public scrutiny, which marginally lifts the chance of expedited discretionary action. I remain skeptical of 10% without concrete signals (litigation, DHS review, congressional pressure, or scheduled travel), and I agree that clandestine re-entry is unlikely to be credibly documented in time to resolve Yes.",
    "rationale": "Base rates and timing dominate: post-removal legal return usually takes months to years; two months is tight even with parole. No specific indicators of active, fast-moving relief have surfaced. Public attention slightly increases the chance of an exceptional outcome, but absent evidence of imminent DHS action or court-ordered return, the probability stays low. I modestly adjust upward from 3% to 4% to account for the publicity tail, but I don’t see grounds for as high as 10%.",
