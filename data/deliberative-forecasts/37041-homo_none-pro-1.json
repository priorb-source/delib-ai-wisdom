    "review": "The other two forecasters and I are in strong agreement on the fundamental dynamics of this question: a very powerful status quo and historical base rate arguing for 'No' versus a recent PAHO alert suggesting a slight, unquantified increase in regional risk. I found their reasoning convincing, particularly two points that I had not weighed heavily enough. First, both forecasters explicitly laid out the long and improbable causal chain required for a 'Yes' outcome (importation -> vector infection -> local transmission -> detection -> bureaucratic action), making the low probability more tangible. Second, Forecaster 2 made the excellent point that the PAHO alert itself likely triggers heightened surveillance and vector control efforts in at-risk countries, which acts as a mitigating factor that may actually *reduce* the probability of an outbreak becoming large enough to warrant a CDC advisory. This is a crucial counterargument to seeing the alert as purely a risk-increasing factor.",
    "rationale": "My initial forecast of 5% was based on the idea that the PAHO alert represented a significant increase in regional risk, and I may have overweighted the possibility of a rapid outbreak in a known endemic zone like Panama. After reviewing the other analyses, I believe this was an overestimate. The arguments presented by my fellow forecasters have convinced me to lower my probability. The key reasons for my update are: 1) The explicit framing of the long chain of low-probability events underscores how unlikely a 'Yes' outcome is within the tight ~5-week timeframe. 2) Forecaster 2's insight that the alert itself activates a public health response, thereby mitigating the risk, is a compelling argument I had not fully appreciated. This effectively dampens the primary evidence for a 'Yes' vote. 3) The consensus view that the probability is very low reinforces that my initial forecast may have been an overreaction to the new information, not sufficiently anchoring on the extremely strong base rate. Therefore, I am updating my forecast downward from 5% to 2%, aligning with Forecaster 2. This new figure better reflects the extremely high bar for a 'Yes' outcome while still accounting for the nonzero, heightened regional risk indicated by the PAHO alert.",
