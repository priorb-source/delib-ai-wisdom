  "information": "A Russian delegation is scheduled to visit Istanbul on June 2, 2025, for a second round of peace talks with Ukraine. Kremlin Spokesman Dmitriy Peskov stated that a high-level summit involving President Trump would depend on the achievement of results from these direct talks between the two delegations. Russia proposed the June 2 date, following a previous meeting on May 16. The United States will not send an official delegation, but White House press secretary Caroline Levitt said, 'We will let you know if the President has plans to send a representative.'\n\nIn February 2025, there was media speculation, particularly from French sources, about a potential visit by Donald Trump to Moscow for the Victory Day celebrations on May 9, 2025. Former Russian Prime Minister Sergey Stepanov commented at the time that such a visit would be a 'big sensation.' On February 12, 2025, Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin held a 1.5-hour phone call during which they agreed to a personal meeting and extended mutual invitations to Washington and Moscow. The speculated May 9 visit did not occur.\n\nIn late May 2025, following a major Russian drone and missile attack in Ukraine, President Donald Trump referred to President Vladimir Putin as 'absolutely crazy.' In a separate statement, Trump also expressed his disappointment with Putin's continued attacks, saying, 'I am very disappointed, very, very disappointed.' Trump indicated he would observe Russia's intentions over a two-week period to determine if they were genuine about achieving peace.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "About one month (≈32 days)",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "June 2 Istanbul talks stall or yield only minor progress; rhetoric and hostilities persist; no trip is announced; any leader-level engagement is slated for a third country (e.g., Istanbul, Geneva, Helsinki) or for a later date; July 1 arrives without a Russia visit.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "The June talks produce a tangible breakthrough (ceasefire framework or negotiations roadmap) and both sides agree to a rapid, high-visibility summit in Moscow or another Russian city before end‑June, with the White House dispatching an advance team and announcing a late‑June visit by President Trump to formalize or catalyze the deal.",
    "rationale": "Baseline: There is no announced Russia trip, and presidential travel to an adversary capital typically requires visible prep (advance security teams, public signaling) unless kept exceptionally secret. Historically, U.S. presidents do visit Russia, but not amid active large‑scale hostilities without a clear diplomatic purpose. The status quo therefore favors No.\nRecent signals (RA summary):\n- A Russian–Ukrainian second round in Istanbul on June 2; Kremlin’s Peskov linked any high‑level summit with President Trump to results from these talks. The U.S. isn’t sending an official delegation.\n- Speculation about a May 9 Moscow visit did not materialize.\n- In late May, after major strikes on Ukraine, Trump called Putin “absolutely crazy” and said he was “very disappointed,” adding he’d watch Russia’s intentions over two weeks—implying earliest justification for engagement would be mid‑June and contingent on de‑escalation.\nWhy not higher: Political optics and security/logistics are unfavorable; no trip is announced; Trump’s recent condemnation of Putin reduces near‑term incentives; even if there’s progress, a neutral venue is more likely than Russia. The window is tight (about a month).\nWhy not lower: Trump’s penchant for dramatic, last‑minute diplomacy and the explicit mutual invitations (Feb 12 call) create a non‑zero tail. A breakthrough on June 2 could rapidly trigger a summit, and a two‑to‑three‑week planning sprint is difficult but not impossible if both sides prioritize it.\nUpdate triggers:\n- Upward: Credible reports of a ceasefire framework or major de‑escalation; White House or Kremlin mentions of a Trump visit to Moscow; evidence of U.S. advance teams in Russia; NOTAMs/airspace coordination consistent with a presidential trip; schedule holds late June.\n- Downward: Istanbul talks collapse or renewed large Russian strikes; sharper U.S.–Russia rhetoric; indications of a planned third‑country summit; firm denials from either capital about a Russia trip.",

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
