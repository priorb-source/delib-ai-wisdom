  "information": "In a recent home series ending May 18, 2025, the Dodgers were swept in three games by the Los Angeles Angels. This was the Dodgers' first three-game sweep at home since June 2023. Prior to this series, the Dodgers had been tied with the Detroit Tigers for the best record in the major leagues. The Angels entered the series in last place in the American League West and were reportedly on pace to post historically poor offensive numbers for the season. Other competitive teams in the National League include the Mets and the Phillies.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "About 27 days (until June 15, 2025)",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No — after the May 18 sweep, the Dodgers likely do not currently have the top MLB winning percentage.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "One of the current front-runners (e.g., Tigers, Phillies, Mets; possibly another AL East team) keeps a modest edge while the Dodgers play roughly .550–.600 ball over the next ~25 games, leaving LA 1–3 games behind in winning-percentage terms when the standings are checked on or after June 15.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "The Dodgers go on a ~14–8 (or better) run over the next ~22–25 games while the current leader cools off slightly, producing either a tie for the best winning percentage or a narrow sole lead on the MLB standings page when checked on/after June 15 (assuming ties count as having the highest percentage).",
    "rationale": "Baseline: With ~27 days to go, volatility in a 25-game window is meaningful, but the best teams tend to remain near the top. Per the research assistant, LA had been tied for MLB’s best record before being swept by the Angels; that sweep likely moved them slightly off the top. Other strong contenders mentioned are the Phillies and Mets; the Tigers were tied with LA for the best record before the sweep. This suggests a clustered top tier rather than LA as a clear standalone leader. \nStatus quo weighting: Because the world changes slowly, I give extra weight to the current state: LA is probably a small step behind the top winning percentage today. Over the next four weeks, overcoming multiple close competitors is harder than simply maintaining a lead. \nTeam quality: The Dodgers’ underlying strength (elite lineup headlined by Betts/Ohtani/Freeman; deep roster even amid pitching-management challenges) supports a solid chance to surge. But injuries/usage limits on the pitching staff and the presence of multiple elite peers (Phillies, a surprisingly strong Tigers club, and at least one AL East contender) limit the probability that LA will be the team at the very top on a specific date. \nWhy not higher? Even if LA is top-3 by true talent, there are several plausible leaders on June 15, and they are likely a game or two behind right now, so they must both perform and get help from rivals’ regression. \nWhy not lower? They were tied for the best record just before the Angels series, indicating they’re already in the top cluster. A 2–3 game swing over ~25 games is common, so a return to the top (or a tie for it) is quite feasible. \nUpdate triggers: I would raise the forecast if LA retakes or is within 0.5 games of the top by end of May, or if top rivals stumble. I would lower it if LA’s rotation health/usage worsens, or if any single rival extends to a 3+ game equivalent lead in winning percentage by early June. I assume ties for the best winning percentage count as Yes since the Dodgers would then “have the highest” as well.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill the LA Dodgers have the highest winning percentage in the MLB on June 15, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nYahoo Sports: [Even as Dodgers navigate injuries and manage pitcher usage, the wins keep coming](https://sports.yahoo.com/mlb/article/even-as-dodgers-navigate-injuries-and-manage-pitcher-usage-the-wins-keep-coming-053322413.html)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if the Los Angeles Dodgers have the highest winning percentage in Major League Baseball according to the [MLB official standings](https://www.mlb.com/standings/) when checked by Metaculus on or after June 15, 2025.\n\nNo other resolution source will be used to resolve the question. Question resolves based on how the page appears when checked by a Metaculus Admin.\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nIn a recent home series ending May 18, 2025, the Dodgers were swept in three games by the Los Angeles Angels.

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
