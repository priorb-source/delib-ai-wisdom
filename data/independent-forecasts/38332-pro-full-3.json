  "information": "In early March 2025, during the inauguration of President Yamandú Orsi in Montevideo, Brazilian President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva publicly invited Uruguay, Colombia, and Mexico to the BRICS summit scheduled for July in Rio de Janeiro. Lula stated, 'it's essential that these countries participate, because it's a moment for debate with the whole world.' Following the invitation, President Orsi expressed interest in participating, stating he hoped other Latin American countries would join to 'consolidate multilateralism and free trade.'\n\nPresident Yamandú Orsi is confirmed to travel to Seville, Spain, to attend the Fourth International Conference on Sustainable Development Financing. This United Nations conference is scheduled to run from June 30 to July 3, 2025. President Orsi has reaffirmed Uruguay's commitment to multilateralism, stating that his government will be in Seville to 'strengthen and commit' to the UN's objectives.\n\nAs of early June 2025, the government of Uruguay had not issued an official public statement confirming or denying President Orsi's attendance at the BRICS summit. Media coverage at the time described the country's participation as 'undecided' or 'up in the air.' The BRICS summit is scheduled to take place in Rio de Janeiro on July 6-7, 2025. Other leaders, including India's Prime Minister Narendra Modi, are planning to attend.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "26 days",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "The government of Uruguay either remains silent until the July 1 deadline passes, or formally declines the invitation, possibly citing President Orsi's demanding schedule with the UN conference in Seville ending just three days before the BRICS summit begins.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Before July 1, 2025, the Uruguayan Presidential office or the Ministry of Foreign Affairs issues a press release or an official makes a public statement confirming that President Yamandú Orsi will travel to Rio de Janeiro to attend the BRICS summit.",
    "rationale": "The primary drivers for a 'Yes' outcome are the strong diplomatic and political incentives. The invitation was extended personally by President Lula of Brazil, Uruguay's most significant neighbor and a key partner in Mercosur. For President Orsi, a fellow left-leaning leader, accepting the invitation reinforces this crucial bilateral relationship and aligns with his stated foreign policy goal of strengthening multilateralism. Orsi has already publicly expressed interest in attending. The logistics, while tight, are feasible; President Orsi is scheduled to be at a conference in Seville, Spain until July 3, and the BRICS summit begins in Rio de Janeiro on July 6. This is a manageable travel schedule for a head of state. \n\nThe probability is not higher than 70% because, as of early June, no official confirmation has been issued. This delay could signal internal debate within the Uruguayan government about the strategic implications of aligning more closely with the BRICS bloc, which includes China and Russia. The demanding schedule provides a plausible reason for declining, which could be used as a diplomatic cover if there is hesitation. An update towards a higher probability would require any positive statement from Uruguayan officials, even if informal.\n\nThe probability is not lower than 70% because the political and diplomatic fundamentals strongly favor attendance. Publicly snubbing a personal invitation from the president of Brazil for a summit hosted in Brazil would be a significant and surprising diplomatic move, likely damaging to regional relations. The status quo of 'no announcement' is common for such events, with final confirmations often coming just a few weeks prior. An update towards a lower probability would require reports of scheduling conflicts becoming insurmountable or statements from officials suggesting non-attendance is being seriously considered.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill the government of Uruguay announce that its president, Yamandú Orsi, will attend the BRICS summit in July 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\n[Lula invites Mexico, Colombia, and Uruguay to BRICS Summit](https://en.mercopress.com/2025/03/04/lula-invites-mexico-colombia-and-uruguay-to-brics-summit#google_vignette) | [Uruguay’s participation at the BRICS summit still up in the air](https://www.plenglish.com/news/2025/03/02/uruguays-participation-at-the-brics-summit-still-up-in-the-air/)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if before July 1, 2025 the government of Uruguay, or anyone speaking on its behalf, issues any sort of public communication (written or oral) confirming its acceptance of the invitation for President Yamandú Orsi to attend in person the BRICS Summit scheduled to take place in Rio de Janeiro in July 2025.\n\nSince the summit will be held after this question resolves, actual attendance is not required, merely the announcement of plans to attend.\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nIn early March 2025, during the inauguration of President Yamandú Orsi in Montevideo, Brazilian President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva publicly invited Uruguay, Colombia, and Mexico to the BRICS summit scheduled for July in Rio de Janeiro.

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
