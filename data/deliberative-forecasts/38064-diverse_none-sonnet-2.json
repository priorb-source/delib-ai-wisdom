    "review": "I've identified a critical interpretive difference. Forecasters 2 and 3 appear to assume June 12, 2025 has already been announced as the meeting date, focusing primarily on whether it will complete successfully. Forecaster 2's 95% forecast treats this as a straightforward operational question with high base rates, while Forecaster 3's 76% incorporates more GME-specific risk but still assumes the date is set.\n\nHowever, my initial 30% reflected uncertainty about whether June 12 is even the scheduled date - we're 16 days out with 'no additional information available,' which is highly unusual if the date were confirmed (proxy materials are typically filed 30-60 days in advance). The other forecasters make compelling arguments about: (1) high base rates for scheduled meetings completing (>90%), (2) companies learning from failures (the 2024 crash creates strong incentives to upgrade systems), and (3) the predictability of annual meeting timing.\n\nForecaster 3's acknowledgment that 'lack of confirming details justifies not going higher' suggests some recognition of date uncertainty. The key insight from both is that IF June 12 is the scheduled date, completion probability should be high despite 2024's issues, because the failure mode is now known and addressable.",
    "rationale": "Re-evaluating the question structure: asking about a specific date (June 12) in a forecasting interview context likely assumes some basis for that date being relevant. The 2024 meeting was June 13, making June 12 a reasonable candidate. I'm updating my estimate upward based on: (1) The strong base rate arguments about corporate meeting completion (85-95%), (2) The compelling case that known failures are easier to prevent than unknown ones, and (3) The reasonable assumption that June 12 is at least a plausible candidate date given 2024's timing.\n\nHowever, I'm not going as high as 95% because: (1) The lack of confirmed information about the specific date remains concerning - there's meaningful probability it's scheduled for a different date entirely, (2) The 2024 server crash demonstrates real execution risk specific to GameStop's high retail interest, (3) The resolution criteria are strict - partial completion doesn't count, and (4) Even with preparations, unprecedented traffic loads from meme stock enthusiasm could overwhelm systems.\n\nMy updated probability balances: ~70% chance June 12 is the scheduled date (given June timing pattern and no contrary information) × ~75% chance of successful completion if scheduled (accounting for learned lessons but retaining GME-specific risk) = ~52-53%. I'm rounding to 55% to reflect that the other forecasters' confidence in high completion rates has valid foundations, but date uncertainty still warrants significant discount from their estimates.",
