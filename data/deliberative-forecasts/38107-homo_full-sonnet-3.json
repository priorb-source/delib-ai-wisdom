    "review": "Both forecasters make several compelling arguments that strengthen the case for a lower probability. Most notably: (1) They emphasize that weeks have already passed since the incident without any charges, warrants, or subpoenas being issued - this is a stronger signal than I initially weighted; (2) Forecaster 3 explicitly mentions grand jury proceedings as a likely requirement, which adds procedural time I hadn't fully accounted for; (3) Forecaster 2 makes an excellent point that calls for prosecution come from political commentators (Flynn, Fox News analysts, InfoWars) rather than actual prosecutors or DOJ officials - this distinction is important for assessing credibility; (4) Both emphasize that Comey was already interviewed and released without arrest, which is a strong signal that investigators didn't find immediate grounds. Their arguments about InfoWars' poor track record and the unreliability of these predictions are well-taken. However, I notice they may be slightly underweighting the fact that 31 days is still technically sufficient time if there were extraordinary political will, and the investigation is confirmed active by the DHS Secretary herself, not just media speculation.",
    "rationale": "After reviewing the other forecasters' analyses, I find their arguments about procedural barriers and the significance of time passing persuasive. The grand jury requirement adds a procedural layer I hadn't fully emphasized, and the fact that approximately two weeks have passed since the incident without formal charges is more meaningful than I initially weighted. The distinction between political commentary calling for prosecution versus actual DOJ action is crucial. However, I maintain slightly more uncertainty than Forecasters 2 and 3 because: (1) The investigation is officially confirmed and active, not speculative; (2) While 31 days is tight, it's not impossible for rapid legal action under extraordinary political pressure; (3) We don't have full visibility into what prosecutors may be doing behind the scenes. The base rate of arresting former FBI directors remains extremely low, First Amendment protections are strong, and the 2023 Supreme Court precedent creates a high bar. But the active investigation and political environment prevent me from going as low as 4-5%. I'm updating my forecast down from 10% to 7%, acknowledging the stronger arguments about procedural timing and the significance of weeks passing without charges, while maintaining slightly more probability mass for tail-risk scenarios.",
