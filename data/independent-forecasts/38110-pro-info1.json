  "information": "The government of Benin closed its land border crossings with Nigeria's Kwara state around May 6-8, 2025. The specific crossing mentioned is between Taberu village in Baruten Local Government Area, Kwara State, and the neighboring Tanu village in Benin. On May 9, 2025, Benin extended its border security operations to the Sèmè and Owode borders in Lagos State. Stated reasons for the closure include concerns over arms smuggling, the emergence of a new militant group known as 'Mahmuda', and unregulated exportation of agricultural products like soya beans and cashews. Reports mentioned intelligence regarding the illegal importation of arms and ammunition from Parakou, Benin, into Nigeria.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "1 month",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No. The border crossings remain closed as they currently are.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "The underlying security and economic issues cited by Benin—specifically arms smuggling, the activities of the 'Mahmuda' militant group, and unregulated agricultural exports—are not resolved through bilateral negotiations between Benin and Nigeria within the next month. The situation remains at a diplomatic stalemate, and Benin keeps the border closed to address its stated concerns.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "High-level diplomatic talks between Nigerian and Beninese officials lead to a swift agreement. Nigeria provides credible security assurances, possibly including joint patrols or enhanced intelligence sharing, that satisfy Benin's concerns. A temporary arrangement is made to regulate the disputed agricultural trade, leading Benin to reopen the crossings.",
    "rationale": "My forecast is primarily driven by the very short timeframe for resolution. The border closure, which occurred in early May 2025, is attributed to serious and complex issues: national security threats from a new militant group and arms smuggling, as well as economic disputes over unregulated trade. These are not problems that are typically resolved in a matter of weeks. The status quo, in which the border remains closed, is the most likely outcome due to diplomatic and bureaucratic inertia. For the border to reopen before July 1, there would need to be an unusually rapid and successful high-level intervention that produces tangible security and economic agreements. While the economic pain caused by the closure provides an incentive for a quick resolution, the gravity of the security concerns cited by Benin suggests they will not reverse their decision without significant concessions and verifiable actions from Nigeria. My forecast is not lower than 15% because strong political will, driven by economic pressure and Nigeria's regional influence, could force a surprise diplomatic breakthrough. My forecast is not higher because the one-month timeline is exceptionally tight for resolving issues as fundamental as cross-border security and trade regulation. I would increase my forecast upon credible news of high-level bilateral meetings being scheduled or joint security operations being announced. I would decrease it if either government issues statements that harden their position or if there is a complete absence of diplomatic engagement.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill Benin re-open its closed land border crossings with Nigeria's Kwara state before July 1, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\n[Exclusive: Benin Rep.

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
