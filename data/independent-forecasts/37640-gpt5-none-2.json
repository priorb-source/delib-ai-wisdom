    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "About 7 weeks (until July 1, 2025)",
    "status_quo_outcome": "Yes — EnergyStar.gov is currently up and such federal sites are rarely taken fully offline quickly.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "EPA decommissions the domain or server before July 1 (e.g., DNS removed, firewall blocks public access, or site returns persistent errors) and IsItDownRightNow reports it as down when checked on/after July 1.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Even if the program is eliminated, the site remains reachable (perhaps with a sunset or archival notice, or a redirect to an EPA/DOE page) and IsItDownRightNow reports it as up on/after July 1.",
    "rationale": "- Baseline: As of May 7, IsItDownRightNow shows EnergyStar.gov is up. With only ~7 weeks to July 1, the status quo strongly favors continued availability. Federal websites typically persist during program transitions for records management, stakeholder comms, and archiving, even when work is being wound down.\n- Policy shift: Reports indicate the administration plans to eliminate Energy Star and related climate work not required by statute. However, eliminating a program does not necessarily imply immediate domain takedown. Past precedent (e.g., 2017 EPA climate content changes) often led to removals or archiving over months, not weeks, and commonly left pages up with notices or redirects.\n- Practical/technical factors: Taking a federal domain fully offline usually involves coordination (communications, NARA/records, redirects). A quick full decommission before July 1 is possible but less likely than leaving a static or redirecting page. Moreover, the resolution criterion is lenient: any reachable response likely yields an “up” status by the checker, including redirects or a sunset page.\n- Residual risks: A deliberate symbolic takedown timed before July 1; misconfiguration causing the site to be unreachable at the time of Metaculus’s check; or policy to immediately remove the domain. Add small chance of transient outage or monitoring-site false negative.\n- Why not higher: Explicit elimination plans raise the probability of rapid changes, including potential domain removal, and short-term political optics could motivate faster action.\n- Why not lower: Institutional inertia, stakeholder reliance on Energy Star labeling information, and common practice of maintaining or archiving federal sites make a hard takedown by July 1 unlikely.\n- What would move me up: Public statements indicating the site will be archived but remain available; internal or external comms setting a later decommission date; continued uptime with visible sunset messaging/redirects; congressional or legal pressure to preserve access.\n- What would move me down: An official EPA/OMB notice or reliable reporting of an imminent domain decommission before July 1; observed persistent downtime/blocked access in late June; confirmation that IsItDownRightNow flags the site as down despite redirects; DNS changes indicating domain retirement on a specific date before July 1.\n- Research assistant: No additional info; forecast primarily based on current uptime, typical federal web decommission timelines, and the NYT report on planned elimination.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill the EPA's EnergyStar.gov still be online on July 1, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nAccording to the [New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/06/climate/epa-energy-star-eliminated.html), \"'The Energy Star program and all the other climate work, outside of what’s required by statute, is being de-prioritized and eliminated,' Paul Gunning, the director of the E.P.A. Office of Atmospheric Protection, told employees during the meeting, according to the recording obtained by The New York Times. Mr. Gunning’s office itself is also slated for elimination.\n\nFor the past 33 years, Energy Star has been known for its recognizable blue label, which shows that an appliance has met energy efficiency standards set by the federal government.\"\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if EnergyStar.gov is online according to [Is It Down Right Now?](https://www.isitdownrightnow.com/energystar.gov.html) when accessed by Metaculus on or after July 1, 2025.\n\nAs of May 7, 2025, the resolution source returns the message, \"Energystar.gov is UP and reachable by us.\"\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nNo additional information available.\n\nToday is 2025-05-14.\n\nBefore answering you think:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n(e) You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
