    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "26 days (outcome determined by July 1, 2025)",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No - the New York Times does not mention 'reverse purchasing' or 'reverse purchase'",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "The New York Times does not cover this Chinese economic trend during the specified window, or if they do report on similar consumer behavior patterns, they use their own terminology rather than the specific phrase 'reverse purchasing.' The term remains confined to Chinese media discourse.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "The New York Times publishes an article about Chinese consumer trends, cross-border shopping, or international trade that specifically adopts the term 'reverse purchasing' or 'reverse purchase,' possibly when covering or translating Chinese media reports about this phenomenon, or when the trend becomes significant enough to warrant direct coverage using this specific terminology.",
    "rationale": "This forecast requires considering several key factors. First, 'reverse purchasing' appears to be terminology primarily used in Chinese media (as evidenced by the People's Daily article from April 30, 2025). The New York Times rarely adopts niche economic terminology directly from Chinese sources without such terms first gaining broader recognition in English-language discourse. The base rate for the NY Times using obscure translated economic terms from Chinese media is very low. Second, the time window is quite narrow - only 22 days from June 9 to July 1. This provides limited opportunity for the term to emerge in coverage. Third, my research assistant provided no evidence that 'reverse purchasing' has gained any traction in Western media or is being discussed beyond Chinese outlets. The NY Times typically employs its own descriptive language when covering international economic phenomena rather than importing technical terms from foreign media. Why not higher: There's zero evidence of momentum for this term in English-language media. The concept itself (Chinese consumers purchasing goods abroad) isn't particularly novel or newsworthy enough to drive urgent coverage using this specific terminology. The editorial standards of the NY Times favor clear, accessible language over niche economic jargon. Why not lower: Though unlikely, it's technically possible the Times could reference this term if writing about Chinese economic policy or consumer behavior trends, particularly if directly quoting or analyzing Chinese government statements or media. The probability isn't zero given the non-zero time window. Updates would come from: evidence of 'reverse purchasing' appearing in other English-language business or economic publications, or major news developments specifically framing Chinese consumer behavior with this term.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill the New York Times mention \"reverse purchasing\" before July 1, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nPeople's Daily: [“Reverse purchasing” reflects the vitality of the Chinese market](http://finance.people.com.cn/n1/2025/0430/c1004-40471159.html)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if the NY Times mentions \"reverse purchasing\" in any of its content items as found through [this search](https://www.nytimes.com/search?dropmab=false&lang=en&query=%22reverse%20purchasing%22&sort=best), dated after June 9, 2025 and before July 1, 2025. This question will also count \"reverse purchase,\" which can be found through [this link](https://www.nytimes.com/search?dropmab=false&lang=en&query=%22reverse%20purchase%22&sort=best).\n\n\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nNo additional information available.\n\nToday is 2025-06-05.\n\nBefore answering you think:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n(e) You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
