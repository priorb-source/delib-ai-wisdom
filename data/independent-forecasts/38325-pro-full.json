  "information": "The advance estimate for Q1 2025 annualized real GDP growth was -0.3%. The second estimate, released on May 29, 2025, was an upward revision to -0.2%. Key factors driving the contraction in the first quarter included a significant increase in imports, which subtracted 4.90 percentage points from GDP, and a reduction in government spending, which subtracted 0.12 percentage points. These negative factors were partially offset by positive contributions from investment (+3.98 percentage points) and consumer spending (+0.80 percentage points).\n\nHistorical analyses of BEA data by the St. Louis Fed show that revisions which change the sign of GDP growth from negative to positive are uncommon, happening in less than 20% of such cases. Another analysis covering the period from 1996 to 2024 indicates that when an advance estimate is between -0.5% and 0%, the third estimate turns positive in roughly 35-40% of instances. The typical absolute revision from the second to the third estimate is about 0.1 to 0.2 percentage points, while the absolute average revision from the advance to the third estimate is larger, at approximately 0.5 percentage points.\n\nThe third estimate for Q1 2025 GDP incorporates more comprehensive source data than was available for previous estimates. This includes complete data for March on international trade in goods and services, construction spending, and manufacturers' and trade inventories. The third estimate will also incorporate updated data on federal and state government spending, as well as the results of annual benchmark revisions to trade and services data which can affect the final figures.",

    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Approximately 3 weeks. The Bureau of Economic Analysis typically releases the third estimate for a quarter's GDP near the end of the third month following the quarter's end, suggesting a release date around the end of June 2025.",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No. The most recent data, the second estimate, showed annualized real GDP growth at -0.2%. If no further revisions occurred, the outcome would be No.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "The more comprehensive source data incorporated into the third estimate confirms the weakness seen in prior estimates. Final data for March on international trade, inventories, and government spending are either unchanged or revised slightly downwards, resulting in a final GDP figure that remains at or below 0.0%.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Final source data is stronger than anticipated, leading to an upward revision of at least 0.3 percentage points. This is likely driven by a smaller-than-estimated trade deficit in March (due to higher exports or lower imports) or upward revisions to business inventories and construction spending, pushing the final growth rate above 0.0%.",
    "rationale": "My forecast is based on the second estimate of -0.2% and historical revision patterns. The status quo is a negative growth rate, and revisions must overcome this to resolve as 'Yes'. Historically, when an advance GDP estimate is between -0.5% and 0%, the third estimate turns positive in approximately 35-40% of cases. The Q1 advance estimate was -0.3%, placing it squarely in this category. The revision from -0.3% to -0.2% already demonstrates some positive momentum. However, a further upward revision of at least 0.3 percentage points is required to cross the zero threshold. This is larger than the typical absolute revision of 0.1 to 0.2 percentage points observed between the second and third estimates. The primary drag on Q1 GDP was a surge in imports, a volatile component prone to revision. A significant change in the final trade data could easily swing the final number. I am placing my probability at 38%, reflecting the historical data for similar situations but tempering it slightly because the required revision is larger than the median second-to-third revision. My forecast is not higher because overcoming a negative estimate remains the less frequent outcome. It is not lower because the initial negative reading was driven by a volatile component and the historical data suggest a non-trivial chance of a positive revision in these specific circumstances. I would increase my forecast upon release of data suggesting a smaller March trade deficit or stronger inventory accumulation. I would decrease it if leading indicators pointed to the opposite.",

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any).
