  "information": "National polling data shows the Conservative party with a 22% approval rating, while Reform UK is polling at 25% and the Liberal Democrats at approximately 14-16%. In the 2024 UK general election, the Liberal Democrats regained the constituencies of North Cornwall and St Ives. Political analyst Professor John Curtice has noted that the surge in support for Reform UK is likely to split the right-wing vote, which could indirectly benefit the Liberal Democrats.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Approximately 10 days. Cornwall Council elections are scheduled for May 1, 2025, which is the first Thursday in May, a typical date for English local elections.",
    "status_quo_outcome": "The status quo from the 2021 Cornwall Council election results would likely show either a hung council with no overall control, or control by a coalition/plurality of Independents or Liberal Democrats, as Cornwall has historically had strong Independent representation alongside Liberal Democrat presence.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Independent candidates collectively win the most seats on Cornwall Council, maintaining Cornwall's traditional pattern of strong Independent representation. Alternatively, the Conservative Party retains the most seats despite national unpopularity, or the vote becomes so fragmented between Conservatives, Reform UK, Liberal Democrats, Labour, and Independents that no single party clearly dominates, with Independents emerging as the largest bloc.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "The Liberal Democrats leverage their momentum from winning North Cornwall and St Ives constituencies in the 2024 general election to secure the most seats on Cornwall Council. The split in the right-wing vote between Conservatives (22% nationally) and Reform UK (25% nationally) allows Liberal Democrat candidates to win seats in multi-way contests. Their ground game and local organization, strengthened by recent parliamentary victories, proves effective in Cornwall's 87 council divisions.",
    "rationale": "The key challenge in forecasting this outcome is Cornwall's distinctive political landscape with its strong tradition of Independent councillors. While the research assistant notes that the Liberal Democrats won North Cornwall and St Ives in the 2024 general election, local council elections often produce different results than parliamentary elections. The national polling data shows Conservatives at 22% and Lib Dems at 14-16%, but local factors typically matter more in council elections. The split between Conservatives and Reform UK (25%) could benefit the Lib Dems in three-way contests, as Professor Curtice noted. However, the question asks specifically about winning the MOST seats - not control or a plurality, but literally the highest number. In Cornwall, this is complicated by the presence of many Independent candidates who don't caucus as a unified group but are counted individually. The Lib Dem momentum from 2024 is real and significant, suggesting improved organization and voter enthusiasm. However, I'm not forecasting higher because: (1) Independents have historically performed very strongly in Cornwall and could collectively or individually hold more seats than any single party; (2) we lack detailed local polling; (3) 10 days is enough time for the situation to remain fluid. I'm not forecasting lower because: (1) the 2024 general election results demonstrate genuine Liberal Democrat strength in Cornwall; (2) the Conservative-Reform split is a structural advantage; (3) the Lib Dems have the organizational capacity to run a full slate of candidates unlike some smaller parties. To revise upward, I would need to see: local polling showing Lib Dems clearly ahead, evidence that fewer Independents are running, or endorsements/campaign momentum indicators. To revise downward: polling showing Conservatives consolidating support, evidence of strong Independent campaigns, or signs the Reform vote isn't actually splitting the right as expected.",
