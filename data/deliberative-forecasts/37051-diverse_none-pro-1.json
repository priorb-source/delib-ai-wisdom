    "review": "The other two forecasters presented analyses that were highly convergent with my own, focusing on the same core tension: an unprecedented political threat versus immense institutional and legal inertia. We all agree that the base rate for such an event is near-zero, the procedural timeline is far too short for a standard revocation, and Harvard would mount an immediate and likely successful legal challenge. Forecaster 2 emphasized the specific political actor's demonstrated willingness to take unconventional actions, which is a key driver of the non-zero probability. Forecaster 3 provided a detailed breakdown of the procedural steps and legal grounds, reinforcing the high barriers to a 'Yes' outcome. Neither presented arguments I had entirely missed, but their framing, particularly their slightly higher assessment of the tail risk posed by direct political intervention, was persuasive. They convinced me that my initial 1% might have been slightly too anchored on the procedural barriers alone, without fully pricing in the potential for a politically-motivated attempt to circumvent those very procedures, however unlikely its success.",
    "rationale": "After reviewing my colleagues' analyses, I am updating my forecast modestly upward from 1% to 2%. My core reasoning remains unchanged: the procedural, legal, and institutional barriers to revoking Harvard's 501(c)(3) status are formidable, and the timeline of just over two months makes a successful revocation extremely improbable. The IRS process is designed to be deliberative and includes multiple steps of notification, appeal, and potential litigation, a sequence that takes years, not weeks. However, both other forecasters correctly highlighted the significance of the specific political threat from a figure known for challenging institutional norms. This deliberation has convinced me that I was slightly underweighting the small but real possibility of an extraordinary, extra-procedural attempt to force the issue. A 2% forecast better reflects a consensus view, acknowledging that while the system is designed to prevent such an outcome, the current political environment introduces a slightly larger tail risk than a near-zero base rate would suggest. I am not moving higher, to 3%, as I believe that level begins to understate the powerful braking effects of the administrative state and the judicial system, which would almost certainly intervene to halt such a process immediately.",
