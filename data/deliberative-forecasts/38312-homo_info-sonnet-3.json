    "review": "The other forecasters raise several critical points I underweighted. Most importantly, Forecaster 2 provides specific summit dates (June 15-17), meaning only 12 days remain - not the '2-3 weeks' I vaguely estimated. This dramatically tightens the timeline. Forecaster 2 also emphasizes that Canada has already invited multiple non-G7 countries (Australia, Ukraine, South Africa, Brazil) but conspicuously not India, and that credible sources confirm no advance preparations are underway. This is much stronger evidence than I initially credited. The point about a last-minute invitation being 'face-losing' for Modi domestically is also compelling - accepting after others were invited first would appear weak. Forecaster 3's mention of positive messages between Carney and Modi provides slight upward pressure, but their observation about unresolvable bilateral issues (Khalistani elements, diplomat safety) reinforces the downward case. The logistical impossibility argument is particularly strong: security advance teams, bilateral meeting schedules, and delegation logistics cannot materialize in under 2 weeks for a visit of this magnitude. The combination of (1) explicit 12-day timeline, (2) other countries already invited, (3) no reported preparations, and (4) face-saving concerns makes Forecaster 2's lower probability more justified than my initial assessment.",
    "rationale": "Upon reflection, I overestimated the probability by being too vague about timing and underweighting the significance of Canada having already invited other countries. With only 12 days until June 15-17, and no advance preparations reported by credible sources, the logistical barriers are nearly insurmountable. High-level summit attendance requires weeks of security and diplomatic preparation that simply hasn't occurred. The fact that Australia, Ukraine, South Africa, and Brazil have been invited while India has not is highly informative - if Canada intended to invite India, they would have done so already alongside these other non-G7 nations. Accepting a rushed, last-minute invitation would be domestically costly for Modi. I maintain some probability above zero because diplomatic surprises occasionally occur and there's technically still time for an emergency invitation if strategic imperatives suddenly override normal protocol. However, the evidence clearly points toward a lower probability than my initial 12%.",
