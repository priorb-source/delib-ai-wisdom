    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Approximately 1-2 months. The US Census Bureau typically releases the international trade data for a given month early in the second following month, so the report for April 2025 is expected in early June 2025.",
    "status_quo_outcome": "Yes. Absent major policy shifts or economic shocks, nominal exports would be expected to increase. The year-over-year growth from April 2023 to April 2024 was approximately 2.1%. A similar rate of growth, driven by global economic activity and inflation, would push the April 2025 figure well above the threshold.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Following the implementation of broad new tariffs in early 2025, as implied by the 'liberation day' context, major US trading partners such as the European Union, China, and Canada impose significant retaliatory tariffs. This trade war sharply reduces demand for US goods and services, and the resulting decline in export volume is severe enough to overwhelm the upward pressure from domestic inflation, causing the total nominal export value to fall below the April 2024 level.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "The new US tariff regime is either less severe than anticipated or key trading partners' response is muted, avoiding a full-scale trade war. Alternatively, a significant depreciation of the US dollar boosts export competitiveness, or strong global demand for specific high-value US exports (e.g., energy, technology, services) is resilient enough to overcome the new trade barriers. In this scenario, the combination of these factors with underlying inflation results in nominal export growth.",
    "rationale": "My forecast is primarily driven by the significant policy shock implied by the provided background context regarding 'Trump’s liberation day tariffs'. While the status quo baseline, based on recent year-over-year growth (2.1%) and inflation, would strongly suggest a 'Yes' outcome, this context fundamentally alters the forecast. A sweeping new tariff regime, implemented in early 2025, would almost certainly provoke significant retaliatory measures from nearly all major US trading partners. This would create powerful headwinds for US exports. The central question becomes whether the negative impact on export volume will be greater than the positive impact of nominal price increases due to inflation (currently running around 3-3.5%). I judge that a widespread trade war is likely to reduce export volumes by more than this inflationary buffer, causing the nominal dollar value to stagnate or decline year-over-year. Therefore, 'No' is the more probable outcome.\n\nMy probability is not lower than 30 because inflation provides a substantial cushion, meaning export volumes would need to fall significantly to register a nominal year-over-year decline. Furthermore, some exports are based on long-term contracts, and services may be less affected than goods, preventing a total collapse in the short term. \n\nMy probability is not higher because the prospect of a simultaneous trade conflict with the EU, China, and other key partners represents a severe and unprecedented shock to the global trading system. It is difficult to construct a plausible scenario where this does not lead to a material reduction in US exports.\n\nI would increase my forecast probability for 'Yes' if there were signs that trading partners were not retaliating, that key trade blocs were granted exemptions, or if early 2025 trade data showed unexpected resilience. Conversely, I would lower it further upon confirmation of high, sweeping tariffs and immediate, strong retaliatory actions.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill the US Census Bureau report an increase in US exports in April 2025 compared with April 2024?\n\nQuestion background:\n[Experts React: How the world is responding to Trump’s ‘liberation day’ tariffs](https://www.atlanticcouncil.org/blogs/new-atlanticist/experts-react/experts-react-how-the-world-is-responding-to-trumps-liberation-day-tariffs/)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if the total amount of exports by the United States for April 2025 reported by the US Census Bureau in its [U.S. International Trade in Goods and Services release](https://www.census.gov/foreign-trade/Press-Release/current_press_release/index.html) encompassing that month, exceeds 262,578 million USD.\n\n\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nNo additional information available.\n\nToday is 2025-04-30.\n\nBefore answering you think:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n(e) You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
