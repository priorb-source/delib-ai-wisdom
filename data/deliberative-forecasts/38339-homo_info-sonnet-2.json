    "review": "Both forecasters provide valuable additional context that I hadn't fully weighted. Forecaster 2 quantifies the crisis more precisely (€2 billion debt, ~$580,000 daily obligation), which underscores the severity. Forecaster 3 highlights Bulgaria's active preparation of alternatives (Black Sea exploration, LNG terminals), suggesting greater readiness to act than I initially considered. However, I find their 22-25% forecasts somewhat overconfident given the key evidence. The critical fact that talks as of May 2, 2025 focused on 'price and capacity renegotiation rather than outright cancellation' - just one month ago - strongly suggests the parties are pursuing modification, not termination. This is the most recent concrete evidence of direction, and both forecasters don't adequately engage with it. Additionally, the requirement that 'termination of the contract is blocked until the outstanding debt is fully settled' creates a structural barrier that makes rapid unilateral cancellation very difficult within 25 days. While the financial distress is severe, bankruptcy risk doesn't automatically translate to contract cancellation announcement - it could lead to payment moratorium, restructuring, or other crisis measures. The forecasters correctly emphasize status quo bias and short timeframes, but then don't follow through with sufficiently low probabilities given these constraints.",
    "rationale": "After reviewing the other analyses, I'm updating modestly upward from 12% to 15%. The quantified severity of the financial crisis (€2 billion debt, $580,000 daily costs) and Bulgaria's demonstrated preparation of alternatives (diversification efforts) are more significant than I initially weighted. These factors do create genuine possibility of forced action even in a short timeframe. However, I'm not updating as high as 22-25% because the most recent evidence - renegotiation talks in early May rather than cancellation talks - is decisive. This indicates both parties are on a modification track, not a termination track. The debt settlement requirement before termination creates a massive procedural barrier. With only 25 days remaining and no announcement despite months of public pressure, the default outcome is clearly continuation or renegotiation. For cancellation to occur now would require a dramatic acceleration from the established negotiation pattern, which while possible given the financial stress, remains unlikely in such a compressed timeframe. The increase to 15% acknowledges the severity of the crisis while maintaining that structural and temporal barriers make cancellation improbable.",
