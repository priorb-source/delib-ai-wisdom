    "review": "Forecaster 2’s process-based skepticism is persuasive: moving a contentious defunding provision through both chambers and to signature within ~6 weeks is highly unlikely. I’d add an important reinforcement they didn’t mention: CPB is funded via two-year advance appropriations, so even “immediate” defunding typically requires rescissions and thus even steeper legislative hurdles. That strengthens their low base rate. Their analysis underweights that the resolution depends on the spreadsheet’s designation rather than strict legal finality, but in practice the maintainers are unlikely to mark “complete” without durable, enacted changes or clearly effective implementation.\n\nForecaster 3’s 28% seems too high. Executive action faces the Impoundment Control Act and near-certain litigation/GAO scrutiny; temporary withholdings or directives are unlikely to be judged as definitively “stopping funding,” and the tracker is apt to keep such an item as “in progress” while contested. With only ~45 days left and no visible forcing event (e.g., a must-pass bill at the brink), the prior for a clean, recognized completion is low. Their recognition of the spreadsheet’s subjective assessment is valid, but they overestimate how quickly and definitively maintainers would call it complete on the basis of executive steps alone.\n",
    "rationale": "Key drivers remain: (1) very short timeline; (2) legislative difficulty amplified by the Senate filibuster and the need for either a must-pass vehicle or a standalone rescission; (3) CPB’s advance appropriations, which make an immediate stop unusually hard even for a unified government; (4) the Impoundment Control Act constraining executive-only routes; and (5) the tracker’s likely caution and possible update lag, both biasing toward No under the resolution rule.\n\nNew consideration: the advance-appropriation feature lowers the chance of any action being both effective and recognized as “complete” by the tracker before July 1.\n\nGiven these, I retain a low probability but shade down slightly from my prior to reflect the added difficulty from advance appropriations and the lack of any reported fast-moving vehicle. I don’t go as low as 2% because there remains a nonzero path via a sudden inclusion in a must-pass bill or an aggressive executive freeze that the tracker (perhaps controversially) decides to treat as completion and updates promptly.\n",
