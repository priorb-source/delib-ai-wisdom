  "information": "U.S. Indo-Pacific Commander Admiral Samuel Paparo stated in May 2025 that while the U.S. could currently defeat China in a Taiwan Strait conflict, China's military is expanding its capabilities rapidly. Paparo noted that China is producing warships at a rate of 6 per year compared to the U.S.'s 1.8. He also stated that China's military pressure on Taiwan had escalated by 300% in 2024. In response to heightened tensions, Taiwan's Ministry of Defense announced its annual 'Han Kuang' military exercises in summer 2025 will, for the first time, simulate a response to a potential Chinese invasion specifically set in the year 2027.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Less than 2 months. The question resolves on July 1, 2025.",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No. The People's Republic of China continues its campaign of military pressure and 'gray zone' tactics against Taiwan, but does not launch a full-scale ground invasion.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "The People's Republic of China maintains or slightly adjusts its level of military intimidation, including air and naval incursions, but does not commit ground forces to Taiwanese territory. The US continues to condemn this pressure but has no cause to accuse China of a full-scale invasion before the deadline.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Following a rapid and unforeseen escalation, perhaps triggered by a political event or a military miscalculation in the Taiwan Strait, the People's Liberation Army initiates an amphibious and airborne assault on Taiwan. As PLA ground troops land on the island, the US President or Secretary of State publicly declares that China is invading Taiwan.",
    "rationale": "My forecast is based on the extremely high costs and logistical complexities of a full-scale invasion of Taiwan, which make it a highly unlikely event within the short, sub-two-month timeframe. The status quo, while tense, is one of coercion, not open warfare. An invasion would be a radical break from this, likely triggering a devastating war with the US and its allies, and causing catastrophic damage to China's economy. The research provided indicates that while tensions and Chinese capabilities are increasing, key defense planners are preparing for a potential conflict in the medium-term (e.g., 2027), not within the next 60 days. The massive and observable preparations required for an amphibious invasion have not been reported, making a surprise attack before July 1, 2025, highly improbable. My probability is not lower than 2% because the heightened military pressure (a reported 300% increase in 2024) raises the risk of an accidental clash that could spiral out of control, or a severe miscalculation by Beijing's leadership. It also reflects the inherent unpredictability of the situation. My probability is not higher because the fundamental deterrents—military, economic, and diplomatic—remain exceptionally strong. An invasion is a 'break the glass' option for the CCP, not a tool of regular statecraft. I would increase my forecast if intelligence detected a massive, unannounced mobilization of PLA forces opposite Taiwan. I would decrease my forecast if China were to publicly de-escalate military exercises and enter into high-level de-confliction talks with the US.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill the United States accuse the People's Republic of China of invading Taiwan before July 1, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nCFR: [Why China-Taiwan Relations Are So Tense](https://www.cfr.org/backgrounder/china-taiwan-relations-tension-us-policy-trump)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if, before July 1, 2025, the US government publicly accuses the People's Republic of China of invading Taiwan by sending its ground military forces into Taiwan without consent from the Taiwanese government in Taipei.\n\n\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nU.S. Indo-Pacific Commander Admiral Samuel Paparo stated in May 2025 that while the U.S. could currently defeat China in a Taiwan Strait conflict, China's military is expanding its capabilities rapidly.

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
