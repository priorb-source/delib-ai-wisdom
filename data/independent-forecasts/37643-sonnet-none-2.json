    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Approximately 7 weeks until July 1, 2025",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No - the objective remains marked as 'in progress' rather than 'complete'",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "The Public Service Loan Forgiveness program continues to operate through July 1, 2025, either because termination efforts face legal challenges, require more time for implementation, or stall politically. The Keep_Track moderators maintain the status as 'in progress' since the program has not been fully terminated.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "The Trump administration successfully terminates PSLF through executive action or expedited legislation before July 1. The termination is implemented or definitively announced such that the Keep_Track moderators determine it meets their criteria for marking the objective as 'complete' on the spreadsheet.",
    "rationale": "This forecast requires considering both political reality and the tracker's subjective standards. The key constraints are: (1) Only 7 weeks remain until the resolution date - an extremely short timeframe for major policy implementation; (2) The objective is currently 'in progress,' meaning the status quo is No resolution; (3) Terminating PSLF would likely require either Congressional action or administrative rulemaking, both of which typically take months and face legal challenges; (4) The Keep_Track moderators control what counts as 'complete' and may have high standards. While the 'in progress' status suggests some action has been taken toward this Project 2025 objective, completing the termination of a major federal program in 7 weeks faces significant procedural, legal, and political hurdles. Even if the administration announces termination, implementation delays or legal injunctions could prevent the tracker from marking it complete. My forecast is not lower because: the status is already 'in progress' suggesting momentum; administrative actions can sometimes move quickly; the tracker might mark it complete based on definitive policy announcements rather than full implementation. My forecast is not higher because: 7 weeks is extremely short for government action; legal challenges would likely create delays; no information suggests imminent completion; major program terminations typically take much longer than 7 weeks. I would update upward with news of signed executive orders, passed legislation, or official termination announcements. I would update downward with legal injunctions, Congressional opposition, or no progress reports.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill the Project 2025 Tracker spreadsheet have the objective of terminating the Public Service Loan Forgiveness program marked as complete before July 1, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nAt the time of this question, the objective was marked as \"in progress.\" The 2025 Tracker is a project of the Keep_Track subreddit and is explained [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/Keep_Track/comments/1ii7tbr/project_2025_tracker_is_now_live/).\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if the Project 2025 objective to \"terminate the Public Service Loan Forgiveness program\" is marked as complete according to [this spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1QGG6wNHna-1tt91yXNkOauAJJ7snobFjfEnmxlmzhl4/edit?gid=0#gid=0) before July 1, 2025. If it is anything other than complete (such as \"in progress\") when accessed by Metaculus on or after July 1, 2025, then the question resolves as **No**.\n\n\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nNo additional information available.\n\nToday is 2025-05-14.\n\nBefore answering you think:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n(e) You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
