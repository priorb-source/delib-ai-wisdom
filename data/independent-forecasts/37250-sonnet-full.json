  "information": "The U.S. Supreme Court unanimously ruled that Kilmar Abrego Garcia's deportation was unlawful and ordered the Trump administration to 'facilitate' his return. Subsequently, U.S. District Judge Paula Xinis ordered the administration to explain its diplomatic efforts with El Salvador regarding his return and set deadlines for the government to provide information and documents. An earlier court-ordered deadline for Garcia's return of April 7, 2025, passed without compliance.\n\nThe Trump administration has publicly resisted the court orders. President Trump stated the case is 'in the hands of lawyers' but also claimed he 'could' have Garcia returned with a single phone call but would not, citing alleged MS-13 gang affiliations. The Department of Homeland Security acknowledged the initial deportation was an 'administrative mistake'. Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem stated that if Garcia were to return to the U.S., he would be immediately deported again.\n\nKilmar Abrego Garcia was deported to El Salvador around March 15, 2025, and is being held in a maximum-security prison. The President of El Salvador, Nayib Bukele, has publicly labeled Garcia a 'terrorist' and has stated that he will not be released or returned to the United States. U.S. Senator Chris Van Hollen traveled to El Salvador to demand Garcia's release from prison, but reported that the U.S. embassy in El Salvador had not received instructions to assist in the matter.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "2 months (until July 1, 2025)",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No - Garcia remains in El Salvador and does not return to the United States",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Garcia remains imprisoned in El Salvador as President Bukele maintains his refusal to release him. The Trump administration continues resisting court orders, with diplomatic efforts remaining stalled. The July 1 deadline passes with Garcia still in custody in El Salvador.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Under mounting judicial pressure and potential contempt proceedings, the Trump administration intensifies diplomatic efforts. El Salvador's government, facing international pressure or some diplomatic incentive, releases Garcia and allows his return to U.S. territory before July 1, even if briefly before another deportation attempt.",
    "rationale": "The status quo strongly favors a No outcome. Three major barriers exist: (1) El Salvador's President Bukele has publicly labeled Garcia a 'terrorist' and explicitly stated he will not be released or returned - a very difficult position to reverse publicly; (2) The Trump administration is actively resisting compliance despite unanimous Supreme Court ruling, with Secretary Noem stating Garcia would be immediately deported again if returned; (3) The April 7 court-ordered deadline already passed without compliance, demonstrating the administration's willingness to defy judicial orders. The combination of active resistance from both governments, the short 2-month timeframe, and the already-missed deadline creates a very high bar for Garcia's return. While court orders theoretically carry enforcement mechanisms, contempt proceedings and diplomatic negotiations typically take longer than 2 months to compel action. The U.S. embassy in El Salvador reportedly hasn't even received instructions to assist. The only factors preventing a lower probability are: the unanimous Supreme Court ruling carries significant legal weight; Judge Xinis is actively monitoring compliance with deadlines; and technically 2 months provides enough time if both governments reversed course dramatically. However, such reversals would require both leaders to backtrack from very public positions, which is politically costly. For the probability to increase, I would need to see: active diplomatic negotiations, softening rhetoric from either government, concrete compliance steps from the administration, or new judicial enforcement actions. For it to decrease further: more explicit refusals, Garcia's legal status deteriorating in El Salvador, or complete breakdown of negotiations.",

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
