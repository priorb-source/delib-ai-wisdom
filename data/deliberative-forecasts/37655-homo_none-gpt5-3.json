    "review": "Both forecasters largely mirror my baseline: elections aren’t held or scheduled under martial law; the Rada would need to act; and only ~6 weeks remain. The most useful added nuance is the practice of setting dates roughly within the statutory pre‑election period (~90 days), which makes an early, long‑lead announcement less likely before July 1. Their tail scenarios (signaling to allies, ceasefire/legal pivot, conditional date) were already in my consideration set. No new concrete indicators were cited (e.g., draft bills or leadership statements), so these analyses mostly reinforce the status‑quo No. Their 10–12% feels a touch high absent fresh signals; the 90‑day‑window point, if anything, leans my estimate down, while the signaling‑tail keeps a small non‑zero chance.",
    "rationale": "Time is short, martial law persists, and international partners appear to accept postponement. Setting a specific date would require a visible Rada decision that is unlikely without an accompanying plan to lift/suspend martial law or a ceasefire—neither of which has credible momentum reported here. The added pre‑election‑window argument further reduces the odds that Kyiv would announce far in advance. The only plausible Yes path by July 1 is a political signaling move to name a fall 2025 date (possibly contingent on lifting martial law) or a sudden de‑escalation plus legislative push—both low‑probability on this horizon. Net: I keep a low estimate, nudging slightly to reflect a small signaling tail while acknowledging the 90‑day practice.",
