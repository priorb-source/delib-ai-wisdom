    "review": "Both forecasters emphasize two points I only partially articulated: (1) the effective lower bound near prior troughs makes further sizable downside less likely than a modest bounce, and (2) the preliminary May reading typically precedes the April CPI release, so real-time pump prices and market tone may dominate more than official data headlines. Their framing on status-quo anchoring versus mean reversion matches my view; the added emphasis on a binding floor and the timing nuance nudges me slightly more positive. I still see persistent inflation/gas headwinds keeping gains limited and preserving meaningful No risk, so I don’t go as high as 63%, but I find their arguments directionally convincing.",
    "rationale": "April’s 50.8 is extraordinarily low, historically associated with higher odds of at least a small rebound absent a fresh shock. Only a small uptick is needed to clear the threshold. The preliminary May release timing means it will be more sensitive to real-time prices and market sentiment than to the official April CPI print, slightly reducing the chance of a new negative data shock coinciding with the survey. Offsetting this, spring gasoline prices and sticky inflation narratives could keep sentiment flat-to-down, and a tie resolves as No. Netting these, I raise my odds modestly to reflect mean reversion and the timing consideration while still weighting ongoing headwinds. I update from 60% to 62%.",
