    "review": "Both forecasters largely mirror my base read: strong negative momentum, broad-based weakness, elevated inflation expectations, and tariff/policy uncertainty tilt toward another very weak print. The most useful additions were (1) emphasizing that ties at 50.8 resolve No and (2) that the preliminary reading alone is sufficient for resolution, which creates an asymmetry—any low preliminary that later revises up wouldn’t help. They also highlighted typical month-to-month sampling volatility (1–3 points), reinforcing that a small noise-driven uptick remains plausible. No new macro data were introduced beyond what I considered, but the resolution mechanics and tie-as-No point do nudge me slightly lower.",
    "rationale": "I continue to see the status quo as leaning No: inflation expectations at a multi-decade high, rising unemployment fears, tariff-related price pass-throughs, and recent market volatility are all likely to keep households cautious into the early-May survey window. Given four consecutive declines into a near-floor level, downside could be bounded, so a modest mean-reversion uptick cannot be dismissed. However, because resolution accepts the preliminary print and ties resolve No, the bar for a Yes requires a clean move above 50.8 on the preliminary—raising the hurdle. Balancing the persistent headwinds against floor effects and typical volatility, I’m trimming my probability slightly from my initial 46% to reflect the asymmetry in resolution mechanics while preserving a sizable chance of a small rebound.",
