    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "About 8 days (through May 20, 2025)",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No — the recall succeeds and Metz loses his seat.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "The recall campaign capitalizes on the high-salience allegation (shooting a teen in the face), turnout among motivated opponents is strong in a very small electorate, and a majority votes to remove him.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "The recall fails: enough voters accept Metz’s explanation (e.g., self-defense/mitigating context), are wary of the alternative/replacement process, or the opposition’s turnout effort underperforms, so a majority votes against the recall and he retains his seat.",
    "rationale": "- Base rates: Across U.S. local recalls that make the ballot, removal rates are typically around 60% (i.e., incumbents survive roughly 40%). That sets a starting point near 40% for survival.\n- Case-specific factors: The allegation—shooting a teen in the face—is unusually severe and likely to be salient in a tiny town electorate, which tends to push outcomes toward removal relative to the base rate. Media coverage from a major local outlet suggests broad awareness. These factors argue for a lower-than-base survival probability.\n- Countervailing factors: Very small electorates can be idiosyncratic; incumbents sometimes benefit from personal relationships and low, uneven turnout. If there’s plausible self-defense context or no charges filed, some voters may view the recall as overreach. Uncertainty in such a small race argues against extreme confidence.\n- Status quo weighting: Given the current trajectory (a recall driven by a serious incident and active opposition), the status quo expectation is removal; I weight that more heavily absent new information.\n- Why not higher? The severity/salience of the allegation and the mobilization implied by qualifying a recall in a small town make survival less likely than the ~40% base rate.\n- Why not lower? Small-town unpredictability, potential mitigating circumstances, and the possibility of a weak replacement option can depress pro-recall votes. Without concrete polling or formal charges, pushing below ~25–30% would be overconfident.\n- What would move me up: Clear reporting that prosecutors declined to charge or that credible evidence supports self-defense; endorsements from respected local figures; strong pro-Metz GOTV indicators; signs of disarray or unpopularity among replacement candidates.\n- What would move me down: Formal charges or new damning evidence; unified local elite calling for removal; unusually high early turnout driven by the recall proponents; polling (if any) showing majority support for recall.\n- Research assistant summary: No additional information was available beyond the headline context, so this forecast leans on base rates and generic small-town recall dynamics with scenario adjustments for the seriousness of the allegation.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill Mountain View, Colorado town councilor Brent Metz win his recall election on May 20, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\n[Town councilor accused of shooting teen in face addresses incident during recall election](https://www.9news.com/article/news/crime/mountain-view-council-member-accused-of-shooting-teen-addresses-incident/73-5800d282-842f-4fca-a358-ddcdca710eab)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if Brent Metz retains his seat as Mountain View, Colorado town councilor following the recall election currently scheduled for May 20, 2025\n\n\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nNo additional information available.\n\nToday is 2025-05-12.\n\nBefore answering you think:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n(e) You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
