    "review": "Both forecasters emphasize the short timeline, the extended TRO with a judge finding the claims “plausible,” and the drag imposed by parallel proceedings (federal case + BIA appeal). I find this persuasive and directionally consistent with my priors. One additional point I’d highlight, which strengthens their arguments, is that a timely BIA appeal typically prevents execution of an IJ’s removal order until the BIA rules, so deportation would require not just dissolving the TRO but also a rapid, likely expedited BIA decision. Neither forecaster leaned on that procedural bar explicitly. Their arguments about political pressure and an expedited path to Yes are reasonable, but still require a multi-step cascade under severe time pressure. Overall, their reasoning nudges me slightly lower than my initial estimate.",
    "rationale": "Key constraints: (1) A live TRO that a district judge just extended on First Amendment/APA plausibility grounds; (2) a pending BIA appeal that generally prevents execution of the IJ’s removal order until the BIA rules; (3) if the TRO were dissolved and the BIA affirmed quickly, Khalil could still seek emergency stays from the Third Circuit; and (4) potential logistical hurdles (travel documents/destination) further compress the window. A Yes outcome requires a fast PI denial and TRO dissolution, an unusually expedited BIA decision within weeks, denial of administrative/emergency stays by the Third Circuit, and immediate removal logistics. That cascade is possible but unlikely within ~7 weeks. Political will and a national-security framing do increase upside risk, so I won’t go near-zero, but the layered legal protections and timing make Yes a tail. I’m adjusting down modestly from 15% to reflect the BIA stay/finality point and practical timing/logistics.",
