  "information": "The 2026 Texas U.S. Senate election features incumbent Republican Senator John Cornyn seeking a fifth term. Cornyn faces a primary challenge from Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton, who has already announced his campaign. On the Democratic side, while O'Rourke is publicly considering a run, other figures like former Congressman Colin Allred have also been mentioned as potential candidates, though none had formally entered the race as of late May 2025.",

    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "About 6 weeks (until July 1, 2025).",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No. Beto O'Rourke has not announced his candidacy for the US Senate.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "The July 1, 2025 deadline passes without Beto O'Rourke making a formal announcement of his candidacy. He may either explicitly decline to run or simply let the date pass while he continues to weigh his options.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Before July 1, 2025, Beto O'Rourke holds a press event or releases an official statement or video formally declaring his candidacy for the 2026 US Senate election in Texas.",
    "rationale": "My forecast heavily weights the status quo, as launching a Senate campaign is a significant undertaking that requires overcoming substantial inertia. Beto O'Rourke is not currently a candidate. His recent history of three consecutive high-profile election losses (2018 Senate, 2020 Presidential, 2022 Governor) establishes a strong political headwind and a high personal risk for another attempt. While the research notes he is publicly considering a run and the Republican primary infighting between Cornyn and Paxton presents a strategic opportunity, his statements are non-committal, typical of a politician gauging support rather than signaling a firm decision. The July 1, 2025 deadline is extremely close, leaving a very short window to formally launch a campaign of this magnitude. My probability is not lower because O'Rourke possesses a formidable fundraising network and high name recognition, which would allow for a quicker launch than a typical candidate. The fractured Republican field also presents a rare and compelling reason for him to run. My probability is not higher because the political narrative of his past losses is a significant liability, other potential Democratic candidates like Colin Allred may enter the race, and the path of least resistance is to forgo another grueling campaign. My forecast would increase with credible reports of him hiring campaign staff or a key potential rival stepping aside. It would decrease if another strong Democrat announces their candidacy or as the deadline approaches with continued inaction from his camp.",
