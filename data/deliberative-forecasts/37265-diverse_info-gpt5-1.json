    "review": "Both forecasters emphasize advisory inertia and the short window, which aligns with my base case. The main new point is Forecaster 2’s reference to April 2025 jihadist activity in the Mozambique–Tanzania border area (Niassa/Cabo Delgado spillover). That adds a marginal near-term risk I did not explicitly weigh. Forecaster 3’s comparison to recent regional upgrades (e.g., Uganda/Burundi) supports that State is willing to act when triggers appear, preventing a very low forecast. I find their reasoning directionally sound, though I think 18–20% is a bit high given the need for a clear in-country catalyst and the tendency to keep nationwide Level 2 while handling hotspots (e.g., Mtwara) via localized Level 3s.",
    "rationale": "Status quo remains Level 2 with localized Level 3 in Mtwara and a March 2025 coastal alert—consistent with a No outcome absent a major incident. The key upside risk is a high-profile attack or credible plot in Dar es Salaam, Arusha, or Zanzibar, or rapid cross-border escalation affecting coastal/tourist hubs; such an event could prompt a swift Level 3. The newly highlighted April 2025 border incidents slightly raise the near-term hazard rate. However, State has tolerated similar background risk for years without nationwide escalation, and with only ~60 days left, the probability that both a qualifying event occurs and State updates the national level in time remains modest. I’m nudging up from 12% to reflect the recent activity but staying below peers due to advisory inertia and the pattern of managing risk through subnational cautions rather than countrywide upgrades unless/until a clear domestic catalyst occurs.",
