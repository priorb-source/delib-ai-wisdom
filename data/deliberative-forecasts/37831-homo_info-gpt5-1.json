    "review": "Both forecasters emphasize the short timeline, Mali’s authoritarian trajectory, reduced external leverage (ECOWAS exit/AES alignment), and low odds that courts move swiftly or that the junta would comply with an adverse ruling. I find their reasoning sound and consistent with my prior view. The new element I hadn’t explicitly incorporated is the detail about active legal challenges in multiple Bamako courts and at the Supreme Court’s administrative section. That creates a small additional path via an urgent administrative ruling (e.g., a suspension) that the junta could accept as a face‑saving, temporary reinstatement. They also underscored the resolution nuance—general reauthorization is required—which I agree raises the bar. Overall, their analyses marginally increase the plausibility of a tactical retreat but keep this firmly low-probability.",
    "rationale": "Time remaining (~40 days) and revealed preferences argue against a reversal. The dissolution followed legal groundwork (CNT repeal) and public framing about rationalizing 300+ parties and preserving stability, suggesting intent to entrench, not experiment. External coercion is weak in the near term: Mali’s distance from ECOWAS, closer ties to AES partners and Russia, and limited bite of AU/UN criticism reduce immediate pressure. Domestic protests appear modest so far, and the regime has shown willingness to repress. The one incremental upside channel is the judiciary: active challenges and the possibility of an urgent administrative order could provide a narrow, face‑saving off‑ramp where the junta temporarily re‑legalizes parties pending a new framework. That would satisfy the resolution if it generally reauthorizes party formation. However, the judiciary’s independence and the executive’s compliance are uncertain, and timelines are tight. Net effect: a slight uptick from my prior view, but still clearly single‑digit odds. Downside signals would include further crackdowns or legal entrenchment; upside would include credible reporting of imminent court action, sustained large protests/strikes, or a mediated roadmap explicitly restoring parties before July 1.",
