    "review": "The other forecasters provided two critical arguments that I had previously underweighted. First, both expanded the field of strong competitors beyond California, correctly identifying states with major aviation hubs like Illinois and Georgia, as well as other aerospace centers like Texas and Arizona/Nevada. This dilutes Florida's chances more than my initial analysis suggested. Second, Forecaster 3 provided a more rigorous emphasis on the resolution criteria that 'ties resolve as No.' Given the very low number of pilot reports expected per month (often just 0, 1, or 2 for a top state), the probability of a tie is statistically significant and 'materially depresses the chance of a Yes.' This was a key insight I had not sufficiently incorporated into my probability.",
    "rationale": "I am lowering my forecast from 25% to 17%. My initial reasoning overemphasized qualitative factors, such as Florida's unique military airspace, and failed to adequately account for the statistical realities of the question. The other forecasters' arguments were highly convincing. The combination of a wider field of strong competing states and the significant handicap imposed by the 'ties resolve as No' rule makes a unique Florida victory less likely than I first assessed. The low-count nature of these specific reports means that a scenario where Florida ties with one or more other states at just one or two sightings is very plausible, and this would result in a 'No' resolution. My updated forecast of 17% still recognizes Florida as a top-tier contender, far above the base rate for an average state, but properly discounts its chances to reflect these considerable hurdles.",
