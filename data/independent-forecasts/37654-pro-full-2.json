  "information": "As of May 15, 2025, the Project 2025 Tracker spreadsheet listed the objective to 'Break up the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration' as 'In progress'. The moderators of the tracker have previously indicated that an item is moved to 'Complete' status only when a formal action, such as a signed executive order or an enacted statute, achieves the specific recommendation. For other large-scale restructurings, the tracker's status was changed to 'Complete' only after such a formal action was taken. From January through mid-May 2025, 5 of 41 objectives marked as 'In progress' on the tracker were updated to 'Complete'.\n\nOn May 8, 2025, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) announced it would no longer be updating its Billion Dollar Weather and Climate Disasters database. The official reason cited was 'in alignment with evolving priorities, statutory mandates, and staffing changes'. The database, active since 1980, had logged 403 events with an estimated cost exceeding $2.9 trillion. The discontinuation has been attributed to agency restructuring, budget cuts, and staff departures, including the lead scientist for the program. The administration also proposed a 25% reduction in NOAA's budget for fiscal year 2026.\n\nBreaking up a federal agency typically requires either legislation passed by Congress or an executive reorganization plan. Historically, similar executive reorganizations have taken between two and six months to progress from concept to a signed executive order, following legal and administrative vetting. For a legislative approach, while the House of Representatives could pass relevant language in an appropriations bill in June, Senate action would likely not occur until mid-July at the earliest. Past large-scale government reorganizations, such as the creation of the Department of Homeland Security, have been complex processes that take longer than a month and a half to formalize.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Approximately 1.5 months. The question resolves on July 1, 2025, and today is May 15, 2025.",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No. The objective's status is currently 'in progress'. If it remains unchanged, the question will resolve as No.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "The administration continues to weaken the agency through budget proposals and personnel changes, but a formal, legally binding instrument like a presidential executive order or an enacted statute to 'break up' NOAA is not finalized and signed before July 1, 2025. Following their established criteria, the spreadsheet moderators leave the objective marked as 'in progress'.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "The administration fast-tracks an executive reorganization plan, culminating in the signing of an executive order that officially dismantles NOAA or reassigns its primary functions to other federal departments before the July 1, 2025 deadline. The moderators of the Project 2025 Tracker then update the spreadsheet to mark the objective as 'complete'.",
    "rationale": "My forecast is based on the high bar for resolution and the very short timeline. The primary factor driving my low probability estimate is the time constraint. There are only about six weeks until the deadline. According to the research, a formal break-up of a federal agency requires either an act of Congress or an executive reorganization plan, typically taking the form of an executive order. The legislative path is too slow, with Senate action unlikely before mid-July. The executive action path, while faster, historically takes a minimum of two to six months to move from concept to a signed order due to the necessary legal and administrative reviews. The current timeline of 1.5 months is shorter than the typical minimum. The criteria for the question to resolve as 'Yes' are strict: the spreadsheet must be updated to 'complete', which the tracker's moderators only do upon a formal action like a signed executive order or an enacted statute. Actions taken so far, such as discontinuing the Billion Dollar Disasters database and proposing budget cuts, are significant steps toward the goal but do not meet this specific, final threshold. While these actions demonstrate clear intent and make the probability non-zero, they are insufficient for a 'complete' status. The base rate of change on the tracker is also low; only 5 of 41 'in progress' objectives have been completed in the first 4.5 months of the year, and breaking up an entire agency is likely a more complex task than most. My forecast is not lower than 15% because the administration has shown this is a priority, and there is a small but real chance they could rush a legally-sufficient executive order to score a political win. My forecast is not higher because the bureaucratic and legal realities of a major government reorganization make such a rapid timeline highly improbable. I would increase my forecast upon news of a finalized draft of an executive order or public statements indicating an imminent signing. I would decrease it if administration officials signal a longer timeline for this specific objective.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill the Project 2025 Tracker spreadsheet have the objective of breaking up NOAA marked as complete before July 1, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nAt the time of this question, the objective was marked as \"in progress.\" The 2025 Tracker is a project of the Keep_Track subreddit and is explained [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/Keep_Track/comments/1ii7tbr/project_2025_tracker_is_now_live/).\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if the Project 2025 objective to \"break up the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration\" is marked as complete according to [this spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1QGG6wNHna-1tt91yXNkOauAJJ7snobFjfEnmxlmzhl4/edit?gid=0#gid=0) before July 1, 2025.

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower.
