  "information": "Saipan has become a popular destination for Korean tourists, who constituted 70% of the island's visitors in 2024. The Governor of Saipan, Arnold Palacios, has identified the Korean tourist market as a primary focus for growth and sustainability. In line with this, the Mariana Visitors Authority launched a marketing campaign titled 'This is the Marianas' for the Korean market. The 2025 Saipan Marathon attracted over 200 Korean participants out of 612 runners from 19 countries. Additionally, KB Kookmin Card initiated a promotional event for its Visa cardholders traveling to destinations including Saipan, offering discounts on flights, hotels, dining, and shopping starting from July 18.\n\nThe weakness of the Japanese yen poses a challenge to tourism in the Northern Mariana Islands (NMI), as Japanese travelers tend to prefer non-U.S. dollar destinations. Japanese visitor numbers to the CNMI were 7,762 in 2023 and 13,779 in 2024, with the increase largely due to cruise ship arrivals. In response, United Airlines has launched a digital advertising campaign for its Narita-Saipan route, and the Marianas Visitors Authority has partnered with Japanese travel agencies. The islands also received diving awards at the 'Marine Diving Fair 2025' in Tokyo, highlighting their appeal. Separately, Hong Kong Airlines lists Saipan as one of its destinations, and travel platform Expedia noted a significant increase in search volume for Saipan from Hong Kong travelers.\n\nAs of mid-May 2025, flight tracking websites indicate that Saipan International Airport (SPN) has three to four non-stop flight destinations. These are Guam (GUM), served by United Airlines; Seoul-Incheon (ICN), served by Jeju Air, T’way Air, and Jin Air; Busan (PUS), served by Jeju Air; and an intermittently listed service to Tokyo-Narita (NRT), operated by United Airlines. A report by the Mastercard Economics Institute notes a general surge in travel within the Asia-Pacific region. Saipan's tourism appeal is supported by sightseeing opportunities related to its history, nature, and culture, including tours of WWII battlefields and natural sites like Managaha Island and The Grotto.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Approximately 6 weeks until July 1, 2025",
    "status_quo_outcome": "NO - Current tracking shows 3-4 direct flight destinations",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Saipan maintains its current direct flight network of 3-4 destinations (Guam, Seoul-Incheon, Busan, and possibly Tokyo-Narita if operating intermittently). No new routes are launched in the next 6 weeks, which is typical given that new international routes usually require months of planning, regulatory approval, and advance booking periods.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "One or more new direct flight destinations are added by July 1st. Most likely candidates would be Hong Kong (if Hong Kong Airlines service becomes active/scheduled), an additional Korean city given the strong 70% Korean tourist market share, or restoration of more reliable Tokyo-Narita service. Alternatively, existing 'intermittent' services become regularly scheduled, pushing the count above 4.",
    "rationale": "The status quo strongly favors a NO outcome, as current mid-May 2025 data shows only 3-4 direct destinations. The threshold requires >4 destinations, meaning at least 5. To achieve a YES outcome, Saipan would need to add 1-2 new destinations within approximately 6 weeks - a challenging timeline given that international route launches typically require months of planning. Key evidence from the research: (1) Three confirmed destinations: Guam, Seoul-Incheon, and Busan; (2) Tokyo-Narita service is 'intermittently listed,' suggesting it may not consistently count; (3) Hong Kong Airlines lists Saipan as a destination, but active service status is unclear; (4) Strong Korean tourism (70% of visitors) supports existing Korean routes but no announcements of imminent expansion. Positive factors include the Asia-Pacific travel surge and aggressive Korean market targeting, but these are long-term trends unlikely to manifest as new routes within 6 weeks. The weak Japanese yen actually works against adding Japanese destinations. I'm not lower (15-20%) because there's uncertainty about Hong Kong service status and the possibility that scheduled routes aren't yet visible in May tracking data. I'm not higher (40-50%) because the status quo is clearly below threshold and the timeframe is too short for typical route launches. I would update higher if: announcements of new routes scheduled for June/July emerge, or if Hong Kong service is confirmed as active. I would update lower if: Tokyo-Narita service is confirmed discontinued, or if no route expansion signals appear by early June.",
