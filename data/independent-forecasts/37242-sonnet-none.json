    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Approximately 1 to 1.5 months. The April 2025 data is expected to be published in early June 2025.",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No - arrivals would not fall. The status quo outcome is that April 2025 passenger arrivals would be equal to or greater than April 2024 arrivals, continuing the positive growth trend observed in recent data.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Tourism to the Canary Islands maintains its growth trajectory. The February 2025 data already showed an increase over February 2024 (2,248,198 vs 2,199,255). European tourism, which dominates Canary Islands visitors, remains strong. Easter 2025 (April 20) falls during April, potentially capturing more Easter holiday travel than Easter 2024 (March 31) which straddled March-April. Economic conditions in key European markets remain stable, and any Trump policy concerns have minimal practical impact since US tourists represent a small fraction of Canary Islands visitors.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Global or European economic uncertainty dampens travel demand in spring 2025. Trump's tariff policies create broader economic ripple effects that reduce discretionary travel spending among European tourists. Weather conditions in April 2025 are unfavorable compared to April 2024. Geopolitical events or health concerns emerge that impact travel. Competition from alternative destinations intensifies. The Easter holiday timing doesn't provide the expected boost, or adverse events specifically affect the Canary Islands tourism sector.",
    "rationale": "The primary evidence available is the February 2025 data showing growth over February 2024, suggesting ongoing positive momentum in Canary Islands tourism. The concern about Trump's policies mentioned in the article is likely overstated for this specific destination, as the Canary Islands primarily attract European tourists (particularly from the UK, Germany, and mainland Spain), with US visitors comprising a small minority. The Easter timing factor is significant: Easter 2025 falls on April 20, placing the entire holiday period within April, while Easter 2024 was March 31, likely splitting holiday travel across months. This calendar advantage should favor April 2025. Additionally, tourism numbers historically tend to show gradual growth year-over-year absent major disruptions, supporting the status quo of stable or increasing arrivals. The lack of evidence for major disruptions or adverse conditions strengthens the case for continued growth. My forecast is not lower (closer to 50%) because the fundamental drivers support growth and there's no concrete evidence of problems. It's not higher (closer to 0%) because we lack complete data for April 2025, economic conditions can shift, and unexpected events could have occurred. To revise upward (higher probability of decline), I would need evidence of European economic weakness, major disruptions to Canary Islands tourism infrastructure, or confirmation of weak bookings. To revise downward, I would need additional positive tourism indicators or confirmation of strong travel demand in Q2 2025.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill inbound airline passenger arrivals to the Canary Islands fall in April 2025 compared with April 2024?\n\nQuestion background:\n[Canarias braces for the consequences of Trump's policies on tourism, potentially leading to a decline in tourist arrivals from the US](https://diariodeavisos.elespanol.com/2025/04/turismo-aranceles/)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if the total number of passenger arrivals to the Canary Islands for the month of April 2025, as presented at the [Canary Islands Tourism Research site](https://investigacion.turismodeislascanarias.com/en/inbound-tourism-arrival-passengers/monthly-data), is lower than the total number for April 2024. If the number for April 2025 is greater than or equal to the number for April 2024, the question resolves as **No**.\n\nSpecifically, Metaculus will access \"Passenger arrivals (AENA). April 2025,\" which is expected to be posted in the beginning of June 2025. The numbers considered will be the monthly totals under Canary Islands. For example, in the [February 2025 report](https://investigacion.turismodeislascanarias.com/sites/default/files/2025-03/Promotur_AENA_febrero%202025_EN.pdf), the number shown for February 2025 is 2,248,198 and the number shown for February 2024 is 2,199,255. Thus, if the question had been comparing February 2025 with February 2024, it would have resolved as No, because the number went up.\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nNo additional information available.\n\nToday is 2025-04-30.\n\nBefore answering you think:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n(e) You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
