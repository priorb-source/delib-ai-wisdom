  "information": "According to reports from May 2025, Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum has achieved a 76% approval rating, making her the best-evaluated president since the 1994-2000 term. In specific areas, 63.4% of respondents positively evaluated her management of poverty reduction, and her administration's policies have been linked to a 24.9% reduction in homicides. However, on transparency and anti-corruption, 57.4% of respondents had a negative perception. Her administration has announced a $298 billion investment plan. Some polls cited her approval rating as high as 82%.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Approximately 6 weeks.",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No. Based on the most recent polling data provided, Claudia Sheinbaum's approval rating (76%) is significantly higher than Javier Milei's last known rating (61%), and this gap is highly unlikely to reverse in the short term.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Claudia Sheinbaum's approval rating remains high, buoyed by the honeymoon period of her presidency, popular social programs, and perceived improvements in security. Meanwhile, Javier Milei's approval rating stagnates or declines as his austerity measures continue to cause economic hardship for many Argentinians, preventing him from closing the significant polling gap by the resolution date.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "A major political scandal erupts in Mexico, directly implicating Sheinbaum and causing a rapid drop in her public approval. Concurrently, Argentina sees a surprisingly quick economic turnaround under Milei, with inflation dropping dramatically and signs of growth emerging, leading to a surge in his popularity that allows him to surpass Sheinbaum's diminished rating.",
    "rationale": "My forecast is based primarily on the substantial and recently established lead in approval ratings held by Claudia Sheinbaum. The research assistant's report indicates her approval is at 76%, putting her far ahead of Javier Milei's last known rating of 61%. With only about six weeks until the resolution date, public opinion inertia makes it highly improbable for such a large gap to be closed and reversed.\n\nSheinbaum's high approval appears well-supported by tangible achievements cited in the report, such as reductions in poverty and homicides, which tend to create durable public support. Her announced investment plan is also likely to sustain positive sentiment. While her negative perception on anti-corruption is a vulnerability, it is not currently sufficient to overcome the positive drivers of her popularity.\n\nConversely, Javier Milei's radical economic reforms typically cause short-term public pain and approval rating volatility. For his rating to surpass Sheinbaum's high benchmark of 76%+, Argentina would need to experience an undeniable and rapid economic 'miracle' within the next six weeks, a highly improbable event.\n\nMy probability is not lower than 3% to account for low-probability, high-impact 'black swan' events, such as a sudden, severe scandal in Mexico. My probability is not higher because the current data presents a very clear picture, and a reversal would require two simultaneous and significant shifts in public opinion in two different countries, moving in opposite directions, within a very short timeframe. I would reconsider my forecast if new polling showed a sharp decline in Sheinbaum's approval alongside a significant surge in Milei's.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill Javier Milei have a higher approval rating than Claudia Sheinbaum on June 28, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nAt the time of this question, Sheinbaum is at 60% as compared with Milei at 61%.\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if Javier Milei has a higher approval rating than Claudia Sheinbaum at [Morning Consult](https://pro.morningconsult.com/trackers/global-leader-approval) when checked by Metaculus on or after June 28, 2025. A tie or a lead by Sheinbaum resolves the question as **No**.\n\n\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nAccording to reports from May 2025, Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum has achieved a 76% approval rating, making her the best-evaluated president since the 1994-2000 term.

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
