  "information": "The escape from the Orleans Justice Center on May 16, 2025, involved ten inmates and went undetected for seven hours. The inmates created a hole in a wall behind a toilet, climbed out through a maintenance area, and used a mattress to get over a barbed-wire fence. An investigation revealed significant security flaws, including chronic understaffing, with the prison at only 60% of required staffing at the time. A federal monitor's report had previously warned of a deteriorated security situation, citing inmates' ability to manipulate cell locks. At least three jail employees have been arrested in connection with the escape, which the Orleans Parish Sheriff believes was an 'inside job' aided by staff.\n\nA multi-agency manhunt is underway, involving over 200 officers from local, state, and federal bodies, including the FBI, U.S. Marshals, and the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives (ATF). The reward for information leading to the capture of the two remaining fugitives has been increased to $50,000 per person, with funds contributed by Crimestoppers, the FBI, and the ATF. As of late May 2025, law enforcement had received nearly 700 tips from the public. In connection with the escape and subsequent aid to the fugitives, at least 14 accomplices have been arrested, including family members of one of the escapees.\n\nAs of May 30, 2025, eight of the ten escapees have been recaptured. Some captures occurred out of state, including two inmates who were apprehended in Walker County, Texas, after a high-speed chase. The two fugitives still at large are Antoine Massey, 33, and Derrick Groves, 27, who are both considered armed and dangerous. Groves is a convicted murderer awaiting sentencing for a double homicide. Massey is described as a 'serial escapee' with three prior escapes from custody and was also being sought for kidnapping and rape. A former federal warden noted that Massey's housing in a first-floor cell was a significant security risk.",

    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "About 32 days (until 2025-07-01)",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No — as of May 30, two fugitives (Massey and Groves) remain at large; if nothing changes, at least one will still be free on July 1.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "One or both fugitives avoid detection through June by moving between safe houses, limiting communications, and potentially leaving Louisiana. Despite tips, no verified location leads to a successful interdiction before July 1, so at least one remains at large.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "A credible tip driven by the $50k rewards or electronic/forensic leads puts one or both fugitives in law enforcement’s sights; US Marshals/FBI coordinate arrests in June, or a confrontation results in a fatality. By July 1, both Massey and Groves are either in custody or confirmed dead.",
    "rationale": "What I’m weighing: (1) Current status: 8 of 10 already recaptured within two weeks; two remain (Massey, a serial escapee; Groves, a convicted murderer awaiting sentencing). These two are plausibly the hardest to catch. (2) Resources: a large, multi-agency manhunt (>200 officers; FBI/USMS/ATF), nearly 700 tips, and $50k rewards per fugitive. At least 14 accomplices have been arrested, shrinking support networks. (3) Time: ~1 month remains. In many high-profile U.S. jailbreaks, most fugitives are recaptured within weeks, but the last holdouts sometimes persist for months. The hazard of capture is highest early and can decline as fugitives settle. Countervailing this, intense federal involvement and big rewards can sustain capture rates. \nPutting extra weight on the status quo: right now, “not all 10 in custody” is the status quo, and the remaining two likely have better tradecraft/assistance than those already caught. That lowers the chance that both are accounted for by July 1. Still, the scale of the manhunt, prior momentum (8/10 already), and sizable rewards keep the probability meaningfully above a long-tail, low number. \nWhy not higher: the two remaining are the most capable/connected; one is a serial escapee who’s avoided capture for two weeks; manhunts often get the easy captures first. Even if each has, say, a 60–70% chance of being caught in June, getting both by July 1 compounds to roughly 36–49%. \nWhy not lower: federal resources, aggressive arrests of accomplices, and large rewards materially increase capture odds in the next month; lethal encounters also count toward a Yes. \nUpdate signals upward: confirmed sightings, arrests of close facilitators (family/primary associates), increased reward/publicity, evidence they remain local, or recovery of their phones/vehicles. \nUpdate signals downward: credible reporting they’ve moved far out of state/underground with strong support, indications of manhunt scaling down, or a sustained drought of actionable leads.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill all 10 inmates who escaped from jail in New Orleans on May 16, 2025 be recaptured before July 1, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\n[Manhunt continues Monday for 7 Orleans jail escapees as state launches investigation](https://www.fox8live.com/2025/05/19/manhunt-continues-monday-7-orleans-jail-escapees-state-launches-investigation/)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if before July 1, 2025, all 10 inmates who escaped from jail in the [2025 New Orleans jailbreak](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2025_New_Orleans_jailbreak) have been either recaptured or killed, according to [credible sources](https://www.metaculus.com/faq/#definitions).

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
