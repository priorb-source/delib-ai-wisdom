  "information": "Several of the candidates named in the question have officially announced their intention to run in the 2025 presidential election. Jean-Louis Billon, a member of the PDCI-RDA party, announced his candidacy in late May 2025, positioning himself as an alternative within his party following the disqualification of its leader, Tidjane Thiam. Simone Gbagbo, former first lady, has also announced her candidacy under the banner of her party, the Movement of Capable Generations (MGC). Pascal Affi N'Guessan is also presented as a candidate for the FPI party.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Approximately 1 month (until July 1, 2025)",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No - none of the five named candidates are currently disqualified",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "All five candidates continue their campaigns without legal challenges. The electoral commission does not take action against any of them, and they all remain eligible to run through July 1, 2025.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "One or more of the named candidates faces disqualification before July 1, 2025, similar to what recently happened to Tidjane Thiam. This could occur through legal challenges, electoral commission rulings, or administrative decisions based on eligibility requirements or past convictions.",
    "rationale": "The status quo currently favors a 'No' outcome since none of the five candidates appear to be disqualified at present. However, several factors create meaningful uncertainty. First, there is very recent precedent: Tidjane Thiam was just disqualified from the electoral list, demonstrating that authorities are actively reviewing and removing opposition candidates. This signals a contentious political environment where disqualifications are not merely theoretical. Second, some of these candidates have controversial political histories that could provide grounds for disqualification. Laurent Gbagbo and Simone Gbagbo, in particular, have faced legal issues related to their time in power. Third, the research assistant confirms that Billon, Simone Gbagbo, and Affi N'Guessan have already announced their candidacies and appear to be proceeding, suggesting they haven't faced immediate obstacles. However, the short one-month timeframe limits the window for new disqualifications to emerge. Electoral processes typically take time, and most candidates who will be disqualified would likely already be facing challenges. The lack of specific reports about pending disqualifications for these five candidates is noteworthy. For my forecast to move higher, I would need evidence of: active legal challenges against any of these candidates, statements from electoral authorities questioning their eligibility, or reports of document reviews that could lead to disqualifications. For my forecast to move lower, I would need: explicit confirmations of their eligibility, successful completion of registration processes, or the passage of time closer to July 1 without any challenges emerging. Given the recent precedent, the controversial nature of some candidates, but balanced against the short timeframe and lack of specific threats, I estimate a 30% probability.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill any of these candidates be disqualified from running in the 2025 Ivorian presidential election before July 1, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nBBC: [Main opposition leader removed from Ivory Coast electoral list](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c0l0j849143o)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if before July 1, 2025, according to [credible sources](https://www.metaculus.com/faq/#definitions) any of these candidates has been removed from the electoral list or otherwise become legally ineligible to run in the [2025 presidential election](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2025_Ivorian_presidential_election) of the Ivory Coast (Côte d'Ivoire) under the laws of the country: Gnangbo Kacou, Laurent Gbagbo, Pascal Affi N'Guessan, Jean-Louis Billon, or Simone Gbagbo.\n\n\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nSeveral of the candidates named in the question have officially announced their intention to run in the 2025 presidential election.

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
