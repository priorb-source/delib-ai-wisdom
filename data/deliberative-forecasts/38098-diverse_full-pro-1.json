    "review": "The other two forecasters and I are in strong agreement, arriving at nearly identical low-probability forecasts based on the same core evidence. We all correctly identified the key factors: the very short timeline (one month), Ralph Norman's explicit denials of a Senate run, his reported focus on the 2026 governor's race, the complete lack of any campaign groundwork (FEC filings, staff, etc.), and the strength of the incumbent, Lindsey Graham. Forecaster 3 made a particularly useful point that I hadn't explicitly articulated: the official filing deadline for the 2026 primary is still far off, which removes any procedural pressure for Norman to make a decision in the next 32 days. This argument further strengthens the case for a 'No' resolution.",
    "rationale": "After reviewing the other analyses, I am more confident in my initial assessment. The consensus among the forecasters validates the core reasoning. No new evidence or compelling argument was presented that would suggest a higher likelihood of Norman declaring his candidacy. In fact, the point raised by Forecaster 3 regarding the distant filing deadline reinforces my belief that an announcement before July 1, 2025, is extremely improbable, as there is no tactical urgency for him to do so. The other forecasters' slightly higher probability of 3% versus my 2% represents a negligible difference in quantifying a tail risk event. I believe my 2% forecast accurately reflects the overwhelming evidence pointing to 'No', while still accounting for the slim possibility of a sudden, unexpected political development that is not foreshadowed by any current activity. Therefore, I will not be changing my forecast.",
