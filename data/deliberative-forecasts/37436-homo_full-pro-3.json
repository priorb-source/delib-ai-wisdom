    "review": "The other two forecasters based their analyses on the same three core factors I identified: the small number of additional fatalities needed (five), the established casualty rate among UN staff, and the recent report that Israel's security cabinet approved an intensification of military operations. We are in complete agreement on the primary drivers of the forecast. The only divergence is in the final probability, which reflects differing assessments of the likelihood of an unexpected, durable ceasefire. Forecaster 2 (98%) is slightly more confident, leaving a very small window for a 'No' outcome. Forecaster 3 (90%) is more cautious, assigning a 10% probability to a sudden political development leading to de-escalation. I find Forecaster 3's 10% probability for a lasting ceasefire to be too high given the stated intent to escalate and the history of previous ceasefires failing. Conversely, Forecaster 2's 2% chance for a 'No' outcome might be slightly too low, as it discounts the possibility of various unforeseen scenarios, not just a ceasefire. My position remains between these two.",
    "rationale": "After reviewing the other expert analyses, I am maintaining my forecast of 95%. The deliberation process reinforced my initial reasoning, as all three of us independently identified the same critical variables. The other forecasters' quantitative framing of the casualty rate—calculating that at the recent rate of 15 deaths in 42 days, the threshold of five more deaths would be met in approximately two weeks—strengthens the case for a 'Yes' resolution. This timeframe is very short relative to the nearly two months remaining until the resolution date. The planned military escalation further increases the already high risk to UN personnel. My forecast did not change because the other analyses did not introduce new evidence, but rather confirmed my own assessment. My probability of 95% remains a well-calibrated estimate that balances the overwhelming evidence pointing to a 'Yes' outcome with the small but non-zero chance of an unforeseen event, such as a sudden and lasting ceasefire or a significant change in operational dynamics, preventing five more UN staff fatalities from being reported by the deadline.",
