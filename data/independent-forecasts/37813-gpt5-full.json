  "information": "According to multiple news outlets, U.S. government bodies have documented 757 cases of Unidentified Aerial Phenomena (UAP) between May 2023 and June 2024. Of this total, 708 occurred in airspace, and only 49 cases had been officially closed as of early 2025. The Department of Defense's All-Domain Anomaly Resolution Office (AARO) is the primary body for receiving these reports. The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) also investigates UAP sightings, especially those confirmed by radar, and shares its findings with the Department of Defense.\n\nA specific incident in January 2023 involved a U.S. Air Force F-16 Viper fighter jet colliding with an unidentified object during a training mission over Arizona, causing damage to the aircraft's canopy. The object was described as an 'orange-white uncrewed aerial system' (UAS). This is one of numerous encounters reported by military pilots in the region, establishing Arizona as a hotspot for UAP sightings, particularly near military training areas and the border with Mexico. Former government intelligence officer Luis Elizondo confirmed that there has been significant reported activity in the area.\n\nSome U.S. officials speculate that a portion of the UAP sightings, especially in the Southwest, could be attributable to advanced drone technology used by drug cartels for espionage or smuggling. Ron Vitiello, an advisor to U.S. Customs and Border Protection, noted that the 'unlimited funding' of cartels could enable them to deploy technologies previously unseen in the drone sector. This theory has been presented as a potential explanation for some of the unidentified objects observed in restricted military airspace.",

    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "About 6 weeks (roughly 41 days) until Metaculus can check on or after July 1, 2025.",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "NUFORC receives its usual mix of reports in June 2025, but none are categorized with the specific shape tag “Cube” (reports may be tagged as Square/Rectangle/Other instead, or simply lack a shape). When checked on/after July 1, 2025, the June index shows zero Cube entries.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "At least one June 2025 report is posted by NUFORC with the shape explicitly listed as “Cube,” visible on the June 2025 event index page when checked on/after July 1, 2025.",
    "rationale": "Frame and base rate: NUFORC’s shape taxonomy includes many categories, with “Cube” historically uncommon relative to shapes like Light, Sphere, Triangle, or Fireball. The prompt itself notes cube-shaped reports are rare historically, though December 2024 had an unusually high six cube entries, showing that clusters can occur.\n\nWhat matters is the probability that at least one report in June 2025 is tagged “Cube.” A simple way to think about this is a Poisson-like process with a small mean count of cube reports per month. If the long-run mean were well below 1/month, the chance of ≥1 in a given month would be under ~37%. December 2024’s six suggests the mean isn’t negligible and may have risen recently (or that there is substantial month-to-month variance). Summer months typically see higher overall reporting volume (more time outdoors, clearer skies), which nudges the probability upward for June.\n\nStatus quo weighting: Historically, many months likely have zero cube reports, so the default/median outcome is No. However, higher summer volumes and recent clusters argue for a materially non-trivial chance.\n\nEvidence from RA: The RA notes elevated UAP attention and many UAP cases across U.S. agencies. While that indicates a high underlying rate of reported anomalies, it’s only weakly informative for the specific NUFORC shape “Cube.” Still, more overall reports can slightly increase the tail probability of at least one cube-tagged entry.\n\nWhy not higher: “Cube” is a narrow label; near-miss labels (Square, Rectangle, Box, Other) would not count. Even with more reports in summer, the base rate for the cube label appears low, and months with zero cubes are common.\n\nWhy not lower: NUFORC often logs hundreds of reports per month. With higher June volume and occasional spikes (e.g., Dec 2024), the chance of at least one cube-tagged report is meaningfully above a very low number. Increased UAP attention may also bias some witnesses toward “Cube.”\n\nUpdates I’d watch to move this:\n- Upward: Early June NUFORC postings already showing cube entries; social/media memes or local clusters mentioning cube/cube-in-sphere; evidence that 2025-to-date has had several cube tags.\n- Downward: Evidence that 2025-to-date has had zero/near-zero cube tags; NUFORC changing taxonomy away from “Cube”; notable posting delays pushing June entries beyond the typical check window or a large share of shapes recorded as Other rather than Cube.\n",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill the National UFO Reporting Center report a sighting of a cube-shaped UFO in June 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nAccording to the [National UFO Reporting Center](https://nuforc.org/about-us/): \"The National UFO Reporting Center was founded in 1974 by noted UFO investigator Robert J. Gribble. The Center’s primary function over the past five decades has been to receive, record, and to the greatest degree possible, corroborate and document reports from individuals who have been witness to unusual, possibly UFO-related events. Throughout its history, the Center has processed over 180,000 reports, and has distributed its information to thousands of individuals.\"\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if The National UFO Reporting Center posts a report of a sighting of a UFO/UAP shaped like a cube in June 2025 at [this link](https://nuforc.org/ndx/?id=event) when accessed by Metaculus on or after July 1, 2025.\n\nFor example, although rare in the history of NUFORC, the month of December 2024 [had](https://nuforc.org/subndx/?id=e202412) six sightings with a cube shape.\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nAccording to multiple news outlets, U.S. government bodies have documented 757 cases of Unidentified Aerial Phenomena (UAP) between May 2023 and June 2024.

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
