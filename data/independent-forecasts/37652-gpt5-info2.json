  "information": "The relationship with the United States under President Donald Trump was a central theme of the recent Canadian election. Trump had made public remarks about absorbing Canada into the U.S. and imposed tariffs on Canadian goods. In response, Prime Minister Carney stated his government would 'relentlessly' protect Canadian sovereignty and work to define a new economic and security relationship with Washington. After the election, Carney met with Trump but did not secure a removal of the U.S. tariffs. Carney has stated he will maintain Canadian tariffs on U.S. products as long as American tariffs remain in place. The new Canadian cabinet has been explicitly tasked with focusing on Canada-U.S. relations and resolving trade disputes.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "~46 days (until July 1, 2025)",
    "status_quo_outcome": "Leaning Yes — base rates and likely honeymoon effects suggest Carney > Trump at present and over the next ~6 weeks.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Trump’s approval stabilizes or ticks up into the mid-to-high 40s on improving U.S. economic/news cycle while Carney’s early-term approval slides into the low 40s amid domestic stumbles (e.g., economic softness, scandal, missteps on tariffs) or the displayed Morning Consult figures round to the same whole number, creating a tie (which resolves No).",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Carney’s honeymoon persists with approval around the high 40s to low 50s, buoyed by a perceived firm stance on U.S. tariffs and sovereignty, while Trump remains in his typical low-to-mid 40s range (or dips on controversy), yielding a clear multi-point gap in Carney’s favor on the July 1 reading.",
    "rationale": "Framing: Morning Consult’s global tracker reports 7-day trailing averages by country and displays whole-number approval figures. The question resolves Yes only if Carney’s displayed approval exceeds Trump’s on or after July 1; a tie or missing data resolves No. With ~6 weeks left, large swings are less likely, so I weight the status quo heavily.\n\nBase rates and leader-specific considerations:\n- U.S. President Trump: Historically polarizing, with Morning Consult-type approval often in the low-to-mid 40s. Even with an early-term boost, his ceiling tends to be constrained; sustained readings above ~47–48% are uncommon without major, broadly popular wins.\n- Canada’s PM (Carney): Newly elected leaders often enjoy a honeymoon window during their first 100–200 days. Canada’s recent leaders frequently start near or above 50% before regressing. Carney’s technocratic profile and early focus on sovereignty/trade could sustain broad, if soft, support into early summer.\n\nContext from the research assistant: Carney has prioritized managing U.S. relations amid tariffs and emphasized protecting sovereignty. This stance can be domestically popular in Canada, potentially reinforcing approval in the near term. The lack of immediate tariff relief could otherwise erode support, but rally-around dynamics and a short horizon temper that risk.\n\nWhy not higher than ~70?:\n- Rounding/tie risk: Morning Consult displays whole numbers; a 1–2 point underlying edge could still round to a tie, which resolves No.\n- Volatility risk in Canada’s smaller samples and the short window for idiosyncratic events (e.g., economic news, scandals, wildfires/healthcare disruptions) that could push Carney into the low 40s.\n- Upside risk for Trump: A string of strong economic prints or a highly popular policy move could lift him toward the upper 40s by late June.\n\nWhy not lower than ~70?:\n- Structural advantage: New Canadian PMs commonly post higher approvals than U.S. presidents, especially a polarizing one like Trump.\n- Short time frame: Absent a salient negative shock in Canada or clear positive shock in the U.S., reversion toward typical levels favors Carney > Trump.\n\nWhat would move me upward:\n- Fresh Morning Consult updates showing Carney ≥50% and Trump ≤42–43% through mid/late June.\n- Canadian polling indicating continued honeymoon approval and positive reaction to the government’s U.S. strategy.\n\nWhat would move me downward:\n- Evidence of Carney’s approval slipping to ≤45% (e.g., economic disappointment, cabinet scandal, policy backlash).\n- U.S. data showing Trump at ≥47–48% for consecutive weeks.\n- Any indication the tracker will not display a July figure for one leader, or repeated instances of equal rounded values near July 1.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney have a higher approval rating than US President Donald Trump on July 1, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nResolution source updates monthly. According to Morning Consult for January 2025: \"The latest approval ratings are based on data collected from Jan. 21-27, 2025. Ratings reflect a trailing seven-day simple moving average of views among adults in each country surveyed.\"\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if Mark Carney has a higher approval rating than US President Donald Trump according to [Morning Consult](https://pro.morningconsult.com/trackers/global-leader-approval) when checked by Metaculus on or after July 1, 2025. If this not the case (including due to a tie), this resolves as **No**.\n\n\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nThe relationship with the United States under President Donald Trump was a central theme of the recent Canadian election.

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
