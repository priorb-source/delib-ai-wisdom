    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "About 2 months (≈60 days)",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "The TNLA does not take up or pass the AfCFTA ratification in May/June, or it passes late but the instrument of ratification is not deposited with the AU Commission by June 30, 2025.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "The cabinet prioritizes AfCFTA, the TNLA passes ratification in May or early June, the president signs promptly, and the instrument is deposited with the AU Commission before July 1, 2025.",
    "rationale": "- Baseline and timing: With roughly 60 days left, substantial procedural steps must occur: legislative approval, presidential assent (if required), and formal deposit with the AU Commission. Even where political will exists, the deposit step can slip past deadlines. The status quo therefore favors inaction or delay.\n- Country context: South Sudan has faced acute competing priorities (security, humanitarian, macroeconomic). Legislative throughput has historically been slow. AfCFTA ratification is politically low-cost but not urgent domestically, making it vulnerable to slippage.\n- Comparative/base-rate cues: Most AU members have already ratified; South Sudan is among a small remainder. Late ratifiers often move only when there is a clear, scheduled push from the executive and a prepared parliamentary docket. Absent clear public signals of imminent action, the short window lowers odds.\n- Signals on hand: No fresh indications (e.g., cabinet approval, TNLA agenda listings, or ministry/AfCFTA Secretariat notices) that ratification is queued for immediate passage and deposit. The referenced business summit implies advocacy and interest but not procedural readiness.\n- Why not higher: Tight timeline plus lack of concrete signals of a fast-track process or scheduled deposit.\n- Why not lower: Ratification is broadly supported across the AU, carries reputational/economic benefits, and could be used by Juba for positive signaling. If the executive chooses to prioritize it, the legal act itself can be straightforward and could be bundled with other treaty ratifications.\n- What would move me up: Credible reports of cabinet approval, TNLA committee reports placing AfCFTA on the order paper, confirmed plenary scheduling, or an official statement that the instrument is being prepared for deposit. Any AU/AfCFTA Secretariat communication acknowledging imminent deposit would sharply raise odds.\n- What would move me down: Parliamentary recess or adjournment through June, reports of procedural holdups, or absence of any movement by early June.\n\nAssistant’s research: No additional information provided beyond the article link; thus no confirmed procedural progress to incorporate, reinforcing reliance on status-quo and timing considerations.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill South Sudan ratify AfCFTA (the pan-African free trade agreement) before July 1, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nThe Star Worldwide via MSN: [World Chambers Africa Summit maps economic path for South Sudan](https://www.msn.com/en-xl/africa/other/world-chambers-africa-summit-maps-economic-path-for-south-sudan/ar-AA1CTigs?ocid=BingNewsVerp)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if South Sudan ratifies the African Continental Free Trade Area (AfCFTA) Agreement before July 1, 2025.\n\n\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nNo additional information available.\n\nToday is 2025-05-02.\n\nBefore answering you think:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n(e) You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
