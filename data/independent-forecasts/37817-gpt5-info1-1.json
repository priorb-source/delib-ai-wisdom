  "information": "United Airlines has announced a new year-round, twice-weekly direct flight from Narita, Japan, to Koror, Palau, which will commence on October 29, 2025. The route will be operated by a Boeing 737-800 aircraft, and tickets are already available for purchase. Separately, in February 2025, Qantas launched a new direct route from Brisbane to Koror, named the 'Palau Paradise Express.' This service is supported by the Australian Government.",

    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "About 41 days (outcome checked on or after 2025-07-01)",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "By July 1, 2025, flightsfrom.com/ROR lists only Guam and Yap (United), plus at most one or two additional regional services (e.g., Taiwan and/or a sporadic Philippines or Australia service). The total destinations remain 3–5, not exceeding 5.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Multiple seasonal/supported routes are active on July 1, 2025, and appear on flightsfrom.com—e.g., Guam and Yap (United) plus Taiwan, Philippines, South Korea, and Japan (summer charters or subsidies), and possibly Australia—bringing the total to 6 or more.",
    "rationale": "- Definition and baseline: The question resolves off the number of direct destinations shown on flightsfrom.com/ROR on or after July 1, 2025. To resolve Yes, Koror must have 6+ nonstop destinations listed at that time. For a small market like Palau, 6 is a high bar.\n\n- Status quo weighting: Palau’s post-pandemic air service recovery has been sluggish (as suggested by the cited Marketplace piece), and small-island airports typically sustain a handful of routes. A reasonable base-rate expectation for ROR right now is around 2–4 scheduled destinations (very likely Guam and often Yap via United; occasionally Taiwan and/or Manila; others are intermittent). If nothing changed, the most likely outcome is No.\n\n- Research assistant summary and impact: The assistant notes (1) United’s new Narita–Koror service starting Oct 29, 2025—this is after the resolution date and thus does not help reach >5 by July 1, and (2) a Qantas Brisbane–Koror route launched in Feb 2025, supported by the Australian Government. If the Brisbane route exists as a scheduled service and appears on flightsfrom.com in July, it modestly increases the count by one. However, a Qantas-operated BNE–ROR route would be unusual for such a small market; absent independent confirmation, I treat this as plausible but uncertain. Even granting Brisbane, reaching 6 total still requires several additional routes active exactly around July 1.\n\n- What it would take to get to Yes: To clear 5 destinations, Koror would likely need GUM and YAP (United) plus at least four of the following operating and listed on July 1: Taipei, Manila, Seoul, Tokyo (earlier than United’s October start, perhaps via seasonal charters), Brisbane (if real), and possibly one more (e.g., Hong Kong or another Japanese/Korean city). While summer seasonality can bring charters, getting to six simultaneously active and listed routes by July 1 seems unlikely without multiple government-supported or charter programs aligning at once.\n\n- Why not higher: Limited demand recovery, PRC group-tour restrictions to Palau due to its Taiwan ties, and long lead times for scheduled route launches all push against multiple new routes materializing by July 1. The known Narita start is after the date. Even if the Brisbane service exists, you’d still need several additional concurrent routes.\n\n- Why not lower: There is some upside risk from seasonal summer charters (Japan/Korea/Taiwan), possible Philippines services, and potential government-supported Pacific connectivity that could briefly lift the destination count. Flightsfrom.com includes seasonal scheduled routes if they’re operating in the period, so a cluster of summer operations could, in principle, push the total higher than expected.\n\n- What would change my view:\n  • Upward: Verified schedules (in GDS or airline announcements that are reflected on flightsfrom.com) showing July 2025 nonstop services to multiple additional cities (e.g., ICN, TPE, MNL, a Japan city before October, and confirmation that BNE is operating and listed). Evidence of government-subsidized flights slated for July would also move me up.\n  • Downward: Confirmation that Yap service is suspended, that Brisbane service is not operating or won’t appear on flightsfrom.com, or that Taiwan/Philippines seasonal services are not running in early July. A current snapshot of flightsfrom.com showing only 2–3 destinations would also push me down further.",
