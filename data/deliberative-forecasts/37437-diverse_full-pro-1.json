    "review": "The other two forecasters and I are in strong agreement, with forecasts of 2%, 2%, and 3%. This consensus is based on the same core evidence: the very short timeframe (under two months) and the consistent intelligence pointing to 2027 as the People's Liberation Army's target for readiness. Forecaster 2 did well to explicitly distinguish between a 'security crisis,' which the CFR deems moderately likely, and an 'invasion,' which is a much higher bar that must be met for this question to resolve Yes. Forecaster 3 provided the most novel and insightful points. I found two of their arguments particularly compelling. First, they highlighted the strictness of the resolution criteria, noting that the U.S. must publicly use the term 'invasion' or describe the sending of ground forces. This means other forms of aggression, like a blockade or missile strikes, would not resolve the question. Second, they identified the most plausible, albeit still unlikely, scenario for a 'Yes' resolution: a limited Chinese seizure of a Taiwanese-controlled outlying island (e.g., Kinmen, Pratas). This is a more concrete tail-risk scenario than a general 'miscalculation.'",
    "rationale": "I am maintaining my forecast of 2%. My initial reasoning remains the strongest argument against a near-term invasion: all credible intelligence and even Taiwan's own military planning point to 2027 as the key year for China's readiness. Launching a major amphibious invasion without complete preparation in the next eight weeks would be an immense and unlikely gamble for Beijing. The analyses from the other forecasters have reinforced my confidence in this view. Forecaster 3's points, while insightful, ultimately balance each other out without shifting my final probability. Their point about a potential seizure of an outlying island slightly increases the perceived probability of a qualifying military action occurring. However, their point about the strictness of the resolution criteria—requiring the U.S. to specifically label the event an 'invasion'—simultaneously decreases the probability that such a limited action would be framed in a way that resolves this question as 'Yes'. For example, the US might condemn it as an 'unprovoked attack' or 'illegal seizure' without using the term 'invasion.' Therefore, while my understanding of the potential scenarios has become more nuanced, the overall low probability remains unchanged.",
