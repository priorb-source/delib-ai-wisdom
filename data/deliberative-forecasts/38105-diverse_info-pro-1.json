    "review": "My initial forecast of 70% was overly optimistic, and the other forecasters provided a crucial reality check. All three of us correctly identified Lebanon's history of political gridlock as the key obstacle, but Forecaster 2's analysis was particularly persuasive in its detail. They rightly pointed to specific, unresolved legislative sticking points (bank restructuring, capital controls) and, most importantly, contrasted the Lebanese minister's optimism with the IMF's own more cautious assessment that progress has been 'slow.' Forecaster 2 also made a strong point about the multi-stage internal IMF process, which makes the one-month deadline even more challenging than I had initially considered. Forecaster 3 added a valuable perspective by highlighting external pressures that could catalyze a deal, such as conditional EU aid and the June 10 donor meeting serving as a focal point. These arguments collectively convinced me that while my initial assessment of the current talks' seriousness was not wrong, I significantly underestimated the powerful and specific headwinds.",
    "rationale": "I am substantially decreasing my forecast from 70% to 25%. My initial analysis was too heavily swayed by the positive momentum of an IMF mission being in Beirut and the optimistic statements from the Lebanese Finance Minister. The deliberation with my colleagues has convinced me that I under-weighted several critical factors.\n\nFirst, as Forecaster 2 detailed, the most politically contentious reforms—specifically a credible bank restructuring law and capital controls—remain unresolved. These are the same issues that have scuttled past efforts, and the fact that they are still stumbling blocks with only one month remaining is a powerful negative indicator.\n\nSecond, Forecaster 2's point about the IMF's official, cautious tone is a direct and more reliable counter-signal to the political posturing from Lebanese officials. This suggests the gap between the two sides is larger than I initially assumed.\n\nFinally, the procedural timeline for finalizing a Staff-Level Agreement and then scheduling a Board vote makes the July 1 deadline extremely tight, even with maximum political will.\n\nI am not lowering my forecast to Forecaster 2's 12% because I believe Forecaster 3's points about external pressure and the June 10 donor meeting as a catalyst are valid. These factors create a plausible, albeit narrow, path to a 'Yes' outcome. The extreme severity of the crisis combined with these external pressures could yet force a rapid compromise. However, the balance of evidence now strongly suggests that this is the less likely scenario.",
