    "review": "Forecaster 2’s reasoning aligns closely with mine: small, perishable, limited-distribution, Class II recall with no illnesses typically closes in 1–3 months, but administrative lag is a material risk. Their mention of vending machine operators potentially slowing verification is a useful nuance. Forecaster 3 emphasizes the bureaucratic and timing risks more heavily and notes that many recalls drift into 3–6 months; that’s plausible and the short window left makes the “Active at cutoff” risk real. However, 34% seems too low given the narrow scope, perishability, and that we’ll be ~95–100 days in by May’s end—well within a common closure window for recalls of this type. Overall, F3 adds weight to the timing/lag risk; F2 largely corroborates the baseline with a similar central estimate.",
    "rationale": "We have ~23 days until the deadline. The recall is small (303 lbs), Class II, limited to WA vending machines, with best-by dates in late Feb—so all implicated product should be long out of commerce. Those factors support a relatively straightforward effectiveness verification. Countervailing factors: the page is still Active as of May 8, FSIS closure updates can lag, Class II events may be lower priority, the vending-machine chain could involve multiple operators, and the cutoff falls on a weekend (if closure posts June 2, it resolves No). Net: I still see the base case as “closure is plausible in May,” but the administrative timing risk is non-trivial. I slightly trim my prior to reflect the lag risk emphasized by Forecaster 3, while keeping odds above 50% given the case specifics and typical 2–4 month closure pattern for limited, perishable misbranding/allergen recalls.",
