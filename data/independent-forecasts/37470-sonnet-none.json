    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Approximately 54 days until July 1, 2025",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No announcement has been made. The status quo is that this question resolves as No unless the International Traditional Karate Federation publicly announces Egypt as the 2026 host before the deadline.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "The ITKF does not make any formal announcement about the 2026 championship host before July 1, 2025. This could occur because: negotiations are still ongoing, the decision has been delayed, a different country was selected, or the announcement timing extends beyond the deadline.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "The ITKF formally announces through their official channels (website, social media, press release) before July 1, 2025 that Egypt has been selected to host the 2026 Traditional Karate World Championship, following through on the discussions mentioned in the VetoGate article.",
    "rationale": "The VetoGate article indicates that Egypt's Minister of Youth and Sports, Ashraf Sobhi, held discussions with the ITKF president about hosting the 2026 World Championship, which demonstrates active interest and engagement. However, several factors limit confidence: (1) Only 54 days remain until the deadline, creating a narrow window for a formal announcement; (2) Discussions about hosting do not guarantee selection - many countries may be in consideration; (3) The research assistant found no additional corroborating information, suggesting either no announcement has been made or information is not readily available; (4) Traditional karate events receive less media coverage than Olympic karate, making information harder to verify; (5) We lack information about competing bids or the typical ITKF decision timeline. Applying the status quo bias - the world changes slowly and most forecasted events don't happen - the default outcome is No until evidence emerges of an actual announcement. My forecast is not higher because there's no confirmation of selection, only discussion, and time is limited. It's not lower because the VetoGate article provides concrete evidence of serious engagement at ministerial level. I would update higher if: official ITKF sources mention Egypt as host, additional credible sources report the selection, or ITKF announces an imminent decision. I would update lower if: another country is announced as host, the deadline approaches with no news, or sources indicate decision delays.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nBefore July 1, 2025, will the International Traditional Karate Federation announce that Egypt has been chosen to host the 2026 Traditional Karate World Championship?\n\nQuestion background:\nVetoGate Egypt: [Ashraf Sobhi discusses hosting the 2026 World Cup with the President of the International Traditional Karate Federation](https://www.vetogate.com/5400045)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if, before July 1, 2025, the International Traditional Karate Federation announces that Egypt has been chosen to host the 2026 Traditional Karate World Championship.\n\n\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nNo additional information available.\n\nToday is 2025-05-08.\n\nBefore answering you think:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n(e) You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
