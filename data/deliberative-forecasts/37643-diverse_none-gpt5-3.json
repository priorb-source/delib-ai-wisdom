    "review": "Forecaster 2’s emphasis on the compressed legislative timeline and the need for statutory change matches my prior view. They add a clear base-rate framing: absent visible progress already underway, completion by July 1 is extraordinarily rare. I find this convincing and consistent with my earlier reasoning.\n\nForecaster 3 raises the possibility that the tracker might mark “complete” based on an aggressive administrative announcement rather than full, implemented termination. That’s the main argument pushing higher. However, given PSLF’s statutory basis, any administrative attempt to “terminate” would be immediately contested and, in most interpretations, fall short of true termination. Community trackers typically require concrete, verifiable policy consummation rather than intent, which makes a 15% estimate feel high without evidence that this tracker uses very permissive criteria.\n\nNet: F2 reinforces my priors; F3 highlights a pathway I already considered but seems to overweight it given the time left and likely tracker standards.",
    "rationale": "The key constraints remain: 48 days is very little time; PSLF is statutory; legislative repeal is the clean path and there’s no indication of near-term passage. Even if an administration moved to halt new PSLF accrual or processing by rule or guidance, that would face legal/political challenges and is unlikely to be judged as a completed “termination” by a careful tracker before July 1. I still reserve a small tail for an extraordinary legislative vehicle or an unexpectedly permissive tracker interpretation, but I weight those as quite unlikely in this window.\n\nGiven F2’s alignment and the lack of new evidence favoring imminent action, I’m nudging down slightly to reflect the extremely tight calendar and the tracker’s probable requirement for clear, enacted change.",
