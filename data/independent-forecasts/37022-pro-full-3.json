  "information": "The latest published value for Ukraine's government debt for February 2025 was 1.869 trillion UAH. The threshold for the question to resolve as 'Yes' is 1.900 trillion UAH, necessitating a month-on-month increase of at least 30.5 billion UAH. Historical data from 2024-2025 shows that the typical monthly net change in debt ranged from a decrease of 10 billion UAH to an increase of 110 billion UAH. The median monthly increase during this period was approximately 25 billion UAH, and the increase from January to February 2025 was 18.5 billion UAH. In seven of the twelve months preceding March 2025, the monthly increase was 30 billion UAH or greater.\n\nIn mid-March 2025, Ukraine received a disbursement from an IMF Extended Fund Facility (EFF) tranche amounting to $400 million, which is equivalent to approximately 16 billion UAH. Furthermore, the first tranche of EU ERA loans, valued at €1 billion, was expected in late March. Domestic bond auctions have continued to raise approximately 26 billion UAH per month. Debt servicing costs for March were reported to be modest.\n\nBy the end of 2024, Ukraine's total state debt had reached approximately 7 trillion UAH, equivalent to about 92% of the country's GDP. The state budget for 2024 operated with a significant deficit, and the Accounting Chamber of Ukraine reported a 29% increase in tax debt during that year. During March 2025, the Ukrainian hryvnia weakened from 41.1 to 41.4 UAH/USD. This 0.7% depreciation increased the UAH valuation of Ukraine's foreign-currency denominated debt by an estimated 9-11 billion UAH.",

    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "The outcome will be known within the next few weeks. Today is April 22, 2025, and official government debt figures for March 2025 are typically published by the end of April or in early May.",
    "status_quo_outcome": "The status quo outcome, based on the median monthly debt increase over the past year (25 billion UAH), would be 'No'. An increase of this magnitude from the February 2025 level of 1.869 trillion UAH would result in a total of 1.894 trillion UAH, which is below the 1.90 trillion UAH threshold.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "A 'No' outcome would occur if the net increase in government debt during March 2025 was less than 31 billion UAH. This could happen if the large EU loan was not disbursed or registered in March, and if domestic borrowing was lower than average or offset by larger-than-expected debt repayments.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "A 'Yes' outcome occurs if the net increase in debt is 31 billion UAH or more. This scenario is realized through the combination of known financial inflows in March: the IMF tranche disbursement, continued domestic bond auctions, and the valuation effect of hryvnia depreciation on foreign-currency-denominated debt. These factors alone are projected to increase the debt well beyond the threshold.",
    "rationale": "My forecast is based on a quantitative assessment of the specific financial events that occurred in March 2025. The starting point is the February 2025 debt level of 1.869 trillion UAH, which requires an increase of at least 31 billion UAH to resolve as 'Yes'. Several factors strongly indicate this threshold was surpassed.\n\nFirst, there were significant, identifiable debt inflows. Ukraine received a $400 million IMF tranche (~16 billion UAH) in mid-March, and domestic bond auctions continued to raise approximately 26 billion UAH per month. Second, the 0.7% depreciation of the hryvnia during March increased the UAH value of foreign-denominated debt by an estimated 9-11 billion UAH. The sum of these three items alone (16 + 26 + 10) points to a baseline increase of roughly 52 billion UAH, which is substantially higher than the required 31 billion UAH.\n\nWhile the status quo based on the median monthly increase (25 billion UAH) would suggest a 'No' outcome, this is outweighed by the specific, concrete data available for March. Monthly debt figures are often volatile and driven by the timing of large aid disbursements, making data for the specific month in question more valuable than historical averages. The fact that monthly increases exceeded 30 billion UAH in 7 of the 12 preceding months also shows that the required increase is not an outlier.\n\nMy forecast is not higher than 90% because there remains some uncertainty regarding the precise timing and official accounting of these financial flows. A small chance exists that some inflows were registered in April, or that unmentioned debt servicing costs were higher than assumed.\n\nMy forecast is not lower because the evidence for a substantial increase is multi-faceted and compelling. For the outcome to be 'No', the combined effect of the confirmed IMF tranche, regular domestic borrowing, and currency depreciation would need to be almost entirely negated, which seems highly improbable. \n\nI would revise my forecast downwards if official sources indicated the IMF tranche was not booked in the March accounts, or upwards if it's confirmed that the large €1 billion EU loan was also included in the March figures.",
