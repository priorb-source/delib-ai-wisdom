  "information": "As of early 2024, there were four to five regularly scheduled direct flight destinations from Koror, including Guam (operated by United Airlines), Manila (United Airlines), Taipei (China Airlines), and Brisbane (Qantas). In addition to scheduled services, Japan Airlines (JAL) resumed direct charter flights from Narita to Palau in March 2025 after a five-year suspension.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Approximately 6 weeks. The question resolves on or after July 1, 2025, and today is May 21, 2025.",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No. As of early 2025, there are four to five direct flight destinations from Koror (Guam, Manila, Taipei, Brisbane, and potentially a charter from Narita). This is not greater than 5, so the status quo outcome is 'No'.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "The slow post-pandemic tourism recovery continues. No new airlines establish scheduled services to Palau, and existing carriers do not add new destinations before the resolution date. The total number of destinations remains at 5 or fewer.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "A new scheduled service is announced and launched before July 1, 2025. For example, a Chinese airline resumes pre-pandemic routes or a regional carrier adds a new connection, bringing the total number of destinations to six or more.",
    "rationale": "My forecast is heavily weighted by the status quo and the short time remaining until resolution. The current number of direct, scheduled destinations from Koror is four, with a fifth charter route that may not qualify under the resolution criteria. The question requires more than five destinations, meaning at least six. The resolution date of July 1, 2025 is less than six weeks away. Establishing a new international flight route is a complex process involving regulatory approvals and logistical planning that typically takes many months. It is highly unlikely for a new route to be announced and operational within this short timeframe. The provided background information indicating a slow tourism recovery in Palau further supports this, as airlines are less likely to invest in new routes to a market with weak demand. My probability is not lower because there is a small chance for a last-minute launch of a previously planned route for the summer season. My probability is not higher because the combination of a very short timeline and unfavorable market conditions creates a significant barrier to adding the one or two new routes required for a 'Yes' outcome. I would update my forecast towards 'Yes' upon an immediate, official announcement of a new scheduled route to Koror beginning before July 1. I would update towards 'No' (i.e., lower the probability) if any existing service was suspended.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill there be greater than 5 direct flight destinations from Koror, Palau on July 1, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nMarketplace: [Why hasn’t tourism recovered in Palau? Flights haven’t restarted in high volume since the pandemic drop-off, and South Koreans are booking their vacations elsewhere.](https://www.marketplace.org/story/2024/04/19/palau-tourism)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if there are greater than 5 direct flight destinations listed at the [All scheduled direct (non-stop) flights from Koror (ROR)](https://www.flightsfrom.com/ROR) tracker when checked by Metaculus on or after July 1, 2025.\n\n\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nAs of early 2024, there were four to five regularly scheduled direct flight destinations from Koror, including Guam (operated by United Airlines), Manila (United Airlines), Taipei (China Airlines), and Brisbane (Qantas). In addition to scheduled services, Japan Airlines (JAL) resumed direct charter flights from Narita to Palau in March 2025 after a five-year suspension.\n\nToday is 2025-05-21.\n\nBefore answering you think:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n(e) You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
