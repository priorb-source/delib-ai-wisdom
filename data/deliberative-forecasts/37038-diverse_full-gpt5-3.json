    "review": "Both forecasters emphasize the same key points I relied on: the HTS already shows +17% for Israel, suspension status doesn’t matter for resolution, and the short window plus bureaucratic inertia favors the listing persisting through June 1. They add a useful framing that the July 9 suspension date is the real negotiating target, which further reduces the likelihood of an early HTS removal. I agree with their logic. The only caveat I’d add is that HTS updates can occur quickly after a Presidential proclamation/Federal Register notice—so an early deal in late May could still flip this before June 1—but that remains a lower-probability tail.",
    "rationale": "Status quo is already a Yes: the +17% line is in HTS and marked suspended, which still counts. For a No, the administration would need to conclude a deal and issue a revocation (proclamation/FR notice), and USITC would need to update the HTS before June 1. Signals from both sides point to July 9 as the operative deadline; maintaining the listing (possibly with suspension extended) preserves leverage while talks continue. Given the short 5-week window, the most probable path is that nothing changes on the HTS site before June 1. I stay below ~90% because a rapid deal with immediate revocation and fast HTS update in late May is plausible given the bilateral relationship and public optimism, even if not the base case.",
