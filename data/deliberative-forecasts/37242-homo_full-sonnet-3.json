    "review": "All three forecasters have converged on remarkably similar probabilities (15%, 15%, 18%), which validates the core analytical framework. The consensus identifies: (1) strong structural growth factors (airline capacity increases of 7-10%, consistent Q1 growth), (2) the critical Easter calendar advantage (Easter entirely in April 2025 vs late March 2024), and (3) the limited impact of the April 28 power outage (affecting only final 2-3 days, 5.7% of flights on one day). Forecaster 2 added valuable context about US tourism concerns being premature and US tourists not being the primary market. Forecaster 3's quantification of worst-case power outage impact at 1-2% of monthly traffic is helpful. The Easter timing effect may actually be stronger than initially weighted - it's a mechanical calendar advantage that should add tens of thousands of passengers to April 2025 compared to April 2024. The convergence itself is informative evidence that the probability range of 15-18% is well-calibrated.",
    "rationale": "The deliberation reinforces rather than challenges my initial analysis. Three independent forecasters using different analytical approaches converged on essentially identical probabilities, suggesting this probability range accurately reflects the evidence. The structural case for growth remains overwhelming: airline capacity up 7-10%, Q1 growth trend of 2.2-3.6%, and most critically, the Easter calendar effect providing a substantial mechanical advantage to April 2025. The power outage remains the only significant negative factor, but its impact is clearly bounded - affecting 2-3 days out of 30, with limited flight cancellations even on the worst day. For April 2025 to fall below April 2024 despite these factors would require either (a) the power outage having dramatically worse cascading effects than reported, or (b) major unreported disruptions throughout April. Neither seems likely. The convergence at 15-18% demonstrates appropriate confidence without overconfidence. I see no compelling reason to deviate from my initial forecast of 15%.",
