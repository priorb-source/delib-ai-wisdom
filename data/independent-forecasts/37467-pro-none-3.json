    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Less than 2 months.",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No. Beyond Meat remains a going concern and is not in bankruptcy proceedings.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Beyond Meat continues to manage its cash reserves and operations, successfully navigating through the next several weeks without a liquidity crisis that would necessitate a bankruptcy filing. The company's cost-cutting measures and existing cash on hand are sufficient to extend its runway beyond the July 1, 2025 deadline.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "A sudden liquidity crisis forces the company's hand. This could be triggered by an unexpected acceleration of cash burn, a major creditor calling a loan, or a crucial financing round failing, leaving management with no alternative but to seek bankruptcy protection before the deadline.",
    "rationale": "My forecast is based on an analysis of Beyond Meat's financial precarity against the very short timeframe for this question. The primary reason for the low probability is the company's presumed cash position relative to its burn rate. While the company is facing significant challenges, highlighted by the recent quarterly operating loss of nearly $38 million, its cash reserves are likely sufficient to cover operations for the next ~53 days until the July 1, 2025 deadline. Publicly available information from previous quarters suggests a cash buffer that, while diminishing, would not be exhausted in this short window barring an acute crisis. Bankruptcy is a final resort, and companies in this situation typically exhaust all other options (emergency financing, asset sales) first, which takes time. The status quo is solvency, and in a short timeframe, the status quo is a powerful predictor.\n\nMy forecast is not lower than 5% because the company is in a genuinely distressed financial state. The high cash burn is a significant risk, and an unforeseen event—such as a major customer ceasing orders, a supplier demanding cash on delivery, or a sudden credit line withdrawal—could trigger a liquidity crisis much faster than anticipated. The 5% probability accounts for this tail risk of a sudden negative shock.\n\nMy forecast is not higher than 5% because a bankruptcy filing within the next eight weeks seems improbable without a specific, immediate catalyst. The company's most significant debt obligations are not due until 2027, alleviating the pressure of a near-term maturity cliff. Without such a catalyst, the company's existing resources should allow it to operate past the deadline.\n\nI would increase my probability forecast upon news of a major financing deal falling through, the issuance of a 'going concern' warning in an SEC filing, or a significant downward revision of sales forecasts. Conversely, I would decrease my forecast if the company announced a new round of funding or a strategic partnership that shores up its balance sheet.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill Beyond Meat file for bankruptcy before July 1, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nBeyond Meat has had several years of losses and in the most recent quarter it [posted](https://investors.beyondmeat.com/news-releases/news-release-details/beyond-meatr-reports-fourth-quarter-and-full-year-2024-financial) a loss from operations of almost $38 million.\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question will resolve as **Yes** if Beyond Meat, Inc., files any petition for bankruptcy protection in the United States, under any chapter of the United States Bankruptcy Code, before July 1, 2025. The question will resolves on the filing of such a petition, not on whether any bankruptcy protection is granted by a court. If no such petition is filed by that date, this question will resolve as **No**.\n\n\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nNo additional information available.\n\nToday is 2025-05-08.\n\nBefore answering you think:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n(e) You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
