    "review": "Forecaster 2’s analysis is broadly aligned with mine: the binding constraint is time, with unresolved, politically hard prior actions (notably bank restructuring) and the IMF’s own “slow” progress signal. Forecaster 3 adds useful emphasis on active negotiations and political pressure, but I disagree with their interpretation that an announcement like a staff-level agreement would satisfy resolution. The criterion requires a signed economic agreement in which the IMF agrees to provide money; in practice, that means IMF Executive Board approval of a financing arrangement (EFF/RFI/etc.). A staff-level agreement is conditional and not Board-approved financing. That misread likely inflates their probability. Neither forecaster introduced decisive new positive signals (e.g., imminent passage of an IMF-compliant bank restructuring law or a Board date), but they do underscore genuine momentum and external incentives (EU conditionality), which modestly raises the tail risk of a rapid, last‑week‑of‑June Board approval or a fast‑track emergency facility—still low probability.",
    "rationale": "I maintain that Board approval is the relevant threshold. The calendar is punishing: even if a staff-level agreement emerges around/after the June 10 round, Lebanon would still need to complete contentious prior actions (especially bank restructuring), finalize the LOI/MEFP, get staff/management clearance, circulate Board papers (typically at least a week), and secure a June Board slot. Lebanon’s track record since the 2022 SLA argues against rapid reform passage, and the IMF’s public concerns about the draft law suggest real friction. Offsetting factors include active negotiations, strong external pressure (EU linkage), and a small probability of an emergency instrument being considered quickly if circumstances warrant. On balance, I slightly increase my probability to reflect these tails, but the modal outcome remains slippage beyond July 1.",
