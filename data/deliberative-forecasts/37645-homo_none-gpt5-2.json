    "review": "Both forecasters highlighted a key institutional detail I hadn’t explicitly incorporated: the 45–60 day window between calling elections and the vote. That means any pre–July 1 announcement would effectively force a mid/late-summer election date, which is strategically unattractive and thus further suppresses the likelihood of an announcement in this short window. They also reiterate that the SNS-led majority can likely install a new PM without dissolution, reducing near-term pressure for snap polls. I find these arguments convincing and directionally consistent with my view, with the legal timing point meaningfully strengthening the case for a lower probability than my initial 35%.",
    "rationale": "Roughly 6–7 weeks remain. Given Serbia’s practice, an official decree announcing the election date triggers a 45–60 day countdown, implying a summer vote if announced before July 1. That is a political disincentive. The ruling bloc still appears capable of forming a government after a PM resignation, so there is a viable non-election pathway. While Serbia does have a history of snap elections and leadership may use them tactically, the fresh mandate from Dec 2023 and the unattractive summer timing make a near-term announcement less likely. I’m trimming my estimate modestly to reflect the added weight of the legal timing constraint. I would move up on clear signals from President Vučić or senior SNS figures favoring dissolution or evidence that a PM-designate cannot be confirmed within deadlines; I would move down on swift nomination/confirmation of a new PM or explicit denials of early elections.",
