    "review": "Forecaster 2 and 3 largely mirror my priors, but they added a few useful nuances: (1) the April 2 tariff shock is outside the Q1 window, reinforcing that a value-driven entry would have needed to happen at still-elevated Q1 valuations; (2) Buffett’s historical optics/insider concerns around Microsoft lower the probability of MSFT as a candidate; and (3) a path-to-Yes via expiration of an SEC confidential treatment in Q1 is theoretically possible, though unsupported by evidence. These points slightly strengthen the No case and don’t provide new positive catalysts. Overall their reasoning is consistent and persuasive, with the Microsoft point being the most incremental to my view.",
    "rationale": "Status quo still points to No: Berkshire has been a persistent net seller, turnover is exceptionally low, cash balances are high, and Buffett has reiterated concerns about the capital intensity of the Magnificent Seven. Q1 ended before the April tariff drawdown; valuations for most Mag 7 were not clearly in Berkshire’s strike zone during the quarter. If Berkshire were accumulating a sizeable new Mag 7 stake, it would likely have sought confidential treatment, which would cause the Q1 13F to omit it and resolve No for this question. Among potential Yes names, Alphabet or Meta are the most plausible; Tesla and Nvidia are unlikely, and Microsoft is further discounted by long-standing optics concerns. A Yes could still occur if Ted/Todd initiated a small, disclosable stake or if an earlier confidential position is revealed this quarter, but there are no leaks, hints, or AGM commentary pointing that way as of May 7. Incorporating the other forecasters’ added points—especially the Microsoft optics and Q1 timing relative to the tariff shock—I trim my estimate slightly from 12% to 11%.",
