    "review": "Forecaster 2 provides crucial concrete data that dramatically changes the analysis: 105 objectives were marked Done as of April 16, with 44 in progress. This is the critical baseline information I lacked. The mathematical case is compelling - only 15 more objectives needed over 76 days from that date (46 days remaining now), requiring just 0.197/day compared to observed rates of 0.625/day recently. Even at one-quarter the recent pace, the threshold would be nearly reached. Forecaster 3's analysis mirrors my initial uncertainty but estimates the current count at 60-90, which appears too conservative given Forecaster 2's data point. If we extrapolate from 105 on April 16 to today (May 16), even at a significantly reduced pace of 0.3/day, we'd be at approximately 114 now, needing only 6 more in the remaining 46 days. The margin of safety is substantial.",
    "rationale": "My initial 48% forecast was anchored on lacking baseline data. Forecaster 2's concrete April 16 datapoint (105 Done, 44 in progress) fundamentally changes the calculation. The required completion rate to reach 120 is dramatically lower than observed historical rates. Even accounting for possible slowdowns, implementation challenges, or data verification lags, the mathematical buffer is comfortable. However, I'm not adopting Forecaster 2's 87% because several uncertainties remain: (1) I cannot independently verify the April 16 data; (2) we don't know if there's been acceleration, steady pace, or slowdown in the past month; (3) political/legal obstacles could have emerged; (4) tracker methodology or verification standards could have changed. The most likely scenarios are either we're already past or very close to 120, or we're at 110-115 requiring minimal additional completions. The downside scenarios requiring significant systematic slowdown seem less probable but not negligible. Balancing the strong mathematical case against residual data uncertainty and potential obstacles, I'm updating substantially upward to 72%.",
