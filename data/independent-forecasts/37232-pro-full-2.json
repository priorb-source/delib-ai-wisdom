  "information": "The most recent post on Virgin Galactic's News page was dated January 30, 2025. The post before that was from December 12, 2024. Over the 10 complete months leading up to May 2025, five months contained at least one post. There was a four-month gap in posts from August to October 2024, and a three-month gap from February to April 2025.\n\nVirgin Galactic announced it will release its financial results for the first quarter of 2025 on Thursday, May 15, 2025, followed by a conference call. The company's Q4 2024 earnings release on February 26, 2025, was not posted on the main News page, nor was the press release announcing the date for the Q1 2025 results. These communications were issued via the Investor Relations section and PR wires.\n\nThe company is in a flight hiatus, with no crewed flights scheduled until 2026. The next generation of spaceplanes, the Delta SpaceShip, began assembly in March 2025. Commercial flights for this new craft are planned to begin in mid-2026, with private astronaut flights following in the fall of 2026. According to a regulatory filing, Geode Capital Management LLC increased its stake in Virgin Galactic by 19.1% during the fourth quarter of 2024.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Approximately one month. The outcome will be known on June 1, 2025.",
    "status_quo_outcome": "Yes",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Virgin Galactic makes at least one post on its News page in May 2025. This could be triggered by an unexpected company announcement, a significant milestone in the development of the Delta class spaceships, or a change in their communications strategy to post financial results more broadly.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "No new posts appear on the News page during May 2025. The company continues its current communications pattern, where there is no operational flight news to report and financial results are published exclusively in the Investor Relations section.",
    "rationale": "My forecast is based on Virgin Galactic's recent communication patterns during its current flight hiatus. The status quo is a three-month gap in posts on their News page, which suggests a low likelihood of a post in any given month. While historically posts were made in 5 of the last 10 months, the current operational context is different. Critically, the company did not post its Q4 2024 earnings release on this page, nor did it post the announcement for the upcoming Q1 2025 results. This establishes a strong precedent that the Q1 earnings release on May 15, the most predictable news event for the month, will also not appear on the main News page. With no flights scheduled until 2026, the primary source of regular news is absent. Therefore, the most likely outcome is that May passes with no posts on this specific page.\n\nMy probability is not higher than 75% because there is still a non-trivial chance of an ad-hoc announcement. For example, the company could release news about a significant manufacturing milestone for the Delta class fleet, announce a new partnership, or feature a story about its future astronauts. Such events are possible, though not guaranteed to occur in May.\n\nMy probability is not lower than 75% because the evidence against a post is compelling. The deliberate separation of financial news from the main news page, combined with the lack of operational flight activity, strongly curtails the most common sources of corporate news. The status quo of a multi-month communication gap is a powerful predictor.\n\nI would decrease my probability (i.e., move my forecast towards 'No') if Virgin Galactic were to retrospectively add past financial announcements to the News page, signaling a change in strategy. I would increase my probability if the company announced a formal pause in public-facing news releases until a specific future date.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill Virgin Galactic fail to make any new posts on its News page in May 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nAs of April 19, 2025, Virgin Galactic's most recent post was timestamped January 30, 2025. The most recent one before then was December 12, 2024.\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if no new posts appear at Virgin Galactic's News page, which can be accessed at [this address](https://www.virgingalactic.com/news), timestamped after April 30, 2025 and before June 1, 2025. If there is a new post, then this question resolves as **No**.\n\n\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nThe most recent post on Virgin Galactic's News page was dated January 30, 2025.

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
