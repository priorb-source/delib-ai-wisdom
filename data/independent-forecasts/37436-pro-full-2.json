  "information": "As of April 30, 2025, the official UN OCHA impact snapshot reported 295 UN staff fatalities in Gaza. Reports from late April cited UNRWA stating that 295 of its personnel had died since October 7, 2023. This number reflects a steady increase over time; a UN report on March 19, 2025, had stated at least 280 UN employees were killed, and an OCHA report cited on January 9, 2025, listed 263 UNRWA staff fatalities. Broader figures for humanitarian workers indicate a higher total toll; an OCHA report on April 23, 2025, stated that at least 418 humanitarian workers, including the 295 UN staff, had been killed in Gaza since the conflict began. A specific incident on March 23, 2025, resulted in the deaths of 15 humanitarian personnel, including staff from the Palestinian Red Crescent and one UN staff member.\n\nThe United Nations has warned of a worsening humanitarian crisis in Gaza, exacerbated by a blockade that severely restricts access to aid, food, water, and medical supplies. In early May 2025, UN Emergency Relief Coordinator Tom Fletcher called the aid blockade a form of 'cruel collective punishment,' noting that over 3,000 aid trucks were stalled at the border. According to OCHA reports from late April and early May 2025, insecurity and access restrictions have compelled humanitarian organizations to close nutrition centers. The same reports indicated an 80% rise in children being treated for malnutrition and that 65% of residents lack access to clean drinking water. The UN Population Fund also announced it had exhausted its supply of emergency shelter materials and hygiene products.\n\nOn May 5, 2025, Israel's security cabinet reportedly approved a plan to intensify military operations in the Gaza Strip. This follows a period of renewed violence since a ceasefire broke down in mid-March 2025. The UN has described Gaza as one of the most dangerous places in the world for humanitarian workers, with its personnel and facilities at risk from military activity. The UN's Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) has stated that humanitarian efforts are severely hindered by severe restrictions on movement within the territory. The International Red Cross also noted that the deteriorating security situation is hindering the work of its staff and partners.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Less than two months. The outcome will be determined by the final OCHA impact snapshot published before July 1, 2025.",
    "status_quo_outcome": "Yes. The number of fatalities has been on a steady upward trend since the conflict began. With the current count at 295, a continuation of existing conflict dynamics over the next two months would almost certainly result in the additional 5 fatalities required to cross the 300 threshold.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "A 'No' outcome would require a sudden and durable ceasefire being implemented and holding throughout the forecast period, leading to a complete halt in UN staff casualties. Alternatively, if OCHA ceases to publish updates, the final number would remain at 295, resulting in a 'No'.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "A 'Yes' outcome occurs if at least five more UN staff fatalities are reported before July 1, 2025. This scenario is realized if the conflict continues at its current intensity or, as recent intelligence suggests, escalates, leading to further casualties among humanitarian workers in the high-risk environment of Gaza.",
    "rationale": "My forecast is based on three key factors: the small number of additional fatalities required, the time remaining, and the current trajectory of the conflict. The threshold is 300, and the last OCHA report on April 30, 2025, listed 295 UN staff fatalities, meaning only five more are needed. Historically, the toll has risen consistently; for example, it increased by 15 in the 42 days between March 19 and April 30. At that rate, five more deaths would be expected in approximately 14 days, and we have nearly two months until the resolution date. The most significant factor supporting a 'Yes' resolution is the report from May 5, 2025, that Israel's security cabinet approved a plan to intensify military operations. This action directly increases the risk to all personnel in Gaza, including UN staff. The UN itself has described Gaza as one of the most dangerous places for humanitarian workers. My probability is not higher than 90% to account for the non-zero chance of a sudden, unforeseen political development leading to a durable ceasefire and immediate de-escalation. My probability is not lower because the gap to the threshold is very small, the historical trend is clear, and the explicit intention to escalate military operations makes further casualties highly probable. I would lower my forecast significantly if a ceasefire were announced and appeared to be holding. I would raise it if a major incident involving multiple UN staff casualties were reported.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill 300 or more UN staff be reported to be killed in Gaza according to UN's OCHA in its final impact snapshot before July 1, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nSee accompanying Humanitarian update [here](https://www.ochaopt.org/content/humanitarian-situation-update-284-gaza-strip).\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if the number of reported UN staff killed in Gaza is greater than or equal to 300 according to the most recent impact snapshot for the Gaza Strip posted [here](https://www.ochaopt.org/publications) by the United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs as of July 1, 2025.

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any).
