  "information": "UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer faces criticism from Brexit supporters over concessions in a 'renewal' agreement with the EU. His government is also grappling with a sluggish economy, contributing to a decline in popularity. Starmer faces a growing political challenge from Nigel Farage's Reform UK party, whose economic plans he has described as reckless and comparable to the policies of former Prime Minister Liz Truss. Starmer's government plans to reduce the civil service by 50,000 jobs by 2030, aiming to save £2 billion annually, with details to be announced in a spending review on June 11.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Approximately one month.",
    "status_quo_outcome": "Yes. Based on long-term data from the resolution source (Morning Consult), UK Prime Ministers have consistently maintained a higher approval rating than their Japanese counterparts, even when both leaders are unpopular domestically. This suggests a structural advantage for the UK leader in this comparison.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "In June 2025, the spending review announced by Starmer's government, which includes significant civil service job cuts, proves to be deeply unpopular, triggering public backlash and a sharp drop in his approval rating. Concurrently, Prime Minister Ishiba's government in Japan successfully passes a popular economic relief measure, giving him a modest but crucial boost in public support that allows his rating to equal or surpass Starmer's.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "The British public reacts neutrally to the June 11 spending review, viewing it as a necessary if unpleasant measure. Starmer's approval rating remains low but stable. Meanwhile, Prime Minister Ishiba continues to struggle with Japan's stagnant economy and internal party divisions, keeping his approval rating suppressed in the low 20s, consistent with trends for recent Japanese leaders. As a result, Starmer maintains a lead, however narrow, over Ishiba on July 1.",
    "rationale": "My forecast is primarily based on the consistent historical pattern in the Morning Consult Global Leader Approval tracker, which shows UK leaders polling higher than Japanese leaders. For instance, even with very low domestic popularity, Rishi Sunak has consistently polled above Fumio Kishida. This structural factor provides a strong baseline in favor of a 'Yes' outcome.\n\nThe research note indicates Keir Starmer's government is facing significant headwinds, including economic sluggishness and controversial spending cuts planned for June. This will almost certainly depress his approval rating from any post-election honeymoon period. I estimate his approval will likely be in the 25-35% range by July.\n\nFor Japan, while a new Prime Minister like Shigeru Ishiba would likely start with higher ratings than his predecessor, Japanese leaders' approval ratings tend to decline rapidly and remain low due to persistent economic and demographic challenges. Therefore, it is probable that Ishiba's rating will also be low, likely in the 20-30% range.\n\nThe core of the forecast is that while both leaders are likely to be unpopular, Starmer's 'floor' in this specific poll is likely higher than Ishiba's. The probability is not higher than 65% because the margin between the two leaders is likely to be small, making the outcome highly susceptible to short-term events in the final month, especially the reaction to the UK's spending review on June 11. A significant negative reaction could easily flip the outcome. The probability is not lower because the historical polling data provides a strong prior that would require a substantial political event to overturn. I would increase the probability if the UK spending review is well-received, and decrease it if it causes widespread public anger.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer have a higher approval rating than Japanese Prime Minister Shiguru Ishiba on July 1, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nResolution source updates monthly. According to Morning Consult for January 2025: \"The latest approval ratings are based on data collected from Jan. 21-27, 2025. Ratings reflect a trailing seven-day simple moving average of views among adults in each country surveyed.\"\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if Keir Starmer has a higher approval rating than Shiguru Ishiba according to [Morning Consult](https://pro.morningconsult.com/trackers/global-leader-approval) when checked by Metaculus on or after July 1, 2025. If this not the case (including due to a tie), this resolves as **No**.\n\n\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nUK Prime Minister Keir Starmer faces criticism from Brexit supporters over concessions in a 'renewal' agreement with the EU.

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
