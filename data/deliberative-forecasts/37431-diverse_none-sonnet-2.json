    "review": "The other forecasters raise several important points I hadn't fully weighted:\n\n1. **Class I recall status** (Forecaster 2): This highest-risk designation creates stronger institutional pressure for rapid resolution, which I underweighted in my initial analysis.\n\n2. **Typical closure timeframes** (Forecaster 3): Their 1-3 month estimate with 6-10 weeks common for straightforward cases is more optimistic than my 2-4 month baseline. With 56 days (8 weeks) remaining from today, this places us right in the middle of the \"common\" range they cite, suggesting closure before July 1 is more plausible than I initially thought.\n\n3. **Allergen vs. contamination recalls**: Both forecasters emphasize that allergen misbranding cases are more straightforward than pathogen investigations, which should accelerate timelines - a valid distinction I acknowledged but perhaps underweighted.\n\nHowever, I find some of their optimism questionable:\n- We're only 11 days into a recall that typically takes 6-10 weeks, meaning most of the work remains\n- Forecaster 3's acknowledgment that \"FSIS processes often take longer than hoped\" supports more conservative estimates\n- The 65,000 pound volume and likely multi-state distribution (frozen buns) creates real logistical complexity\n- No evidence exists of unusually rapid progress to date\n\nForecaster 2's reasoning about balancing the Class I urgency against the logistical challenges seems most balanced. Their 40% forecast appropriately weights both the plausible-but-ambitious nature of the timeline.",
    "rationale": "After reviewing the other analyses, I believe I was somewhat too pessimistic at 32%. The combination of Class I status, the straightforward nature of allergen misbranding (vs. contamination), and typical closure timelines of 6-10 weeks for similar cases suggests that closure within the remaining 8 weeks is more plausible than I initially estimated.\n\nHowever, I don't find sufficient reason to be as optimistic as 46%. The fundamental challenge remains: we're only 11 days into a process that typically takes 6-10 weeks, with the deadline at exactly 8 weeks. This is a tight timeline with no margin for delays. The status quo (Active) remains the default outcome, and bureaucratic processes rarely proceed faster than expected without specific evidence of rapid progress.\n\nKey factors supporting a modest upward revision:\n- 8 weeks falls within the \"common\" range for straightforward allergen recalls\n- Class I designation creates institutional urgency\n- Misbranding is simpler than contamination investigations\n\nKey factors preventing higher revision:\n- Most recall work still ahead with no buffer for delays\n- No information suggesting unusually fast progress\n- Distribution complexity of frozen products across multiple states\n- Strong status quo bias toward Active status\n\nI'm updating my forecast from 32% to 38%, closer to Forecaster 2's balanced assessment but remaining somewhat more conservative given the tight timeline and lack of evidence for rapid progress.",
