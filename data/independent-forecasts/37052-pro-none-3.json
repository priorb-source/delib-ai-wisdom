    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Approximately 2 months (from April 25, 2025, to July 1, 2025).",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No successful coup occurs in any country in Africa or Latin America. The current governments, including the military juntas in the Sahel, remain in power through the deadline.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Despite high political and security tensions in several countries, particularly in West Africa, potential coup plots are either thwarted by existing governments or fail to materialize before the July 1, 2025 deadline. Incumbent leaders navigate political crises without resorting to illegal means to retain power.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "A faction within the military of a politically unstable African nation, most likely in the Sahel region (e.g., Mali, Burkina Faso, Niger, or Chad), successfully overthrows the existing government. The coup plotters cite the government's failure to contain Islamist insurgencies or manage the economy, and they manage to secure control of the capital and key state institutions with minimal resistance.",
    "rationale": "My forecast is primarily driven by the high base rate of successful coups in Africa over the past five years, particularly in the Sahel region. The list provided in the background shows at least seven successful coups in Africa since mid-2020, an average of more than one per year. The underlying drivers for this instability—including persistent jihadist insurgencies, economic hardship, and geopolitical competition—have not abated and continue to create a fertile environment for military takeovers. The question only requires one successful event across two continents within the specified timeframe. \n\nMy probability is not higher primarily due to the very short forecast window of approximately two months. While the region is unstable, coups are still discrete, difficult-to-predict events. A high-risk environment does not guarantee a coup will occur within this specific, narrow timeframe. Many plots may be in motion, but they may not come to fruition before July 1st.\n\nMy probability is not lower because ignoring the established, multi-year trend of successful putsches in Africa would be a significant forecasting error. The conditions are ripe, and the 'coup contagion' effect, where a successful coup in one country emboldens actors in neighboring states, remains a potent factor. While the probability of a coup in Latin America is considerably lower based on recent history of failed attempts (Peru 2022, Bolivia 2024), it still contributes a small, non-zero chance to the overall probability. \n\nI would increase my forecast upon receiving credible intelligence of significant military mobilization, purges of senior officers, or overt political ultimatums from the military in a high-risk country. I would decrease my forecast if there were significant, successful regional diplomatic interventions that demonstrably stabilized a teetering government.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill there be a successful coup in Africa or Latin America before July 1, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nAccording to [Powell & Thyne (2011, p. 252)](https://www.uky.edu/~clthyn2/powell-thyne-JPR-2011.pdf), a coup is \"illegal and overt attempts by the military or other elites within the state apparatus to unseat the sitting executive.\" In recent years, some of the coups in Africa have been:&#x20;\n\n* [Mali August 2020](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2020_Malian_coup_d%27%C3%A9tat)\n* [Mali May 2021](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2021_Malian_coup_d%27%C3%A9tat)\n* [Niger March 2021](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2021_Nigerien_coup_attempt) (attempt)\n* [Niger July 2023](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2023_Nigerien_coup_d%27%C3%A9tat)\n* [Gabon August 2023](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2023_Gabonese_coup_d%27%C3%A9tat)\n* [Chad January 2025](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2025_N%27Djamena_attack) (possible attempt)\n* [Burkina Faso January 2022](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/January_2022_Burkina_Faso_coup_d%27%C3%A9tat)\n* [Burkina Faso September 2022](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/September_2022_Burkina_Faso_coup_d%27%C3%A9tat)&#x20;\n* [Guinea September 2021](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2021_Guinean_coup_d%27%C3%A9tat)\n\nLatin America has had the following coup attempts in recent years:\n\n* [Peru self-coup attempt](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2022_Peruvian_self-coup_attempt), December 2022\n* [Brazil Congress attack](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2023_Brazilian_Congress_attack), January 2023\n* [Bolivia coup attempt](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2024_Bolivian_coup_attempt), June 2024\n\nSee also: [VoA by the numbers Coups in Africa](https://projects.voanews.com/african-coups/)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if there is a successful coup d’état in any country on the African continent or Latin America before July 1, 2025, according to credible media reports. If this does not occur, this question resolves as **No**.\n\nLatin America is defined as any country in North America or South America whose primary language is Spanish, Portuguese or French.\n\nA coup d’état (often shortened to \"coup\") is [defined](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coup_d'%C3%A9tat) as an event in which a state's military or other components of its power structure overthrow the existing political authority.&#x20;\n\nA \"successful\" coup is defined as a coup in which the group or person attempting to seize power establishes control over both the government and military, and will be considered to have succeeded once any significant resistance to their authority has ceased.&#x20;\n\nA self-coup, [defined](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Self-coup) as a political leader, having come to power through legal means, remaining in power through illegal means, will count. This includes scenarios in which an incumbent leader refuses to relinquish power after an election.\n\nExternal support for a coup, such as is described [here](https://africacenter.org/spotlight/africas-coups-and-the-role-of-external-actors/), will count as long as the mercenaries or other external actors are acting in support of a perpetrator from within the state.\n\nCivil wars, mutinies, rebellions or popular uprisings will not count, nor will changes to a country's constitution that restrict a country's democratic norms.\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nNo additional information available.\n\nToday is 2025-04-25.\n\nBefore answering you think:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n(e) You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
