    "review": "My initial forecast was a low 10%, based on the high and ongoing salience of the tariff story. The other forecasters provided valuable quantitative frameworks that challenged my initial intuition.\n\nForecaster 2 correctly framed this as a 'hazard rate' problem: we only need one day of success (a joint omission) over the remaining period. Their use of a Bayesian approach based on the ~0 successes in the past ~20 days is a methodologically sound way to anchor the forecast. It rightly suggests that my initial 10% was likely too low by not formally accounting for the 'at least one' condition over a ~22-day window.\n\nForecaster 3 also focused on the 'one day' requirement and attempted to model daily probabilities. However, their analysis contains a critical logical flaw: their calculation of 1-(0.9025)^23 represents the probability that there is at least one day where it's *not the case that both papers mention tariffs*. This condition is met if even one paper omits the word, which does not satisfy the resolution criteria requiring omission from *both*. A corrected calculation using their own starting assumptions (e.g., a 95% daily mention rate per paper) would yield a probability closer to 5-10%, supporting my initial low forecast. Therefore, I find their reasoning unconvincing and their 65% forecast unfounded.\n\nThe most compelling argument came from Forecaster 2's structure. It forces a quantitative consideration of how a low daily probability can accumulate over several weeks into a non-trivial chance of a 'Yes' outcome.",
    "rationale": "I am updating my forecast from 10% to 20%. The primary reason for this upward revision is Forecaster 2's analysis, which correctly highlighted that my initial forecast underweighted the cumulative probability of a rare event occurring over a 22-day period. The 'we only need one success' framing is crucial.\n\nHowever, I am not moving closer to Forecaster 2's 40% because I believe their model's key assumption—that the daily probability of omission is static—is flawed. The research assistant's report describes a very recent (April 2) executive order whose consequences are still unfolding and escalating (e.g., consumer stockpiling, supply chain disruptions, other businesses failing). This suggests the news salience of tariffs is increasing, not constant or decreasing. Therefore, the fact that there have been no successes in the past 22 days is a strong signal that the daily probability of a joint omission is extremely low, and it is likely getting even lower as the story develops.\n\nMy updated 20% forecast balances two competing factors. On one hand, the escalating nature of this major economic story makes it exceptionally likely to remain on the front pages of both the nation's premier business paper (WSJ) and its paper of record (NYT) every day. On the other hand, the 22-day window provides a non-zero chance that a completely unrelated, major breaking news event (e.g., a natural disaster, a significant geopolitical development) could dominate both front pages for a single day, causing a joint omission. The 10 percentage point increase reflects a more formal appreciation for the latter possibility over the multi-week timeframe.",
