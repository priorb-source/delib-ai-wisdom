  "information": "According to an April 19, 2025, Politico report, Haley Stevens was 'widely expected to declare her Senate candidacy as early as next week.' On the same day, both the Washington Examiner and the Livingston Post reported that Stevens was expected to announce her bid 'in the coming weeks,' a slightly more ambiguous timeframe.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Approximately 10 days remain until May 1, 2025, when the question resolves.",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No - Haley Stevens has not yet announced her candidacy for US Senator from Michigan as of April 21, 2025.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Stevens delays her announcement beyond May 1 due to ongoing negotiations, campaign preparation delays, strategic timing considerations, or decides not to run for the Senate seat after all.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Stevens announces her candidacy in the next 10 days, consistent with Politico's reporting that she was expected to declare 'as early as next week' from April 19, meaning an announcement could come in the April 22-28 window.",
    "rationale": "The research assistant provided reports from April 19, 2025 (just 2 days ago) indicating imminent announcement. Politico specifically stated Stevens was 'widely expected to declare her Senate candidacy as early as next week,' which would place an announcement squarely within our May 1 deadline. The Washington Examiner and Livingston Post used the slightly vaguer 'coming weeks' timeframe. Multiple credible outlets reporting similar information suggests genuine signals from Stevens' camp about timing. The Democrats' loss of other top Senate contenders (per CNN background) creates urgency for Stevens to enter the race. However, 'widely expected' is not a confirmation, and political announcement timelines frequently slip due to fundraising considerations, staff preparation, strategic timing, or last-minute negotiations. The 10-day window provides reasonable time for an announcement if plans remain on track, but also leaves room for delays. My forecast is not higher because political announcements often get postponed and there's no official confirmation. It's not lower because the reporting is recent, credible, from multiple sources, and the timeframe aligns well with the May 1 deadline. I would update higher if Stevens' campaign made official statements about announcement timing or if more recent reporting emerged. I would update lower if reports suggested delays or if we reached late April without movement.",
