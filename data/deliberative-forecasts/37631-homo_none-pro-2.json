    "review": "The other forecasters and I share a core thesis: the outcome hinges on the asymmetric volatility between the stable, defensive Walmart and the high-beta, narrative-driven Tesla, especially given the short ~45-day timeframe. We all agree that Tesla's valuation is subject to large swings that could easily decide the outcome, while Walmart's is expected to remain relatively constant. The primary point of divergence is a factual one about the 'status quo' on May 13, 2025. Forecaster 2 believes Tesla is slightly ahead, anchoring their forecast at 60%. Forecaster 3 believes Walmart is slightly ahead, anchoring their forecast higher at 70%. This disagreement highlights that the two companies are extremely close in valuation. Since their reasoning largely reinforces my own central argument about momentum vs. volatility, the main new consideration is how to interpret this ambiguous starting point.",
    "rationale": "I am maintaining my original forecast of 65%. The deliberation with the other forecasters has reinforced my conviction in the core analytical framework rather than altering it. The key factor remains the strong negative momentum for Tesla, driven by tangible business headwinds like competition and slowing growth, contrasted with Walmart's stability. The discrepancy among the forecasters about which company is currently leading confirms that the market caps are neck-and-neck. In such a scenario, the forward-looking trajectory becomes more important than the starting position. The path of least resistance involves Walmart's valuation remaining stable while Tesla's continues to face downward pressure. I am not increasing my forecast to 70% because, as all forecasters noted, Tesla's stock is notoriously volatile and a single unexpected positive catalyst (e.g., FSD progress, strong delivery numbers) could cause a sharp rally. I am not decreasing it to 60% because the fundamental challenges facing Tesla are significant and unlikely to be resolved in the next six weeks, making a decline or stagnation more probable than a rally. Therefore, 65% remains my best estimate, balancing the prevailing negative trend for Tesla against its well-known potential for unpredictable high-magnitude price swings.",
