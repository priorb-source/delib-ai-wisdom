    "review": "Both forecasters lean appropriately on base rates and regression. Forecaster 2 adds a specific historical anchor (Arráez at .392 on July 1, 2023), which is a useful calibration point for how close a modern hitter can get. Both implicitly assume the resolution uses qualified hitters; neither engages with potential ambiguity in “according to the ESPN baseball stats page,” which often defaults to qualified but can be toggled to all batters. I find their quantitative bounds (10–12%) reasonable under a qualified-only interpretation. There’s no new concrete 2025 data presented (e.g., current leaders and PAs), so the new arguments mainly reinforce the base-rate case rather than introduce new evidence.\n",
    "rationale": "Baseline: Sustaining .400 through July 1 historically is extremely rare for qualified hitters. By May 20, we’re ~6 weeks from resolution; variance is shrinking as PA accumulate. Recent near-miss examples (e.g., 2023 Arráez hovering at/near .400 into late June, reportedly .392 on July 1) show plausibility but still favor No given regression and modern pitching quality.\n\nKey uncertainty: The resolution cites the ESPN stats page but doesn’t explicitly require “qualified.” If qualified-only, my prior was in the low-teens. If any player listed (including non-qualified) could count, the probability is materially higher because a part-time player with limited PAs could be ≥ .400 on that specific date.\n\nUpdate from deliberation: The other forecasters’ reasoning strengthens the base-rate case for qualified hitters and doesn’t add evidence for 2025 players currently near .400. That nudges me slightly downward from my initial 18%, mainly by placing more weight on the qualified-hitters interpretation. I still keep a non-trivial probability for a definitional resolution that allows non-qualified appearance on ESPN, but I downweight it somewhat as most leaderboard checks default to qualifiers.\n\nTriggers to move: Up if by mid-June a qualified hitter is ≥ .395 (especially ≥ .400) with 220+ PA. Down if by mid-June all qualified leaders are ≤ .380. If clarification confirms “qualified hitters only,” I’d move closer to ~10–12%; if it confirms “any player on ESPN stats (all batters),” I’d move up substantially (40–60%).\n",
