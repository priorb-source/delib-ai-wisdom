    "review": "Both forecasters provide crucial information I lacked. Forecaster 2's claim that April 2025 data shows approximately $0.632 is the most important new information - this places the current price just above the threshold, fundamentally changing the question from 'will prices stay stable' to 'will prices decline in May.' This dramatically shifts the base case from Yes to No. Forecaster 3's emphasis on the strict resolution rule (exactly $0.6300 resolves No) and characterization of sub-$0.630 as 'on the low side' of the recent range is well-taken. Both forecasters appropriately weight the upward cost pressures from the article, which I may have dismissed too easily. The key disagreement is magnitude: Forecaster 2 at 45% treats this as nearly a coin flip given proximity to threshold, while Forecaster 3 at 28% emphasizes that moving down from current levels against documented cost pressures is less likely than not. I find Forecaster 3's reasoning more compelling - requiring an actual price decline (not just stability) against headwinds is a meaningful hurdle.",
    "rationale": "I significantly overestimated the probability of Yes in my initial forecast. The critical error was assuming banana prices would naturally fall below 63 cents as a status quo outcome, when in fact the April 2025 data (per Forecaster 2) shows prices at approximately $0.632 - already above the threshold. This completely changes the dynamics: instead of betting on continued stability in a normal range, we're betting on a price decline against documented upward pressures from tariffs, port fees, and inflation mentioned in the Quartz article. To resolve Yes, the May price must drop more than 0.2 cents from April's level. While banana prices do exhibit some monthly volatility and retail promotions could provide temporary relief, the combination of: (1) starting above the threshold, (2) documented cost pressures, (3) historically small month-to-month changes, and (4) the strict resolution rule, all argue for a lower probability of Yes than I initially assessed. I'm updating significantly downward toward Forecaster 3's more conservative position, though not quite as low, as I still acknowledge the possibility of promotional activity or supply-side improvements that could nudge prices down the necessary fraction.",
