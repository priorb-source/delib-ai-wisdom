    "review": "Both forecasters provide strong analysis aligned with mine. Forecaster 2 emphasizes the fragmented opposition and lack of mechanisms to force restoration, which reinforces the low probability. Forecaster 3 raises an important point I hadn't fully emphasized: the resolution criteria only requires the site to be 'online' according to IsItDownRightNow, not that it contains climate content. A minimal placeholder page or redirect could technically satisfy this while avoiding policy contradiction. This is a meaningful insight that could slightly increase the probability. However, I'm not fully convinced this changes things significantly because: (1) even a placeholder might be seen as contradicting their ideological stance; (2) the administration has been comfortable with 4 months of criticism without action; (3) they've shown no inclination toward half-measures on climate issues. The June hearings are unlikely to produce binding requirements in the short 3-4 week window remaining afterward. All three of us converge on similar reasoning about the strong ideological opposition, concrete dismantling actions, historical precedent, and lack of restoration plans.",
    "rationale": "After deliberation, I maintain my 8% forecast. Forecaster 3's point about the low resolution bar is valid - technically, even a minimal page could satisfy the criteria without contradicting policy. This prevents me from going lower. However, several factors keep me from going higher: (1) The administration has demonstrated comfort with sustained criticism, maintaining the site offline for 4 months; (2) Secretary Hegseth's explicit statements show ideological commitment, not just administrative inaction; (3) Concrete dismantling actions (funding cuts, policy reversals) suggest systematic removal rather than temporary neglect; (4) Historical precedent from 2017-2021 shows similar sites stayed down for years; (5) Only 6 weeks remain, with June hearings unlikely to produce binding action in the remaining window. The convergence around 5-10% across all forecasters suggests this range appropriately captures the uncertainty. I stay at 8% because while a minimal restoration is theoretically easy and cheap, the administration's demonstrated prioritization of ideological consistency over mollifying critics makes even token gestures unlikely.",
