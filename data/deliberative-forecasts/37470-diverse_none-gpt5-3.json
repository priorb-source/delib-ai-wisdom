    "review": "Forecaster 2 leans heavily on the May 7 minister–ITKF president meeting as a near-decisive signal. That’s useful timing detail and does indicate momentum, but the leap from high-level talks to an 85% chance of a formal, time-bounded announcement seems overstated without evidence of an ITKF board/congress schedule or official hints. Risks of bureaucratic timing and the need for formal ratification remain material. Forecaster 3’s analysis aligns closely with mine: short window, lack of corroboration, unknown competing bids, and process risk. Their point about lower media coverage for traditional karate is fair, though the resolution hinges on an ITKF announcement (which should be traceable via ITKF channels even if broader media is thin). Overall, F3’s reasoning is more convincing than F2’s; the meeting is a positive signal but not sufficient to justify very high odds.",
    "rationale": "We have ~54 days left. The only public signal is a high-level meeting with strong political backing and positive noises from the ITKF president. This increases plausibility that Egypt is a serious/leading bidder and that a 2026 host decision could be imminent. However, there is no evidence of an official ITKF decision timeline, congress/board vote scheduled before July 1, or competing bids’ status. Smaller federations can move quickly, but they also sometimes time announcements with preplanned events, which may fall after July 1. Local press can overinterpret discussions as impending confirmations. Balancing these, I slightly raise my prior to reflect the fresh, timely signal and the need to lock a 2026 host soon, but I still weight the status quo and process/communication risks more heavily than F2. I would update higher on any ITKF agenda/notice of a vote or official teaser naming Egypt as preferred/sole candidate; lower if indications emerge that the decision will be taken later in 2025 or that another bid is active.",
