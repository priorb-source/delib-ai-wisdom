    "review": "Both forecasters emphasize the correct base rate: headliners usually appear solo unless a joint segment is explicitly billed. I agree. They also highlight execution risk, especially Musk’s propensity for late changes—this is a meaningful downward factor I weighed but could emphasize more. The point that even a brief group-on-stage moment (e.g., closing thanks/photo) would satisfy the criterion is important and keeps odds above near-zero; I had this in mind but Forecaster 2 framed it crisply. Forecaster 3’s mention of a possible Tesla shareholder meeting timing adds plausible scheduling risk, though it’s uncertain. I’m skeptical of Forecaster 3’s reference to “olive branch”/informal contacts—there’s no supporting evidence provided here, so I discount that upward nudge. Overall, their arguments slightly reinforce the downside risk and do not add concrete upside evidence.",
    "rationale": "The default at YC/tech conferences is separate keynotes or fireside chats; absent any announced joint session, the prior favors No. The Altman–Musk rivalry and recent history of contention make a curated joint appearance less likely, particularly on YC’s stage, where YC would want to avoid a spectacle that could overshadow the student-focused agenda. Execution risk remains material: Musk’s event participation can shift late; any cancellation, remote appearance, or tight travel schedule would make a shared physical stage impossible. Conversely, YC could engineer a headline moment (joint interview or brief closing stage appearance), and because any simultaneous on-stage presence qualifies, the upside tail can’t be dismissed. With no agenda or public hints as of ~3 weeks out, I tilt slightly further toward No versus my prior. I’m making a small downward adjustment to reflect execution risk and lack of positive signals, while keeping a meaningful probability for a surprise or orchestrated joint moment.",
