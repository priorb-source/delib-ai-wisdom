  "information": "Breaking up a federal agency typically requires either legislation passed by Congress or an executive reorganization plan. Historically, similar executive reorganizations have taken between two and six months to progress from concept to a signed executive order, following legal and administrative vetting. For a legislative approach, while the House of Representatives could pass relevant language in an appropriations bill in June, Senate action would likely not occur until mid-July at the earliest. Past large-scale government reorganizations, such as the creation of the Department of Homeland Security, have been complex processes that take longer than a month and a half to formalize.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "47 days from May 15, 2025 to July 1, 2025 (approximately 6.5 weeks)",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No - the objective remains marked as 'in progress' rather than 'complete' on the tracker",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "The most likely scenario is that breaking up NOAA proves too complex to complete in 47 days. Either executive action gets delayed in legal and administrative review, or legislative approaches move too slowly through Congress. The tracker maintainers continue to mark the objective as 'in progress' because no definitive action (executive order, signed legislation, or actual dissolution) has occurred by July 1st.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "An expedited executive order is drafted and signed in late May or June that formally breaks up NOAA, reassigning its functions to other agencies. The Project 2025 Tracker maintainers consider the signing of this order sufficient to mark the objective as 'complete' even if full implementation is still pending. Alternatively, fast-tracked legislation passes both chambers by late June and is immediately signed.",
    "rationale": "This forecast weighs heavily toward the status quo (No) for several compelling reasons. First, the timeframe is extremely compressed at just 47 days. My research assistant notes that similar executive reorganizations historically take 2-6 months from concept to signed order, and we're being asked whether completion occurs in less than 2 months when the objective is currently only 'in progress.' Second, breaking up NOAA is a major federal reorganization affecting critical services like the National Weather Service and National Hurricane Center - not a simple administrative change. Third, the legislative pathway appears too slow, with Senate action unlikely before mid-July according to the research. Fourth, there's ambiguity about what the tracker maintainers would consider 'complete' - they may require actual implementation rather than just an order being signed. The forecast is not lower than 13% because: (1) executive action could theoretically move faster than historical averages if strongly prioritized, (2) the tracker might mark an executive order as 'complete' without waiting for full implementation, and (3) there could be accelerated processes we're unaware of. The forecast is not higher because the timeframe is so short, the current 'in progress' status suggests significant work remains, and major agency reorganizations rarely proceed this quickly due to legal, administrative, and political complexities. I would update higher if we saw: a draft executive order leaked or announced, emergency expedited procedures invoked, or the tracker status changed to indicate near-completion. I would update lower if we reached mid-June with no concrete action announced.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill the Project 2025 Tracker spreadsheet have the objective of breaking up NOAA marked as complete before July 1, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nAt the time of this question, the objective was marked as \"in progress.\" The 2025 Tracker is a project of the Keep_Track subreddit and is explained [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/Keep_Track/comments/1ii7tbr/project_2025_tracker_is_now_live/).\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if the Project 2025 objective to \"break up the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration\" is marked as complete according to [this spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1QGG6wNHna-1tt91yXNkOauAJJ7snobFjfEnmxlmzhl4/edit?gid=0#gid=0) before July 1, 2025. If it is anything other than complete (such as \"in progress\") when accessed by Metaculus on or after July 1, 2025, then the question resolves as **No**.\n\n\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nBreaking up a federal agency typically requires either legislation passed by Congress or an executive reorganization plan.

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
