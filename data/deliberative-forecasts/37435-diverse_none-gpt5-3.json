    "review": "Forecaster 2 and I are broadly aligned: short window, strong inertia, and the need for concrete distress signals (missed payments, going‑concern language, retention of restructuring advisors) before a filing becomes plausible in the next ~8 weeks. Their trigger list is sensible. Forecaster 3 appropriately highlights the genuine business model disruption but, in my view, overweights that factor relative to the short timeline and lack of known acute liquidity triggers—9% seems high absent specific red flags like imminent maturities, defaults, or advisor hires.\n\nNeither added concrete new facts (e.g., debt maturity dates, covenant pressures, or recent disclosures). The main incremental consideration is the upcoming earnings/updates window, which is a reasonable moment for negative surprises that could raise near-term risk. That said, even a bad print typically doesn’t translate into a filing within weeks without an existing default or acceleration path.\n",
    "rationale": "Time left is short (~8 weeks). Base rates for an abrupt filing in that span are low, especially for a company that (as of late 2024) held cash, had been repurchasing some converts, and lacked a near-term maturity wall. Filings at this cadence are usually preceded by public markers: going‑concern language, missed payments, notices of default, failed exchanges, or retention of restructuring advisors. We have no such signals cited here.\n\nThe primary upside risk in this window is an adverse earnings/update—e.g., disclosure of a sudden liquidity shortfall, covenant issues, or advisor retention—which would quickly push the odds up. Tail events (legal judgments, security incidents, vendor tightening) also exist but are low probability. Absent those, the status quo strongly favors “No.”\n\nI’m nudging my estimate up slightly to reflect the imminent catalyst window (earnings/8‑Ks) where such signals, if present, would surface. But without concrete indicators today, the probability remains low single digits.\n",
