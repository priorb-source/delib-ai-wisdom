  "information": "South Sudan signed the African Continental Free Trade Area (AfCFTA) agreement in 2019 but, as of early May 2025, is one of the few states that have not deposited their instruments of ratification with the African Union. The ratification process requires a bill to pass the Transitional National Legislative Assembly, be signed by the President, and have the formal instrument lodged with the AU Commission. Historically, South Sudan's legislative processes can be lengthy; for example, the country took six years to ratify the Maputo Protocol.\n\nThe government of South Sudan is currently focused on several pressing domestic issues, including a delayed peace roadmap and preparations for national elections scheduled for December 2025. The country is also facing a fiscal crisis following a collapse in oil revenue due to a shutdown of a Red Sea pipeline. Further complicating the political landscape, the Vice-President and other senior officials were arrested in late April 2025. The national legislature has been meeting infrequently, sitting for only 32 days in the second half of 2024, and its published calendar for May-June 2025 includes no trade-related bills. Additionally, the Finance Ministry has not budgeted for the obligations associated with AfCFTA ratification, such as tariff reductions.\n\nOn the continental level, the AfCFTA has achieved 92% consensus on trade rules, with 49 of 54 African countries having joined the agreement. To support implementation, initiatives such as the Pan-African Payment and Settlement System (PAPSS) have been introduced. Within South Sudan, both the Chamber of Commerce and the Ministry of Trade have publicly advocated for ratification, with the Trade Minister reaffirming the government's commitment at an April 2025 summit. In February 2025, the East African Community (EAC) launched a new trade committee in South Sudan to help harmonize standards with the AfCFTA framework.",

    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "About 60 days (until July 1, 2025)",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "The AfCFTA ratification bill is not tabled or not prioritized by the Transitional National Legislative Assembly in May–June; the government remains preoccupied with the peace roadmap, political turmoil, fiscal crisis, and election preparations; even if cabinet endorses, the Assembly does not pass it in time and the instrument of ratification is not deposited with the AU before July 1.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "The Trade Ministry and Presidency jointly fast‑track an AfCFTA Ratification Bill as an urgent item; the Assembly passes it in one or two sittings, the President signs promptly, and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs prepares and deposits the instrument with the AU Commission in June, possibly spurred by EAC/AU pressure or a donor-linked milestone.",
    "rationale": "- Baseline/logistics: Ratification requires (1) Assembly passage, (2) presidential assent, and (3) deposit with the AU. With only ~60 days left, all three must occur quickly, and the deposit must be recorded before July 1. South Sudan’s legislative processes are typically slow (e.g., six years to ratify the Maputo Protocol).\n- Current signals: As of early May 2025, South Sudan has not ratified AfCFTA. The Assembly met only 32 days in H2 2024 and its May–June 2025 calendar shows no trade-related bills. The Finance Ministry has not budgeted for AfCFTA obligations, suggesting limited readiness. Acute domestic distractions include a fiscal crunch due to oil revenue collapse, a delayed peace roadmap, December 2025 election prep, and fresh political turmoil (senior arrests in late April). These all bias toward legislative inaction in the near term.\n- Countervailing pressures: The Ministry of Trade and the Chamber of Commerce advocate ratification; the Trade Minister reiterated commitment at an April 2025 summit. EAC launched a new trade committee in Juba in February to harmonize standards. Continent-wide momentum is strong (most AU members have ratified; AfCFTA institutions like PAPSS are rolling out). These create a plausible fast‑track scenario, albeit without concrete procedural steps visible yet (no bill on the order paper).\n- Weighting the status quo: Given no public scheduling, slow legislative cadence, lack of budget provisioning, and competing crises, the default is “no ratification by July 1.” However, a small chance remains that political leadership pursues a quick, symbolic ratification to signal regional integration, and the Assembly expedites it.\n- Why not higher: No bill queued, no budgetary prep, limited sitting days, and immediate political-fiscal crises make a multi-step legal process in <2 months unlikely.\n- Why not lower: Clear political rhetoric in favor, EAC support structures in-country, and the relative simplicity of the legal act if prioritized leave room for a rapid push.\n- What would move me up: (a) Official notice that an AfCFTA Ratification Bill is tabled/first reading scheduled; (b) a presidential message requesting urgent passage; (c) cabinet approval communiqué; (d) Assembly calendar updated with expedited sessions; (e) Finance/Trade circulars preparing implementation; or (f) AU/EAC announcements indicating imminent deposit. \n- What would move me down: Prolonged suspension or adjournment of the Assembly, further political instability, or explicit government statements that ratification will wait until after the 2025 elections.",
