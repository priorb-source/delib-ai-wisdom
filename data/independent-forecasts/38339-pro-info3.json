  "information": "In early June 2025, Russian energy company Gazprom abandoned its plan to build a major gas distribution hub in Turkey. Reports cited insufficient pipeline capacity from Turkey to Greece and Bulgaria as a key reason for the project's lack of feasibility. Separately, Bulgaria has pursued other energy initiatives, signing gas exploration and drilling agreements with Shell and NewMed for blocks in the Black Sea. Bulgaria also has reserved 1 billion cubic meters of gas per year from the Alexandroupolis LNG terminal in Greece.",

    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Less than one month. The question resolves on July 1, 2025.",
    "status_quo_outcome": "The gas transmission agreement between Bulgargaz and BOTAŞ remains in effect, and Bulgaria continues to be bound by its terms.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "The Bulgarian government continues to express its displeasure with the agreement and may pursue negotiations or legal challenges, but stops short of announcing a unilateral cancellation before July 1, 2025, due to the high diplomatic and legal risks involved. The contract remains formally in place as the deadline passes.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Facing the imminent bankruptcy of the state-owned Bulgargaz and mounting domestic political pressure, the Bulgarian government makes a formal announcement that it is terminating the agreement with BOTAŞ, accepting the risk of a diplomatic dispute with Turkey and subsequent international arbitration.",
    "rationale": "My forecast is based on the significant inertia of international agreements, which makes unilateral cancellation a high-stakes and relatively rare event, especially within a short timeframe. The status quo is that the contract, while disadvantageous for Bulgaria, remains active. The primary argument against cancellation is the risk of severe diplomatic fallout with Turkey, a critical neighbor, and the high probability of a costly and potentially unsuccessful legal battle in international arbitration. Governments are typically reluctant to take such drastic steps unless all other options are exhausted.\n\nThe research assistant's report contains information that pulls in both directions. Bulgaria's new energy initiatives, such as LNG terminal access and Black Sea exploration, strengthen its long-term energy security and reduce its dependence on the Turkish route. This gives Bulgaria a stronger negotiating position and makes cancellation a more viable option than it might have been previously. However, the news that Gazprom has abandoned its Turkish hub plan has a more ambiguous effect. While it may reduce the long-term strategic value of the Turkish route, it doesn't alleviate the immediate, crippling financial obligations under the current contract. It is unlikely to be a sufficient catalyst for immediate action within the next three weeks.\n\nMy probability is not lower than 20% because the financial pressure on Bulgargaz is severe, with reports suggesting a risk of bankruptcy. This represents a genuine crisis that could force the government's hand, overriding typical diplomatic caution. The political rhetoric against the deal has been consistently strong, creating an environment where cancellation could be seen as a necessary political move.\n\nMy probability is not higher than 20% due to the extremely short time remaining until the resolution date. Such a significant geopolitical and commercial decision would likely require more time to execute, even if the will to do so exists. Despite the financial pain, the agreement has been in place for some time, suggesting that Bulgaria has thus far been willing to bear the cost rather than risk cancellation. The path of least resistance in the immediate term is to allow the contract to continue while pursuing other avenues like renegotiation.\n\nI would increase my forecast if there were credible reports of emergency meetings within the Bulgarian government to discuss the BOTAŞ contract or leaks of a forthcoming announcement. I would decrease my forecast if there were official statements from either party about engaging in constructive negotiations to amend the agreement, as this would indicate a path to resolution other than cancellation.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill the Botas Gas Agreement between Bulgaria and Turkey be cancelled before July 1, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\n[Borissov to Erdogan: Bulgaria Needs Out of the Botas Gas Deal](https://www.novinite.com/articles/232423/Borissov+to+Erdogan%3A+Bulgaria+Needs+Out+of+the+Botas+Gas+Deal) | [Bulgargaz on verge of bankrupty due to debts to Turkish gas company BOTAS: Turkish media](https://www.turkiyetoday.com/business/bulgargaz-on-verge-of-bankrupty-due-to-debts-to-turkish-gas-company-botas-turkish-med-3201881)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if before July 1, 2025, the natural gas transmission agreement between Bulgargaz EAD and BOTAŞ Petroleum Pipeline Corp is announced by either party as being cancelled.\n\nTermination of the agreement by either side, even if denied by the other side, would still count.\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nIn early June 2025, Russian energy company Gazprom abandoned its plan to build a major gas distribution hub in Turkey.

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
