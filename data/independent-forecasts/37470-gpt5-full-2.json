  "information": "On April 29, 2025, Egypt's Minister of Youth and Sports, Dr. Ashraf Sobhy, met with Gilberto Gartner, a Brazilian national who is the President of the International Traditional Karate Federation (ITKF). The purpose of the meeting was to discuss Egypt's bid to host the 2026 World Traditional Karate Championship. Dr. Sobhy stated that Egypt has organized over 440 sports events in recent years, citing its modern sports infrastructure. President Gartner expressed confidence in Egypt's ability to host the championship successfully, noting he had witnessed a high level of organization at the World Gymnastics Championship in Egypt and that the country has a large base of karate practitioners.\n\nEgypt has a recent history of hosting major international sporting events. In April 2025, the country hosted the World Karate Premier League in Cairo, which involved 384 players from 67 countries. In May 2025, Egypt hosted the Pharaohs' Championship for Rhythmic Gymnastics with 18 participating countries, the African Championship for Rhythmic Gymnastics with 8 participating countries, and the 25th World Military Equestrian Championship with 20 participating nations. Egypt is also scheduled to host the Senior World Karate Championships (an event of the separate World Karate Federation) in November 2025.\n\nAnalysis of the International Traditional Karate Federation (ITKF) indicates a pattern of announcing World Championship hosts 24 to 36 months prior to the event. As of mid-May 2025, there is no mention of Egypt's 2026 bid, nor any related bid documentation, on the ITKF's official website. There have been no public reports of other nations submitting competing bids for the 2026 championship. Egypt previously hosted an ITKF event in 2014.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "About 54 days (until July 1, 2025)",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No announcement by ITKF before July 1, 2025",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "ITKF defers the 2026 host decision to later in 2025 (e.g., at a congress or during a later championship), announces a different host, or only Egypt’s ministry/federation makes claims without an official ITKF announcement. Alternatively, any announcement pertains to a different event (e.g., a World Cup) rather than the 2026 World Championship.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Within May–June 2025, ITKF’s Executive Committee or Congress votes to award Egypt the 2026 Traditional Karate World Championship and ITKF publishes an official announcement (website, verified social media, or formal press release) explicitly naming Egypt as the 2026 host.",
    "rationale": "- Timing window: With ~7 weeks left, a formal decision and announcement must occur quickly. The research notes ITKF historically announces hosts 24–36 months ahead; we are now ~18–20 months from 2026, suggesting the federation is already later than usual or the cycle is atypical. That tilts toward no announcement within this short window.\n- Current signals: A high-level meeting on Apr 29, 2025 between Egypt’s sports minister and ITKF’s president and positive comments about Egypt’s capabilities are supportive signals. Egypt’s recent hosting track record (Premier League, gymnastics, military equestrian; upcoming WKF Worlds in Nov 2025) shows capacity and readiness, and there are no reported competing bids. These factors raise the plausibility of a relatively quick award to Egypt.\n- Countervailing factors: As of mid-May 2025 there is no ITKF website mention of a 2026 bid or process; small federations sometimes move slowly and announce hosts at events later in the year. The referenced article mentions “World Cup,” which may not be the same as the “World Championship” specified by the resolution criteria; mislabeling risk lowers odds. The key requirement is an explicit ITKF announcement naming Egypt as 2026 World Championship host before July 1.\n- Why not higher: Lack of official ITKF documentation or calendar cues for a late-May/June decision; historical earlier announcement pattern; short timeline; event-name ambiguity risk.\n- Why not lower: Strong political will and public courting, ITKF president’s positive remarks, Egypt’s proven hosting capacity, and apparent absence of rival bids suggest a non-trivial chance of a swift decision.\n- Upward updates: Evidence of an imminent ITKF board/congress decision in May/June; official bid submission by Egypt; ITKF teasers or agenda posts; leaks from ITKF or Egypt’s federation referencing the 2026 World Championship specifically.\n- Downward updates: ITKF schedules the host vote after July 1; credible reports of another bidder; continued silence from ITKF through June; announcements that concern a different event (World Cup) or a different year.",

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower.
