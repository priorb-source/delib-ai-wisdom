    "review": "Both forecasters reinforce the key dynamic: the policy is fresh, politically owned (they add specifics: Premier Eby and Minister Dix), and the short horizon makes reversal unlikely. They also sharpen the core resolution risk I noted: the language on the exact BC Hydro page could be generalized or restructured, yielding a No even if the exclusion persists. New, useful points: (1) explicit brand call-outs reduce consumer confusion, arguing for keeping “Tesla is not eligible” on-page; (2) added political context (lower political cost to maintain exclusion, public signaling) slightly raises the chance the explicit mention stays. The protest/market-share details aren’t decisive for copy decisions, but they marginally support status quo messaging. Overall, I find their reasoning convincing and directionally consistent with mine, nudging me slightly upward on the probability that the explicit Tesla mention remains.",
    "rationale": "Time to resolution is ~1 month; status quo is an explicit Tesla exclusion dated March 12, 2025, framed within a broader domestic-preference posture. Political principals have publicly backed it, increasing inertia. The main failure mode for a Yes is not a policy reversal but a web update that removes brand-specific wording or a page restructure. Balancing that, the consumer-clarity rationale for naming Tesla and the recency of the change make it more likely the explicit call-out persists through July 1. No credible signals of softening or legal constraints have emerged. Given these factors and alignment with peer arguments, I slightly increase my forecast to reflect a higher probability the exact page will still say Tesla is ineligible by early July.",
