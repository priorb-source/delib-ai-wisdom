  "information": "Post Malone has received five nominations for the 60th Academy of Country Music (ACM) Awards, scheduled for May 8, 2025. His nominations include Album of the Year for \"F-1 Trillion,\" and three nominations for his collaboration with Morgan Wallen, \"I Had Some Help.\" He is not nominated for the top category, Entertainer of the Year. Key competitors include first-time nominee Ella Langley, who leads with eight nominations. Other heavily nominated artists are Morgan Wallen and Lainey Wilson with seven nominations each, and Chris Stapleton with six nominations.\n\nThe reception for cross-genre artists at country music award shows has been mixed historically. Favorable precedents include Beyoncé winning a CMA Award for a collaboration with The Chicks, and Justin Timberlake winning a CMA with Chris Stapleton. Lil Nas X also won CMA Awards for \"Old Town Road.\" However, many artists crossing over face resistance from traditional voters, and the Album of the Year award typically goes to established country artists. Post Malone himself has a history of receiving numerous Grammy nominations without winning; at the 2025 Grammy Awards, he was nominated for eight awards and lost all of them, bringing his career total to 18 nominations without a win.\n\nPost Malone has recently made high-profile moves into the country music scene. His country album, \"F-1 Trillion,\" has had strong commercial performance. He has engaged in collaborations with established country stars such as Morgan Wallen, Luke Combs, Blake Shelton, and Jelly Roll. His recent performance at the Coachella festival featured a country-focused set and guest appearances from Jelly Roll and Ed Sheeran. However, this performance received a mixed reception from viewers and critics.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "16 days",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "ACM voters coalesce around established country artists (e.g., Lainey Wilson, Chris Stapleton, Zach Bryan, Morgan Wallen) in key categories; “I Had Some Help” gets edged out for Single/Song/Music Event/Video and Album goes to a core-country favorite. Post Malone goes 0-for-4 (or 0-for-5).",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "He wins a shared category tied to “I Had Some Help” with Morgan Wallen (most plausibly Music Event, Single, or Video/Visual Media of the Year). A less likely path is an Album win for his country project if it overperforms with voters.",
    "rationale": "Timing: The show is on May 8, 2025, so there is little time left for new information beyond final pre-show buzz or early (off-air) category announcements.\nBaseline and evidence: Multiple nominations materially raise the chance of winning at least one award. Even if the exact count is 4 (per prompt) or 5 (per research assistant), the collaboration with Morgan Wallen gives him realistic paths in shared categories where pure traditionalism is somewhat relaxed. “I Had Some Help” was a dominant commercial hit, which typically plays well for Single/Music Event/Video at the ACMs. By contrast, Album of the Year is usually tougher for cross-genre entrants, making that route a long shot.\nCountervailing factors: Cross-genre entrants can face resistance from traditional voters. Post Malone’s awards track record (high nominations, few wins at major shows like the Grammys) suggests caution. The ACM field is strong with several core-country favorites who often perform well with voters. If those acts sweep, Malone could get blanked.\nWhy not higher: He is unlikely to be the clear favorite in any category except perhaps Music Event, and voter preference for established country acts could shut him out. Album seems particularly difficult.\nWhy not lower: The sheer number of bites at the apple across collaboration categories meaningfully increases the chance he picks up at least one shared win. The song’s commercial dominance is hard for voters to ignore in categories like Single/Music Event/Video.\nWhat would move me up: Credible reporting that “I Had Some Help” is the frontrunner in Music Event/Single; early off-air announcements indicating a win in Visual Media/Music Event; strong industry chatter pointing to a wave for Wallen-collaborations. What would move me down: Signals that another song is sweeping the narrative for Single/Song (e.g., Zach Bryan/Kacey Musgraves, Lainey Wilson), or leaks/early reveals showing those categories going elsewhere.\nSummary: With multiple nominations anchored by a blockbuster collaboration, a shared-category win is plausible but not assured. I put modest weight on the status quo (no win) due to cross-genre headwinds and strong competition, but the multi-category exposure keeps the overall chance slightly above even.",
