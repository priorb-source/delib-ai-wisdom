    "review": "All three forecasts cluster tightly between 25-30%, suggesting strong analytical convergence. The other forecasters emphasize several important points: (1) the maintainers' likely conservative criteria for marking something 'complete' - they probably require actual funding cessation, not just proposals or partial steps, (2) legal challenges would likely prevent even executive actions from being considered 'complete' within the timeframe, and (3) budget reconciliation, while theoretically a fast-track mechanism, still requires weeks to draft, debate, and pass. Forecaster 2's point about legal challenges delaying 'complete' status even if executive action occurs is particularly compelling - the maintainers would likely wait to see if cuts actually take effect and survive legal scrutiny. Both forecasters are slightly more bearish than my initial 30%, and their reasoning about the high bar for 'complete' status is persuasive.",
    "rationale": "Upon reflection, I'm adjusting slightly downward. The key insight from the other analyses is that the spreadsheet maintainers likely use conservative criteria for 'complete' - they would probably require not just announced policy changes but actual, implemented funding cessation. This is a higher bar than I initially weighted. Even if the administration takes executive action within 46 days, legal challenges and implementation delays would likely prevent the maintainers from marking it 'complete' before July 1st. Congressional action through normal channels remains unlikely in this timeframe, and while budget reconciliation is theoretically possible, it still requires several weeks minimum. The 'in progress' status suggests activity but also indicates we're not close to completion by the maintainers' standards. The clustering of all forecasts in the 25-30% range reinforces that this probability band is appropriate. I'm moving from 30% to 27% to reflect the stronger weight on maintainers' conservative completion criteria and the legal/implementation delay factors.",
