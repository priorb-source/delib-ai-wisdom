    "review": "Forecaster 2 adds a key datapoint I hadn’t incorporated: credible reports in early May that Circle has paused its IPO due to market volatility. That materially lowers near-term odds. Forecaster 3’s operational focus (no price range, no roadshow as of mid‑May; typical 3–6 month S‑1-to-trade cadence) is also persuasive and highlights timeline compression I underweighted. Both correctly emphasize the status quo and near-term execution milestones. They don’t address the NYSE-specific condition much; if the S‑1 names NYSE, that particular risk is small, but the pause dominates. Overall, their arguments are convincing and warrant a substantial downward update from my prior forecast.",
    "rationale": "Given reports of a pause, the base case is no listing by June 30. Even if Circle resumed quickly, they’d still need to file an amended S‑1 with a price range, launch a 1–2 week roadshow, and obtain SEC effectiveness and NYSE approval—all within ~6 weeks. That’s possible but unlikely, especially after a deliberate pause. The broader crypto backdrop and Circle’s scale keep a non‑trivial chance alive if market conditions improve abruptly and the deal was already near‑ready behind the scenes. The NYSE-specific requirement could be a risk if the exchange wasn’t specified, but if the S‑1 indeed lists NYSE (as some reports suggest), that constraint is largely mitigated. Netting these, I move down substantially from my prior 59% to reflect the pause, lack of visible progress, and compressed timeline.",
