    "review": "Both forecasters emphasize the multi‑year inadmissibility bars, the need for DHS consent or humanitarian parole, and the typical months-to-years timelines—points I largely agreed with but underweighted in my initial 10%. They also stress the constraint that a Yes requires credible public confirmation, which reduces the chance that any irregular return would resolve the question positively. The absence of signals (litigation, DHS review, or congressional pressure) is salient with only ~60 days left. I find their base-rate-heavy reasoning convincing and more consistent with the short window.",
    "rationale": "Time remaining is about two months, and the modal path to a lawful, documented return (I‑212 consent and/or humanitarian parole) rarely completes this fast absent clear government error plus strong, visible advocacy. There are no reported indicators of imminent action. The requirement for credible sources to confirm entry further suppresses the odds that an irregular return would produce a Yes. While notability can marginally raise the tail risk of expedited parole or a court-facilitated return, that tail appears small given the timeline and lack of visible movement. Accordingly, I’m updating down from 10% to 5%. I would move up if credible reporting emerges of DHS reconsideration/parole processing, a court order compelling return, or concrete congressional intervention with timelines; I would move down with explicit DHS refusals or continued silence into early June.",
