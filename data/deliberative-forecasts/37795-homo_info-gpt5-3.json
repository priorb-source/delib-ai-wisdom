    "review": "Both forecasters contributed concrete, decision-relevant details I hadn’t explicitly incorporated. Forecaster 2’s specific snapshot (COL ~8–38, .174; next-worst ~.286; -128 RD; bottom-tier across pitching and hitting) and back-of-the-envelope thresholds to flip the basement are compelling—showing that even an above-.500 short run from Colorado likely still leaves them last unless a rival collapses to an extreme degree. Forecaster 3 usefully adds prior baseline (PECOTA ~.343, back-to-back 100+ losses) and qualitative evidence (blowouts, structural pitching depth issues) indicating early results aren’t just noise.\n\nI find their core argument convincing: the current gap is unusually large for a ~25-game window, and the Rockies’ true-talent plus schedule make a swift catch-up by others unlikely. I remain a bit more conservative than F2 due to short-horizon variance, the “on or after” timing noise, and small uncertainty about how ties are treated on the standings page (though I agree ties likely count as Yes). Overall, the added evidence warrants a substantial upward revision from my prior.",
    "rationale": "Key update: The reported .112 winning-percentage gap (COL ~.174 vs next-worst ~.286) with only ~25–28 games before the check is the dominant fact. Even if Colorado plays near .450 over that stretch, their cumulative record likely remains below any team currently around .286 unless that team posts an outlier 3–22 or 4–21 type skid. Colorado’s underlying indicators (run differential, worst-in-MLB pitching and hitting metrics) and baseline projections make such a surge by COL and simultaneous collapse by a peer improbable. The managerial change and a single-player return offer limited near-term lift.\n\nResidual risks that keep me below ~90%: (1) short-term variance is large in baseball; a .500+ month from COL isn’t impossible, (2) another cellar team could suffer a severe injury wave and crater, (3) the admin may check a day after June 15, adding a bit of timing noise, and (4) small uncertainty around whether ties are counted as Yes (I assume they are, which nudges the probability up a few points). Netting these, the large current gap dominates, so I move sharply upward from my initial conservative view.",
