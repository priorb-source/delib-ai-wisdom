  "information": "The People's National Movement (PNM) is the incumbent party, having won the 2020 general election with 21 out of 41 seats. The main opposition, the United National Congress (UNC), won the remaining 19 seats. The country uses a first-past-the-post electoral system. Historically, the PNM has won the majority of general elections held since the year 2000.\n\nThe upcoming election on April 28, 2025, is an early election triggered by the resignation of former Prime Minister Keith Rowley. The PNM is now led by Prime Minister Stuart Young. Reports indicate that the opposition UNC has formed a coalition with the Congress of the People (COP). Among the issues raised during the campaign are high crime rates and concerns about electoral transparency, which prompted the presence of Commonwealth election observers. Former Attorney General John Jeremie has publicly endorsed the UNC.\n\nA poll conducted by Guardian TT between April 10-13, with research by pollster Hamid Ghany, indicated that the PNM was positioned to benefit from vote-splitting in Tobago's two key seats between the Tobago Progressive Democratic Patriots (TPP) and the Progressive Democratic Patriots (PDP), potentially allowing the PNM to win both. The same poll identified that 20% of the electorate was undecided or planning to split their vote. A separate poll by WIC News showed the UNC at 72% and the PNM at 18%.",

    "status_quo_outcome": "The incumbent People's National Movement (PNM) is the historically dominant party and won the 2020 election. The status quo outcome is the PNM winning the most seats again.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "The opposition coalition, led by the United National Congress (UNC), successfully campaigns on key issues like high crime rates, consolidates the anti-incumbent vote, and wins over a majority of undecided voters to flip several marginal seats, thereby securing a plurality.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "The incumbent PNM capitalizes on its established political machinery and a split in the opposition vote in the two Tobago constituencies between the TPP and PDP. This allows the PNM to win those key seats and retain its narrow majority, consistent with the first-past-the-post electoral system dynamics.",
    "rationale": "My forecast is based on a balance of factors pointing to a very close election, with a slight edge for the incumbent PNM. The PNM won the last election with a narrow 21-19 majority, so any small shift could change the outcome. Key factors supporting a PNM victory include incumbency advantage and, crucially, a report from a Guardian TT poll indicating that vote-splitting among opposition parties in Tobago's two seats could hand both to the PNM. This provides a clear, structural path to victory in a first-past-the-post system. However, the probability is not higher because the PNM faces significant headwinds. The main opposition UNC has formed a coalition, potentially unifying its voter base. National issues such as high crime rates and the endorsement of the UNC by a former Attorney General create a challenging environment for the incumbent. While one poll showed a massive 72% for the UNC, this appears to be a significant outlier and should be weighted lightly, especially when another poll identifies a large 20% bloc of undecided voters who will be decisive. My forecast of 55% reflects the PNM's structural advantages giving them a better-than-even chance, while acknowledging the UNC coalition has a very real path to victory. I would increase my forecast if reliable polling showed the PNM with a clear lead in marginal seats. I would decrease it if the opposition in Tobago unified behind a single candidate or if polling consistently showed the UNC-led coalition with a durable lead.",
