    "review": "Forecaster 2 adds a good point on inter-satellite links reducing dependence on in-country ground infrastructure, which weakens the logistics/ground-station concern. However, their 85% feels too high given that Starlink typically flips the map when the store, pricing, taxes, and distribution are also ready, and there’s been no signal of that yet. Forecaster 3 rightly emphasizes the 23-day post-license silence versus the DRC’s near-instant activation as negative evidence on priority/operational readiness. I agree with that as a modest down-weighting factor, though 23 days is still a short window with 55 days left. Net: F2 strengthens the technical feasibility case; F3 appropriately penalizes the current lack of movement. I find F3’s calibration closer to my prior than F2’s.",
    "rationale": "I still expect a Yes to be more likely than not before July 1 because (1) the key regulatory barrier is removed; (2) Starlink has recently demonstrated very fast activations post-license (e.g., DRC); (3) lasers mitigate any need for South African gateways; and (4) the technical/geofencing challenge is minimal for a small, discrete territory. That said, the absence of any public indicators—country pricing, reseller arrangements, type approval notices, or store enablement—three weeks after licensing is a mild negative signal on prioritization. Also, enabling “Available” usually coincides with e-commerce readiness and import/logistics, which may face frictions in a small, landlocked market, even if they can air-ship directly to Maseru. Balancing these, I trim my forecast slightly to reflect the short-term silence and small-market deprioritization while keeping it above even due to ample time remaining and recent Starlink execution speed in Africa.",
