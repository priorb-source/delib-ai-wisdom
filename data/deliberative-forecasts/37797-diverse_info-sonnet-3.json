    "review": "Both forecasters provide strong, well-reasoned analyses that largely align with my original thinking. Forecaster 2 introduces the Pakistan intelligence situation but correctly notes this would more likely lead to grey list action rather than direct black-listing. Forecaster 3 makes particularly compelling points: (1) the emphasis on the 'high bar' for black list changes is well-placed - this is FATF's most severe designation requiring active non-cooperation rather than mere deficiencies; (2) the observation that grey list countries are by definition cooperating with FATF, making escalation to the black list extremely unlikely absent complete cooperation breakdown; and (3) the research assistant's focus on grey list movements is largely irrelevant to predicting black list changes. This last point is especially strong - if anything, grey list progress indicates the system is working through normal channels rather than building toward black list escalations. The convergence around 8-12% from all three forecasters suggests we're in the right range.",
    "rationale": "After reviewing the other analyses, I find Forecaster 3's arguments most persuasive for moderating my forecast slightly downward. The 'high bar' framework is crucial - the black list is reserved for active non-cooperation, not mere deficiencies. Current black-listed countries (North Korea, Iran, Myanmar) show no signs of the dramatic institutional changes needed for removal. For additions, the Pakistan situation Forecaster 2 mentions would follow normal FATF progression through grey list first. Grey-listed countries cooperating with FATF are definitionally unlikely candidates for escalation. Russia's suspended membership remains the main tail risk, but FATF has maintained this limbo state for over two years without black-listing, suggesting strong institutional or political barriers to formalization. The February 2025 plenary maintaining status quo just 3 months ago is highly informative - insufficient time has passed for meaningful situation changes. While I maintain some probability for unexpected geopolitical events or Russia situation resolution, these tail risks are better captured at 10% rather than 12%. The evidence points strongly toward status quo for June 2025.",
