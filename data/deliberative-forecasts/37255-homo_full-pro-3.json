    "review": "The analysis from the other two forecasters strongly aligns with my own, creating a solid consensus that ratification is highly unlikely. We all identify the same three core barriers: the extremely short two-month timeframe, Libya's focus on a competing bilateral trade deal with Turkey, and the lack of urgency due to the broader slow pace of AfCFTA's implementation. The key argument that both other forecasters articulated more forcefully than I did was the crippling effect of Libya's internal political fragmentation and 'legislative paralysis.' This isn't just a matter of competing priorities, but a fundamental question of state capacity to perform a complex legislative function like treaty ratification. Their emphasis on this structural barrier was particularly convincing.",
    "rationale": "My reasoning remains largely the same, but the deliberation has strengthened my conviction and led me to refine my probability estimate. While I had initially factored in Libya's political instability, the other forecasters' focused arguments on 'legislative paralysis' and 'rival governing bodies' convinced me that I had perhaps slightly underestimated this structural barrier. The combination of an almost impossible deadline, a clear alternative policy focus (the Turkish FTA), and a dysfunctional legislature makes the path to ratification before July 1st virtually non-existent. The small probability I previously assigned to a 'symbolic' or unexpected political action now seems slightly too high. Therefore, I am lowering my forecast from 5% to 3% to better reflect the compounded difficulty of overcoming not just logistical and political hurdles, but fundamental issues of state capacity. This adjustment aligns my forecast with Forecaster 3, whose reasoning I found most compelling.",
