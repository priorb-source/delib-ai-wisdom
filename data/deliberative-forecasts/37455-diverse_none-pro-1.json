    "review": "My initial forecast of 85% was significantly higher than my colleagues' (both at 40%). Their analyses were highly convincing and highlighted critical factors I had either overlooked or under-weighted. Specifically, Forecaster 3's point about Lesotho being a landlocked enclave within South Africa—a country with its own Starlink regulatory challenges—is a crucial piece of context that introduces substantial potential for friction and delay. I had not considered this geopolitical nuance. Furthermore, both forecasters correctly emphasized the significance of the ~3-week lag that has already occurred since the license was granted. My initial model treated the license as a trigger for immediate action, but as they point out, this delay is evidence that other operational steps are still required. Their more disciplined application of status quo bias on a short timeline is also a key insight. Their reasoning has persuaded me that my initial forecast was overly optimistic.",
    "rationale": "I am substantially revising my forecast downwards from 85% to 40%. My initial analysis was too heavily weighted on the positive signal of the license grant and failed to adequately account for implementation friction and specific regional context.\n\nThe arguments from the other forecasters convinced me of three key points:\n\n1.  **Geopolitical Complications:** The fact that Lesotho is an enclave within South Africa, a country where Starlink has faced significant regulatory hurdles, is a major potential complication I had missed. This could add delays related to hardware importation, service geofencing, and political sensitivities that are not present in other countries.\n\n2.  **The Evidentiary Value of Inaction:** Over three weeks have passed since the license was granted with no public change to Starlink's map or any announcements. This is not just a lack of information; it is a signal that the license was not the final step and that other operational requirements (e.g., hardware type approval, payment gateway setup, logistics) are still pending. This makes a launch within the remaining ~54 days less certain.\n\n3.  **Historical Precedent and Status Quo:** As my colleagues noted, the time from license grant to service activation for Starlink varies globally. A timeline of \"several weeks to a few months\" is common. With less than two months remaining, the deadline falls squarely within this uncertain period. The status quo ('No availability') is a strong prior on such a short timeline, and the path to 'Yes' requires a smooth and rapid execution of the remaining steps, which is now less certain given the points above.\n\nTherefore, a 'No' outcome is more likely than a 'Yes'. A 40% probability correctly reflects that while the license makes a launch possible, the combination of a tight deadline, existing inaction, and unique regional complexities makes it more probable that the activation will slip past July 1, 2025.",
