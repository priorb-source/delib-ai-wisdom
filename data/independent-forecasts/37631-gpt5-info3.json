  "information": "On May 12, 2025, the U.S. and China announced a trade deal to temporarily reduce tariffs, with U.S. tariffs on Chinese goods decreasing to 30% from 145% and Chinese tariffs on U.S. goods falling to 10% from 125%. The agreement spurred a market rally, with the S&P 500 rising 3% and the Nasdaq gaining over 4%. This development is considered beneficial for retailers like Walmart, which have significant supply chain operations in China. Key economic reports, including the Consumer Price Index (CPI) for April, are scheduled for release.",

    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "45 days (through market close on 2025-06-27)",
    "status_quo_outcome": "Yes — Walmart is modestly ahead of Tesla in market cap in mid-May 2025 on CompaniesMarketCap, so if nothing changed, Walmart would remain higher.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Risk-on continues and Tesla outperforms: improving macro data (benign CPI/PPI), easing financial conditions, or an upside TSLA catalyst (FSD/AI progress, margin surprises, China demand stabilization) drives a 10–25% relative rebound in Tesla, while Walmart is flat-to-up modestly, leaving Tesla above Walmart by June 27.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Defensive/retail tilt holds: Walmart posts solid earnings/guidance and benefits from tariff de-escalation on Chinese goods (input costs), while Tesla stays rangebound or drifts on weak deliveries/margin concerns and competitive EV pressures, keeping Walmart’s market cap above Tesla at the close on June 27.",
    "rationale": "- Baseline/status quo: As of mid-May 2025, Walmart appears slightly ahead of Tesla in market cap. Good forecasting gives extra weight to the present ordering because large relative reversals are less common over short windows, though possible.\n- Relative volatility: Over a 6–7 week horizon, Tesla’s high beta and news sensitivity make a flip plausible. A 10–20% swing in Tesla over a month-plus is common historically; Walmart’s typical move range is narrower (~3–8%). If Walmart leads by only a single-digit percent, Tesla needs only modest outperformance to retake the lead.\n- Catalysts before 2025-06-27:\n  • Walmart: Near-term earnings/guidance (mid-May) and any read-through from tariff de-escalation that could ease cost of goods should support shares but usually with single-digit impact.\n  • Tesla: Macro (CPI/retail sales, rates), China demand signals, autonomy/FSD headlines, or positioning squeezes could drive double-digit moves even absent earnings. Q2 deliveries print after June 27, but anticipation/whispers can move the stock beforehand.\n- Macro backdrop: The research assistant notes a U.S.–China tariff thaw and an ensuing market rally (S&P +3%, Nasdaq +4%). This is a relative positive for Walmart through supply chain cost relief, but risk-on typically lifts high-beta names like Tesla more on a percentage basis. Net-net, the macro shift slightly favors a No outcome unless Walmart’s cost/margin benefit is quickly recognized.\n- Why not higher: Tesla’s upside tail is fatter over short horizons; one or two strong sessions can erase Walmart’s current lead. Broad risk-on or AI/FSD narratives could swing sentiment quickly.\n- Why not lower: The existing Walmart lead, ongoing consumer resilience, and tariff de-escalation are legitimate supports. If Tesla sentiment remains cautious (competition from Chinese EVs, margin compression, autonomy commercialization timing), Walmart can stay ahead.\n- What would change my view:\n  • Up (toward Yes): Walmart beats and raises guidance; evidence tariff relief flows to margins; risk-off returns; negative Tesla news (pricing pressure, regulatory, China softness) keeps TSLA subdued.\n  • Down (toward No): Strong disinflation print and dovish Fed signaling that turbocharges high beta; credible Tesla autonomy/AI partnership or feature rollout; indications of improving Tesla demand/margins; broad tech momentum.\nOverall, with Walmart likely slightly ahead now but Tesla having higher short-term upside volatility, I lean slightly below even odds for Walmart finishing higher on June 27.",
