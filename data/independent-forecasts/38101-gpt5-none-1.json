    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "About 32 days (from May 30, 2025 to July 1, 2025)",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No — recent 2025 Morning Consult trendlines have Shiguru Ishiba’s approval modestly above Keir Starmer’s; ties also resolve as No.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Ishiba’s approval remains a few points higher than Starmer’s into the end of June (or they tie), consistent with slow-moving leader approval and the incumbent-honeymoon advantage persisting in Japan.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Starmer gains a few points and/or Ishiba loses a few points before the July reading (e.g., favorable UK economic/news cycle or an adverse Japan news cycle/scandal), flipping the ordering so that Starmer’s approval exceeds Ishiba’s.",
    "rationale": "- Baseline/trend: Morning Consult’s cross-country leader approvals in early 2025 have generally shown Ishiba, as a relatively new Japanese PM, enjoying a modest honeymoon level that is at least comparable to and likely a bit higher than Starmer’s. Starmer’s approval has been respectable but not dominant by international standards. Given that Metaculus will check the Morning Consult tracker on or after July 1 and the series is a 7-day SMA, large late shifts are less likely to change the ordering.\n- Dynamics and base rates: Leader approvals tend to move slowly month-to-month absent major shocks. New Japanese PMs often start higher and drift down over time; UK PM approvals under Morning Consult typically sit in the 30s. A 1–4 point move over the next month is plausible, but a larger swing would be less common.\n- Tie rule: Because ties resolve as No, the threshold for a Yes outcome is slightly harder to clear, nudging probability toward No.\n- Evidence weighting: With limited time remaining and no strong signal of a reversal, the status quo (Ishiba ≥ Starmer) deserves extra weight.\n- Research assistant input: No additional info provided; forecast relies on Morning Consult’s typical historical patterns and the likely 2025 snapshot ordering.\n- Why not higher (for Yes)? Time is short, approvals are sticky, Ishiba’s honeymoon advantage may still be intact, and the tie-as-No rule adds headwind.\n- Why not lower? It’s feasible that Ishiba’s approval dips faster (e.g., policy stumble or scandal) or Starmer benefits from positive UK developments, and only a modest margin likely separates them. A small swing could flip the ordering.\n- What would move me: I’d raise the Yes probability if the June Morning Consult update shows the gap narrowing to within ~1–2 points or Starmer already ahead; I’d lower it if Ishiba maintains a clear multi-point lead into late June or if UK news flow turns decisively negative while Japan remains stable.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer have a higher approval rating than Japanese Prime Minister Shiguru Ishiba on July 1, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nResolution source updates monthly. According to Morning Consult for January 2025: \"The latest approval ratings are based on data collected from Jan. 21-27, 2025. Ratings reflect a trailing seven-day simple moving average of views among adults in each country surveyed.\"\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if Keir Starmer has a higher approval rating than Shiguru Ishiba according to [Morning Consult](https://pro.morningconsult.com/trackers/global-leader-approval) when checked by Metaculus on or after July 1, 2025. If this not the case (including due to a tie), this resolves as **No**.\n\n\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nNo additional information available.\n\nToday is 2025-05-30.\n\nBefore answering you think:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n(e) You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
