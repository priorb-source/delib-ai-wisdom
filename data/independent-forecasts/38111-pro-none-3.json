    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "1 month",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "The diplomatic momentum from the May 2025 recognitions by Spain, Ireland, and Norway slows. Potential recognizers like France and the UK proceed with internal deliberations and alliance-building, but this process extends beyond June. No country makes a formal announcement during the month.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Driven by the French initiative and the recent wave of recognitions, another European nation, such as Belgium, Malta or Slovenia, formally announces its recognition of Palestine in June 2025 to maintain pressure for a two-state solution.",
    "rationale": "The forecast is based on the significant diplomatic momentum generated in May 2025 by the recognition of Palestine by Spain, Ireland, and Norway. The background information indicating that the UK has joined a French initiative for recognition is a powerful signal that major European powers are considering this step. This creates a favorable environment and a potential 'cascade effect' where other countries feel emboldened to act. A 'Yes' outcome is plausible within the short one-month timeframe if a smaller, like-minded country decides to act quickly to capitalize on the current momentum. However, my forecast is not higher than 45% because major diplomatic shifts, especially those involving G7 nations like France and the UK, typically require extensive coordination that can easily take longer than one month. Diplomatic pushback from the United States and Israel could also cause delays. The status quo, where no new recognition occurs in any given month, remains a strong possibility. The world of diplomacy often moves slower than headlines suggest. My forecast would increase with specific statements from foreign ministries indicating an announcement is 'imminent' or planned for June. Conversely, it would decrease if these initiatives are framed with a longer timeline ('in the coming months') or if significant international focus shifts elsewhere.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill a UN member country newly recognize Palestine in June 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\n[UK joins France's initiative for recognition of Palestinian state](https://www.lemonde.fr/en/international/article/2025/05/20/uk-joins-france-s-initiative-for-recognition-of-palestinian-state_6741456_4.html)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if after May 31, 2025 and before July 1, 2025, a UN member country announces that it recognizes Palestine as a sovereign nation. Resolves based on Al Jazeera's [tracking page](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/4/10/mapping-which-countries-recognise-palestine-in-2025) or other credible sources should the tracking page not be timely updated.\n\n\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nNo additional information available.\n\nToday is 2025-05-31.\n\nBefore answering you think:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n(e) You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
