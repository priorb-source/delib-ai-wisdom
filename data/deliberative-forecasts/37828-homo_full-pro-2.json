    "review": "My review of the other forecasters' analyses reveals a strong consensus on the core drivers of this forecast. All three of us identified the same critical pieces of evidence: 1) The direct and recent statements from Rippling's CEO explicitly denying any imminent IPO plans, 2) The massive $450 million Series G funding round in May 2025, which obviates the short-term need for public capital, and 3) The establishment of a tender offer and future secondary liquidity programs, which addresses a key pressure point for going public. The reasoning across all analyses is highly convincing and aligns with my own. The only difference is a minor one of degree, with Forecaster 3 assigning a slightly lower probability (3%) than my and Forecaster 2's initial 5%. Forecaster 3's analysis did not introduce new evidence but their slightly more confident stance in the 'No' outcome prompted me to re-evaluate the weight I assigned to the low-probability 'Yes' scenarios.",
    "rationale": "My initial forecast of 5% was based on the overwhelming evidence against an IPO announcement in the next five weeks, primarily the CEO's very recent public statements, the new funding round, and the alternative liquidity options. After reviewing the other forecasts, my conviction in this reasoning is reinforced. However, Forecaster 3's slightly lower probability of 3% made a compelling point implicitly: the confluence of these three major factors makes the likelihood of a reversal extremely small. The practical hurdles of preparing and filing an S-1 or a formal website announcement in less than 40 days, directly after the CEO stated the opposite and the company secured private funding, are immense. It would require a pre-existing, secret IPO process that runs counter to all available evidence. While I initially assigned a 5% chance to account for potential strategic misdirection or a sudden market shift, I now believe that was slightly too high. The evidence for 'No' is simply too strong and consistent. Therefore, I am lowering my forecast slightly from 5% to 4%. This revised forecast reflects a slightly higher degree of confidence in the status quo, while still acknowledging that a surprise event is not a zero-probability outcome.",
