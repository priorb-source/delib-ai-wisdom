    "review": "The other forecasters introduced two decisive pieces of evidence that I had not considered. Forecaster 2 noted that the President's Office had explicitly denied reports of a planned election, directly contradicting the intelligence from the research assistant's report that had informed my initial forecast. Most importantly, Forecaster 3 provided critical new information: the Verkhovna Rada has already extended martial law until August 6, 2025, a date beyond this question's resolution deadline of July 1. This recent legislative action makes an imminent election announcement legally and politically incoherent. Their reasoning is highly convincing as it is based on recent, concrete government actions, whereas my initial forecast was based on reports of political maneuvering which have now been contradicted or rendered moot.",
    "rationale": "I am significantly updating my forecast downward from 35% to 5%. My initial forecast was based on the premise that an announcement could be a low-cost political tool for President Zelensky to signal democratic commitment, as suggested by the reports from Poroshenko and The Economist. However, the new evidence presented by my fellow forecasters fundamentally alters the landscape. The extension of martial law beyond the July 1 resolution date is the single most important factor. It represents a a clear, official, and very recent government action that reinforces the legal prohibition on elections. Announcing an election date in the next six weeks would directly contradict a law just passed, creating a confusing and politically damaging signal. This, combined with the explicit denial from the President's Office, makes the likelihood of an announcement before July 1 plummet. The status quo is not just inertia; it has been actively reinforced. My forecast remains slightly above the absolute lowest estimates to account for the small but non-zero possibility of a 'black swan' event, such as a sudden and unexpected peace agreement, but the path to a 'Yes' resolution is now almost entirely blocked.",
