    "review": "The deliberation phase reveals a strong consensus among all three forecasters, with each independently arriving at a 1% probability. Our core reasoning is identical: the ongoing civil war in Sudan has paralyzed state functions, making the ratification of an international treaty before the July 1, 2025 deadline a practical impossibility. \n\nForecaster 2 introduced two excellent and highly specific arguments that I had not explicitly considered: 1) the complete absence of a functioning legislative body in Sudan, and 2) Sudan's current suspension from the African Union (AU), which is the depository for AfCFTA ratification. These are not just general obstacles; they are concrete institutional and procedural barriers that make a 'Yes' outcome even less plausible. I find this reasoning extremely convincing as it adds a formal, legalistic layer of difficulty on top of the kinetic, political reality of the war. Forecaster 3's analysis strongly mirrored my own, reinforcing the view that the humanitarian and political crisis is the overwhelming factor.\n\nOverall, the arguments from the other forecasters did not challenge my forecast but rather solidified the conviction behind it.",
    "rationale": "I am maintaining my forecast of 1%. My initial analysis was driven by the overwhelming reality of Sudan's civil war, which has brought normal governance to a halt. The deliberation with my colleagues has only strengthened this conclusion. \n\nThe new evidence raised by Forecaster 2—the lack of a functioning parliament and Sudan's suspension from the African Union—adds critical institutional and procedural barriers to the list of reasons why ratification is exceptionally unlikely. Ratification is a formal legislative act, and without a legislature, the mechanism for it does not exist. Furthermore, it is highly improbable that the AU Commission would accept an instrument of ratification from a suspended member state whose government lacks unified, legitimate control over its territory. \n\nThese factors, combined with the extreme time pressure (less than one month remaining) and the fact that the government's entire focus is on the conflict, create an almost insurmountable set of obstacles. While I maintain a 1% probability to account for a 'black swan' event like a sudden, unexpected peace accord and a concerted push for international legitimacy, the arguments presented in deliberation have confirmed that this is a near-zero probability event. My forecast does not change because it was already at a floor, but my confidence in it has increased.",
