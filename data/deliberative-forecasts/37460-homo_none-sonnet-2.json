    "review": "Forecaster 2 and I diverge significantly (65% vs 35%), while Forecaster 3 aligns with my initial assessment. The key disagreement centers on how much weight to place on the Wikipedia article's existence. Forecaster 2 makes a compelling argument that Wikipedia articles about ongoing protest movements signal significant, well-documented events, pushing them above 50%. This is a stronger interpretation than I initially considered. However, I'm skeptical of reaching 65% for several reasons: (1) The Wikipedia article's existence doesn't confirm protests met the 10,000+ threshold; (2) We lack information about when these protests occurred relative to the question launch date; (3) The complete absence of information from my research assistant is itself meaningful - if there were clear, ongoing large-scale protests, we'd expect SOME concrete details; (4) The resolution requires BOTH reaching 10,000+ participants AND being documented by the Global Protest Tracker with accurate counts, creating multiple failure points. Forecaster 2's interpretation that the Wikipedia article indicates current large-scale activity is logical but potentially overconfident given our information gaps.",
    "rationale": "After deliberation, I believe the Wikipedia article is stronger evidence than I initially weighted - it does suggest significant 2025 protest activity in Turkey. However, I maintain that multiple uncertainties prevent reaching 65% confidence: the temporal ambiguity (when did protests occur vs when did the question launch?), the threshold requirement (10,000+ is substantial), the Global Protest Tracker coverage question, and critically, the complete absence of additional information from my research assistant. If qualifying protests were clearly occurring, we'd expect at least some supporting details. The Wikipedia signal suggests probability above my initial 35%, but the information gaps and multiple resolution criteria hurdles suggest staying well below 65%. I'm updating modestly upward to account for underweighting the Wikipedia signal, while maintaining skepticism about overconfident interpretations of limited evidence.",
