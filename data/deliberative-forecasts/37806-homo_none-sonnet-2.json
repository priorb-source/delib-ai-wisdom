    "review": "The other forecasters provide nearly identical analyses and arrive at remarkably similar forecasts (30% and 32%). They raise one crucial piece of information I should have emphasized more: Trump has been in office for approximately 4 months already (since January 20, 2025), which strengthens the status quo argument considerably. If the Diversity Visa program were a top priority for presidential action, we might have expected movement already. Both forecasters also correctly emphasize the very specific resolution criteria requiring the exact phrase 'Diversity Visa' in a formal presidential action, not just immigration policy broadly. Their reasoning about competing priorities (border security, enforcement, deportations) aligning with Trump's focus is sound. The convergence around 30-32% across all three independent analyses suggests this range is well-calibrated. I find no significant flaws in their logic, and their emphasis on the 4-month status quo is particularly compelling evidence I should weight more heavily.",
    "rationale": "After reviewing the other forecasters' analyses, I'm maintaining my forecast at 30%. The key insight from the deliberation is that Trump has been in office for 4 months without issuing such an action, which is stronger status quo evidence than I initially articulated. However, I had already incorporated this general consideration (lack of evidence, competing priorities, short remaining timeframe) into my original 30% forecast. The 42 days remaining still provides sufficient time for a presidential action if it becomes a priority - Trump has shown he can move quickly on immigration issues. The requirements remain very specific (exact phrase 'Diversity Visa' in a formal presidential action), which constrains the probability. The convergence of all three forecasts in the 30-32% range, arrived at through similar reasoning about Trump's historical opposition balanced against status quo momentum and lack of current evidence, suggests this is an appropriate calibration. No new arguments or evidence emerged that would justify a significant update from my initial assessment.",
