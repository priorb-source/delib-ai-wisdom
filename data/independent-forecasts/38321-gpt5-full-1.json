  "information": "According to multiple news reports from early June 2025, the White House has officially confirmed that US President Donald Trump will attend the NATO summit in The Hague. White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt stated, 'I can confirm that Trump will attend the NATO summit.' This confirmation was also echoed by officials from allied nations. Dutch Prime Minister Dik Scoh announced Trump's intention to attend following a phone call between the two leaders. Similarly, Polish Foreign Minister Radoslaw Sikorski stated that Trump had reaffirmed his commitment to the alliance and would be present at the summit.\n\nA primary focus of the summit will be defense spending among NATO members. President Trump has been advocating for member countries to increase their defense spending to 5% of their GDP, a significant increase from the current 2% target. In response to this pressure, NATO Secretary-General Mark Rutte (or Jens Stoltenberg, sources vary) has reportedly proposed a compromise deal: a target of 3.5% of GDP on direct defense spending by 2032, with an additional 1.5% allocated for broader security-related expenditures. The discussions will also address military aid to Ukraine, and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky is expected to attend.\n\nThe NATO summit is scheduled to take place from June 24 to June 26, 2025, at the World Forum in The Hague, Netherlands. This will be the first time the Netherlands has hosted a NATO summit. Over 6,000 delegates and 2,000 journalists from 32 NATO member countries and partner nations are expected to be in attendance. President Trump's schedule for June 2025 also includes other high-profile international travel, such as his attendance at the G7 leaders' summit in Kananaskis, Canada, from June 15 to 17.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "~20–22 days (the summit is June 24–26, 2025; a definitive Yes would likely be known on June 24 when leaders convene)",
    "status_quo_outcome": "Yes — Trump attends in person as officially confirmed by the White House and allied officials, consistent with typical U.S. presidential participation in NATO summits.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "A late cancellation or downgrade: a domestic crisis, health issue, or urgent international event keeps him in Washington; he chooses to send the Vice President or Secretary of State instead; or he travels to the Netherlands but avoids any session where other leaders are physically co-present, failing the “in person” criterion.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "He follows the current plan, travels to The Hague, and participates in at least one leaders’ session or group event at the summit venue (e.g., opening session or group photo), meeting the in-person definition.",
    "rationale": "Evidence points strongly toward attendance. According to the research assistant, the White House Press Secretary has publicly confirmed Trump will attend the NATO summit in The Hague, an intention echoed by allied officials (e.g., Dutch PM announcing after a call; Poland’s FM stating Trump reaffirmed commitment and would be present). The summit is June 24–26, 2025. The agenda reportedly centers on allied defense spending and Ukraine—topics Trump is highly invested in, giving him strong incentive to appear and press his case directly. U.S. presidents almost always attend NATO summits, and Trump himself attended NATO leaders’ meetings during his previous term. With less than three weeks to go and an official confirmation in hand, the status quo strongly favors attendance. Reasons the probability isn’t higher than the high 80s include: (1) Trump’s known proclivity for abrupt schedule changes; (2) non-trivial but low short-horizon risks such as health issues, domestic crises, or security concerns; (3) the possibility of using a non-attendance or a shortened presence as leverage, though current signaling suggests engagement rather than boycott. Reasons it isn’t lower: (1) public, on-the-record confirmation from the White House and allies; (2) institutional norm of presidential attendance; (3) Trump’s substantive incentives to attend to advocate for higher allied spending; (4) short time to event reduces uncertainty. Upward updates: firmed logistics (e.g., USSS pre-positioning reports, NATO protocol schedules listing POTUS in plenaries, pool reports of wheels up to Europe), and multiple allied schedules synchronizing around his participation. Downward updates: credible reporting of a domestic or international crisis, health concerns, legal/scheduling constraints, or a public reversal indicating he will send a surrogate or limit his presence such that he avoids any co-present leaders’ session.",

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
