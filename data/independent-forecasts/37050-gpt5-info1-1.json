  "information": "Historical changes to the Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA) are infrequent. In February 2024, Intel and Walgreens were replaced. In August 2020, Exxon Mobil, Pfizer, and Raytheon Technologies were replaced by Salesforce, Amgen, and Honeywell. In June 2018, General Electric was replaced by Walgreens Boots Alliance, and in March 2015, AT&T was replaced by Apple.",

    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "About 67 days (until July 1, 2025)",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No change; all 30 companies listed remain in the DJIA through July 1, 2025",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "No official S&P Dow Jones Indices announcement (or credible reporting) of a removal occurs before July 1, 2025; corporate actions among constituents remain routine and do not force an index change.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "The S&P DJI Index Committee announces a lineup change before July 1, 2025—e.g., swapping out a lagging or less-representative member such as Verizon, 3M, Boeing, or Disney to rebalance sector representation or respond to a major corporate action, potentially to add a name like Alphabet, Meta, Eli Lilly, or another large, thematically relevant firm.",
    "rationale": "- Base rates and timing: Dow changes are infrequent. The most recent were February 2024 (two removals) and before that August 2020 (three). With only ~2 months left, base-rate odds of an additional change before July 1 are low.\n- Status quo weight: Committees usually avoid rapid, repeated reshuffles. After two 2024 removals (Intel and Walgreens), the bar for another quick change is higher absent a trigger (major corporate action, sector-representation gap, or extreme price dynamics).\n- Triggers that could move this to Yes: (1) A large, surprising corporate action among constituents (e.g., merger, breakup, bankruptcy risk) prompting immediate substitution; (2) A significant stock split or outsized price move that distorts the price-weighted balance; (3) A strategic desire to add a currently excluded megacap (e.g., Alphabet or Meta) that would likely entail removing a current member—candidates often speculated include Verizon (telecom exposure), 3M (shrunk post-spinoff), Boeing (if crisis deepens), or Disney (if strategic repositioning accelerates). None of these triggers are presently confirmed.\n- Why not higher: No credible reporting suggests an imminent change; recent 2024 updates reduce urgency; sector coverage is broadly adequate; no known pending corporate actions among constituents that would compel removal on a short fuse.\n- Why not lower: The committee can announce changes without much notice; price-weighted structure can prompt opportunistic tweaks; ongoing issues at a few constituents (e.g., Boeing’s continued operational challenges, 3M’s reduced profile, Verizon’s low price/sector overlap) provide plausible, if low-probability, removal paths.\n- What would change my view: Credible media reports or an S&P DJI press release signalling a review; a major corporate action (spin, merger, distress) by any constituent; announcement of a large stock split by a high-price member that creates imbalance; sharp sector reclassification needs.\n- Summary of assistant’s historical context: Changes are sporadic—Feb 2024 (Intel, Walgreens out), Aug 2020 (Exxon, Pfizer, Raytheon out), Jun 2018 (GE out), Mar 2015 (AT&T out for Apple)—supporting a low short-term probability absent triggers.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill any of these companies get dropped from the Dow Jones Industrial Average before July 1, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nOregon Business: [Intel Ousted From Dow Jones By Rival Nvidia](https://oregonbusiness.com/intel-ousted-from-dow-jones-by-rival-nvidia/)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if before July 1, 2025, there is any official announcement or confirmation (or credible source reporting) that any of the following companies will no longer be a component of the Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA) either on the official announcement or that the company has been or will be removed from the index: Amazon.com Inc, American Express Co, Amgen Inc, Apple Inc, Boeing Co, Caterpillar Inc, Cisco Systems Inc, Chevron Corp, Goldman Sachs Group Inc, Home Depot Inc, Honeywell International Inc, International Business Machines Corp, Johnson & Johnson, Coca-Cola Co, JPMorgan Chase & Co, McDonald’s Corp, 3M Co, Merck & Co Inc, Microsoft Corp, Nike Inc, Procter & Gamble Co, Sherwin-Williams Co, Travelers Companies Inc, Unitedhealth Group Inc, Salesforce Inc, NVIDIA Corp, Verizon Communications Inc, Visa Inc, Walmart Inc, Walt Disney Co.\n\nAlthough removals from the index are generally effective immediately in order to forestall frontrunning, this is not a requirement for this question. All that is required is for there to be an announcement or confirmation before the resolution date about the removal from the DJIA at any point in time. Therefore this question will resolve based on the announcement or confirmation, not on the actual removal date.\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nHistorical changes to the Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA) are infrequent. In February 2024, Intel and Walgreens were replaced. In August 2020, Exxon Mobil, Pfizer, and Raytheon Technologies were replaced by Salesforce, Amgen, and Honeywell. In June 2018, General Electric was replaced by Walgreens Boots Alliance, and in March 2015, AT&T was replaced by Apple.\n\nToday is 2025-04-25.\n\nBefore answering you think:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n(e) You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
