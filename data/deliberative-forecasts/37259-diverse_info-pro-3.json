    "review": "My initial forecast of 15% was the highest of the group, based on the idea that high public support for independence could lead to a low-cost, symbolic announcement of a future referendum date. However, the other two forecasters presented compelling, specific evidence that I had underweighted. Forecaster 2's points on the contentious and delayed constitutional drafting process and the historical precedent of long lead times for major referendums were very persuasive. A referendum announcement would be putting the cart before the horse. Forecaster 3 provided perhaps the most crucial pieces of evidence: that the official independence commission has a 'multi-year mandate,' which strongly signals no action is imminent, and that the more pro-independence Naleraq party is in opposition, meaning the gradualist government has little incentive to appease them with a hasty announcement. Both analyses effectively dismantled my primary rationale for a probability above 10%.",
    "rationale": "After reviewing my peers' analyses, I am significantly lowering my forecast. My initial 15% probability placed too much weight on the possibility of a symbolic political gesture. The specific evidence provided by the other forecasters makes such a gesture highly improbable. The three key points that swayed my decision are: 1) The official independence commission is operating on a 'multi-year mandate,' which directly contradicts the notion of an announcement within the next two months. 2) The separate, but related, constitutional drafting process is delayed and contentious, indicating that the foundational work necessary before a referendum announcement is not complete. 3) The political dynamics—with the gradualist party in power and the more radical pro-independence party in opposition—reduce the incentive for the government to make a sudden move. Why would they hand a political victory to their opposition? The combination of this procedural, structural, and political evidence overwhelmingly points towards the status quo prevailing. The extremely short timeframe to the resolution date is the final, decisive factor. I am reducing my forecast from 15% down to 6%, which acknowledges the minuscule chance of a black swan political event but reflects the powerful evidence that no announcement is planned or procedurally feasible in the given timeframe.",
