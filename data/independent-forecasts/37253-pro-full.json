  "information": "North Korea has conducted six nuclear tests, with the last one occurring in September 2017. The current gap of over seven and a half years is the longest interval between tests. According to South Korea's National Intelligence Service (NIS), the tunnels at the Punggye-ri test site are maintained in an operational condition. The U.S. State Department also assesses that the site remains capable of supporting a seventh test. The IAEA has warned about an 'exponential' expansion of North Korea's nuclear program and ongoing plutonium production at the Yongbyon facility. However, analysis of satellite imagery by the think tank 38 North shows no new tunneling activity at Punggye-ri, and there are no public reports of specific preparations such as equipment movement or other logistical arrangements that would typically precede a test.\n\nIn late April 2025, North Korea conducted the first weapons system tests for its new 5,000-ton 'Choe Hyon-class' destroyer. The tests, observed by leader Kim Jong Un, included the launch of supersonic cruise missiles, strategic cruise missiles, and anti-aircraft missiles. The warship is expected to be delivered to the navy and enter service in early 2026. Earlier in 2025, North Korea conducted several other weapons tests. In April, it tested the 'Haeil-2' underwater attack drone. In February, it test-launched strategic cruise missiles. In January, it conducted its first missile test of the year, firing an intermediate-range ballistic missile with a hypersonic glide vehicle.\n\nNorth Korean leader Kim Jong Un has repeatedly called for strengthening the country's strategic forces. Following the destroyer weapon tests in April 2025, he stated, 'The time has come for North Korea's navy to choose to accelerate nuclear armament.' In January 2025, he said the country's nuclear weapons development program would continue 'indefinitely.' In February 2025, the US, South Korea, and Japan issued a joint statement confirming their trilateral partnership and calling for North Korea's complete nuclear disarmament, pledging to strengthen sanctions enforcement. The European Union condemned North Korea's ballistic missile launch in January 2025, calling it a violation of UN Security Council resolutions.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "2 months",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "North Korea continues its current strategy of rhetorical threats and testing of non-nuclear delivery systems, such as cruise and ballistic missiles. The leadership does not see a compelling strategic need for a nuclear test within the next two months, and no immediate preparations are made at the Punggye-ri test site, thus maintaining the testing moratorium that has been in place since 2017.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "In response to a perceived provocation, such as a large-scale US-South Korea military drill, or to achieve a technical milestone, such as demonstrating a miniaturized warhead for its new tactical weapons, Kim Jong Un orders a surprise nuclear test. Preparations are conducted rapidly and with a high degree of secrecy, leveraging the readiness of the Punggye-ri test site.",
    "rationale": "My forecast is based on the short two-month timeframe and the lack of immediate, observable indicators for a nuclear test. The strongest evidence supporting a 'No' outcome is the status quo itself: North Korea has not conducted a nuclear test for over seven and a half years, the longest pause in its history. Furthermore, despite the Punggye-ri test site being maintained in an operational state, independent analysis from 38 North shows no new tunneling or logistical preparations typical of an impending test. While Pyongyang has been active in testing various missile systems and its rhetoric remains aggressive—with Kim Jong Un calling for the navy to 'accelerate nuclear armament'—this activity appears focused on diversifying its delivery systems rather than demonstrating new nuclear capabilities in the immediate term. \n\nMy probability is not lower than 15% because North Korea is an unpredictable state and retains the technical capability to conduct a test on relatively short notice. A political decision, driven by domestic or international factors, could override the current pattern of behavior. Kim Jong Un's consistent pro-nuclear statements confirm the long-term intent remains, making a test a persistent possibility. \n\nMy probability is not higher because of the absence of short-term warning signs. A forecast above 20% would require tangible evidence of preparations, such as satellite imagery showing equipment and personnel movement at the test site or specific intelligence indicating a political decision to proceed. For me to update my forecast higher, such evidence would need to emerge. For my forecast to decrease, a significant de-escalation or diplomatic engagement, which is currently unlikely, would be required, or simply the passage of time toward the deadline without any preparatory signals.",
