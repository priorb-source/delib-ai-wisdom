    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Less than 2 months (approximately 54 days until July 1, 2025)",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No - WorldAtlas.com continues to display the body of water as the Gulf of Mexico on their North America page",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "WorldAtlas.com maintains their traditional naming convention, displaying only 'Gulf of Mexico' on the North America page, treating the political renaming effort as unrecognized by international geographic standards and choosing not to update their reference materials based on a unilateral governmental declaration",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "WorldAtlas.com updates their North America page to reflect the recent US political development, either adopting 'Gulf of America' as the primary name or displaying it alongside 'Gulf of Mexico' with appropriate context (such as 'Gulf of America formerly known as Gulf of Mexico'), recognizing the local US naming preference while maintaining their reference value",
    "rationale": "This question relates to the January 2025 executive order by President Trump attempting to rename the Gulf of Mexico. The key evidence is that WorldAtlas.com's article title already includes '(Gulf of America)' in parentheses, indicating awareness of the naming issue. However, the resolution criteria specifically require the North America page to display this name, not just an article title. Geographic reference websites like WorldAtlas typically exhibit strong conservatism regarding political name changes, especially controversial ones lacking international recognition. They generally wait for broad consensus before updating established geographic names. The short timeframe (under 2 months) works both ways: it limits time for adoption but also means any planned changes would occur soon. Status quo bias strongly favors maintaining 'Gulf of Mexico' since: (1) it's the internationally recognized name, (2) many countries and organizations have rejected the rename, (3) reference sites prioritize stability and accuracy over political preferences. The parenthetical mention in the article suggests acknowledgment but not necessarily intent to change primary displays. For me to update higher, I would need evidence that WorldAtlas has announced or begun implementing the name change. To update lower, clear statements from WorldAtlas about maintaining traditional geographic names would be decisive. My forecast balances the slight evidence of awareness against strong institutional conservatism of reference websites.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill WorldAtlas.com display the body of water northwest of the Caribbean Sea as the Gulf of America before July 1, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nWorld Atlas article: [Gulf Of Mexico (Gulf of America)](https://www.worldatlas.com/gulfs/gulf-of-mexico.html)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if, before July 1, 2025, the World Atlas website at its [North America](https://www.worldatlas.com/webimage/countrys/na.htm) page displays the body of water west of Florida, south of Louisiana and north of the Yucatán Peninsula as the Gulf of America. (At the time of this question, the name displayed is the Gulf of Mexico.)\n\nIn case both names are used, for example \"Gulf of America formerly known as Gulf of Mexico,\" this question resolves as Yes. Note that verification will be from Metaculus admins accessing the webpage from the United States and that therefore resolution will be based on how the page appears when accessed from that location.\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nNo additional information available.\n\nToday is 2025-05-08.\n\nBefore answering you think:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n(e) You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
