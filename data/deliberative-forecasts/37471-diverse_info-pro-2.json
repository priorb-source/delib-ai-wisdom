    "review": "My initial forecast of 55% was far too high. The other two forecasters presented crucial evidence I had overlooked. Forecaster 3's use of the just-released March 2025 FRED data (503k) was the most critical new fact. It revealed that inventory grew by only 3k from February to March, making my assumption of a rapid 50k pile-up in three months untenable. It also reframed the problem: an increase of over 47k is needed in just two months (April and May). Forecaster 2's analysis of leading indicators was also highly convincing. I had not considered the sharp decline in March housing starts (-14.2%) and single-family permits, nor the pessimistic NAHB builder confidence index. These data points show that builders are actively throttling new supply, which directly counters the mechanism for a rapid inventory surge. Both forecasters correctly contextualized the 550k threshold as a historically extreme level, only seen during the 2006-2007 housing bubble, an important base-rate consideration I did not sufficiently weigh.",
    "rationale": "I am drastically revising my forecast downward from 55% to 5%. The deliberation process revealed fatal flaws in my initial reasoning. My analysis was too focused on the demand-side pressure from rising mortgage rates and neglected the supply-side response and the actual recent trend in the data. The new evidence shows that a 'Yes' outcome is extremely unlikely.\n\n1.  **The Starting Point and Required Pace:** The March 2025 number is 503k. To exceed 550k by May requires an inventory gain of more than 47k in two months. The actual gain from February to March was only 3k. This means the pace of inventory accumulation would need to accelerate by a factor of more than 15x compared to the most recent reading, which is highly improbable.\n\n2.  **Builder Pullback:** As Forecaster 2 highlighted, builders are actively pulling back. The sharp declines in housing starts and permits in March signal a smaller pipeline of new homes coming to market. This supply-side constraint makes it very difficult for inventory to surge, even if sales were to slow significantly.\n\n3.  **Historical Precedent:** As Forecaster 3 argued, the 550k level is an extreme historical outlier. The base rate for such a high level of inventory is very low, and reaching it would require an extraordinary market shock, not just a continuation of current trends.\n\nIn summary, the slow recent growth, the active reduction in new supply by builders, and the historically high target level all combine to make a 'Yes' outcome a remote possibility. I am moving my forecast to 5% to reflect this overwhelming evidence. The small remaining probability accounts for the possibility of a major data revision or a sudden, unforeseen collapse in sales that outpaces the builder pullback.",
