  "information": "According to multiple news outlets, U.S. government bodies have documented 757 cases of Unidentified Aerial Phenomena (UAP) between May 2023 and June 2024. Of this total, 708 occurred in airspace, and only 49 cases had been officially closed as of early 2025. The Department of Defense's All-Domain Anomaly Resolution Office (AARO) is the primary body for receiving these reports. The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) also investigates UAP sightings, especially those confirmed by radar, and shares its findings with the Department of Defense.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Approximately 41 days. June 2025 begins in 11 days (June 1, 2025), runs for 30 days, and the outcome will be determined on or after July 1, 2025.",
    "status_quo_outcome": "At least one cube-shaped UFO sighting is reported to NUFORC in June 2025. While the example notes that December 2024's six cube sightings were 'rare', this suggests cube-shaped reports do occur regularly, just in varying numbers.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "June 2025 passes without any witnesses reporting cube-shaped UFO sightings to NUFORC, or any such reports received are not published by July 1, 2025. This could occur if fewer overall sightings happen, if witnesses observe other shapes instead, or if cube sightings simply don't occur that particular month.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "At least one person observes and reports a cube-shaped UFO to NUFORC during June 2025, and NUFORC processes and publishes this report on their website by the time Metaculus checks on or after July 1, 2025.",
    "rationale": "The key evidence is that December 2024 had six cube-shaped sightings, which is described as 'rare' in NUFORC's history. This tells us two important things: (1) cube-shaped sightings do occur with some regularity, and (2) six in a month represents an unusually high number, suggesting typical months have fewer. NUFORC processes significant volume—approximately 3,600 reports annually (180,000 over 50 years) or roughly 300 per month. The question's threshold is low: we only need ONE cube sighting, not six. Even if cube sightings represent a small percentage of total reports and most months have zero to three such sightings, the probability of at least one occurring is moderate. The research assistant's information about 757 UAP cases to government bodies shows continued public interest in reporting aerial phenomena, which supports ongoing NUFORC activity. My forecast is not higher (70-80%) because 'rare' suggests many months likely have zero cube sightings—we simply don't have the distribution data. If most months had cube sightings, six wouldn't be described as rare. My forecast is not lower (40-50%) because we only need one sighting, NUFORC has consistent traffic, and the December 2024 example proves cube reports do occur. I would update higher if data showed cube sightings occurred in most months, or if June historically had elevated reporting. I would update lower if data showed cube sightings only occurred in a minority of months.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill the National UFO Reporting Center report a sighting of a cube-shaped UFO in June 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nAccording to the [National UFO Reporting Center](https://nuforc.org/about-us/): \"The National UFO Reporting Center was founded in 1974 by noted UFO investigator Robert J. Gribble. The Center’s primary function over the past five decades has been to receive, record, and to the greatest degree possible, corroborate and document reports from individuals who have been witness to unusual, possibly UFO-related events. Throughout its history, the Center has processed over 180,000 reports, and has distributed its information to thousands of individuals.\"\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if The National UFO Reporting Center posts a report of a sighting of a UFO/UAP shaped like a cube in June 2025 at [this link](https://nuforc.org/ndx/?id=event) when accessed by Metaculus on or after July 1, 2025.\n\nFor example, although rare in the history of NUFORC, the month of December 2024 [had](https://nuforc.org/subndx/?id=e202412) six sightings with a cube shape.\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nAccording to multiple news outlets, U.S. government bodies have documented 757 cases of Unidentified Aerial Phenomena (UAP) between May 2023 and June 2024. Of this total, 708 occurred in airspace, and only 49 cases had been officially closed as of early 2025. The Department of Defense's All-Domain Anomaly Resolution Office (AARO) is the primary body for receiving these reports. The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) also investigates UAP sightings, especially those confirmed by radar, and shares its findings with the Department of Defense.\n\nToday is 2025-05-21.\n\nBefore answering you think:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n(e) You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
