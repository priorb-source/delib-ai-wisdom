    "review": "Forecaster 2 appears to rely on facts I have not seen substantiated: namely that a presidential block has already been issued and that there is an imminent court ruling (e.g., June 18). If a presidential order were already in place, we’d likely have seen an immediate or near‑term termination in past analogs; moreover, my research and the assistant’s report don’t indicate such an order as of May 16. The reference to a $30/share alternative also looks inconsistent with current trading around $44 and historical bids. Given these gaps, I weight Forecaster 2’s 70% as too high for “collapse by July 1.” Forecaster 3’s analysis is more balanced: it correctly emphasizes bipartisan political headwinds and USW opposition while noting the timing constraint and corporate inertia. I agree with the crux that the principal uncertainty is timing rather than ultimate viability. However, I still think 40% is high for a termination 8‑K within ~6.5 weeks, absent a clear, time‑bounded trigger (e.g., a presidential prohibition or refusal to extend).",
    "rationale": "Key drivers remain: (1) timing constraint, (2) need for a formal termination 8‑K, and (3) current signals from markets and stakeholders. With ~46 days left, the most plausible “Yes” path is a presidential prohibition following a CFIUS process, which historically prompts swift termination. While political pressure is real and bipartisan, I see no credible report of a decision being imminent. Companies are reportedly still engaging with policymakers, and activist investors’ bullish positioning plus reports of “progress in talks” point toward continued negotiation or extension over an abrupt walk‑away. The wide spread to $55 likely reflects both failure risk and a potentially long/uncertain timeline; it does not, by itself, imply a high probability of termination by July 1.\n\nI discount scenarios that require immediate board pivot to an alternative buyer at a much lower price or litigation milestones already calendared; those claims are either outdated or unsupported. Given these considerations, the base case remains pendency past July 1 absent a decisive governmental action. I make a slight upward nudge from my prior to reflect Forecaster 3’s valid emphasis on bipartisan pressure and union opposition, which does create non‑trivial odds of a near‑term adverse decision, but I still see the modal outcome as “No” by July 1.\n\nUpside (toward Yes): credible reports that CFIUS has recommended prohibition to the President; leaks of an imminent presidential order; explicit statements from either party refusing to extend the outside date; disclosure of failed mitigation talks. Downside (toward No): news of extension, concrete mitigation frameworks gaining traction, or supportive signals from key officials.\n",
