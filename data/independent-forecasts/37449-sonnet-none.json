    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Approximately 56 days (until July 1, 2025)",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No - there is no current blockade of Taiwan by China, and no US accusation of such a blockade",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "China continues its current approach to Taiwan without implementing an actual blockade of seaports. Even if China increases military pressure through exercises or gray zone tactics, either (a) it stops short of a full blockade, or (b) the US uses different terminology like 'coercion,' 'quarantine,' or 'maritime harassment' rather than explicitly accusing China of 'blockading' Taiwan",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "China dramatically escalates tensions and implements a blockade of one or more Taiwanese seaports (possibly framed as a 'quarantine' or 'inspection regime'), and the US government publicly and explicitly accuses China of blockading Taiwan, using that specific terminology in official statements",
    "rationale": "This forecast heavily weights the status quo outcome for several key reasons. First, the timeframe is extremely short - only 56 days remain until resolution. Second, a blockade would represent a massive military escalation tantamount to an act of war, which historically are rare events that typically involve visible military buildup and warning signs. There are currently no reports of such preparations. Third, the base rate for major cross-strait military actions is very low despite decades of tensions. Fourth, even if China were to increase maritime pressure, the question requires very specific language - the US must publicly accuse China of 'blockading' Taiwan. The US might deliberately avoid this term to prevent further escalation, preferring diplomatic language like 'coercion' or 'gray zone tactics.' The research assistant provided no additional information suggesting imminent crisis. The WSJ article referenced indicates Chinese capability, but capability does not equal intent or imminent action. I'm not forecasting lower (below 2-3%) because: (1) geopolitical surprises do occur, (2) cross-strait tensions are genuinely elevated, (3) China has demonstrated willingness to conduct aggressive military exercises near Taiwan. I'm not forecasting higher because: (1) a blockade would likely trigger US military response under the Taiwan Relations Act, making it an extraordinarily risky move, (2) no current intelligence or reporting suggests imminent action, (3) the very short timeframe makes a major policy shift unlikely. I would update higher if there were reports of Chinese naval mobilization, major incidents in the Taiwan Strait, or credible intelligence warnings. I would update lower as time passes without incident.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill the United States accuse the People's Republic of China of blockading Taiwan before July 1, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nWSJ via MSN: [China Is Ready to Blockade Taiwan. Here’s How.](https://www.msn.com/en-us/news/world/china-is-ready-to-blockade-taiwan-here-s-how/ar-AA1BvnW8)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if, before July 1, 2025, the US government publicly accuses the People's Republic of China of blockading at least one of Taiwan's seaports without consent from the Taiwanese government in Taipei.\n\n\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nNo additional information available.\n\nToday is 2025-05-06.\n\nBefore answering you think:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n(e) You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
