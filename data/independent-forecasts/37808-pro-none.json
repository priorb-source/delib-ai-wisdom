    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Approximately 6 weeks.",
    "status_quo_outcome": "Yes, the webpage will remain online.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "A new presidential administration, ideologically opposed to the Diversity Visa program, could issue an executive order to suspend it. Following this directive, the State Department would remove the entry and information page to halt the program's operation. Alternatively, a major, pre-planned redesign of the travel.state.gov website could result in the specific URL being changed or removed, even if the program itself continues.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "The State Department continues its routine operations under the existing legal framework that authorizes the Diversity Visa program. Bureaucratic inertia and the short timeframe prevent any significant political or technical changes from being implemented that would affect the webpage's availability. The page remains online as part of the standard annual cycle of the program.",
    "rationale": "My forecast is heavily weighted towards the status quo. The Diversity Visa program is established by law (Immigration Act of 1990), and the State Department's website is a long-standing piece of government infrastructure. Over a short timeframe of approximately six weeks, bureaucratic inertia is an extremely powerful force. The default outcome for any government webpage is that it will remain unchanged absent a specific and strong reason.\n\nThe primary risk factor for a 'No' outcome is political. The background materials correctly identify that the program is controversial, particularly with some Republican leaders. If a new administration hostile to the program had taken office in January 2025, they might have taken steps to suspend or terminate it. However, by late May 2025, such an action would have to be implemented very quickly to meet the July 1 deadline. While an executive order could be issued, the subsequent administrative process to remove web content for a legally-mandated program would likely take time and could be subject to legal challenges, making a takedown within six weeks unlikely, though not impossible.\n\nMy forecast is not higher than 96% due to this political risk and a smaller technical risk. A major website overhaul by the State Department could change the URL structure, leading to a 'No' resolution based on the precise wording of the question. While government IT projects are often slow, such a change is possible.\n\nMy forecast is not lower because the barriers to change are significant. Removing the webpage for a program still on the statute books is a non-trivial administrative and legal step. The path of least resistance, by far, is for the State Department to maintain the existing web presence. For me to lower my forecast, I would need to see a specific announcement of an executive order targeting the DV program or a confirmed notice from the State Department about an imminent website migration affecting that URL.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill the US State Department's Diversity Visa page still be online on July 1, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\n[Federal judge’s order leaves many visa lottery winners out of luck](https://www.siliconvalley.com/2020/10/01/judges-order-leaves-many-visa-lottery-winners-out-of-luck/) | [Donald Trump's 2017 tweet discussing the DV program](https://x.com/realDonaldTrump/status/925684982307348480)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if the Step 1 Submit an Entry page with instructions for registering for the Diversity Immigrant Visa (DV) Program is at [this location](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/us-visas/immigrate/diversity-visa-program-entry/diversity-visa-submit-entry1.html) when attempted to be accessed by Metaculus on or after July 1, 2025.\n\n\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nNo additional information available.\n\nToday is 2025-05-20.\n\nBefore answering you think:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n(e) You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
