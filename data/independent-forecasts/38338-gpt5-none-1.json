    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "About 24 days (until July 1, 2025)",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Morgan continues to float the idea and build a plan but delays a formal candidacy announcement until later in 2025 (or decides against running), keeping the window before July 1 closed without a definitive declaration.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Morgan decides to move quickly and publicly declares his candidacy via a press event, major interview, or social media post before July 1, perhaps to generate momentum, stake an early claim in the field, or align with end-of-quarter fundraising optics.",
    "rationale": "- Time horizon: With only a little over three weeks left, the default outcome is that no announcement occurs by July 1. Good forecasting practice weights the status quo heavily; absent a forcing deadline, most things don’t change quickly. \n- Base rates/timing: This is for the 2026 Florida governor’s race. Many credible statewide candidates announce later in the cycle (late 2025 or early 2026). Announcing before July 2025 is early, lowering the likelihood in this tight window. \n- Actor history: John Morgan has repeatedly teased runs in past cycles and not pulled the trigger. His pattern suggests a propensity to consider publicly without committing quickly, which weighs toward No in a short time frame. \n- Current signals: The Politico piece (May 15) signals planning and seriousness but not inevitability or an imminent date. There’s no obvious deadline (e.g., legal filing cutoff) forcing a June announcement. If anything, he might prefer to roll out later when attention is higher or when strategic conditions clarify. \n- Why not higher: No hard deadline before July 1, early timing for 2026, and Morgan’s prior history of flirtation without formal entry all argue against a near-term announcement. \n- Why not lower: He is wealthy and can self-fund, enabling a rapid, low-friction launch. The recent reporting of a concrete blueprint implies nontrivial intent; a spontaneous announcement is plausible. \n- What would move me up: Concrete signs of imminence—hiring senior campaign staff, opening a candidate committee (beyond exploratory), reserving venues, clear media reports of a set announcement date in June, teaser posts indicating a specific timeline before July 1. \n- What would move me down: Public statements punting a decision to late summer/fall, endorsements of another candidate, or reporting that he’s decided against running. \n- Research assistant summary: No additional info provided; this forecast relies on general patterns, the Politico headline context, and Morgan’s past behavior.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill John Morgan announce his candidacy for Florida governor before July 1, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nPolitico: [John Morgan lays out campaign blueprint for possible Florida governor run](https://www.politico.com/news/2025/05/15/john-morgan-florida-governor-run-00351005)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if John Morgan announces his candidacy for governor of Florida before July 1, 2025. If no such announcement has been made before that date, the question resolves as **No**.\n\n\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nNo additional information available.\n\nToday is 2025-06-06.\n\nBefore answering you think:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n(e) You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
