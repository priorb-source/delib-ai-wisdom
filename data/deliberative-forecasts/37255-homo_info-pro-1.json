    "review": "All three forecasters are in strong agreement on the core driver of this forecast: Libya's profound and persistent political fragmentation makes ratification of a major treaty within a two-month timeframe extremely unlikely. The status quo of legislative inaction is the dominant factor. Forecaster 2's analysis was helpful in adding specificity by naming the rival administrations (GNU and HoR), reinforcing the central argument of political deadlock. However, I found Forecaster 3's reasoning particularly convincing and novel. They introduced two key points I had not sufficiently weighted: 1) the nearly six-year period of inaction since Libya signed the agreement in 2019 serves as strong historical evidence of this not being a priority, and 2) the slow, multi-decade implementation timeline for AfCFTA across the continent significantly reduces any external pressure on Libya to act with urgency. This second point, in particular, undermines one of the few plausible scenarios for a 'Yes' vote, which would involve a faction being pressured into or seeking a quick diplomatic victory.",
    "rationale": "I am updating my forecast downward based on the deliberation. My initial reasoning, centered on Libya's internal political paralysis and the very short timeline, remains intact. However, I was persuaded by Forecaster 3's argument that the lack of urgent external pressure fundamentally lowers the probability of a 'Yes' outcome. I had previously assigned a small probability to a scenario where a Libyan faction might push for a rapid ratification as a diplomatic gesture. Forecaster 3 correctly pointed out that with AfCFTA's continent-wide implementation being a slow process (e.g., tariff removal by 2034), there is little incentive or pressure from the African Union or other partners for Libya to rush this process now. This new consideration effectively removes one of the only plausible, albeit low-probability, paths to ratification. The combination of intractable internal gridlock and a near-total absence of external urgency leads me to conclude that my initial 5% forecast was too high.",
