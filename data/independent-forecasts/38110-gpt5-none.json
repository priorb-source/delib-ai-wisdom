    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "About 31 days (until July 1, 2025)",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No — the crossings remain closed and no credible report of reopening appears before July 1, 2025.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Benin keeps the Kwara-adjacent posts shut pending security operations and anti-smuggling measures; no joint communiqué or official notice is issued; local media continue reporting disruptions without a reopening notice through June.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Following bilateral security coordination (e.g., joint patrols, tighter screening), Benin publicly announces a partial or full reopening of the affected Kwara border crossings, and this is reported by credible Nigerian or Beninese outlets before July 1, 2025.",
    "rationale": "- Baseline/status quo: Borders that are closed for security and anti-smuggling reasons in West Africa often remain shut for weeks to months absent clear de-escalation or political direction. The May 2025 closure cites arms smuggling and a new militant threat alongside economic concerns (soy exports), both of which tend to lengthen closures.\n- Time constraint: With only about one month left, administrative and security coordination steps (agreements, deployments, communication to local commands) must happen quickly and be reported credibly. That compresses the window.\n- Pressure to reopen: There is some countervailing pressure—cross-border trade frictions, local livelihoods, and Nigeria–Benin relations under ECOWAS. Quick reversals do occur when closures are tactical or symbolic, and religious/festive periods or agricultural cycles can motivate easing. However, the cited security rationale argues for caution.\n- Reporting requirement: The question requires credible reporting of reopening. Even if a low-key, de facto easing occurs, it may not count unless it’s publicly and credibly reported, which lowers the near-term probability.\n- Historical context: Nigeria–Benin border disruptions have previously persisted (e.g., Nigeria’s 2019–2020 closure), illustrating that reversals are not guaranteed soon after initial action.\n- Research assistant input: No additional information available beyond initial reports; in the absence of signals of imminent talks or a temporary nature, I give extra weight to the status quo.\nWhy not higher: Security-led closures typically outlast a month; no public signs (yet) of a negotiated reopening timetable; credible-report requirement.\nWhy not lower: Local economic costs and bilateral ties can prompt pragmatic, selective reopening; a single credible announcement before July 1 would resolve Yes.\nWhat would move me up: Official statements hinting at a temporary closure, scheduled high-level Nigeria–Benin border security talks in June, reports of successful operations against the cited threat, or local authorities preparing checkpoints for resumption.\nWhat would move me down: Fresh incidents attributed to the militant group, major arms-seizure revelations, or Benin issuing guidance extending or tightening the closure.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill Benin re-open its closed land border crossings with Nigeria's Kwara state before July 1, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\n[Exclusive: Benin Rep. Closes Land Borders With Nigerian Communities Over Soya, Others' Exportation](https://www.legit.ng/nigeria/1654107-exclusive-benin-rep-closes-land-borders-nigerian-communities-soya-exportation/) | [BREAKING: Benin Republic Shuts Border With Kwara Communities Over Attacks By New Terror Group Mahmuda, Arms Smuggling – Sources](https://saharareporters.com/2025/05/08/breaking-benin-republic-shuts-border-kwara-communities-over-attacks-new-terror-group)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if before July 1, 2025, Benin's land border crossings with Nigeria's Kwara state that were closed in May 2025 are [credibly](https://www.metaculus.com/faq/#definitions) reported to have been reopened.\n\n\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nNo additional information available.\n\nToday is 2025-05-31.\n\nBefore answering you think:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n(e) You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
