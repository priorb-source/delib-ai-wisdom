    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "The 2025 Canadian federal election has not yet occurred. Given the date of April 21, 2025, the election is likely to be held within the next few months, though the exact date is not specified. Typically, Canadian federal elections occur within a 36-42 day campaign period after being called. The outcome will be known on election night.",
    "status_quo_outcome": "Yes - the Bloc Québécois would win more seats than the Conservative Party in Quebec. In the 2021 federal election, the Bloc won 32 seats in Quebec while the Conservatives won only 10 seats in the province. Historically, the Bloc has dominated Quebec federal politics compared to the Conservatives, who have struggled to gain traction in the province outside of a few ridings.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "The Conservative Party experiences a major breakthrough in Quebec, potentially winning 15-20+ seats while the Bloc collapses to fewer seats than that. This could occur if: (1) Mark Carney's Liberal surge splits the nationalist/soft-nationalist vote and inadvertently helps Conservatives win plurality victories in three-way races; (2) The Conservative Party successfully campaigns on economic issues that resonate with Quebec voters; (3) The Bloc suffers a catastrophic collapse of support due to the Carney effect mentioned in the articles.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "The Bloc maintains its traditional stronghold in Quebec, winning 25-35 seats while the Conservatives remain confined to their traditional 8-12 seats in the province. Despite the Conservative candidate issues mentioned in Quebec City and even with some Bloc seats potentially lost to a Carney-led Liberal surge, the Bloc retains enough support in rural Quebec and among sovereigntist voters to exceed Conservative seat counts.",
    "rationale": "The historical pattern strongly favors a Yes outcome. In 2021, the Bloc won 32 seats to the Conservatives' 10 in Quebec - a massive 22-seat advantage. The Conservatives have consistently struggled in Quebec, typically winning only 8-12 seats concentrated in suburban Montreal and the Outaouais region. The Bloc, despite being a regional party, has a well-established base across francophone Quebec.\n\nThe articles provide mixed signals: Carney's Liberal surge poses a threat to the Bloc, but the Conservative candidate issue in Quebec City suggests the Conservatives face their own challenges. Importantly, even if the Liberals surge and take seats from the Bloc, this doesn't necessarily translate to Conservative gains - it could simply mean a Liberal-Bloc competition with Conservatives remaining marginal.\n\nFor the Conservatives to win more seats than the Bloc would require an unprecedented shift in Quebec politics. They would need to roughly triple their 2021 performance while the Bloc collapses by about two-thirds. While not impossible, this level of volatility is rare in Canadian elections.\n\nMy forecast is not higher (85-90%) because: (1) The Carney surge mentioned could genuinely reshape Quebec politics; (2) We lack current polling data; (3) Electoral dynamics can shift during campaigns; (4) Economic or other issues could favor Conservatives.\n\nMy forecast is not lower (40-50%) because: (1) The historical pattern is so strong; (2) The Conservatives would need gains AND Bloc would need losses simultaneously; (3) Even a Liberal surge doesn't automatically help Conservatives; (4) The status quo bias principle argues against dramatic reversals.\n\nTo update higher: Polling showing Bloc maintaining 25+ seats or Conservatives stuck at 10-12 seats. To update lower: Polling showing Conservative breakthrough with 15+ projected seats or Bloc collapse below 15 seats.",

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
