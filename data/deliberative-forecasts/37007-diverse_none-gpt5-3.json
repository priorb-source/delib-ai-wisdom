    "review": "Both forecasters lean on incumbency/status quo in a tight two-party system, asserting structural advantages for PNM and noting the lack of contrary polling. These are valid considerations and align with my prior. However, neither introduces new information (e.g., constituency polling, credible national polls, Tobago dynamics, third-party effects like NTA/PDP) that would materially change the base case. They also do not grapple with specific downside risks I highlighted, such as PNM vulnerability in Tobago or the salience of crime. Their probabilities (57% and 62%) appear to reflect a stronger incumbency edge than I’m comfortable with given recent close results and potential fragmentation/anti-incumbent sentiment.",
    "rationale": "One week out, absent reliable polling, I continue to weigh: (1) status quo/early-election timing and incumbency favoring PNM; (2) a historically close map (2020: 22–19) with several marginals; (3) 2023 local results indicating a roughly even landscape; (4) risks to PNM in Tobago and urban marginals amid crime/economic concerns; (5) potential third-party effects (e.g., NTA, Tobago actors) that could either split opposition votes in Trinidad (helping PNM) or threaten PNM in Tobago. The other forecasters’ emphasis on incumbency is already baked into my prior; without fresh, seat-level evidence showing PNM holding Tobago and key marginals, I’m not persuaded to raise the probability. Conversely, I don’t see new evidence to lower it either. I remain narrowly pro-PNM on plurality, but with substantial uncertainty.",
