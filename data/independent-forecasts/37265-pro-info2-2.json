  "information": "Several other countries in the region or with similar risk profiles have recently been elevated to Level 3. Uganda's advisory was raised due to terrorism risks, political demonstrations, and discriminatory laws. Burundi's Level 3 advisory cites violent crimes like grenade attacks and armed robbery targeting foreigners. The State Department also reissued a Level 3 alert for Bangladesh due to civil unrest, crime, and terrorism, and issued a Level 3 warning for Trinidad and Tobago following a surge in violent crime and a declared state of emergency.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Approximately two months, with the outcome determined by July 1, 2025.",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No. Tanzania's current travel advisory is Level 2, 'Exercise Increased Caution.' The status quo outcome is that this advisory level remains unchanged.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "The security situation in Tanzania remains consistent with the current Level 2 advisory. While risks of crime and terrorism persist at their current levels, no major incidents occur that would trigger a re-evaluation and upgrade by the US State Department before the deadline.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "A significant deterioration in the security environment occurs. This could be a single major event, such as a terrorist attack in a tourist area, or a rapid, noticeable escalation in violent crime targeting foreigners, prompting the State Department to issue a 'Reconsider Travel' advisory.",
    "rationale": "My forecast is anchored in the high probability of the status quo persisting over a short timeframe. The US State Department's travel advisories possess significant inertia; they are not typically changed without a clear and compelling catalyst. With only two months until the resolution date, the most likely outcome is that the current Level 2 advisory remains in place. However, the probability is not negligible due to several risk factors. The research provided indicates that regional neighbors like Uganda and Burundi have been elevated to Level 3 for threats—terrorism, violent crime, and civil unrest—that are also present in Tanzania. This demonstrates the State Department's sensitivity to these specific issues in the region. My 20% probability reflects the chance of a trigger event, such as a notable terrorist incident or a spike in crime against travelers, occurring in this two-month window. The forecast is not higher because such trigger events are, by definition, low-probability occurrences, and there is no specific intelligence to suggest one is imminent. It is not lower because the identified risks are real, and the regional precedent shows that an upgrade is a plausible response to a security deterioration. I would increase this forecast upon credible reports of a major security incident or significant political instability. I would decrease it if the deadline grows nearer without any such events.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill Tanzania receive a \"Level 3 – Reconsider Travel\" travel advisory from the US State Department before July 1, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nTravel and Tour World: [Travel Advisory for Tanzania: How Increased Crime and Terrorism Threats Impact Tourists in Popular African Destinations](https://www.travelandtourworld.com/news/article/travel-advisory-for-tanzania-how-increased-crime-and-terrorism-threats-impact-tourists-in-popular-african-destinations/)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if the country of Tanzania has received a Level 3 [travel advisory](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/International-Travel-Country-Information-Pages/Tanzania.html) from the US Department of State before July 1, 2025.\n\n\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nSeveral other countries in the region or with similar risk profiles have recently been elevated to Level 3. Uganda's advisory was raised due to terrorism risks, political demonstrations, and discriminatory laws. Burundi's Level 3 advisory cites violent crimes like grenade attacks and armed robbery targeting foreigners. The State Department also reissued a Level 3 alert for Bangladesh due to civil unrest, crime, and terrorism, and issued a Level 3 warning for Trinidad and Tobago following a surge in violent crime and a declared state of emergency.\n\nToday is 2025-05-02.\n\nBefore answering you think:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n(e) You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
