  "information": "In April 2025, the Ministry of Tourism in the Turks and Caicos Islands (TCI) warned tourism stakeholders against promoting or facilitating the use of illegal taxis, with businesses facing a $1000 fine for such referrals. The government has emphasized that operating an unlicensed taxi is a serious offense, with penalties for drivers including a fine and disqualification from driving. The country, with a resident population of approximately 45,000, has also implemented a new \"Rate Your Ride\" framework. As of May 2025, two locally-based ride-hailing services are confirmed to be operating: GetMe Ride, which launched in 2019, and Conch Cab, which began service in May 2025.\n\nUber's recent expansion strategy has focused on major international markets and technological partnerships. In December 2024, the company launched an \"Uber Taxi\" service in Curitiba, Brazil, integrating licensed local taxi drivers onto its platform through a partnership with mobility company Stuo. In the U.S., Uber partnered with autonomous vehicle developer May Mobility in May 2025, with plans to deploy self-driving taxis in Arlington, Texas, by late 2025 and expand to other cities in 2026. Reports indicate that Uber's historical pattern in the Caribbean has been to prioritize larger markets over smaller island jurisdictions.\n\nTourism in the Turks and Caicos Islands grew significantly in 2024, with the islands welcoming nearly two million visitors across air and cruise travel. This total represents a 10.66% increase in air arrivals and a 30.48% increase in cruise passengers compared to the previous year. New airline routes have been added to accommodate the demand, including a nonstop American Airlines service from Miami to South Caicos launched in March 2025. Concurrently, the U.S. Department of State maintains a Level 2 \"exercise increased caution\" travel advisory for TCI, first issued in July 2023, citing crime levels and reminding travelers of the islands' strict laws against firearms and ammunition.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Approximately 2 months (from May 2, 2025 to July 1, 2025)",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No - Uber is not currently available in Turks and Caicos Islands",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Uber continues focusing on larger markets and technology partnerships (autonomous vehicles, major cities). With a resident population of only 45,000 and two local ride-hailing competitors already operating (GetMe Ride and Conch Cab), Uber determines the market is too small to justify the operational and regulatory effort required for entry.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Uber announces a surprise Caribbean expansion that includes TCI, potentially using a partnership model similar to their December 2024 Brazil launch where they integrated local licensed taxi drivers. The growing tourism market (2M visitors in 2024) provides sufficient business case for entry despite the small resident population.",
    "rationale": "This forecast heavily weights the status quo outcome that Uber is not available in TCI. Several factors support a very low probability: (1) The market is extremely small with only 45,000 residents; (2) Two local ride-hailing services are already established and operational; (3) Uber's documented pattern shows preference for larger markets over small Caribbean islands; (4) There is zero indication in recent news of Uber's interest in TCI or broader small-island Caribbean expansion; (5) The timeframe is only 2 months, insufficient for typical market entry activities including regulatory approval, driver recruitment, and platform setup; (6) The local government is actively enforcing taxi licensing requirements, adding regulatory complexity. The slight non-zero probability accounts for: (a) tourism growth making the market marginally more attractive than raw population suggests, (b) possibility of a surprise announcement using a rapid partnership model, (c) unknown business considerations. For this forecast to increase significantly, I would need to see: concrete announcements of Uber's interest in TCI, regulatory approvals being sought, or evidence of broader Caribbean small-island expansion strategy. For it to decrease further, explicit statements from Uber ruling out TCI expansion would be needed. Given the strong base rate against rapid market expansion into tiny markets with established competitors and no advance signals, the probability remains very low.",

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any).
