    "review": "My initial forecast of 75% was based on the strong positive signals from the Bangladeshi government, including the final license approval and the technical feasibility of a rapid launch using existing satellites. However, the other forecasters provided compelling arguments for a more cautious outlook. Forecaster 2's analysis was particularly persuasive in highlighting the extreme tightness of the timeline. Framing the period from license approval (April 30) to the deadline (July 1) as just two months powerfully illustrates the lack of any buffer for even minor, common delays. Their point that the publicly stated May 2025 launch target has already slipped is a concrete piece of evidence that timelines are not firm. Forecaster 3 helpfully added nuance by specifying 'local commercial setup' (payments, taxes) as another potential source of friction beyond the main tariff approval. Neither forecaster introduced new factual information, but their framing of the existing facts, particularly the timeline risk, was convincing.",
    "rationale": "After reviewing the other analyses, I am revising my forecast downward from 75% to 65%. My initial assessment was overly optimistic about the ability of political will to overcome all bureaucratic friction within the tight 61-day window between licensing and the deadline. The other forecasters correctly emphasized that even in a best-case scenario, the timeline is compressed, and any minor delay in the remaining steps—tariff approval, commercial setup, final technical checks—would result in a 'No' outcome. The fact that the stated May launch target appears to have slipped provides evidence that delays are already occurring. I still believe a 'Yes' outcome is more likely than not due to the significant positive factors: the license has been granted, a trial was successful, high-level political support is evident, and there is no technical dependency on building local gateways. However, a 75% probability understates the risk of commonplace delays. A revised forecast of 65% better reflects the balance between these strong positive drivers and the significant, tangible risk posed by the unforgiving schedule.",
