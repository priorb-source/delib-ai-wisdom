    "review": "Both forecasters add useful tail-risk considerations I hadn’t explicitly baked in: (1) the April 2025 bill to terminate the DV program, which modestly raises short-horizon policy risk; (2) the strictness of the resolution criterion about “at this location,” implying that even a routine CMS reorganization or a redirect could cause a No. I agree the DEI-related EO angle is largely orthogonal. I also find the historical point persuasive that even a hostile administration kept the DV pages up, suggesting policy continuity over six weeks. Their probabilities (87–89%) seem slightly conservative to me given the short timeframe and the cycle’s current status, but they do justify trimming a few points for URL/redirect ambiguity and low-probability outages.",
    "rationale": "Status quo strongly favors Yes. The DV program is statutory and currently active; results for DV-2026 were just released, and the next entry period is months away. State typically keeps the Step 1 page live year-round with “entry closed” messaging. To get a No by July 1, we’d likely need: (a) a site restructure that removes or renames this exact slug without serving the content at that URL (and potentially without a redirect counting); (b) an unusual decision to pull the Step 1 page entirely; (c) a precisely timed outage; or (d) extremely fast-moving legislation ending DV with immediate web changes—historically unlikely on this horizon. New points from peers push me to modestly increase the weight on URL/redirect strictness and the small policy tail. Net effect: slight downward adjustment from my prior estimate while retaining a high likelihood of continuity over ~6 weeks.",
