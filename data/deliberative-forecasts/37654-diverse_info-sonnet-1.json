    "review": "Forecaster 2 provides the strongest quantitative evidence I hadn't considered: only 5 of 41 'In progress' items (12%) moved to 'Complete' over 4.5 months, and we have just 1.5 months remaining. This base rate is powerful evidence against a Yes outcome, especially for a complex item like NOAA breakup. Their emphasis on the tracker's practice of requiring formal action before marking 'Complete' is well-founded. Forecaster 3 introduces important new information about concrete actions (climate database discontinuation, 25% budget cuts), but I find their 30% forecast too optimistic. They themselves acknowledge that 'complete' typically implies finality and that the budget cuts are for next fiscal year. The tension is whether functional dismantling equals 'complete' or whether formal dissolution is required. Given the tracker moderators' stated practice (per Forecaster 2) of requiring formal action, and the lack of reported legislation or executive orders near enactment, Forecaster 2's reasoning is more persuasive. However, Forecaster 3's concrete actions do provide some non-trivial upside risk that I underweighted.",
    "rationale": "I'm updating downward from 13% to 8% based primarily on Forecaster 2's compelling base rate analysis. If only 12% of 'In progress' items completed in 4.5 months, expecting completion in the next 1.5 months for a particularly complex item is statistically unlikely. The tracker's documented practice of requiring formal action before marking items 'Complete' (not just functional progress) significantly lowers the probability. While Forecaster 3's information about concrete dismantling actions is relevant, these are more likely to keep the status as 'In progress' rather than trigger 'Complete' without a formal legislative act or comprehensive executive order. The 25% budget cut being for next fiscal year reinforces this - it's a future commitment, not current completion. I'm not going as low as 4% because: (1) the concrete actions mentioned do create some possibility the moderators might use discretion to mark functional achievement as complete, (2) there could be imminent formal actions we're unaware of, and (3) a late June executive action combined with rapid moderator updating remains possible, though unlikely.",
