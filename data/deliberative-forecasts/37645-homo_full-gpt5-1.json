    "review": "Forecaster 2 added a key legal/timing constraint I hadn’t explicitly weighed: Serbian parliamentary elections are typically set 45–60 days from dissolution, and the decree setting the date usually coincides with dissolution. That means a pre–July 1 announcement would almost surely force a late-July/August vote—an unattractive window if the government prefers autumn. This materially lowers near-term announcement odds. I agree with both forecasters on the mid‑April confidence vote resetting the clock and on waning protest momentum plus a fragmented opposition favoring the status quo. I also concur that Vučić’s “within ten days” line looks more like tactical ambiguity than a firm signal. I find F2’s argument most decision-relevant; F3’s framing aligns with my prior but doesn’t change it much. Net: their inputs nudge me down from my prior 20%.",
    "rationale": "Baseline: The automatic snap-election trigger is gone after the mid‑April investiture; officials emphasize a stable majority. Calling snap elections weeks after forming a new cabinet would be unusual and politically costly. The 45–60 day rule implies that any announcement before July 1 would likely produce a late‑July/August vote—logistically and electorally suboptimal if the aim is an autumn reset, so they can just wait. Paths to Yes remain: a sharp resurgence in protests in late May/June, a scandal or coalition fracture, or a strategic calculation that a low‑turnout summer election maximizes advantage. Vučić’s history keeps a non‑zero tail risk, but legal timing and the fresh cabinet make a rapid move less likely. Monitoring that would move me up: credible reports of dissolution steps, elite defections, major protest escalation, or explicit hints from the Presidency/election commission about an imminent decree. Absent those, the window likely passes into July without an announcement. I’m trimming my estimate to reflect the legal/timing constraint.",
