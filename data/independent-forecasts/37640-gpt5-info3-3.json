  "information": "Decommissioning a federal .gov domain typically requires a process lasting several months for internal approvals, security reviews, and coordination with the General Services Administration (GSA). Federal laws, including the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) and record-retention statutes overseen by the National Archives and Records Administration (NARA), mandate archiving procedures. Historically, websites for discontinued federal programs have often remained online as static archives or with placeholder notices for years after the program ended. When other EPA climate-related webpages were targeted for removal in 2017, the outcome was a redirect or a static page, not a complete shutdown of the domain.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "About 48 days (until July 1, 2025)",
    "status_quo_outcome": "Yes — EnergyStar.gov remains online, possibly unchanged or converted to a static/archive or notice page.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "EPA/GSA decommission the energystar.gov domain before July 1 (DNS removed or traffic blocked), or an extended outage coincides with Metaculus’s check so Is It Down Right Now? reports it as down.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "The domain remains live and returns any HTTP response (normal content, redirect, or a deprecation/archival notice), which Is It Down Right Now? will report as up.",
    "rationale": "- Baseline and inertia: As of May 7, 2025, the resolution source shows energystar.gov is up. With only ~7 weeks left, status quo inertia favors the domain still responding on July 1. Government web infrastructure tends to change slowly, especially for .gov domain retirements.\n- Process friction: Decommissioning a federal .gov domain typically takes months and requires internal approvals, coordination with GSA, security/records reviews, and NARA-compliant archiving. That timeline makes a full domain shutdown by July 1 less likely.\n- Archiving/precedent: FOIA and NARA record-retention obligations usually lead agencies to keep sites online as static archives or with notices rather than pulling the domain. In 2017, EPA climate-related content was removed or redirected, but domains/pages generally stayed reachable. A redirect or notice would still count as “up” to the resolution source.\n- Stakeholder optics: Energy Star is widely recognized and used by manufacturers/retailers. Even if the program is eliminated, keeping the website up with a discontinuation notice reduces confusion and legal risk. That increases the odds the domain remains reachable beyond July 1.\n- Why not higher: There is some chance of an aggressive, politically driven takedown that accelerates domain decommissioning unusually fast. There’s also a small, irreducible risk that when Metaculus checks, a transient outage or misconfigured TLS/DNS causes Is It Down Right Now? to flag it as down.\n- Why not lower: Historical practice, legal/records requirements, and the short time window favor the domain staying reachable, even if only as an archive or redirect. The resolution source typically treats any HTTP response as “up,” further boosting the odds.\n- Update triggers: I would lower the forecast if credible reporting or official notices indicate an imminent domain retirement (e.g., GSA domain removal request approved), sustained outages begin appearing, or DNS/TLS changes degrade availability. I would raise it if EPA/GSA publicly commit to archival hosting, or the site transitions to a static notice/redirect while remaining stable through late June.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill the EPA's EnergyStar.gov still be online on July 1, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nAccording to the [New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/06/climate/epa-energy-star-eliminated.html), \"'The Energy Star program and all the other climate work, outside of what’s required by statute, is being de-prioritized and eliminated,' Paul Gunning, the director of the E.P.A. Office of Atmospheric Protection, told employees during the meeting, according to the recording obtained by The New York Times. Mr. Gunning’s office itself is also slated for elimination.\n\nFor the past 33 years, Energy Star has been known for its recognizable blue label, which shows that an appliance has met energy efficiency standards set by the federal government.\"\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if EnergyStar.gov is online according to [Is It Down Right Now?](https://www.isitdownrightnow.com/energystar.gov.html) when accessed by Metaculus on or after July 1, 2025.\n\nAs of May 7, 2025, the resolution source returns the message, \"Energystar.gov is UP and reachable by us.\"\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nDecommissioning a federal .gov domain typically requires a process lasting several months for internal approvals, security reviews, and coordination with the General Services Administration (GSA).

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
