    "review": "Both forecasters reinforce the short-window constraint and the institutional mechanics: the president issues the decree, and elections are typically scheduled 45–60 days after the call. That legal/timing detail, plus the political cost of summer elections, makes a pre–July 1 announcement less attractive if the aim is an autumn vote. They also emphasize that the SNS-led majority can likely install a new PM without dissolution, which aligns with my prior view. The added specificity on the decree process and the 45–60 day window is the main incremental argument I hadn’t spelled out; it slightly lowers the odds that an announcement would be made now for a later election, since Serbian practice ties the decree to a near-term date rather than a distant one.",
    "rationale": "Roughly six weeks remain. For a Yes, there must be a formal, date-specific decree before July 1. Given Serbia’s practice of holding elections 45–60 days after a decree, announcing now would imply a July/early August vote—politically suboptimal and avoidable if leadership prefers autumn. The ruling bloc still has a workable majority, so the path of least resistance is to nominate and confirm a replacement PM rather than dissolve the assembly. The PM’s resignation raises the hazard of snap polls, but there’s no corroborated sign of coalition breakdown or presidential intent to dissolve on this tight timeline. Netting these factors, I trim my estimate slightly: the short window and summer disincentive dominate, with a residual chance reserved for a sudden strategic call or a surprise failure to form a government.",
