    "review": "Forecaster 2 raises a critical factual point I underweighted: the absence of a DEF 14A filing as of May 27, just 16 days before the alleged meeting date. This is extremely strong negative evidence. Large public companies typically file proxy materials weeks or months in advance, and the 40-day Notice-and-Access requirement would already be violated. While minimum Delaware notice periods (~10 days) could technically still be met with immediate filing, this would be highly unusual for GameStop's profile. Forecaster 3's historical pattern argument (Thursday in early/mid June) is valid but doesn't address whether June 12 is actually the confirmed scheduled date - pattern recognition matters more for predicting future choices than confirming current plans. The conflicting business aggregator data (Computershare: June 2, BI/Bloomberg: June 12) further suggests uncertainty. Without a filed proxy statement this close to the supposed date, the most likely reality is that June 12 is not the actual scheduled date, regardless of what patterns or secondary sources suggest.",
    "rationale": "I significantly underweighted the importance of verifiable regulatory filings in my initial analysis. Forecaster 2's observation that no DEF 14A has been filed as of May 27 is dispositive evidence against a June 12 meeting. While I correctly identified uncertainty about whether June 12 was the confirmed date (noting 10-15% risk in my initial analysis), I should have weighted this much more heavily given the filing timeline requirements. The absence of required SEC filings 16 days out transforms this from 'likely to proceed as scheduled with some risks' to 'unlikely to be the actual scheduled date.' However, I don't go as low as 20% because: (1) Bloomberg listings carry some credibility and suggest June 12 was at least contemplated, (2) it remains legally possible to file immediately and meet minimum Delaware requirements, (3) multiple independent sources listing the same date provides weak corroborating evidence. The most probable scenario is that June 12 either was never the official date, or will be rescheduled/postponed before occurring. I'm updating down approximately 35 percentage points from my original 72%.",
