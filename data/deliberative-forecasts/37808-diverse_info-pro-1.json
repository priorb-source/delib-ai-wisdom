    "review": "The other forecasters introduced crucial context that I had overlooked. Forecaster 2's mention of a specific House bill from April 2025 to terminate the Diversity Visa (DV) program is the most significant new piece of evidence. It transforms the political risk from a general, abstract possibility into a concrete, though still low-probability, threat. My initial analysis treated the primary risk as technical failure, which was a clear error. Forecaster 3's point about the current administration's broader willingness to enact immigration changes (e.g., visa restrictions, TPS terminations) reinforces the idea that executive action is a plausible pathway, something I had discounted too heavily. I find their reasoning convincing because they ground the risk in specific, recent events, whereas my initial forecast relied too much on general bureaucratic inertia. The combination of these two perspectives makes a compelling case that my initial confidence was too high.",
    "rationale": "My initial forecast of 98% was too high, predicated almost entirely on the short timeframe and bureaucratic inertia, while underestimating the current political dynamics. The input from my fellow forecasters has convinced me to revise my estimate downwards significantly. The existence of a recent House bill to terminate the DV program, as noted by Forecaster 2, introduces a specific legislative vehicle that could, in theory, lead to a 'No' outcome. While the 6-week timeline makes successful passage and implementation extremely unlikely, the probability is no longer near zero. Furthermore, Forecaster 3 rightly pointed out the administration's demonstrated willingness to act on immigration policy, which increases the likelihood of a sudden executive action to suspend the program, even if it invites legal challenges. These factors create plausible, albeit difficult, paths to the page's removal that I had not sufficiently weighted. I am therefore lowering my forecast from 98%. However, I am not lowering it to 82% as Forecaster 2 did. The procedural hurdles in Congress are immense, and passing a contentious immigration bill in both chambers and having it implemented at the agency website level in under 45 days remains a very high bar. A roughly 1-in-5 chance of failure seems too pessimistic. My updated forecast of 90% incorporates a ~2% chance of technical/administrative error (my original risk), and now adds an ~8% chance for a political outcome (either legislative or executive) leading to the page's removal.",
