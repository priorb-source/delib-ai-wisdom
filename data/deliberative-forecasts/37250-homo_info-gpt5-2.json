    "review": "Forecaster 2 adds a key legal point I hadn’t explicitly weighed: a unanimous Supreme Court directive to “facilitate” return and active district court supervision. That does increase the plausibility of compliance pressure and a late-June return if the executive chooses to move. However, the missed April 7 deadline and the “facilitate” (vs. compel-by-date-certain) language suggest ongoing resistance and room for delay. Forecaster 3 introduces critical new constraints on the Salvadoran side: reported maximum-security detention, Bukele’s public refusal to release/return, and no visible U.S. executive-branch push. If accurate, that removes the “independent re-entry” path and creates a second veto player, materially reducing the odds within a 2‑month window. I find F2’s 40% too high given dual resistance and timeline; F3’s 3% may be slightly low because courts can escalate (contempt, personal sanctions) and a quiet bilateral deal or humanitarian parole transfer isn’t impossible. Overall, F3’s structural arguments weigh more heavily than F2’s legal optimism on this timeline.",
    "rationale": "Roughly 61 days remain. The status quo is delay and foot‑dragging despite court oversight, with at least one missed deadline; that usually implies additional time-consuming litigation (enforcement, contempt) and opportunities for stays. If Garcia is indeed in Salvadoran custody and Bukele has publicly rejected release, return requires both Salvadoran cooperation and U.S. execution—two hurdles in a politically adversarial environment. Courts can coerce U.S. compliance but cannot directly compel El Salvador; extracting compliance through contempt typically takes time. The “facilitate” phrasing is weaker than a hard mandate, and the administration has political incentives to avoid an optics-heavy repatriation before July 1. A Yes outcome most plausibly comes from (a) a coercive, near-term court order without a stay plus visible DHS action and Salvadoran agreement to transfer, or (b) a quiet bilateral deal on humanitarian or diplomatic grounds. Both are possible but not likely within ~2 months. Conversely, any appellate stay, further slipped deadlines, or formal Salvadoran charges would push chances even lower. Given new info about Salvadoran detention/refusal, I update down modestly from my prior 9% to reflect the second veto player while retaining a small tail for court-driven or diplomatic resolution.",
