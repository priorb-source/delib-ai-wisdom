    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Approximately 3-4 months. Assuming UFC 316 takes place in late summer/early fall of 2025, which would be the approximate timeframe given the current UFC PPV schedule.",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No. The fight between Merab Dvalishvili and Sean O'Malley is not yet officially scheduled for UFC 316. The status quo is that no fight is confirmed. If this state persists and the fight does not happen at this specific event, the question resolves to No.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "The fight between Dvalishvili and O'Malley at UFC 316 is cancelled due to one of the fighters sustaining an injury in training camp. As Dvalishvili would not be fighting O'Malley at UFC 316, the question would resolve to No. Alternatively, the fight happens, and Sean O'Malley successfully defends Dvalishvili's takedowns and wins via TKO.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "The fight is officially confirmed and takes place at UFC 316. Dvalishvili successfully implements his high-pressure, wrestling-heavy game plan, tiring O'Malley out and securing a victory via a 5-round unanimous decision.",
    "rationale": "My forecast is based on two key probabilities: 1) the probability that the fight actually takes place at UFC 316 as specified, and 2) the probability that Merab Dvalishvili wins, given the fight happens. This question assumes their first fight at UFC 306 has already occurred and that a rematch is taking place. \n\nFirst, the fight must occur at UFC 316 for a 'Yes' outcome. High-profile MMA fights are frequently subject to cancellation or postponement due to injuries, contract issues, or other unforeseen circumstances. Since the fight is not yet officially announced, there is a tangible risk it may not materialize for this specific event. I estimate an 80% probability that the fight is booked and successfully takes place at UFC 316.\n\nSecond, conditional on the fight happening, I must assess the matchup. This is a classic elite striker (O'Malley) vs. elite grappler (Dvalishvili) contest. Dvalishvili's primary weapon is his relentless wrestling pace and seemingly bottomless gas tank, a style that has overwhelmed numerous top contenders. O'Malley's path to victory lies in keeping the fight at a distance, using his superior length and striking precision to find a knockout. While O'Malley is a dangerous finisher, Dvalishvili's durability and smothering style present a difficult puzzle to solve over a 25-minute championship fight. The initial betting odds for their first scheduled encounter favored Dvalishvili, and I believe this stylistic advantage persists. I assess Dvalishvili's probability of winning the fight at 60%.\n\nMy final probability is the product of these two factors (0.80 * 0.60), which equals 0.48, or 48%.\n\nThis forecast is not higher primarily because of the dual uncertainty. The 20% chance the fight doesn't happen at all is significant, and O'Malley’s knockout power cannot be understated, providing him with a clear and constant win condition. The forecast is not lower because Dvalishvili's style is historically a very effective antidote to strikers like O'Malley, and it is reasonable to assume this highly anticipated rematch will be booked. I would increase my forecast if the fight were officially announced and both fighters entered their camps healthy. I would decrease it upon hearing of any potential injury to Dvalishvili or if reports suggest O'Malley has made significant, game-changing improvements to his grappling defense.",
