    "review": "Both Forecaster 2 and Forecaster 3 provide sound, logical analyses based on the information they have. Forecaster 2 correctly identifies that only one report is needed, which is a low bar, and appropriately weighs the recent December 2024 data. Forecaster 3 provides an excellent framing of the problem, considering NUFORC's taxonomy, the low historical base rate of 'Cube' shapes, and the effect of higher summer reporting volumes. The most valuable point raised that I had not explicitly articulated was Forecaster 3's concern about the narrowness of the 'Cube' label, where near-misses like 'Box' or 'Rectangle' would not count.\n\nThe critical point of divergence is the data underpinning our base rates. Both other forecasters appear to be treating the December 2024 data point as a potential one-off anomaly and are weighing the long-term historical rarity of 'cube' reports more heavily. Crucially, both forecasters state they would update their forecasts upward if they had evidence of a continuing trend in 2025. My initial analysis included this key piece of information which they were missing.",
    "rationale": "I will not be changing my forecast. The deliberation has reinforced my conviction in my initial analysis. The primary reason for the difference between my 85% forecast and the others (65% and 45%) is an informational advantage. My initial research showed that reports of cube-shaped UFOs have continued to appear on NUFORC every single month from January through April 2025, in addition to the six in December 2024. This establishes a powerful, 5-month, uninterrupted trend.\n\nThis recent, consistent trend is far more predictive than NUFORC's long-term historical average. While Forecaster 3's point about the narrowness of the 'Cube' label is well-taken, it is the primary reason my forecast is not higher (e.g., >90%). It accounts for the possibility of miscategorization or a witness using different terminology. However, given that at least one report has successfully been categorized as 'Cube' for five consecutive months, the status quo is that this will continue. The other forecasters' analyses are sound but are based on an incomplete picture of the most recent and relevant data. Since their own stated update conditions are met by my evidence, their reasoning actually leads me to be more confident in my higher forecast.",
