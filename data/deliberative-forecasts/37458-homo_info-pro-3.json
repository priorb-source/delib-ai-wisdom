    "review": "The other forecasters provided critical context that I had either overlooked or was not aware of. Forecaster 2's analysis, focusing on the recent, explicit public statements from both sides ruling out immediate talks and highlighting China's denial of previous conversations, is highly persuasive. This argument substantially weakens the 'birthday summit' narrative I initially favored, as it underscores the high level of public friction and the difficulty of meeting the mutual acknowledgement criterion. Forecaster 3 introduced a key piece of new information: the high-level meeting in Geneva on May 10-11. This provides a concrete, alternative pathway to a 'Yes' outcome that I had not considered. I find the reasoning from both forecasters to be sound and a necessary corrective to my initial, more optimistic assessment.",
    "rationale": "I am significantly updating my forecast downward from 40% to 20%. The arguments from the other forecasters have convinced me that my initial assessment was too high. Forecaster 2's emphasis on the official denials from both the White House and China's Foreign Ministry severely undermines the credibility or progress of any 'birthday summit' discussions. The present diplomatic friction makes the specific resolution requirement of mutual acknowledgement a very high bar. Therefore, the status quo is more entrenched than I first believed. However, I am not updating as low as 10% because Forecaster 3 introduced the important context of the imminent Geneva talks. While the probability of a major breakthrough is low, this meeting represents a specific, plausible catalyst for a leader-level call that did not exist in my prior analysis. My new forecast of 20% aligns with Forecaster 3's and reflects a synthesis of the new arguments: the base rate for a call is very low due to public friction (per Forecaster 2), but there is a specific, upcoming event that provides a narrow, but non-zero, path to a 'Yes' outcome (per Forecaster 3).",
