    "status_quo_outcome": "No - The objective remains marked as 'in progress' rather than 'complete'",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "The Trump administration proposes budget cuts or takes preliminary steps toward defunding NPR and PBS, but the spreadsheet maintainers determine these actions don't meet the threshold for marking the objective as 'complete.' This could be because legislation hasn't passed, actual funding hasn't been cut yet, or implementation hasn't occurred. The spreadsheet continues to show 'in progress' through July 1.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "The Trump administration takes definitive action to eliminate federal funding for NPR and PBS - such as issuing executive orders redirecting CPB funds, Congress passes appropriations that zero out funding, or the administration successfully implements budget cuts. The Keep_Track subreddit maintainers review these actions and determine they meet their criteria for 'complete,' updating the spreadsheet accordingly before July 1.",
    "rationale": "This question hinges on two factors: (1) whether significant action to defund NPR/PBS occurs in the next 6.5 weeks, and (2) whether the spreadsheet maintainers determine that action meets their threshold for 'complete.' Currently marked 'in progress' suggests preliminary steps have been taken but not finished. Federal funding for public broadcasting flows through the Corporation for Public Broadcasting (CPB), and actually eliminating this funding typically requires Congressional appropriations action, not just executive orders or proposals. While the administration could take steps like submitting budget proposals or issuing directives in 6.5 weeks, fully implementing a funding cut usually takes longer. The critical uncertainty is what the spreadsheet maintainers consider 'complete' - they may require enacted legislation and actual funding cessation, not just proposals or executive action. Given the complexity of the federal budget process and the typical timeline for major appropriations changes, plus the status quo of 'in progress,' the most likely outcome is that the status remains unchanged or only advances partially. For my forecast to be higher, I'd need evidence that: funding cuts are imminent and can be implemented quickly without Congress, or the maintainers use a looser definition of 'complete.' For it to be lower, I'd need evidence that no serious action is being taken or that the maintainers require very high bars for completion. The status quo bias strongly favors No given 'in progress' is not 'complete.'",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill the Project 2025 Tracker spreadsheet have the objective of stopping funding for NPR and PBS marked as complete before July 1, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nAt the time of this question, the objective was marked as \"in progress.\" The 2025 Tracker is a project of the Keep_Track subreddit and is explained [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/Keep_Track/comments/1ii7tbr/project_2025_tracker_is_now_live/).\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if the Project 2025 objective to \"stop funding for NPR and PBS\" is marked as complete according to [this spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1QGG6wNHna-1tt91yXNkOauAJJ7snobFjfEnmxlmzhl4/edit?gid=0#gid=0) before July 1, 2025. If it is anything other than complete (such as \"in progress\") when accessed by Metaculus on or after July 1, 2025, then the question resolves as **No**.\n\n\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nNo additional information available.\n\nToday is 2025-05-16.\n\nBefore answering you think:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n(e) You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
