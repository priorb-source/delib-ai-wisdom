  "information": "Dan Osborn, an independent from Nebraska, is exploring a potential run for the U.S. Senate in 2026 against incumbent Republican Pete Ricketts. In early April 2025, Osborn formed an exploratory committee. He previously ran for the Senate in 2024 against Deb Fischer, losing by approximately six percentage points in a race that attracted $14 million in fundraising. Osborn has also launched a political action committee, the Working Class Heroes Fund, aimed at training and supporting working-class candidates for office. In public statements regarding a potential 2026 run, Osborn has framed the race as a choice to \"replace a billionaire with a mechanic.\"",

    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Approximately 38 days until June 1, 2025",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No - Dan Osborn has formed an exploratory committee but has not formally announced his candidacy",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Osborn's exploratory committee continues its work through May 2025, but he decides to take more time before making a formal announcement, either waiting to build more support, secure additional funding commitments, or timing the announcement strategically for later in 2025 when it might generate more attention closer to the 2026 election cycle.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "After 6-8 weeks of exploratory work, Osborn determines the path forward is viable and makes a formal campaign announcement in mid-to-late May 2025, capitalizing on the momentum from his 2024 race and the recent formation of his exploratory committee and PAC.",
    "rationale": "Dan Osborn formed an exploratory committee in early April 2025, meaning only 2-3 weeks have passed as of April 23. This is a strong signal of intent to run, especially given his recent Senate race in 2024 where he performed competitively and raised $14 million. However, the key question is timing - will he announce in the next 38 days? Factors favoring a YES outcome: (1) He has momentum and infrastructure from his 2024 race; (2) 6-8 weeks is sufficient time for exploratory work, particularly for someone who already knows the landscape; (3) He's already building additional infrastructure like the Working Class Heroes Fund; (4) He has clear messaging prepared. Factors favoring a NO outcome: (1) The 2026 election is 18 months away - there's no urgent need to announce now; (2) Exploratory committees often last several months, not weeks; (3) Strategic timing might favor a later announcement closer to the election cycle; (4) He may want more time to secure commitments and build support. While Osborn appears very likely to eventually run, the compressed timeframe creates uncertainty. A 6-8 week exploratory period would be on the faster end but not unprecedented. I weight this toward YES (65%) because his recent actions suggest urgency and readiness, but assign substantial probability to NO (35%) because waiting until summer or fall 2025 would also be strategically reasonable. I would update higher if reports emerge of imminent announcement plans or fundraising events scheduled; I would update lower if statements suggest a longer exploratory process or if key staffing decisions remain incomplete.",
