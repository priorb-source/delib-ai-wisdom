    "review": "Forecaster 2 adds useful near-term data points (Jan–Mar reportedly sub-63¢) and emphasizes rounding risk at the threshold. If those prints are accurate, the “status quo” does tilt toward Yes absent new shocks, and the reminder that 0.6295 would report as 0.630 (resolving No) is a key nuance. Forecaster 3 introduces a potentially material new input: a 10% U.S. tariff effective Apr 5, 2025. If true, perishability and weekly retail pricing suggest relatively quick pass‑through and a higher May print. That would flip the bias to No and makes a sub‑$0.6300 outcome less likely. I find F2’s stability argument plausible but likely overconfident given the strict cutoff and pass‑through risk; I find F3’s directional argument convincing, but I cannot independently verify the tariff’s implementation here, so I won’t weight it as certain.",
    "rationale": "Netting the arguments: (1) Early‑2025 sub‑63¢ prints (if correct) mean the series doesn’t need to fall to get under—supportive for Yes. (2) However, upstream pressures (Dole’s higher fruit and shipping costs) and the possibility of a new 10% tariff from April raise the mean and the variance for May, with rounding working against Yes near 63.0¢. Bananas’ month‑to‑month volatility is small, but a modest 1–2¢ rise from March/April would be enough to resolve No, and May would likely reflect a fuller month of any April cost shock than April’s CPI did. Given these, I keep a low Yes probability and nudge it slightly down to reflect the potential tariff pass‑through while acknowledging F2’s near‑term sub‑63 data. What would move me: If April (due imminently) prints ≤0.626, I’d move up to ~35–45% despite tariff risk; if April prints ≥0.634 or there’s confirmation of broad pass‑through of a tariff/fees, I’d move down to ~10–15%.",
