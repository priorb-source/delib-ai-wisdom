  "information": "In early March 2025, during the inauguration of President Yamandú Orsi in Montevideo, Brazilian President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva publicly invited Uruguay, Colombia, and Mexico to the BRICS summit scheduled for July in Rio de Janeiro. Lula stated, 'it's essential that these countries participate, because it's a moment for debate with the whole world.' Following the invitation, President Orsi expressed interest in participating, stating he hoped other Latin American countries would join to 'consolidate multilateralism and free trade.'\n\nPresident Yamandú Orsi is confirmed to travel to Seville, Spain, to attend the Fourth International Conference on Sustainable Development Financing. This United Nations conference is scheduled to run from June 30 to July 3, 2025. President Orsi has reaffirmed Uruguay's commitment to multilateralism, stating that his government will be in Seville to 'strengthen and commit' to the UN's objectives.\n\nAs of early June 2025, the government of Uruguay had not issued an official public statement confirming or denying President Orsi's attendance at the BRICS summit. Media coverage at the time described the country's participation as 'undecided' or 'up in the air.' The BRICS summit is scheduled to take place in Rio de Janeiro on July 6-7, 2025. Other leaders, including India's Prime Minister Narendra Modi, are planning to attend.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "25 days (resolves July 1, 2025)",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No. No official announcement confirming President Orsi's attendance has been made. If no announcement is made by the deadline, the question resolves as No.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "The government of Uruguay prioritizes President Orsi's confirmed attendance at the UN conference in Seville, which ends July 3. Due to the logistical difficulty of traveling from Spain to Brazil for the BRICS summit on July 6-7, no announcement of his attendance is made by the July 1 deadline.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "The Uruguayan government determines that attending the BRICS summit is a strategic priority. It releases an official statement before July 1 confirming President Orsi will travel directly from the conference in Seville to the summit in Rio de Janeiro.",
    "rationale": "My forecast is primarily based on a significant and confirmed logistical constraint. President Orsi is scheduled to attend a UN conference in Seville, Spain, from June 30 to July 3, 2025. The BRICS summit is in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, on July 6-7. While travel between the two events is technically possible, the schedule is extremely tight, involving intercontinental travel and leaving little time for rest or preparation between two major summits. The fact that Uruguay has confirmed its attendance in Seville but remains silent on BRICS less than a month before the deadline is a strong indicator of its priorities. The status quo is 'no announcement,' which leads to a 'No' resolution. The logistical challenge provides a convenient and politically neutral reason for the President to abstain without snubbing the invitation from Brazil's Lula. The probability is not lower because the political will to engage with BRICS and maintain strong ties with Brazil is significant. Diplomatic and travel arrangements can change quickly, and a last-minute decision to attend is still possible. The probability is not higher because the logistical hurdle is a concrete, high-impact barrier, and the continued silence from Montevideo suggests they are leaning against attendance. I would raise my forecast if any reliable reports emerge that the Uruguayan government is actively working to solve the travel logistics. Conversely, I would lower it if they announce a different official, like the foreign minister, will represent the country.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill the government of Uruguay announce that its president, Yamandú Orsi, will attend the BRICS summit in July 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\n[Lula invites Mexico, Colombia, and Uruguay to BRICS Summit](https://en.mercopress.com/2025/03/04/lula-invites-mexico-colombia-and-uruguay-to-brics-summit#google_vignette) | [Uruguay’s participation at the BRICS summit still up in the air](https://www.plenglish.com/news/2025/03/02/uruguays-participation-at-the-brics-summit-still-up-in-the-air/)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if before July 1, 2025 the government of Uruguay, or anyone speaking on its behalf, issues any sort of public communication (written or oral) confirming its acceptance of the invitation for President Yamandú Orsi to attend in person the BRICS Summit scheduled to take place in Rio de Janeiro in July 2025.\n\nSince the summit will be held after this question resolves, actual attendance is not required, merely the announcement of plans to attend.\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nIn early March 2025, during the inauguration of President Yamandú Orsi in Montevideo, Brazilian President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva publicly invited Uruguay, Colombia, and Mexico to the BRICS summit scheduled for July in Rio de Janeiro.

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
