    "review": "Both forecasters converge on the same core points I considered: (1) NYT style and U.S. media usage make the exact strings “reverse purchasing”/“reverse purchase” unlikely; (2) the window is very narrow (June 10–30); (3) plausible hooks exist (China trend; Russia asset policy), but translation and editor choices are headwinds; (4) “reverse repurchase” won’t qualify per the quoted search. They also emphasize that adoption by wires (Reuters/AP/Bloomberg) would be a key leading indicator, and that NYT might only use the phrase if explicitly quoting a neologism—points I agree with. I didn’t see new evidence that materially raises the likelihood beyond my prior; their reasoning mostly reinforces my initial view.",
    "rationale": "The resolution hinges on the NYT search for the exact quoted strings between June 10 and June 30. Historical NYT style favors “repurchase/buyback” or “reverse repurchase,” not “reverse purchase/purchasing.” The China tourist-shopping angle could prompt a feature that quotes “reverse purchasing,” but absent clear Western uptake, NYT is more likely to translate or paraphrase differently (e.g., “reverse shopping”). The Russia policy could resurface in mid/late June, yet Western coverage typically uses “buyback”/“repurchase.” Given the short window and specificity, the base rate remains low. There’s a nonzero chance via a one-off quoted usage in a trend piece or newsletter, but I see no new catalysts to move my estimate. I’m holding my forecast.",
