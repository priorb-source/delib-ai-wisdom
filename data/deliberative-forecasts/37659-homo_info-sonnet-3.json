    "review": "Forecaster 2 presents game-changing concrete data that I lacked: as of April 16, 105 objectives were done with 44 in progress. This is critically important because it establishes the current baseline is much higher than I estimated (60-90). If accurate, this dramatically shifts the probability landscape. The mathematical case is compelling: only 15 more objectives needed over 76 days (0.197/day required) versus observed recent rates of 0.625/day. Even with a 75% slowdown, the target would be reached. Forecaster 2's identification of 44 'in progress' objectives provides additional confidence in a pipeline of completions. Forecaster 3's analysis mirrors my original uncertainty but lacks this crucial baseline data. The main weakness in Forecaster 2's analysis is that the April 16 data is now one month old, and we don't know the current state as of mid-May. However, even accounting for this lag and potential slowdowns, the mathematical margin appears comfortable.",
    "rationale": "I am significantly updating my forecast upward based on Forecaster 2's concrete baseline data. My original 40% was predicated on uncertainty about current counts and assumed a baseline around 60-90 objectives. If the actual baseline as of April 16 was 105, then by mid-May it could plausibly be 110-115 or higher given recent completion rates. This puts the target of 120 well within reach with 46 days remaining. The required completion rate is extremely low compared to observed trends, and the 44 objectives in progress suggest a healthy pipeline. My forecast is not as high as Forecaster 2's 87% for several reasons: (1) the April 16 data is one month old and unverified by me directly, (2) rates could have slowed in May due to political/legal challenges, (3) later objectives may be inherently more difficult than early wins, and (4) tracker methodology could change. However, the mathematical margin is substantial enough that even with conservative assumptions about slowdowns or obstacles, the probability of reaching 120 appears considerably higher than my initial estimate. A 72% forecast reflects high confidence based on the strong baseline and comfortable margin, while maintaining appropriate caution about data age and potential unforeseen obstacles.",
