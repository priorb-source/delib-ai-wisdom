  "information": "Between May 2023 and June 2024, the US government documented 757 reports of Unidentified Aerial Phenomena (UAPs), with 708 of them occurring in the air. Of these, only 49 cases were officially closed. A notable number of these sightings occurred near the U.S.-Mexico border, particularly in Arizona. Media reports have covered recent military-related incidents, including a US Air Force F-16 fighter jet that was struck and damaged by an object over Arizona in January 2023. In a separate event from September 2024, a US Air Force pilot reported a close encounter with an object traveling at Mach 2 during a mission in California.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "About 39 days (until Metaculus checks on/after 2025-07-01)",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No — recent monthly NUFORC totals outside of July are typically below 400; June is elevated vs winter but usually not a July-level spike.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Normal early-summer uptick (more people outdoors, clearer skies) yields something like 280–380 reports; no major viral sky events or national UAP media surge; some late-June reports arrive after July 1 and don’t count for resolution.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Multiple widely visible Starlink trains or re-entry events produce waves of sightings across many states; clear weather and a viral social-media clip drive reporting; or a high-profile UAP news cycle boosts public awareness and submission rates, pushing June’s count above 400 by July 1.",
    "rationale": "Baseline: NUFORC monthly counts show strong seasonality with July commonly the peak (holiday fireworks, more skywatching). June is often above winter months but historically less likely to exceed a higher threshold like 400. The July 1 check introduces a slight downward bias because NUFORC posts can lag; late-June reports may be posted after July 1 and not count for this resolution, which tilts odds toward No. Countervailing factors: Summer increases general reporting, and modern drivers (e.g., Starlink trains that are easily visible at twilight across large regions) can create short-lived surges that push a month over a threshold. The research assistant’s note about government UAP reports (757 over ~13 months) indicates steady attention but is only loosely related to NUFORC citizen reports; it slightly supports a background of ongoing interest but doesn’t by itself imply a June spike above 400. Why not higher: 400 is above what I expect for an average June absent special triggers, and the July 1 cutoff likely excludes some late postings. Why not lower: June’s seasonality, frequent Starlink launches, and the potential for a viral event create a meaningful tail-risk of exceeding 400. What would move me up: Early/mid-June widespread Starlink train visibility across the U.S., clusters of media-covered sightings, or NUFORC indicating unusually high submission volumes. What would move me down: Poor weather across much of the U.S. on multiple weekends/evenings, NUFORC site/backlog issues, or evident lack of any notable sky events through mid-June.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill the number of UFO sightings reported by the National UFO Reporting Center exceed 400 for June 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nAccording to the [National UFO Reporting Center](https://nuforc.org/about-us/): \"The National UFO Reporting Center was founded in 1974 by noted UFO investigator Robert J. Gribble. The Center’s primary function over the past five decades has been to receive, record, and to the greatest degree possible, corroborate and document reports from individuals who have been witness to unusual, possibly UFO-related events. Throughout its history, the Center has processed over 180,000 reports, and has distributed its information to thousands of individuals.\"\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if The National UFO Reporting Center posts greater than 400 UFO/UAP sighting reports at [this link](https://nuforc.org/ndx/?id=event) for the month of June 2025, as displayed when accessed by Metaculus on or after July 1, 2025.\n\n\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nBetween May 2023 and June 2024, the US government documented 757 reports of Unidentified Aerial Phenomena (UAPs), with 708 of them occurring in the air. Of these, only 49 cases were officially closed. A notable number of these sightings occurred near the U.S.-Mexico border, particularly in Arizona.

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
