  "information": "Inflation expectations remain a significant concern for consumers. The May University of Michigan survey showed consumer expectations for inflation over the next year increased to 7.3% from 6.5% in April, while long-term inflation expectations rose to 4.6% from 4.4%. Trade policy is also a major factor; according to the survey's director, Joanne Hsu, nearly three-quarters of consumers mentioned tariffs and trade policies as a source of uncertainty. Recent policy actions include the doubling of US steel tariffs. Federal Reserve governor Christopher Waller has outlined a potential path to interest rate cuts later in the year but noted this depends on how trade negotiations unfold and on progress toward the Fed's 2% inflation goal.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Approximately 3 weeks, as the report is expected on the final Friday of June 2025 (June 27, 2025).",
    "status_quo_outcome": "Yes. The current environment, characterized by elevated inflation expectations and significant consumer concern over tariffs and trade policy, is unlikely to improve substantially in the short term. The recent 'plunge' in sentiment suggests momentum is negative, and a continuation of these conditions would likely keep the index below the low threshold of 54.0.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "The index is greater than or equal to 54.0. This scenario would likely be driven by unexpected positive economic news in June, such as a surprisingly low inflation report for May, a significant drop in gasoline prices, or a major de-escalation in trade tensions. Such events could provide a sufficient boost to consumer confidence to prevent the index from falling below 54.0.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "The index is less than 54.0. This outcome becomes highly probable if the current negative factors persist or worsen. An escalation in trade disputes with new tariffs, a disappointing May inflation report confirming stubborn price pressures, or a weakening labor market would reinforce consumer pessimism and almost certainly push the sentiment index below 54.0.",
    "rationale": "My forecast is based on the significant headwinds identified in the research report, primarily persistent inflation fears and acute uncertainty surrounding trade policy. The data showing year-ahead inflation expectations rising to 7.3% and nearly three-quarters of consumers citing tariffs as a concern are strong indicators of deep-seated pessimism. This environment has already led to a 'plunge' in sentiment, and such a sharp downturn is unlikely to reverse course within a single month without a major positive catalyst. The status quo heavily favors a continuation of weak sentiment.\n\nMy forecast is not higher (e.g., 75%) because the 54.0 threshold is historically very low, and consumer sentiment can be volatile. A single piece of significant good news, such as a surprisingly cool inflation report or a breakthrough in trade talks, could be enough to buoy sentiment above this level.\n\nMy forecast is not lower (e.g., 55%) because a 'No' outcome is plausible. The labor market might remain a source of resilience for households, and it is possible that the recent plunge has already priced in the worst of the current news, leading to a stabilization of the index, even if at a low level. \n\nI would increase my probability for 'Yes' if we see an escalation in trade wars or if the May inflation data (released in June) comes in hotter than expected. I would decrease my probability if there is a clear de-escalation on the trade front or if inflation shows a marked and unexpected decline.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill the June 2025 University of Michigan Consumer Sentiment Final Report number be less than 54.0?\n\nQuestion background:\nAxios: [Why the consumer sentiment plunge is different now](https://www.axios.com/2025/05/19/tariffs-consumer-economy-sentiment)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if the University of Michigan's reported June Final Results of the Index of Consumer Sentiment, expected to be posted [here](https://data.sca.isr.umich.edu/reports.php) on the final Friday of June 2025, is less than 54.0 for June 2025.

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
