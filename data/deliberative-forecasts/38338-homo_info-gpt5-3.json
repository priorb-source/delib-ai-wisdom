    "review": "Both analyses are strong. Forecaster 2 surfaced a key detail I hadn’t explicitly incorporated: Morgan’s stated preference for a short, ~three‑month campaign after observing the field. If accurate, that meaningfully lowers the near‑term hazard, since it implies a much later declaration. Forecaster 2 also leans on Morgan’s history of not pulling the trigger, which I agree depresses odds over a short window. Forecaster 3 adds useful context on the nascent centrist party effort (“Capitalist Party”/#ForThePeople), which raises the seriousness signal but also highlights operational complexity that makes a June announcement less necessary. I find F2’s timing argument particularly persuasive for moving down from my prior, while F3’s party‑building note keeps the probability from falling too low given the possibility of a splashy rollout if paperwork is ready. I don’t see new evidence of imminent staff hires, filings, or event plans that would justify a higher number.",
    "rationale": "I’m updating down from 27% to 19%. The main driver is the Politico‑reported plan to wait and, if running, conduct a brief campaign—suggesting no need to declare in June 2025. The short remaining window and lack of observed precursors (committee filings, senior staff hires, venue bookings, or credible reporting of an impending launch) also argue for a low daily hazard. Countervailing factors keep the probability non‑trivial: Morgan is wealthy, enjoys media attention, has publicly laid out a blueprint, and appears to be building infrastructure around a potential new party—any of which could culminate in a surprise June announcement. Netting these, a sub‑20% but not de minimis probability best reflects the current signals and the short timeline.",
