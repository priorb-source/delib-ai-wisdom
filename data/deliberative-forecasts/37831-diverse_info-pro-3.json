    "review": "My initial forecast was 5%. Forecaster 2's analysis, at 4%, strongly reinforced my original reasoning by emphasizing the extremely short timeline, the junta's need to project strength, and its documented resistance to international pressure (e.g., leaving ECOWAS). This deliberation confirmed the high unlikelihood of a voluntary reversal. However, Forecaster 3, at 10%, introduced a crucial argument I had not fully weighed: the existence of formal legal challenges and an appeal to Mali's Supreme Court. While acknowledging the low probability of success due to questionable judicial independence, this presents a specific, institutional pathway to a reversal that is distinct from external pressure or popular revolt. This argument is convincing enough to merit an upward adjustment, as it provides a concrete, albeit unlikely, scenario for a 'Yes' outcome.",
    "rationale": "I am updating my forecast from 5% to 7%. My core reasoning remains that a voluntary reversal by the junta in such a short timeframe is highly improbable, as it would severely undermine their authority. The arguments from Forecaster 2 further solidify this view. However, Forecaster 3's point about the ongoing lawsuits and appeals to the Supreme Court introduces a new, plausible mechanism for a 'Yes' resolution. A court ruling against the decree could, in theory, compel the government to announce a reversal, potentially providing them with a face-saving way to back down if other internal or external pressures were also mounting. The likelihood of the court ruling against the junta *and* the junta complying within the next month is very small, but it is a non-trivial possibility that I had previously overlooked. This specific legal pathway is a more defined risk than the general 'instability' I had initially considered, thus warranting a minor upward adjustment of 2 percentage points. I remain below 10% because I believe the odds of this legal challenge succeeding so quickly and decisively remain very low.",
