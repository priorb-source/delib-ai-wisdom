    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "About 16 days (through May 8, 2025)",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No (as of today, he has not yet won an ACM award this cycle)",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Despite four nominations, he’s shut out in competitive categories as voters favor core country stalwarts; his big collaboration loses Single/Song-type awards to more traditional or critically favored tracks, and collaboration/visual categories go to rivals.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "He converts one of his four nominations—most plausibly a high-profile track or collaboration—into a win (e.g., a radio/streaming-dominant single or a collaboration category).",
    "rationale": "Timing: The awards are ~2 weeks away, so little new information is likely beyond last-minute industry chatter. Status quo favors No simply because no wins have occurred yet, but awards-night outcomes can shift quickly once categories start announcing.\nBase rates and structure: An artist with four nominations at a major awards show typically has better-than-even odds to win at least one category. Even without exact ACM historical rates, multiple nods generally correlate with at least one win in a majority of cases. However, categories can be correlated: if the same song is either in or out of favor with voters, results can be all-or-nothing, which lowers the “at least one” probability versus assuming independence.\nEvidence and context: Post Malone’s country pivot produced very high-visibility, commercially dominant work in the eligibility window, and collaborations broaden appeal among ACM voters. That boosts his chances in radio/streaming-weighted or collaboration-leaning categories. Offsetting factors: ACM voters often reward core country artists and songwriter-driven material; as a relative newcomer to country awards, Malone could face resistance in marquee categories. Competition in 2025 is likely strong among established award winners, keeping his per-category win probability moderate rather than high.\nWhy not higher: Category competitiveness, possible voter preference for traditional acts, and correlation risk across his nominated entries.\nWhy not lower: Four nominations, massive commercial impact, and collaboration dynamics imply a solid chance to land at least one win.\nWhat would move me up: Credible reporting of strong voter sentiment in his favor, odds-shift from industry insiders, or early/pre-telecast category wins. What would move me down: Reports that rival tracks are consensus favorites, early losses in overlapping categories, or indications of voter backlash toward pop crossover entries.\nResearch assistant note: No additional information provided; forecast relies on general award dynamics and known nomination count.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill Post Malone win an award at the 60th Academy of Country Music Awards?\n\nQuestion background:\nThe awards are scheduled to be held on May 8, 2025. Malone has 4 nominations.\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if Post Malone wins an award at the [60th Academy of Country Music Awards](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/60th_Academy_of_Country_Music_Awards).\n\n\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nNo additional information available.\n\nToday is 2025-04-22.\n\nBefore answering you think:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n(e) You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
