  "information": "As of late April 2025, West Texas Intermediate (WTI) oil prices were around $64-$65 per barrel, after the American Petroleum Institute reported a decrease of 4.565 million barrels in U.S. crude oil inventories for the week ending April 18. This price is near the breakeven point for many drilling operations, which is estimated to be around $65 per barrel. A Dallas Fed survey of 130 energy firms in Texas, New Mexico, and Louisiana indicated that firms are dealing with increased costs, reduced rig counts, and layoffs. The survey's company outlook index decreased by 12 points, while the outlook uncertainty index increased by 21 points, with executives citing tariffs on steel (25%) as increasing costs for casing and tubing.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Approximately five weeks. The question resolves based on the report for the week ending May 30, 2025.",
    "status_quo_outcome": "Yes. The current environment of low oil prices relative to costs, coupled with a recent downward trend in rig counts, suggests that without a significant market shift, the number of active rigs will continue to decline or stagnate, ultimately falling below the 583 threshold.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "A significant and sustained rally in WTI crude oil prices, perhaps to over $75 per barrel, occurs in the next month. This could be triggered by an unexpected geopolitical event disrupting global supply or a surprise OPEC+ production cut. This price increase would improve drilling economics enough to halt the decline and potentially encourage producers to reactivate some rigs, pushing the final count to 583 or higher.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "WTI oil prices remain range-bound near the current $65 per barrel breakeven point, or dip lower. Faced with squeezed margins from high input costs (like steel) and continued market uncertainty, energy firms maintain capital discipline and continue to slowly reduce their active rig count. The existing downward trend continues, and the number falls below 583 by the end of May.",
    "rationale": "My forecast is based on the strong confluence of negative indicators for US drilling activity over the short, five-week forecast horizon. The primary driver is the price of WTI crude, which at ~$65 per barrel, is at or near the breakeven point for many producers, offering little incentive to deploy new rigs. This is corroborated by the Dallas Fed survey, which highlights increased costs (e.g., from steel tariffs), a deteriorating company outlook, and rising uncertainty, leading to firms actively reducing rig counts and laying off staff. The reported trend of the rig count falling for consecutive weeks establishes a clear momentum that is unlikely to reverse without a significant external shock. The status quo, which is the most probable path in a short timeframe, points directly to a continued decline in active rigs. \n\nMy probability is not higher than 80% because the oil market is notoriously volatile and susceptible to geopolitical shocks. An unforeseen supply disruption could cause a rapid price spike, altering producer sentiment and rig deployment plans within the forecast window. The rig count is a lagging indicator, but a sharp price signal can halt a decline relatively quickly.\n\nMy probability is not lower than 80% because the current headwinds are substantial and multifaceted. It would require more than a minor price fluctuation to reverse the trend. The combination of weak prices, high costs, and negative corporate sentiment creates significant inertia. For the outcome to be 'No', the market would need a strong positive catalyst to overcome this inertia, which currently seems unlikely.\n\nI would increase my forecast's probability if WTI prices were to fall below $60. I would decrease it if WTI prices rallied and held above $75 or if the weekly rig count reports in early May showed a stabilization or reversal of the downward trend.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill the number of active US drilling rigs be less than 583 for the week ending May 30, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nSeekingAlpha: [U.S. rig count falls for third straight week, Baker Hughes says](https://seekingalpha.com/news/4430543-u-s-rig-count-falls-for-third-straight-week-baker-hughes-says)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if the last count of active US drilling rigs for the week ending May 30, 2025, according to the [Baker Hughes North America Rig Count](https://rigcount.bakerhughes.com/na-rig-count), is less than 583. Specifically, it will resolve based on the number listed as the United States Total for the most recent week in the May 30, 2025 North America Rig Count Report. This is the number of active drilling rigs and includes the total of those classified as gas, oil and miscellaneous, in every US location including inland waters, land and offshore.\n\nIf no report dated May 30, 2025, is released before June 1, 2025, Eastern Time, Metaculus may resolve this question using the most recent report available dated between May 23, 2025, and June 1, 2025, inclusive. If no such report exists, this question will be annulled.\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nAs of late April 2025, West Texas Intermediate (WTI) oil prices were around $64-$65 per barrel, after the American Petroleum Institute reported a decrease of 4.565 million barrels in U.S. crude oil inventories for the week ending April 18.

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
