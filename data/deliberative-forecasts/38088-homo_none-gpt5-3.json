    "review": "- New arguments: Both emphasize a base-rate near 30–35% for U.S. presence around rank 250 and give modest extra weight to the latest observed non-U.S. occupant (Devasini). Forecaster 2 adds the idiosyncratic crypto/Tether linkage for Devasini as a volatility source without directional bias. Forecaster 3 notes potential tailwinds from 2025 U.S. equity strength and USD strength, partially offset by broad non-U.S. representation in the mid-ranks.\n- Persuasiveness: I find the lower base-rate (30–35%) at the mid-list more compelling than my earlier 35–45% assumption, given the U.S. skew at the very top implies relatively less U.S. density in the middle. The status-quo non-U.S. occupant and short horizon justify a slight downward tilt. The crypto linkage increases variance but not a directional push toward U.S., which also argues against raising the estimate.\n- Net: Their points nudge me down modestly from my prior 40%.",
    "rationale": "I update my base-rate for a U.S. billionaire at rank ~250 from roughly upper-30s/low-40s to low/mid-30s, reflecting that the U.S. over-indexes at the top of the list and the mid-ranks are more internationally diversified. I give some weight to the April 30 non-U.S. status quo and the short time until July 1, both favoring No. Countervailing factors (potential U.S. equity outperformance and possible USD strength into late June) provide a small upward nudge but are not enough to offset the base and status-quo considerations. The idiosyncratic volatility around Devasini’s crypto-linked wealth widens uncertainty yet doesn’t systematically raise the chance that a U.S. person sits exactly at #250 on the reference date. Overall, I trim my forecast modestly.\nChange: 40% → 36%, driven by revising the base-rate downward and modestly weighting the latest observed non-U.S. occupant with limited time remaining.",
