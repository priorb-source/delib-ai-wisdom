    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Approximately 6-7 weeks until July 1, 2025. We are currently late in the Texas legislative session (which typically runs January through late May/early June).",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No - Texas does not enact a full ban on THC sales before July 1, 2025",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "The legislative session ends in late May without a THC ban bill passing both chambers of the Texas Legislature and being signed by the governor. Either the bill dies in committee, fails to pass one or both chambers, or runs out of time due to the approaching end of session. The existing legal framework remains in place.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "A bill banning the sale of THC rapidly moves through both the Texas House and Senate in the remaining days of the legislative session, passes both chambers, and is signed by Governor Greg Abbott before July 1, 2025. This would require swift action on what appears to be a contentious issue with lobbying on both sides.",
    "rationale": "The key challenge is timing. Texas operates on a biennial legislative session that meets for 140 days in odd-numbered years, starting in January. We're currently on May 14, 2025, meaning the regular session is nearing its end (late May/early June). The article headline suggests there is legislative activity on banning THC, but my research assistant found no additional information about the bill's status or progress. This lack of concrete information is itself informative - if a major ban were close to passage, we would likely see more news coverage and details about its legislative movement. For a Yes outcome to occur, several things must happen quickly: (1) the bill must clear any remaining committee hurdles, (2) pass both the House and Senate, and (3) be signed by the governor - all within roughly 6-7 weeks, with much of that time at the tail end of a legislative session when many bills die. Legislative processes are inherently slow, and controversial bills face additional hurdles from lobbying, debate, and potential amendments. The hemp-derived THC industry has grown substantially and would likely mount opposition. Status quo bias strongly favors No, as most proposed legislation fails to become law. I'm not lower (e.g., 5%) because the article indicates active legislative consideration and Texas is a conservative state that could support such a ban. I'm not higher (e.g., 40%+) because we lack evidence the bill has advanced significantly, time is extremely limited, and most bills fail even under better circumstances. I would update upward if I saw evidence the bill had already passed one chamber or had strong bipartisan support with fast-tracking. I would update downward if the session ends without passage or if the bill were to die in committee.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill the state of Texas ban THC before July 1, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nBeaumont Enterprise: [Will THC see its final death blow in Texas this session?](https://www.beaumontenterprise.com/news/article/texas-senate-bill-aims-ban-thc-activists-call-20279801.php)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if before July 1, 2025, Texas enacts a law prohibiting the sale of THC. If no new prohibitions on the sale of THC become law in Texas before that date, this question resolves as No.\n\nFor it to count, a law must fully prohibit the sale of THC within the state. This question resolves upon a ban being signed into law, rather than when it is implemented. An enacted law being later overturned will not cause the question to re-resolve. Partial bans (for example laws prohibiting the sale of THC to persons under 21 years of age) will not count. This question pertains to the sale of THC within the state, not to the purchase of it by individuals.\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nNo additional information available.\n\nToday is 2025-05-14.\n\nBefore answering you think:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n(e) You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
