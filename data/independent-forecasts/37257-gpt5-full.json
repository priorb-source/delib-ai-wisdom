  "information": "As of early May 2025, Republika Srpska (RS) has taken several legislative and political steps. A draft for a new constitution, which includes rights to self-determination and provisions for confederal relationships, completed its public consultation phase in mid-April 2025. The RS government has also passed laws to ban Bosnia's central judicial, police, and intelligence agencies from operating within its territory. Milorad Dodik, the leader of RS, has stated he is willing to declare independence if the central authorities, with international support, attempt to take control of RS property. Similarly, Nenad Stevanović, President of the RS Parliament, warned that continued pressure would lead to a declaration of independence, stating that RS is a functional entity capable of implementing its decisions independently.\n\nInternational reactions to the political situation in Republika Srpska are varied. The U.S. and EU have expressed strong opposition to secession, with a U.S. envoy labeling RS's proposals as \"secession by another name.\" The U.S. Embassy in Sarajevo has warned that disobeying the decisions of Bosnia's Constitutional Court, such as celebrating the banned January 9th holiday, may constitute a criminal offense. In contrast, Croatian Prime Minister Andrej Plenković has expressed support for Bosnia and Herzegovina's EU membership while voicing concern over secessionist rhetoric from RS, warning that delays in EU integration could allow Russia and China to increase their influence. Russia has appeared supportive of moves by RS, and a Russian military documentary film festival was scheduled to take place in Banja Luka in May 2025.\n\nHistorical and legal precedents provide context for a potential referendum. Bosnia's Constitutional Court has ruled on multiple occasions that celebrating Republika Srpska Day on January 9 is unconstitutional. Despite this, RS held a parade for the banned holiday in January 2025. Analysis of other independence movements shows varying timelines: the process for Catalonia's 2017 referendum took approximately 7-8 months from legislative groundwork to the announcement, while Scotland's 2014 referendum process took about 2 years. In contrast, Crimea's 2014 referendum, under Russian influence, was organized in about two weeks. The political structure of Bosnia and Herzegovina is based on the 1995 Dayton Agreement, which divided the country into two entities: the Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina and Republika Srpska.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "About 60 days (until 2025-07-01)",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Republika Srpska continues legal and political brinkmanship (adopts or advances a new RS constitution with self-determination language, blocks state-level bodies on RS territory, stages symbolic events) but stops short of an explicit, dated independence referendum announcement before July 1. Leaders keep threats conditional on triggers (e.g., state property enforcement) and prefer ambiguity to avoid immediate, heavier sanctions.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "A sharp confrontation over state property or a new OHR/Constitutional Court intervention prompts Dodik and the RS National Assembly to call an emergency session and formally set a referendum date (potentially for late 2025 or a symbolic date like January 9), using the announcement as leverage and a domestic rallying tool. The announcement is made by an RS authority and published through official channels, meeting the criterion even if Bosnia deems it illegal.",
    "rationale": "Time is short and the baseline is inertia. Historically, Dodik escalates rhetorically and passes entity laws challenging state authority but often avoids the most escalatory, discrete steps that trigger maximal Western penalties (e.g., the 2016 referendum on the state judiciary was ultimately shelved/postponed; more recent withdrawals from state institutions have been partial and reversible). The status quo path—pressure without a dated independence referendum—remains the most likely over the next ~60 days.\n\nEvidence from the assistant’s report pushing the probability up from “very low”: RS has completed public consultation on a new constitution that embeds self-determination and confederal notions, passed laws to bar Bosnia’s central judicial/police/intelligence agencies from operating in RS, and staged a parade for the banned January 9 holiday in 2025. Dodik and the RS Assembly president have threatened independence in response to state property enforcement. Russia’s signaling (e.g., cultural events) offers political cover. These moves show capability and willingness to escalate, and scheduling a referendum could be done quickly if leaders choose.\n\nCountervailing factors keeping the probability below 50%: A formal, dated independence referendum would likely trigger immediate, harsher U.S./EU responses, broaden sanctions, jeopardize EU-related funding and projects, and risk regional backlash (including from Serbia, which has incentives to avoid a crisis). RS leaders gain leverage by keeping threats conditional and timelines vague; a formal date removes that ambiguity and forces a showdown. Also, Dodik’s own statements tie extreme steps to specific triggers (e.g., state property), which may or may not materialize before July 1.\n\nWhy not higher: No clear imminent trigger is identified for May–June; the leadership’s track record favors brinkmanship over irrevocable steps; the cost of a dated referendum announcement is high and immediate, while benefits of ambiguity remain attractive.\n\nWhy not lower: The legislative groundwork and rhetoric are unusually advanced; RS institutions can move quickly; a single galvanizing incident (e.g., an attempt by state bodies, backed by internationals, to enforce property rulings inside RS) could induce an emergency scheduling. Even if the vote were slated for months later, the act of scheduling would satisfy resolution.\n\nWhat would move me up: 1) RS National Assembly agendas or drafts explicitly referencing an independence referendum; 2) adoption of the new RS constitution with explicit mechanisms/timelines for independence votes; 3) direct moves by Bosnia’s state bodies to enforce property rulings in RS or new OHR-imposed measures provoking a showdown; 4) overt Russian political backing tied to a referendum; 5) reports of RS forming/activating referendum commissions or logistical preparations.\n\nWhat would move me down: 1) visible de-escalation by RS (e.g., softening of laws or rhetoric, deal-making over property); 2) stronger-than-expected pressure or inducements from the EU/US/Serbia that RS leadership publicly accepts; 3) RS focusing on a constitutional or policy referendum that sidesteps independence language before July 1.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nBefore July 1, 2025, will the government of Republika Srpska officially announce a date for an independence referendum?\n\nQuestion background:\nFair Observer: [Balkan Tinderbox: How Russia’s Moves Could Reignite Bosnia](https://www.fairobserver.com/politics/balkan-tinderbox-how-russias-moves-could-reignite-bosnia/)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if, before July 1, 2025, a referendum on the independence of Republika Srpska from Bosnia and Herzegovina is officially scheduled. If this does not occur before that date, this question resolves as **No**.\n\nFor purposes of this question, the referendum will be considered \"officially scheduled\" when it is announced by a person or entity with the authority to do so within Republika Srpska. Please note that broader legality, such as within Bosnia and Herzegovina, will be considered irrelevant for this question, so if the Bosnian government declared the referendum illegal, the question would still resolve as Yes.\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nAs of early May 2025, Republika Srpska (RS) has taken several legislative and political steps.
