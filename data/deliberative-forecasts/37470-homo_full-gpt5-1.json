    "review": "Both forecasters largely agree on the key constraints and signals. The most useful new point they raise is the event-name ambiguity (World Cup vs World Championship), which increases the risk that Egyptian media references won’t satisfy the resolution criteria unless ITKF explicitly names Egypt as the 2026 World Championship host. They also emphasize, correctly, that the announcement must be on ITKF channels, not just Egyptian sources. On the upside, they stress small-federation flexibility and the lack of visible competing bids, which modestly increases the plausibility of a swift award. I find their reasoning solid; however, their 30–33% feels a bit optimistic given the short window, absence of any official ITKF process cues, and the historical tendency to announce much earlier. The mislabeling risk is a nontrivial downward factor I hadn’t explicitly accounted for before.",
    "rationale": "With ~7 weeks left, the default is no announcement. The assistant’s historical note (24–36 months lead time) suggests 2026 should already have been awarded if following normal cadence. As of mid-May 2025, there’s no ITKF mention of a 2026 bid or timeline, and federations often batch such decisions at scheduled congresses—likely later in the year. The April 29 meeting and Egypt’s strong hosting record create a plausible fast-track path, especially if ITKF needs to lock in a host and faces no rival bids. But the requirement for an explicit ITKF announcement and the event-name ambiguity (World Cup vs World Championship) both dampen the near-term odds. Balancing these, I slightly raise my estimate to reflect potential small-federation agility and the absence of competing bids, while still giving substantial weight to process inertia and timing constraints.",
