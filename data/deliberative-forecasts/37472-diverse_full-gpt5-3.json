    "review": "Both forecasters make a strong case for a No, emphasizing the very short window and the inertia of extradition/return dynamics. New and persuasive to me from Forecaster 3 is the point about India’s long-standing ties with Hasina/Awami League, which makes a rapid extradition especially unlikely absent a major shock; that lowers the likelihood of the involuntary-return path. Forecaster 2’s focus on the slow pace of extraditions and the near-certainty of arrest if she returns reinforces my initial view that voluntary return is low-probability in this window. I still keep a small tail risk for sudden political shifts or a calculated high-profile return, but the combination of India’s probable caution and Hasina’s legal jeopardy argues for nudging the forecast down.",
    "rationale": "Two plausible Yes paths exist: (1) voluntary, politically motivated return; or (2) rapid extradition. Both look unlikely by July 1. Voluntary return would almost certainly trigger immediate detention with severe charges pending (contempt response May 15; probe report due in May potentially escalating legal actions). There are no concrete indicators of preparations for a safe or strategic return, and the interim government is overtly hostile. Extradition within ~7 weeks would require India to move from months of non-response to fast-track cooperation; given India’s historical alignment with Hasina and likely preference to avoid delivering her into a hostile legal process, that path appears especially weak. I retain a modest tail for: a surprise diplomatic bargain, a destabilizing shock in Dhaka that alters risk calculus, or credible reporting of imminent travel. Absent such signals, the status quo strongly favors No in this narrow window. Updating slightly downward to reflect the India–Hasina relationship point and the paucity of triggers that would accelerate either path before July 1.",
