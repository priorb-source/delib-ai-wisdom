  "information": "Florida's legislature is controlled by a Republican supermajority in both chambers. Governor Ron DeSantis has a history of supporting and signing legislation described as strengthening election integrity. In May 2025, DeSantis signed a law that creates new hurdles for the citizens' initiative process, including a ban on non-citizens and non-residents from gathering signatures for petitions. This followed the enactment of SB 7016 in April 2025, which also restricts ballot initiatives.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Approximately 56 days until July 1, 2025",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No legislation is enacted before the deadline",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Florida's regular legislative session ends in early May without HB 831 or similar bills advancing to enactment. Despite Republican supermajority support, the bill remains in committee, faces procedural delays, or fails to receive necessary votes before the deadline. No special session is called, or if called, the legislation is not prioritized or completed in time.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "HB 831 or similar citizenship verification legislation rapidly advances through both chambers with strong Republican support. The bill passes both houses by mid-to-late June and Governor DeSantis promptly signs it before July 1, 2025. Alternatively, DeSantis calls a special session specifically to pass this legislation as part of a broader election integrity agenda.",
    "rationale": "The key tension in this forecast is between favorable political conditions and extremely tight timing. Favorable factors include: (1) Republican supermajority control of both legislative chambers, (2) Governor DeSantis's demonstrated support for election integrity legislation, evidenced by signing related bills in May 2025, (3) the existence of a specific bill (HB 831) already drafted. However, significant constraints exist: Florida's regular legislative session typically runs March through early May, meaning we may be at or past the end of the regular session. With only 56 days until the deadline, the bill would need to be either very far along in the process already, or require a special session to be called. While DeSantis has shown willingness to act on election issues and the political will clearly exists, the extraordinarily compressed timeline creates substantial uncertainty about whether all procedural steps can be completed. The recent signing of other election-related bills suggests active legislative work is happening, but doesn't confirm HB 831's specific status. My forecast is not higher because the timing constraint is severe - even with a supermajority, bills require committee hearings, floor debates, reconciliation between chambers, and gubernatorial action. My forecast is not lower because the political alignment is nearly optimal for passage if time permits. I would revise upward if evidence emerges that HB 831 has already passed one or both chambers, or if a special session focused on this issue is announced. I would revise downward if the regular session definitively ends without progress on this bill and no special session is scheduled.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nBefore July 1, 2025, will Florida enact legislation expanding its verification requirements of a voter's citizenship?\n\nQuestion background:\nTallahassee Democrat: [Florida may require proof of citizenship to vote under new legislation echoing Trump](https://www.tallahassee.com/story/news/local/state/2025/04/02/got-id-proof-of-citizenship-may-soon-be-needed-to-vote-in-florida/82756919007/)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if, before July 1, 2025, the state of Florida enacts legislation requiring voters to provide proof of US citizenship beyond the requirements at the time of this question, according to [credible sources](https://www.metaculus.com/faq/#definitions).\n\nAny subset of voters being required to provide such proof would count (for example if it only applied to first-time voter registrants or creating a new requirement for mail-in voters). An example of a bill that would count is [HB 831](https://www.flsenate.gov/Session/Bill/2025/831). This question resolves upon enactment; therefore other questions such as when the legislation takes effect or whether it survives court challenges and is implemented is immaterial to this question's resolution.\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nFlorida's legislature is controlled by a Republican supermajority in both chambers. Governor Ron DeSantis has a history of supporting and signing legislation described as strengthening election integrity. In May 2025, DeSantis signed a law that creates new hurdles for the citizens' initiative process, including a ban on non-citizens and non-residents from gathering signatures for petitions. This followed the enactment of SB 7016 in April 2025, which also restricts ballot initiatives.\n\nToday is 2025-05-06.\n\nBefore answering you think:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n(e) You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
