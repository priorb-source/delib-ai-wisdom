    "review": "The other forecasters and I share a strong consensus on the core dynamics of this question: the outcome is driven by a very small number of events (8-12 nationwide pilot reports per month), the primary competition is between California and Florida, and the 'tie resolves as No' rule significantly raises the bar for a 'Yes' resolution. Forecaster 2's framing of California's 'structural advantages' (higher total aviation activity and historical reporting volume) was a useful clarification that reinforces the baseline lean towards a 'No' outcome. Forecaster 3 provided the most compelling new argument by questioning whether the high-profile Florida military encounter on March 28 would even be reported to a civilian organization like NUFORC, versus staying within official military channels. This is a critical point that significantly weakens the primary piece of evidence supporting a 'Yes' forecast.",
    "rationale": "After reviewing the other analyses, I am revising my forecast downward. My initial forecast of 35% was too heavily influenced by the reported multi-object military encounter over Florida on March 28. I treated this event as a strong signal that Florida would have a spike in reports for March. However, Forecaster 3's reasoning is highly persuasive: there is a significant chance that military encounters are reported exclusively through internal, official channels (like to AARO) and do not appear in the public NUFORC database. This greatly diminishes the predictive value of that specific event for this question's resolution criteria. While the event may indicate heightened UAP activity in the region, its direct translation into NUFORC pilot reports is uncertain. Combining this insight with Forecaster 2's point about California's structural advantages and the strict 'no ties' rule, the case for Florida being the unique top state is weaker than I first assessed. I am therefore reducing my probability to account for the diminished impact of the key Florida-specific evidence.",
