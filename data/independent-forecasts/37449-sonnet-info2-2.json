  "information": "In response to China's military exercises around Taiwan, the US has used terms such as \"intimidation tactics,\" \"provocative,\" \"coercive military activities,\" and \"aggressive military activities.\" In April 2025, the US Department of State accused China of \"putting regional security at risk\" with its drills. To date, US government statements have not officially characterized China's actions as a \"blockade.\" Historically, even during the 1995-1996 Taiwan Strait Crisis, the US did not formally accuse China of a blockade. Diplomatic talks between the US and China were held in Shanghai in April 2025.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Approximately 8 weeks until July 1, 2025",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No - the US government does not accuse China of blockading Taiwan",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "China continues military exercises and shows of force around Taiwan, but stops short of actions that would constitute an actual blockade. The US continues using strong but non-blockade language like 'coercive' and 'provocative' to describe Chinese activities. Diplomatic engagement continues and tensions remain elevated but controlled. No seaports are effectively shut down by Chinese forces.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "China escalates from military exercises to implementing a 'quarantine' or 'inspection zone' around Taiwan that effectively prevents commercial shipping from accessing one or more Taiwanese seaports. This prompts the US State Department or White House to issue a statement explicitly accusing China of 'blockading' Taiwan's ports, marking a significant rhetorical escalation intended to rally international condemnation and support.",
    "rationale": "The research assistant's report indicates that while US-China tensions over Taiwan remain high, the US has consistently avoided using the specific term 'blockade' even during heightened crises. In April 2025, despite Chinese military exercises, the strongest language used was 'putting regional security at risk.' Critically, even during the 1995-1996 Taiwan Strait Crisis - a major confrontation - the US did not formally accuse China of a blockade. This historical precedent is significant.\n\nThe status quo strongly favors a No outcome for several reasons: (1) Only 8 weeks remain until resolution; (2) Using 'blockade' terminology represents a major escalatory step that directly impacts US diplomatic and potential military commitments; (3) Recent diplomatic talks in Shanghai suggest both sides are maintaining channels; (4) For the US to make this accusation, China would first need to take concrete actions that effectively shut down seaports - not just conduct exercises.\n\nFor my forecast to be higher, I would need evidence of: China moving beyond exercises to actually interdicting commercial shipping, US officials signaling willingness to use harsher terminology, or a specific crisis trigger (like a Taiwan independence declaration). For my forecast to be lower, I would need to see: significant de-escalation in Chinese military activities, stronger diplomatic breakthroughs, or explicit US statements ruling out blockade accusations.\n\nThe WSJ article indicates China has blockade capability, but capability doesn't equal implementation. The 10% probability reflects primarily tail risk of rapid escalation in an already tense situation, while heavily weighting the strong historical and recent pattern of US rhetorical restraint on this specific term.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill the United States accuse the People's Republic of China of blockading Taiwan before July 1, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nWSJ via MSN: [China Is Ready to Blockade Taiwan. Here’s How.](https://www.msn.com/en-us/news/world/china-is-ready-to-blockade-taiwan-here-s-how/ar-AA1BvnW8)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if, before July 1, 2025, the US government publicly accuses the People's Republic of China of blockading at least one of Taiwan's seaports without consent from the Taiwanese government in Taipei.\n\n\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nIn response to China's military exercises around Taiwan, the US has used terms such as \"intimidation tactics,\" \"provocative,\" \"coercive military activities,\" and \"aggressive military activities.\" In April 2025, the US Department of State accused China of \"putting regional security at risk\" with its drills.

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
