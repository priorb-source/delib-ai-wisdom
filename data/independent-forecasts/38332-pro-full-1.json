  "information": "In early March 2025, during the inauguration of President Yamandú Orsi in Montevideo, Brazilian President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva publicly invited Uruguay, Colombia, and Mexico to the BRICS summit scheduled for July in Rio de Janeiro. Lula stated, 'it's essential that these countries participate, because it's a moment for debate with the whole world.' Following the invitation, President Orsi expressed interest in participating, stating he hoped other Latin American countries would join to 'consolidate multilateralism and free trade.'\n\nPresident Yamandú Orsi is confirmed to travel to Seville, Spain, to attend the Fourth International Conference on Sustainable Development Financing. This United Nations conference is scheduled to run from June 30 to July 3, 2025. President Orsi has reaffirmed Uruguay's commitment to multilateralism, stating that his government will be in Seville to 'strengthen and commit' to the UN's objectives.\n\nAs of early June 2025, the government of Uruguay had not issued an official public statement confirming or denying President Orsi's attendance at the BRICS summit. Media coverage at the time described the country's participation as 'undecided' or 'up in the air.' The BRICS summit is scheduled to take place in Rio de Janeiro on July 6-7, 2025. Other leaders, including India's Prime Minister Narendra Modi, are planning to attend.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "26 days, as the question resolves on July 1, 2025.",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No. As of today, the government of Uruguay has made no official announcement confirming President Orsi's attendance. If this silence continues until the deadline, the question resolves as No.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "The Uruguayan government prioritizes President Orsi's confirmed attendance at the UN conference in Seville, which ends on July 3. Citing the logistical challenges of traveling to Rio de Janeiro for the BRICS summit on July 6, the government either continues to make no announcement or formally declines the invitation before the July 1 deadline.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Valuing the opportunity to strengthen ties with Brazil and engage with major emerging economies, the Uruguayan government decides to manage the tight travel schedule. Before the July 1 deadline, the President's office issues a public statement confirming Yamandú Orsi will travel from Seville to Rio de Janeiro to attend the BRICS summit.",
    "rationale": "My forecast heavily weights the significant logistical conflict presented by President Orsi's confirmed attendance at the UN conference in Seville from June 30 to July 3. The BRICS summit begins in Rio de Janeiro on July 6, creating a very tight turnaround. The continued official silence from the Uruguayan government since the invitation was extended in early March suggests that accepting is not a high priority or has been deemed impractical. While the personal invitation from Brazil's President Lula and Orsi's initial positive remarks are arguments for 'Yes', they are outweighed by the concrete scheduling conflict and the lack of any subsequent confirmation. The status quo is 'No announcement', and this close to the event, that is a strong signal. The probability is not lower because the trip is logistically possible, and Uruguay may still decide the diplomatic benefits of attendance are worth the effort, leading to a late announcement. I would increase my probability if credible reports emerge that the government is arranging travel logistics from Spain to Brazil. I would decrease it if Uruguay announces a lower-level official will attend in the President's place.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill the government of Uruguay announce that its president, Yamandú Orsi, will attend the BRICS summit in July 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\n[Lula invites Mexico, Colombia, and Uruguay to BRICS Summit](https://en.mercopress.com/2025/03/04/lula-invites-mexico-colombia-and-uruguay-to-brics-summit#google_vignette) | [Uruguay’s participation at the BRICS summit still up in the air](https://www.plenglish.com/news/2025/03/02/uruguays-participation-at-the-brics-summit-still-up-in-the-air/)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if before July 1, 2025 the government of Uruguay, or anyone speaking on its behalf, issues any sort of public communication (written or oral) confirming its acceptance of the invitation for President Yamandú Orsi to attend in person the BRICS Summit scheduled to take place in Rio de Janeiro in July 2025.\n\nSince the summit will be held after this question resolves, actual attendance is not required, merely the announcement of plans to attend.\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nIn early March 2025, during the inauguration of President Yamandú Orsi in Montevideo, Brazilian President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva publicly invited Uruguay, Colombia, and Mexico to the BRICS summit scheduled for July in Rio de Janeiro.

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
