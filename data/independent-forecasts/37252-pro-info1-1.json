  "information": "South Korea has been experiencing significant political instability. President Yoon Suk Yeol declared martial law in December 2024, leading to his impeachment. The country's Constitutional Court upheld the impeachment on April 4, 2025. Following these events, a snap presidential election has been scheduled for June 3, 2025. Additionally, law enforcement authorities recently conducted a search of former President Yoon's residence as part of corruption allegations.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "2 months",
    "status_quo_outcome": "The status quo is a state of heightened political tension and increased protest activity following the impeachment of the former president. This environment is highly conducive to large-scale demonstrations, making the status quo outcome 'Yes'.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "The snap presidential election on June 3, 2025, proceeds smoothly and its result is widely accepted by all major political factions. This de-escalates political tensions, and public energy is channeled into the new political process rather than street mobilization. Consequently, no protests reach the 10,000-participant threshold before July 1.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "In the run-up to or immediate aftermath of the June 3 snap election, one or more major political parties or civic groups organize large-scale rallies related to the election's candidates or outcome. Fueled by the recent political crisis, these demonstrations in a major city like Seoul easily surpass the 10,000-participant threshold and are subsequently reported by the Global Protest Tracker.",
    "rationale": "My forecast is primarily based on the extreme political volatility in South Korea. The research indicates that President Yoon Suk Yeol's impeachment was upheld, and a snap presidential election is scheduled for June 3, 2025. Such high-stakes political events in South Korea have historically been accompanied by large-scale public demonstrations and rallies. The period immediately preceding and following a contentious snap election is a peak time for political mobilization. Given the precedent of surging protests following the martial law declaration, it is highly probable that at least one political faction will organize a rally exceeding the 10,000-participant threshold to demonstrate public support or opposition. The probability is not higher because there is a chance the election proceeds with a clear, undisputed winner, leading to a rapid de-escalation of tensions and a 'honeymoon' period for the new government, which would reduce the impetus for protests. The probability is not lower because the political polarization is severe, and South Korea has a robust tradition of civic mobilization. It would be more surprising if this turbulent period passed without a single large-scale protest. I would raise my forecast if major political groups explicitly call for mass rallies, and lower it if polling indicates a landslide victory for one candidate and a general atmosphere of political calm emerges.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill the Global Protest Tracker report any protests in South Korea with 10,000+ participants, before July 1, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nACLED December 2024: [South Korea: Anti-government protests surge following martial law declaration](https://acleddata.com/2025/01/15/asia-pacific-overview-january-2025/#keytrends6)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if the [Global Protest Tracker](https://carnegieendowment.org/features/global-protest-tracker?lang=en) reports a protest in South Korea with 10,000 or more participants with a start date after the launch of this question and before July 1, 2025.\n\n\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nSouth Korea has been experiencing significant political instability. President Yoon Suk Yeol declared martial law in December 2024, leading to his impeachment. The country's Constitutional Court upheld the impeachment on April 4, 2025. Following these events, a snap presidential election has been scheduled for June 3, 2025. Additionally, law enforcement authorities recently conducted a search of former President Yoon's residence as part of corruption allegations.\n\nToday is 2025-05-01.\n\nBefore answering you think:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n(e) You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
