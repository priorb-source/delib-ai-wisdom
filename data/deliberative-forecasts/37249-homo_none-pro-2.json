    "review": "The other two forecasters both arrived at a forecast of 8%, significantly lower than my initial 15%. Their reasoning is compelling and centers on a few key points I had perhaps underweighted. Both correctly emphasize the historical rarity of the required polling shift. Forecaster 2's quantitative framing—that this would require a polling swing of over 20 points in just two months for a poll-of-polls average—is a particularly strong argument that puts the scale of the challenge into stark perspective. Forecaster 2 also introduced the concept of a 'natural ceiling' for Reform's support, which is a crucial limiting factor I hadn't explicitly articulated. Forecaster 3's framing of a necessary 'perfect storm' (a government failure, an opposition collapse, AND a flawless Reform campaign) effectively illustrates the multiple, low-probability events that must align for a 'Yes' outcome. Their shared emphasis on the strong 'prior' of a new government's polling stability is convincing. My initial analysis was too heavily weighted towards recent volatility and didn't sufficiently account for these powerful structural barriers.",
    "rationale": "After reviewing my peers' analyses, I am revising my forecast downward from 15% to 8%. Their arguments have convinced me that my initial assessment over-estimated the probability of such a rapid and dramatic political realignment. The core reason for my change is a greater appreciation for the principle of political inertia, especially concerning a new government less than a year into its term. Historically, poll-of-polls averages do not swing by over 20 points in a two-month period, which is what would be required here. Secondly, the argument that Reform UK likely has a 'natural ceiling' on its support is a key constraint. While they can attract disillusioned Conservative voters, gaining the broad support necessary to not just overtake but establish a 4-point lead over a new Labour government is a much higher hurdle. The 'Yes' scenario requires a perfect storm of events: a catastrophic and rapid failure by the Labour government, the continued inability of the Conservative Party to recover, and a flawless campaign by Reform to capitalize on both. The probability of all three conditions being met in the next two months is extremely low. Therefore, an 8% probability more accurately reflects this as a highly improbable, though not entirely impossible, black-swan event.",
