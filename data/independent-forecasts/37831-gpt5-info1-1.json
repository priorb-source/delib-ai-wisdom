  "information": "On May 13, 2025, Mali's military junta, led by General Assimi Goïta, issued a presidential decree dissolving all political parties and organizations. The government justified the decision by citing the need to rationalize the political landscape, which includes around 300 parties, and to preserve national unity and stability. The decree followed national consultations held in April 2025. Preceding the decree, the National Transitional Council (CNT) voted 130-2 to repeal the law governing the charter of political parties and the statute of political opposition. The government has stated its intention to draft a new legislative framework to regulate the political sector in the future.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "About 39 days (until 2025-07-01)",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No — the decree stands and parties remain dissolved through June 30, 2025.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "The junta stays the course: it keeps the dissolution in force while it drafts a new party law that won’t be ready before July. Security services suppress protests; courts and the transitional council back the decree; external pressure is limited and Mali’s AES partners provide political cover.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Unexpected pressure forces a tactical retreat: large, sustained urban protests, splits within the military elite, or credible threats of painful sanctions/closures from neighbors lead Goïta’s government to rescind the May 13 decree and restore legal status for parties and allow new party formation before July 1.",
    "rationale": "- Short fuse: Only ~6 weeks remain. Reversals of fresh authoritarian decrees within this window are uncommon absent major shocks.\n- Status quo momentum: Per the assistant’s report, the junta dissolved all parties by presidential decree after CNT repealed the legal framework (130–2) and signaled it will draft a new law. That sequence indicates an intentional, multi-step consolidation rather than a trial balloon, making a near-term reversal unlikely.\n- Incentive structure: Mali has distanced itself from ECOWAS and aligned within the AES (with Burkina Faso and Niger), reducing leverage from regional organizations that historically could force quick U-turns. Western pressure has limited bite; the regime relies more on security partnerships with Russia and domestic revenue, and has previously withstood criticism after suspending parties in 2024 and delaying elections.\n- Base rates/analogs: Recent Sahel juntas tend to double down on political restrictions; rapid reinstatement of multiparty activity within weeks is rare. Crafting a new party law typically takes months, not days.\nWhy not higher: There is no clear catalyst signaling imminent reversal; legal groundwork (repeal of party statutes) and public justifications suggest durability. The timeline to draft new rules likely exceeds July 1.\nWhy not lower: Tail risks remain. Acute unrest, an economic shock, or elite fractures could prompt a quick, face-saving reversal (e.g., allowing parties to operate pending a new law). A court ruling invalidating the decree, or credible, coordinated regional pressure with material costs could also move the junta.\nWhat would move me up: Reports of high-level negotiations with civil society about immediate reinstatement; official hints that party activities may resume temporarily; large sustained protests/strikes; signs of military splits; concrete threats of border closures or sanctions from neighbors with enforcement.\nWhat would move me down: New repressive measures (mass arrests of opposition figures, harsher media bans), AES communiqués defending the dissolution, or an official timeline placing any new political framework well after July 1.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nBefore July 1, 2025, will the government of Mali reverse its decision to dissolve all political parties?\n\nQuestion background:\n[Mali's Military Government Shuts Down All Political Parties](https://www.legit.ng/world/africa/1654992-malis-military-government-shuts-political-parties/)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if the government of Mali announces a reversal of its May 13, 2025 presidential decree dissolving all political parties in the country.\n\nA partial reversal, such as allowing the reinstatement of a limited number of parties, will only count as long as new parties are generally allowed to be formed again.\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nOn May 13, 2025, Mali's military junta, led by General Assimi Goïta, issued a presidential decree dissolving all political parties and organizations.

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
