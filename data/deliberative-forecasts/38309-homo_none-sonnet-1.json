    "review": "All three forecasters converged on the 30-45% range despite working independently, which validates the core analytical approach. We all identified the same critical information gaps (no data on opponents, polling, endorsements, or fundraising) and recognized Jones as a credible candidate based on his background as a former delegate and Washington Post coverage. Forecaster 3 raised a particularly compelling point I had underweighted: explicit base rate reasoning for multi-candidate primaries. If this is a typical 3-4 candidate Democratic primary race, baseline probability per candidate would be 25-33%. The fact that Jones warranted major media coverage in November 2024 and is actively campaigning suggests he's not a fringe candidate but a serious contender, which would justify being toward the higher end of that baseline range. However, Forecaster 2 and 3's higher forecasts (40% and 45%) still seem slightly optimistic given the complete absence of concrete data about race dynamics. The clustering of forecasts around 30-45% suggests reasonable consensus, but without evidence distinguishing Jones as a frontrunner, moving to the middle of this range seems more justified than the upper end.",
    "rationale": "Upon reflection, I believe my initial 30% was slightly too conservative. Forecaster 3's base rate reasoning is sound: in a typical Virginia Democratic primary with 3-4 serious candidates, each would baseline around 25-33%. Jones being covered by the Washington Post and having served as a delegate suggests he's a serious player rather than a long-shot candidate, warranting placement at or slightly above the baseline. However, without specific evidence of polling leads, major endorsements, or fundraising advantages, I cannot justify going as high as 40-45%. The complete information vacuum means I should be cautious about assuming Jones is leading. I'm updating modestly upward to 35%, positioning myself between my original forecast and the consensus center. This acknowledges the valid base rate argument while maintaining appropriate skepticism given the lack of race-specific data. My forecast remains on the conservative end of the group range, reflecting that without positive evidence distinguishing Jones from other serious candidates, I should not assume he's more likely than not to win.",
