  "information": "As of May 2, 2025, the U.S. State Department's travel advisory for Niger is Level 3, 'Reconsider Travel,' last updated on March 21, 2023. The stated reasons for the advisory are terrorism, kidnapping, crime, and civil unrest. While the nationwide advisory is Level 3, specific areas within Niger are designated as Level 4, 'Do Not Travel,' including the Diffa region, the Lake Chad basin, and regions bordering Mali. Neighboring countries, including Mali and Burkina Faso, have nationwide Level 4 advisories.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Approximately 2 months until July 1, 2025",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No - Niger maintains its current Level 3 'Reconsider Travel' advisory",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "The State Department does not conduct a formal review of Niger's travel advisory in the next two months, or conducts a review but determines the security situation, while serious, does not warrant escalation to a nationwide Level 4 advisory. The existing framework of Level 3 nationwide with specific Level 4 regions remains sufficient.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "A major security incident occurs (significant terrorist attack, escalation of civil unrest, widespread violence, or targeting of Western nationals), prompting an emergency review and upgrade to Level 4. Alternatively, the State Department conducts an overdue comprehensive review of the advisory and determines that current conditions - including the July 2023 coup aftermath, ongoing terrorism threats, and regional instability - now warrant a nationwide Level 4 designation.",
    "rationale": "The status quo strongly favors a No outcome. Travel advisories are institutional decisions that exhibit significant inertia, particularly at the country level. Niger has maintained a Level 3 advisory since March 2023 (over 2 years) despite ongoing security concerns including terrorism, kidnapping, crime, and the July 2023 coup. This persistence suggests the State Department has established thresholds that haven't been crossed. With only 2 months remaining, the timeframe is quite short for such a significant policy change. However, several factors prevent me from assigning a very low probability. The advisory is notably outdated - last reviewed in March 2023, before the July 2023 coup - suggesting a comprehensive review may be overdue. There's clear precedent for Level 4 designations within Niger (Diffa region, Lake Chad basin, Mali border areas), and both neighboring Mali and Burkina Faso have nationwide Level 4 advisories, indicating deteriorating regional security. The Sahel region generally continues to face significant security challenges. An upgrade would likely require either a dramatic triggering event (major attack, significant deterioration) or a formal policy review that concludes current conditions warrant Level 4. The former is unpredictable but possible given regional instability; the latter could occur but faces bureaucratic inertia. I'm not higher because: (1) the 2-month window is short, (2) the advisory has been stable for 2+ years despite known risks, and (3) State Department policy changes are slow-moving. I'm not lower because: (1) the advisory is overdue for review, (2) regional precedent exists, and (3) security conditions remain genuinely concerning. I would revise upward if there were signs of an imminent State Department review or a major security incident. I would revise downward if the department explicitly reaffirms Level 3 status.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill Niger receive a \"Level 4 – Do Not Travel\" travel advisory from the US State Department before July 1, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nTravel and Tour World: [Niger Faces Growing Travel Risks: U.S. Travel Advisory Highlights Terrorism, Crime, and Limited Medical Care for Tourists in the Country](https://www.travelandtourworld.com/news/article/niger-faces-growing-travel-risks-u-s-travel-advisory-highlights-terrorism-crime-and-limited-medical-care-for-tourists-in-the-country/)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below.

The stated reasons for the advisory are terrorism, kidnapping, crime, and civil unrest.

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
