    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Approximately 1-2 weeks. China's National Bureau of Statistics typically releases monthly CPI data around the 9th-12th of the following month, so May 2025 data should be released around June 9-12, 2025.",
    "status_quo_outcome": "Yes - deflation continues for a 4th consecutive month",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "China's economy shows signs of recovery in May with consumer spending picking up due to government stimulus measures taking effect, improved consumer confidence, or favorable base effects from the previous year. The May CPI shows a positive year-over-year change, breaking the deflationary streak.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Deflationary pressures persist due to continued weak consumer demand, ongoing property market struggles, and insufficient economic stimulus. Consumer prices remain below year-ago levels, marking the 4th consecutive month of deflation as measured by the year-over-year CPI change.",
    "rationale": "The question indicates that China has already experienced deflation in at least three consecutive months (with April confirmed by the SCMP article). This establishes a clear deflationary trend driven by structural economic challenges including weak consumer demand, property market distress, and overall economic sluggishness.\n\nKey factors supporting continued deflation: (1) Deflationary momentum - once established for multiple months, deflation rarely reverses quickly due to sticky consumer expectations and behavior patterns; (2) China's well-documented structural economic challenges including property sector weakness and consumer confidence issues; (3) The status quo principle strongly applies here - economic trends typically persist in the near term.\n\nFactors that could break the trend: (1) Major stimulus packages implemented in April-May could boost demand; (2) Favorable base effects if May 2024 had particularly high prices; (3) Seasonal consumption patterns in May; (4) Targeted policy interventions.\n\nWithout specific information about May economic indicators or major policy shifts from my research assistant, I must rely on the established trend. However, I'm moderating my confidence because: (1) Monthly economic data can be volatile; (2) The Chinese government has strong tools to influence prices if politically motivated; (3) Base effects and seasonal factors add uncertainty.\n\nMy forecast is not higher because there's always uncertainty in monthly data and potential for policy surprises. It's not lower because the three-month deflationary trend creates strong momentum, and fundamental economic challenges remain unresolved. I would revise upward with news of continued economic weakness or downward with evidence of strong stimulus effects or positive leading indicators from May.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill China experience a 4th month in a row of deflation in its May CPI report?\n\nQuestion background:\nSCMP: [China’s consumer prices fall in April, fuelling fears of deflation](https://www.scmp.com/economy/economic-indicators/article/3309834/chinas-consumer-prices-fall-april-fuelling-fears-deflation)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if the \"Percent Change from Year Ago, Not Seasonally Adjusted\" data presented at [FRED Consumer Price Indices (CPIs, HICPs), COICOP 1999: Consumer Price Index: Total for China (CHNCPIALLMINMEI)](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/CHNCPIALLMINMEI#) is negative for May 2025.\n\n\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nNo additional information available.\n\nToday is 2025-06-02.\n\nBefore answering you think:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n(e) You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
