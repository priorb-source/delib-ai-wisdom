  "information": "According to multiple news reports from late May 2025, former Ivorian President Laurent Gbagbo is considered disqualified from the 2025 presidential election. This is due to a 2018 conviction for the looting of the Central Bank of West African States (BCEAO), which resulted in a 20-year prison sentence and the loss of his civic rights. Sources such as Le Point, tunisienumerique.com, and Abidjan.net state that he remains struck from the electoral list. His political party, the People's African Party-Côte d'Ivoire (PPA-CI), announced in late April 2025 that it would evaluate the situation in the first half of June 2025 and consider a 'new level in the fight' if his status on the electoral list does not change.\n\nThe political climate in Côte d'Ivoire is marked by the disqualification of several opposition figures ahead of the October 2025 election. In April 2025, Tidjane Thiam, leader of the main opposition party PDCI-RDA, was disqualified after a court ruled he did not meet eligibility conditions due to his prior dual French-Ivorian nationality, despite having renounced his French citizenship. This and other exclusions have led to protests and accusations of electoral manipulation. Reports also mention that other political figures like Charles Blé Goudé and Guillaume Soro have been excluded from the electoral process due to judicial convictions. In response to the political tensions, various groups, including religious leaders and the UN, have called for peaceful dialogue.\n\nSeveral of the candidates named in the question have officially announced their intention to run in the 2025 presidential election. Jean-Louis Billon, a member of the PDCI-RDA party, announced his candidacy in late May 2025, positioning himself as an alternative within his party following the disqualification of its leader, Tidjane Thiam. Simone Gbagbo, former first lady, has also announced her candidacy under the banner of her party, the Movement of Capable Generations (MGC). Pascal Affi N'Guessan is also presented as a candidate for the FPI party.",

    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Approximately 32 days until July 1, 2025 (current date is May 30, 2025)",
    "status_quo_outcome": "Yes - Laurent Gbagbo appears to already be disqualified",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "The reports about Laurent Gbagbo's disqualification are incorrect or he successfully appeals his status. All five listed candidates remain eligible through July 1, 2025 with no new disqualifications occurring.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Laurent Gbagbo's existing disqualification from the electoral list remains in effect through July 1, 2025, satisfying the resolution criteria. Alternatively, any of the other four candidates (Gnangbo Kacou, Pascal Affi N'Guessan, Jean-Louis Billon, or Simone Gbagbo) gets disqualified in the remaining 32 days.",
    "rationale": "The research assistant's report provides strong evidence that Laurent Gbagbo is already disqualified from the 2025 presidential election as of late May 2025. Multiple credible sources (Le Point, tunisienumerique.com, Abidjan.net) confirm he remains struck from the electoral list due to his 2018 conviction for looting the BCEAO, which resulted in loss of civic rights. The question asks whether any candidate 'has been removed from the electoral list or otherwise become legally ineligible' before July 1, 2025. Since Laurent Gbagbo is currently in this state, the resolution criteria appear to be satisfied. The political context supports this assessment - the Ivorian government has been actively disqualifying opposition figures (Tidjane Thiam, Charles Blé Goudé, Guillaume Soro), showing a pattern of exclusions. Laurent Gbagbo's party (PPA-CI) planned to evaluate his electoral list status in early June 2025, suggesting they acknowledge his current disqualified state. The other four candidates (Billon, Simone Gbagbo, Affi N'Guessan, Kacou) have either announced candidacies or not been reported as disqualified. Why not higher (99%+): Small possibility the reports are incorrect, outdated, or Laurent Gbagbo successfully appeals before June. There could be a technical interpretation where past disqualifications don't count. Why not lower: Multiple independent sources confirm Gbagbo's current disqualified status. The 32-day window is very short for uncertainty to resolve in his favor. For an update upward: Official electoral commission confirmation or court rejection of any Gbagbo appeal. For an update downward: Credible reports that Gbagbo's status was reversed or the initial reports were incorrect.",
