  "information": "The Social Democratic Party of Austria (SPÖ) has been the leading party in every Viennese state election since 1945.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "The 2025 Viennese state election is scheduled for autumn 2025, likely October. From today (April 21, 2025), this is approximately 5-6 months away.",
    "status_quo_outcome": "The Social Democratic Party of Austria (SPÖ) wins the most seats, continuing their unbroken streak of victories in every Viennese state election since 1945 - an 80-year dominance of Vienna politics.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Another party, most likely ÖVP (Austrian People's Party) or FPÖ (Freedom Party of Austria), overtakes SPÖ to win a plurality of seats. This could occur through a major SPÖ scandal, a dramatic rightward shift in Vienna's electorate, or exceptional mobilization by opposition parties around specific local issues.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "SPÖ maintains its traditional strength in Vienna, leveraging its deeply rooted organizational presence, continued support from urban voters, and track record of local governance. The party holds its plurality despite potential gains by other parties, keeping Vienna as Austria's 'red stronghold'.",
    "rationale": "The historical base rate is extraordinarily powerful: SPÖ has won every single Viennese election since 1945 - 80 consecutive years. Vienna is famously Austria's most social-democratic city, with SPÖ deeply embedded in local politics, unions, and social infrastructure. In the most recent 2020 election, SPÖ won 41.6% of the vote and 46 of 100 seats, maintaining a comfortable lead over ÖVP (20.4%) and other parties. While Austrian politics nationally has seen shifts, with FPÖ gaining support, Vienna has consistently resisted these national trends. The reference to March 2025 polling data suggests recent indicators are available. Good forecasting requires respecting base rates and recognizing that the world changes slowly - an 80-year pattern doesn't typically break without clear warning signs. My forecast is not higher (95%+) because: (1) elections are inherently uncertain; (2) even long-standing patterns can eventually break; (3) I lack specific recent poll numbers; (4) we're still months from the election. My forecast is not lower (below 70%) because: (1) the historical precedent is overwhelming; (2) no information suggests a dramatic shift; (3) Vienna's political culture is distinctly SPÖ-friendly; (4) structural factors favor incumbents. I would update higher if: polls show SPÖ with leads of 10+ percentage points, or if opposition parties show internal conflicts. I would update lower if: polls show a very tight race or another party ahead, or if a major scandal emerges affecting SPÖ.",
