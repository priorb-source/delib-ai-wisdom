    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "About 39 days (until July 1, 2025)",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Discord continues preparing privately (e.g., confidential S-1 drafts) and targets a late-summer or fall 2025 IPO window, delaying any public S-1 or specific blog announcement until after July 1.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Discord publicly files an S-1 with the SEC in June 2025, or posts a specific news item on its blog explicitly stating it plans an IPO, prior to July 1.",
    "rationale": "- Baseline/status quo: As of today there has been no qualifying announcement (no public S-1 on EDGAR, no specific IPO announcement on Discord’s news page). If nothing changes, the question resolves No.\n- Evidence for movement: Reputable reporting in March 2025 (e.g., Ars Technica citing bank mandates) suggests Discord is actively preparing for a 2025 IPO. That increases odds of a public S-1 sometime this year.\n- Timing dynamics: Companies frequently file confidentially first (which would not resolve this market) and make their public S-1 closer to the roadshow/listing. Many high-profile tech IPOs target September–November, with public S-1s appearing in late summer. A pre–July 1 public S-1 is possible but not necessary for a 2025 listing, and companies rarely post a standalone “we plan to IPO” blog before filing due to regulatory considerations.\n- Calendar considerations: The late-June period is often thin due to the July 4 holiday. If Discord is aiming for a fall IPO, a public S-1 in late August would be more typical than June. That leans toward No before July 1.\n- Why not higher: The resolution requires a public S-1 or a specific company blog post; confidential submissions won’t count. The remaining window (~39 days) is short, and many firms avoid a June public filing unless they intend to list quickly. \n- Why not lower: Credible reports of 2025 IPO preparation and named underwriters indicate genuine momentum. If market conditions are constructive, a June public S-1 to set up a late-summer or early-fall listing is plausible.\n- What would move me up: Reports of a confidential S-1 submission, leaks of imminent public filing, new executive or banker signals pointing to a June timeline, or any formal company teaser about the IPO timeline.\n- What would move me down: Headlines about delays, adverse market turns, operational setbacks, regulatory snags, or messaging implying a H2 (post–July 1) public filing cadence.\n- Research assistant summary: No additional information available; thus, the forecast leans on general IPO timing patterns and the March 2025 reporting about bank selection.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nBefore July 1, 2025, will Discord announce that it is planning an IPO?\n\nQuestion background:\nArs Technica: [Discord is planning an IPO this year, and big changes could be on the horizon](https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2025/03/report-discord-partners-with-jp-morgan-chase-goldman-sachs-for-a-2025-ipo/)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question will resolve as **Yes** if Discord, Inc., announces before July 1, 2025, that it is planning an initial public offering. In order to streamline the resolution of this question, there are two resolution sources for the IPO announcement: 1) The company filing an [SEC Form S-1](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/sec-form-s-1.asp) or 2) An announcement at the [news](https://discord.com/blog) section of its website. If there is no such announcement before that date, this question resolves as **No**.\n\nPlease note that for an announcement on the news section of the company's website to resolve the question as Yes, the announcement must be specific. Vague statements such as \"someday becoming a public company\" will not count. If there is any doubt, then greater weight will be placed on whether an S-1 has been filed.\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nNo additional information available.\n\nToday is 2025-05-23.\n\nBefore answering you think:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n(e) You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
