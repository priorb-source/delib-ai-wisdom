  "information": "Former FBI Director James Comey is under investigation by the Department of Homeland Security and the Secret Service after posting a photo on Instagram showing seashells arranged to spell '86 47'. The number '86' can be slang for 'kill' or 'remove,' and Donald Trump is the 47th president. Following the post, Comey was interviewed by the Secret Service but was not arrested. He later deleted the post, stating, 'I didn't realize that some people associate these numbers with violence. I oppose all forms of violence, so I deleted the post.' Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem confirmed the investigation.\n\nSeveral public figures have called for legal action against James Comey. General Michael Flynn predicted that Comey will be indicted. The InfoWars platform cited alleged Department of Justice sources claiming Comey's indictment is 'imminent.' Fox News Legal Analyst Gregg Jarrett stated that Comey could be prosecuted for the post. Current FBI Director Chris Wray reported that the agency has faced a surge in threats against Donald Trump following Comey's post, requiring agents to be diverted from other cases.\n\nAs of late May 2025, no charges have been filed against James Comey, nor have any warrants or subpoenas been issued in relation to the social media post. Legal experts suggest a prosecution faces significant hurdles due to First Amendment protections and a 2023 Supreme Court ruling that requires prosecutors to prove a subjective intent to threaten. Historically, arresting former FBI directors or other ex-cabinet-level officials is extremely rare in the United States.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Approximately 1 month until July 1, 2025",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No arrest - Investigation continues without formal charges or arrest",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "The Secret Service and DHS investigation continues without producing sufficient evidence to overcome First Amendment protections and the 2023 Supreme Court ruling on threat prosecution. No charges are filed, and the matter fades as a political controversy without legal consequences. Comey's deletion of the post and stated lack of intent to threaten undermines any prosecution.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Federal prosecutors determine they have sufficient evidence to charge Comey with threatening the president, obtain a warrant, and arrest him. Alternatively, completely unrelated charges emerge from another investigation, or charges are filed in an expedited manner due to intense political pressure from the administration.",
    "rationale": "The probability of arrest is very low for several key reasons. First, the time constraint is severe - only about one month remains, and arresting a former FBI director requires extensive legal review, likely grand jury proceedings, and warrant approval, processes that typically take months. Second, as of late May 2025, no charges, warrants, or subpoenas have been issued despite weeks passing since the initial incident and Secret Service interview. Third, legal experts identify significant barriers including strong First Amendment protections and a 2023 Supreme Court ruling requiring proof of subjective intent to threaten. Comey's explanation and deletion of the post undermines any intent argument. Fourth, historically, arrests of former FBI directors or cabinet-level officials are extremely rare in the United States, suggesting a very low base rate. Fifth, Comey was already interviewed by the Secret Service without being arrested, suggesting authorities don't view the case as warranting immediate custody. While public figures like Michael Flynn and sources cited by InfoWars have predicted imminent indictment, these are unreliable indicators compared to the absence of concrete legal action. The status quo strongly suggests the investigation will continue without arrest. For me to update higher, I would need to see: formal charges filed, a warrant issued, or credible reporting of grand jury proceedings. For me to be more confident in a low probability, I would need to see the investigation formally closed or prosecutors explicitly declining to pursue charges. The forecast is not lower because political pressure exists and investigations remain active; it's not higher because all concrete legal indicators point away from imminent arrest within the tight timeframe.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill James Comey be arrested before July 1, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\n[Secret Service Is Asking Comey About a Photo of Seashells Spelling ‘86 47’](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/16/us/politics/secret-service-comey-social-media-trump.html)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if former FBI director James Comey is arrested before July 1, 2025, according to [credible sources](https://www.metaculus.com/faq/#definitions).\n\nIn order to streamline this question's resolution, please note that an arrest anywhere in the world, for any reason, will resolve this question as Yes. For purposes of this question, we define \"arrest\" using the definition [posted at Nolo](https://www.nolo.com/legal-encyclopedia/justifies-arrest-probable-cause.html): \"An arrest requires taking someone into custody, against that person's will, in order to prosecute or interrogate. It involves a physical application of force, or submission to an officer's show of force. In sum, the arrestee must not be free to leave. Whether the act by the police is termed an arrest under state law is not relevant. When deciding whether someone has been arrested, courts apply the 'reasonable man' standard. This means asking whether a reasonable person, in the shoes of the defendant, would have concluded that he or she was not free to leave.\"\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nFormer FBI Director James Comey is under investigation by the Department of Homeland Security and the Secret Service after posting a photo on Instagram showing seashells arranged to spell '86 47'.

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower.
