  "information": "UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer faces criticism from Brexit supporters over concessions in a 'renewal' agreement with the EU. His government is also grappling with a sluggish economy, contributing to a decline in popularity. Starmer faces a growing political challenge from Nigel Farage's Reform UK party, whose economic plans he has described as reckless and comparable to the policies of former Prime Minister Liz Truss. Starmer's government plans to reduce the civil service by 50,000 jobs by 2030, aiming to save £2 billion annually, with details to be announced in a spending review on June 11.\n\nJapanese Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba's cabinet approval rating fell to a record low of 26% in a March 2025 Asahi newspaper poll. The 14-percentage-point drop followed a controversy involving the distribution of 100,000 yen gift vouchers to 15 lawmakers from the ruling party, which sparked public distrust. Although Ishiba apologized, he stated he used his own 'pocket money' as a sign of appreciation. All 15 lawmakers subsequently returned the vouchers. On the economic front, Ishiba is pursuing a growth-oriented economy driven by wage increases and investment, and has called for cooperation with the Japan Business Federation (Keidanren).\n\nPolling data from early 2025 shows fluctuating approval ratings for both leaders. A Morning Consult screenshot from early May reported Starmer at 36% and Ishiba at 29%, while other reports citing late-May figures placed Starmer at 28% and Ishiba at 32%. Earlier, a March 2025 Ipsos UK poll found that 30% of Britons believed Starmer was performing well, an increase of 7 percentage points. A YouGov poll from the same period showed Starmer with a 31% positive rating, his highest since September 2024. In April 2025, Starmer and Ishiba held a telephone call to discuss the economic impact of U.S. tariffs and agreed to cooperate on global issues.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "About 32 days (until July 1, 2025)",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No — late-May Morning Consult figures reportedly have Ishiba ahead of Starmer by a few points, and a tie would also resolve as No",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Late-June Morning Consult shows Ishiba ~30–33% and Starmer ~27–31%, leaving Ishiba narrowly ahead or the two tied. UK headlines around the June 11 spending review (e.g., civil service cuts) and continued economic gripes keep Starmer depressed; Ishiba stabilizes as the voucher scandal fades.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Starmer rebounds into the low-to-mid 30s on improving sentiment or a positive policy/news cycle, while Ishiba remains stuck below ~30% amid lingering scandal fallout or fresh LDP troubles; Morning Consult’s 7-day average on/after July 1 shows Starmer a couple of points higher.",
    "rationale": "Evidence and recent levels: The research assistant cites Morning Consult snapshots with notable movement: early May Starmer ~36% vs Ishiba ~29%; late May reports Starmer ~28% vs Ishiba ~32%. That suggests both a recent Starmer dip and Ishiba recovery/stability into the low 30s. Non-MC polls (Ipsos, YouGov) had Starmer improving in March, but MC late-May readings matter most for our resolution. With about a month to go and MC using a 7-day moving average, large reversals are possible but less likely than persistence. Status quo weighting: If we freeze conditions, the latest pattern (Ishiba slightly ahead) implies a No. Because ties resolve No, Starmer likely needs a clear, multi-point edge by July 1, raising the bar for Yes. Drivers into July: - UK: Starmer faces criticism over EU concessions, a sluggish economy, and pressure from Reform UK. The June 11 spending review and proposed civil service cuts risk short-term unpopularity. These are more likely to hold approval down than boost it in June. - Japan: Ishiba’s approval was hit by the voucher controversy (Asahi 26% in March), but MC puts him around high 20s to low 30s by late May. As the scandal fades, a modest stabilization or slight recovery is plausible, especially if there’s no new negative headline. Why not higher than my forecast? The late-May MC edge for Ishiba, the short time window, and the tie-as-No rule all lean against Starmer. The UK policy calendar in June features decisions that may be unpopular in the short run. Why not lower? Two countervailing points: (1) Recent MC volatility shows that a swing of several points in relative standing can occur within weeks; Starmer could bounce back to ~31–34. (2) Japanese PM approvals often struggle to rise; if Ishiba drifts back below ~30, Starmer only needs to be modestly above that. What would move my forecast up? - MC releases in mid/late June showing Starmer at/above ~32–33% with upward momentum and Ishiba flat/sub-30. - A UK positive news cycle (e.g., improved economic data or well-received policy) or a self-inflicted error by Reform/Conservatives that softens anti-government sentiment. - Fresh negative headlines for Ishiba or renewed LDP scandal coverage. What would move it down? - MC mid/late June confirming Starmer at/below ~29% while Ishiba is ~31%+. - UK backlash to the spending review and cuts, or worsening macro headlines. - Stabilization for Ishiba with no new scandals and modest economic optimism. Overall, with roughly a month left and current indications of Ishiba slightly ahead, I put moderate odds on a reversal but still below even given tie=No and June’s UK risks.",
