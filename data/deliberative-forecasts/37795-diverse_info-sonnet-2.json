    "review": "Forecaster 2 provides crucial current standings data I lacked - the Rockies at .174 with a .112 gap to the next worst team. This enormous gap is the key fact. Their underlying metrics (last in ERA, WHIP, OPS, -128 run differential) confirm this isn't variance but structural failure. However, 95% seems to underweight the inherent unpredictability of a 25-game window in baseball. Forecaster 3 correctly emphasizes short-term variance and that multiple bottom-feeders exist, but 38% drastically underestimates how difficult it is to close a .112 winning percentage gap in just 25 games. To illustrate: even if the Rockies improve to .250 (a massive jump) and win 6 of their next 25, they'd be at .181. For another team currently at .286 to fall below that, they'd need to go roughly 2-23 over their next 25 games - an even MORE catastrophic collapse than Colorado's current pace. Forecaster 3's base rate argument (3-5% unconditionally) is superseded by the overwhelming conditional evidence. The key insight is that we're not asking about an unconditional probability - we have strong mid-season data showing an unprecedented gap.",
    "rationale": "After reviewing both analyses, Forecaster 2's specific data about the .112 gap is decisive. This isn't a marginal lead in awfulness - it's historic. Over 25 remaining games until June 15, closing this gap would require: (1) The Rockies winning at a .400+ clip (10+ wins), far above their .163 pace, AND (2) Another team simultaneously collapsing to below .163 pace. While Forecaster 3 correctly notes baseball's variance, a .112 gap represents about 5 games in the loss column over just 43 games played - that's enormous and unlikely to reverse in 25 games. The structural indicators (worst ERA, WHIP, OPS, -128 run differential, pre-season PECOTA of .343) all point to persistent weakness, not temporary slump. The managerial change might provide a 2-3 game bump at most, insufficient to close such a gap. However, I won't go to 95% because: (a) 25 games can produce 8-10 game swings in either direction, (b) another historically bad team could theoretically emerge, (c) baseball's inherent randomness. But 38% severely underweights the evidence. I'm revising up to 85%.",
