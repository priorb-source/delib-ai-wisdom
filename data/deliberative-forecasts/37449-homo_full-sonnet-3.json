    "review": "The other forecasters' analyses closely mirror my own reasoning, identifying the same key factors: the distinction between exercises and actual blockades, historical precedent from 1995-1996, the deliberate avoidance of 'blockade' terminology by the US, ongoing diplomatic channels, and the short 8-week timeframe. However, they emphasize two points more strongly than I did: (1) the extraordinary legal and military weight of the term 'blockade' under international law, noting it essentially constitutes an act of war, and (2) this would represent a major escalatory step in rhetoric. This additional emphasis on the legal gravity of 'blockade' terminology actually strengthens the case for a LOW probability - it means the US would be even MORE reluctant to use this term than I initially weighted. The US would need an extremely high threshold of evidence and provocation before making such an accusation. That said, both forecasters independently arrived at 10%, suggesting possible wisdom in crowds. The convergence at 10% could indicate my 7% was slightly underweighting either tail risks or the time available for crisis development. However, I don't see fundamentally new arguments that weren't already incorporated in my analysis. The difference between 7% and 10% is relatively small and could reflect different risk tolerances rather than different information.",
    "rationale": "Upon reflection, the other forecasters' stronger emphasis on the legal significance of 'blockade' as an act of war actually reinforces my lower estimate rather than suggesting I should update upward. The US government would face enormous pressure to be absolutely certain before using such charged language, as it could trigger treaty obligations, military responses, and international legal consequences. This represents an even higher bar than I initially considered. However, I acknowledge some wisdom in the crowd convergence at 10%, and with 8 weeks remaining, there IS sufficient time for a crisis to unexpectedly develop. The status quo remains overwhelmingly likely - no actual blockade, continued exercises that the US describes with less inflammatory terms, and diplomatic channels remaining open. But the tail risk of miscalculation, inadvertent escalation, or a triggering event (such as a collision at sea or aggressive Chinese action during exercises) cannot be fully dismissed. Balancing the reinforced understanding of how high the bar is for using 'blockade' terminology against the modest wisdom-of-crowds update, I'll make a very slight upward adjustment.",
