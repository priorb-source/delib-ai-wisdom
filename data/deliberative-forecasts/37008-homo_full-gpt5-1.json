    "review": "Both forecasters largely mirror my frame: baseline No absent extension; meaningful risk from slippage in generator delivery/commissioning; and a small tail for an unrelated emergency. Forecaster 2 adds a useful nuance that extensions, when issued, typically span several days, so any extension past April 29 would almost certainly cover April 30. Both emphasize island logistics and the government’s incentive to retain emergency powers briefly to manage procurement and rationing during commissioning. Neither introduces new hard evidence (e.g., concrete delays or government signaling), but their stress on schedule and adequacy risk is reasonable. I find their reasoning solid and mostly aligned with mine; it nudges me slightly upward because the cost of a short precautionary extension is low and the system is fragile.",
    "rationale": "Status quo still points to No: the current proclamation expires April 29 and, as of April 21, there is no official indication of an extension. However, end-of-April commissioning targets are prone to slippage; even on-time arrival can be followed by testing, integration, and fuel logistics wrinkles. Given the severity of the outages and economic stakes, authorities may prefer to maintain emergency powers a few extra days to ensure stability and expedite actions, which would make April 30 a Yes. There is also a small tail risk of an unrelated emergency declaration. Balancing the explicit expiry guidance against credible schedule and adequacy risks, I make a modest upward adjustment from my prior to reflect the ease and plausibility of a short precautionary extension without new signaling yet.",
