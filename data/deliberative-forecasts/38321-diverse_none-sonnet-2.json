    "review": "The other forecasters raise several important points I should consider more carefully. Forecaster 2 makes explicit the conditional assumption that Trump is president, and both emphasize Trump's unpredictability and history of selectively skipping multilateral events. Forecaster 3 notes Trump has skipped other regional summits before, and Forecaster 2 highlights the possibility of sending a substitute delegation as a strategic signal. These are valid concerns about tail risks.\n\nHowever, I believe they may be underweighting several factors: (1) We're already in early June 2025, extremely close to when the summit should occur - at this late stage, the absence of any contrary signals (no reports of alternative plans, no threats to skip, no scheduling conflicts) is highly informative; (2) NATO summits are fundamentally different from other multilateral forums - they represent core alliance commitments with America's most important military partners; (3) Even during Trump's contentious first term, he attended every NATO summit (2017, 2018, 2019), suggesting these events hold special status in his calculus; (4) The institutional machinery for presidential attendance would already be in motion.\n\nTheir forecasts of 75-77% appear to weight Trump's general unpredictability heavily, which is reasonable, but may insufficiently account for the specific timing pressure and the particular importance of NATO summits versus other events. The difference between our forecasts essentially comes down to how much weight to place on tail risks of last-minute changes versus the strong status quo signal from the current absence of any contrary information.",
    "rationale": "After reviewing the other analyses, I'm making a modest downward adjustment to 85%. This reflects greater acknowledgment of tail risks from Trump's unpredictability and the theoretical possibility of strategic non-attendance or sending a substitute. However, I maintain a higher forecast than the other forecasters because: (1) the timing is critical - we're in early June with the summit presumably in late June, and no contrary signals have emerged; (2) NATO summits specifically have proven to be events Trump attends even when criticizing the alliance; (3) the institutional weight and diplomatic stakes of a NATO summit exceed typical multilateral forums; (4) attending provides him maximal leverage and visibility, which aligns with his preferences. The 85% forecast acknowledges approximately 15% probability for unforeseen circumstances (health emergencies, domestic crises, or unprecedented strategic boycott decisions), which is higher than my initial 10% but lower than the ~25% implied by the other forecasters' estimates.",
