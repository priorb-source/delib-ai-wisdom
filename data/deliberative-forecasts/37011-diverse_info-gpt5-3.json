    "review": "Forecaster 2 reinforces the core base-rate argument: insurgent right parties almost never convert national vote share into the most seats in county councils under FPTP, and local organisation/incumbency strongly favors established parties. Their addition about Reform’s candidate vetting issues is new to me; if accurate, it further reduces seat-winning efficiency. Forecaster 3’s analysis leans on a (likely incorrect) factual claim that Conservatives hold 57/64 seats; 2021 results were 45/64 for the Conservatives. They also frame the hurdle as needing 33 seats for a majority, whereas the question is “most seats,” not “overall control.” Still, their structural points (incumbency, organisation, scale of swing needed, short runway) are directionally right. Net, their arguments strengthen the case that Reform’s path to being the largest group is extraordinarily narrow; nothing presented suggests widespread Reform leads across divisions.",
    "rationale": "My prior 3% leaned on Reform’s high national polling, full slate, and the possibility of geographically concentrated support. The others’ emphasis on base rates, organisational barriers, and historical analogues (UKIP/Brexit Party) is persuasive and consistent with recent local by-elections showing weak seat conversion for Reform despite vote share. The added (plausible) note on candidate vetting issues is another headwind. While I discount Forecaster 3’s 57-seat claim and the focus on an outright majority, correcting those does not materially improve Reform’s chances of being the largest group. With roughly 10 days to go and no credible division-level evidence of widespread Reform leads, I update slightly downward to align with the stronger base-rate case and organisational realities. I would move up only on credible ward/division polling or canvass data showing Reform ahead across a broad swath of Derbyshire; absent that, the modal outcome is Labour or Conservatives as largest, with Reform winning few seats.",
