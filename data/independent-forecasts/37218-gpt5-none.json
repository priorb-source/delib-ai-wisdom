    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Likely 1–3 months (UFC 315 is probably scheduled for early-to-mid summer 2025; exact date/location not confirmed here).",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "UFC 315 is held outside Trump’s usual stops (e.g., international or a less-aligned US city), or he has a conflicting commitment (official/business/legal), leading him not to appear at the venue.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "UFC 315 is in a favored location (e.g., Miami, NYC/NJ, or Las Vegas) and Dana White/UF C hints or confirms his attendance; Trump’s schedule allows a brief drop-in, so he shows up anywhere on venue grounds.",
    "rationale": "Baseline: Trump attends some UFC numbered events but not most of them. From 2023–2024 he made several high-profile appearances (Miami, NYC, etc.), reflecting a strong relationship with Dana White and comfort with UFC environments, but his attendance rate remains a minority of PPVs. With no concrete reports about UFC 315’s date/location or Trump’s plans, the status quo favors No. Location matters: attendance likelihood rises if the event is in Miami, NYC/NJ, or Las Vegas (historically higher attendance and logistics), and drops sharply if international (he virtually never attends overseas UFC events). Incumbent/official obligations can constrain travel but don’t eliminate the possibility, as he has attended while holding office before. Evidence base: general public record of multiple appearances in 2023–2024 and long-standing ties to UFC/Dana White; no event- or schedule-specific intel (assistant had no additional info). Why not higher: most PPVs do not feature his attendance; date/location unknown; potential scheduling/security constraints. Why not lower: recent pattern of repeated UFC appearances and the promotional value for both parties makes attendance plausible, especially if location aligns. Updaters: Up if UFC 315 is announced for Miami/NYC/NJ/Las Vegas or if credible reports/Dana White hints emerge (could rise to 50–70% depending on specificity). Down if 315 is international or if a clear conflict appears on the same date (could fall to 5–15%).",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill Donald Trump attend UFC 315?\n\nQuestion background:\nAP [Trump sits cageside at Miami UFC event in his latest appearance at a sports event](https://apnews.com/article/trump-ufc-miami-fight-sports-6461901bb3d5f2eec477674d02333a7f)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if President Donald Trump is anywhere within the grounds of the venue where [UFC 315](https://www.ufc.com/event/ufc-315) takes place. Otherwise this resolves as **No**.\n\n\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nNo additional information available.\n\nToday is 2025-04-28.\n\nBefore answering you think:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n(e) You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
