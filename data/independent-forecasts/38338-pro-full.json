  "information": "In mid-May 2025, John Morgan stated he would observe the field of announced candidates before making a decision on running for governor. He also mentioned that if he were to run, his campaign would be brief, lasting approximately three months. Morgan has publicly considered running for governor in previous election cycles, including 2018 and 2022, but ultimately did not enter the races.\n\nProminent attorney John Morgan has announced plans to launch a new political party aimed at centrist voters, expressing dissatisfaction with the current two-party system. Multiple news outlets reported in February and May 2025 that Morgan has been working on this initiative for months, with lawyers preparing party-formation paperwork for what has been referred to as the 'Capitalist Party' or '#ForThePeople'.\n\nThe field for the 2026 Florida gubernatorial race has seen recent developments. On June 5, 2025, former Republican Congressman David Jolly announced his candidacy for the Democratic nomination.

On the Republican side, Congressman Byron Donalds has launched his campaign, and Florida's First Lady, Casey DeSantis, is reportedly considering a run.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Less than one month, until July 1, 2025.",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No. As of today, John Morgan is not an announced candidate for governor.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "John Morgan continues to follow his previously stated plan of observing the developing field of candidates. He focuses his immediate efforts on building the infrastructure for his new centrist political party, delaying any personal candidacy decisions until later in 2025 or 2026. July 1, 2025 passes without an announcement.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Seeing the initial field of candidates as weak or uninspiring, Morgan decides an early announcement would allow him to define the race on his own terms. He leverages the media attention surrounding the launch of his new political party to make a surprise announcement of his own candidacy before July 1, 2025, creating a major political splash.",
    "rationale": "My forecast is primarily based on John Morgan's established behavioral pattern and his own recent statements. Morgan has a history of publicly exploring gubernatorial runs, as he did in the 2018 and 2022 cycles, before ultimately deciding against entering the race. This past behavior establishes a strong prior for him not running, and by extension, not announcing on a short timeline. Furthermore, in mid-May 2025, Morgan explicitly stated he would observe the field of announced candidates before making a decision. With a major candidate, David Jolly, having just announced on June 5, 2025, it is highly probable that Morgan's 'observation period' will extend beyond the July 1 deadline. His focus on launching a new political party is a significant undertaking that likely serves as his primary political project for the time being, rather than a launchpad for an immediate campaign. \n\nMy probability is not lower than 15% because Morgan is actively making political moves, unlike in previous cycles where his considerations were more speculative. The creation of a new party and having a 'campaign blueprint' are concrete actions that create a non-trivial possibility he could use the party's launch as a springboard for his own candidacy in the coming weeks. \n\nMy probability is not higher because the deadline of July 1, 2025 is very close. Given his history of hesitation and his stated intent to 'observe the field,' a sudden announcement within the next three weeks seems unlikely. The significant effort required to launch a new party also makes a simultaneous campaign launch less probable. \n\nI would raise my forecast if credible reports emerge of Morgan scheduling a major press conference or filing official candidacy paperwork. I would lower it if he makes any public statements reaffirming his intent to wait longer or endorsing another candidate.",
