    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Approximately 3–4 months (UFC 316 likely in late summer 2025; exact date/venue not yet public).",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "UFC 316 is held internationally or in a U.S. city outside Trump’s usual travel pattern, or his schedule/political calculus and security costs make attendance not worth it. He instead appears at UFC 315 or a later card (e.g., MSG in the fall).",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "UFC 316 lands in a favorable location (e.g., Miami/South Florida, NYC/NJ area, or Las Vegas), aligns with a fundraiser or other trip, and Dana White’s invitation plus optics make it attractive; he makes a brief appearance on the venue grounds.",
    "rationale": "Base-rate framing: Trump frequently attends UFC PPVs relative to most politicians but still only a minority of all numbered cards. Since 2023 he has appeared at several high-profile UFC events, and as president in April 2025 he attended UFC 312 in Miami, showing willingness and feasibility despite security. However, any single future PPV remains less likely than not. Location is the key driver: domestic venues he favors (Miami/NJ/NY/Las Vegas) materially raise odds; international or less-aligned cities drop them. Without a confirmed UFC 316 venue, the weighted status quo leans No. Rough calibration: about 70–80% chance UFC 316 is in the U.S.; conditional attendance on a domestic card ~30–40% given his pattern and competing priorities; on an international card near 0–5%. That aggregates to roughly 25–35%. Not higher: venue/date unknown, and he may prioritize UFC 315 (July) or a fall MSG card instead of an August event. Not lower: his strong relationship with Dana White and recent attendance signal ongoing appetite; optics benefits can be high, and logistics are clearly manageable. Updates that would move me up: official announcement of UFC 316 in Miami/NJ/NY/Las Vegas; credible reporting of planned attendance or pairing with a fundraiser/rally. Updates that would move me down: UFC 316 announced for an international location or a U.S. city he rarely visits; schedule conflicts or security/political headwinds.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill Donald Trump attend UFC 316?\n\nQuestion background:\nNew York Times: [Trump and Some of His Cabinet Members Attend U.F.C. Fight in Miami](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/13/us/politics/trump-ufc-fight-reyes.html)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if President Donald Trump is anywhere within the grounds of the venue where [UFC 316](https://www.ufc.com/event/ufc-316) takes place. Otherwise this resolves as **No**.\n\n\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nNo additional information available.\n\nToday is 2025-04-30.\n\nBefore answering you think:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n(e) You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
