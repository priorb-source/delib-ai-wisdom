    "review": "Both forecasters add concrete process details I hadn’t explicitly incorporated: (1) CS/HB 1381’s withdrawal on May 3 (a clear sign the flagship measure stalled), and (2) the extended session starting May 12 being budget-focused, making insertion of election policy atypical. They also correctly emphasize Florida’s governor action windows (7/15 days), which tighten the workable calendar even if leadership moved quickly in June. Their legal-caution point (NVRA/Inter Tribal Council) reinforces why leadership might avoid a rushed documentary-proof requirement. I find this reasoning persuasive and it meaningfully lowers the odds relative to my prior estimate. The only caveat is that Florida leadership could, if motivated, expand a call or tuck policy into implementing bills—but that remains uncommon and would likely draw scrutiny. Overall, their arguments push me down.",
    "rationale": "Updating with the new info that no proof-of-citizenship bill cleared both chambers and CS/HB 1381 was withdrawn at sine die, the remaining paths are: (a) add the issue to the budget-focused extended session (unlikely procedurally and politically), or (b) call a special session and pass something quickly enough for enactment by July 1. GOP trifecta and national salience (including Trump’s push) keep a non-trivial chance, and the resolution bar is broad (HB 831-style provisions would count). However, the combination of session inertia, leadership’s apparent deprioritization in regular session, legal risk, and the tight timeline all point to a low-probability Yes before July 1. I’m lowering from 30% to 20% to reflect the post-session status and the limited, atypical remaining pathways while retaining some probability for a late political push or an expanded call.",
