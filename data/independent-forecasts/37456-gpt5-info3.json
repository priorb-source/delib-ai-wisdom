  "information": "Historical data on FSIS recalls shows that resolution times vary based on classification and complexity. Class I (high-risk) recalls typically close in 2-4 months. Class III recalls often close within 1-3 months, with a median time of approximately 90 days. However, recalls that span multiple states, involve large product volumes, or are distributed through institutional foodservice channels frequently take longer to resolve. The extended shelf life of some of the recalled products, until March 2026, is another factor that can complicate and lengthen the verification process.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "About 55 days (until 2025-07-01)",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No — the recall remains Active on the FSIS page on/after July 1, 2025.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "The recall spans multiple states and institutional foodservice channels, and FSIS effectiveness checks (product accounting and consignee verification) take longer than expected. The firm issues updates or a recall expansion, or FSIS continues to list additional consignees, delaying closure beyond July.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Cargill rapidly completes effectiveness checks, accounts for product at consignees, and there are no expansions or complications. FSIS verifies the recall’s effectiveness and updates the page to Closed in June.",
    "rationale": "We are 40 days past the March 28, 2025 recall date, with roughly 55 days left until July 1. Historical FSIS patterns: Class I recalls often close in 2–4 months; Class III in 1–3 months with a median around 90 days. This event (an unapproved/cleaning substance in liquid egg products) is likely Class II or III, implying a plausible 2–3 month closure window, but several factors push timelines longer: multi-state/institutional distribution and some products reportedly having shelf life into March 2026, which complicates effectiveness verification.\n\nGiven a roughly 90–100 day median for lower-risk recalls, closure by July 1 (≈95 days from initiation) is near the median, but conditional on the recall still being Active at day ~40, the odds of closing in the remaining window drop. The extended shelf life and institutional channels further lengthen the right tail. Balancing those drags against Cargill’s scale and capability to execute and document an effective recall (which can speed closure), I lean slightly below even odds.\n\nWhy not higher: The long shelf-life and foodservice distribution increase the chance that FSIS effectiveness checks extend beyond late June; expansions or additional consignee lists would push closure later. Why not lower: If this is Class III or a low-risk Class II with no illnesses, FSIS often closes around 2–3 months; a well-resourced firm like Cargill can complete accounting and documentation quickly, making a June closure plausible.\n\nWhat would move me up: FSIS updates indicating all product accounted for, no expansion, and/or a mid-June note that effectiveness checks are complete; retail/consignee lists finalized with no new additions; signals from Cargill that the recall is complete. What would move me down: Any expansion of scope, additional affected lots/states/institutions, evidence of slow consignee responses, or no material updates by mid-to-late June.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill the USDA-posted recall by Cargill Kitchen Solutions of its liquid egg product for an unapproved substance issued March 28, 2025 be closed before July 1, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nABC News: [Liquid eggs recalled due to potential cleaning solution contamination](https://abcnews.go.com/GMA/Food/liquid-eggs-recalled-due-potential-cleaning-solution-contamination/story?id=120329600)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if the status of the recall posted by the U.S. Department of Agriculture’s Food Safety and Inspection Service (FSIS) is changed from Active to Closed on [this page](https://www.fsis.usda.gov/recalls-alerts/cargill-kitchen-solutions-recalls-liquid-egg-products-due-unapproved-substance) before July 1, 2025. If the recall is still shown as Active when the link is accessed by Metaculus on or after July 1, 2025, this question resolves as **No**.\n\n\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nHistorical data on FSIS recalls shows that resolution times vary based on classification and complexity. Class I (high-risk) recalls typically close in 2-4 months. Class III recalls often close within 1-3 months, with a median time of approximately 90 days. However, recalls that span multiple states, involve large product volumes, or are distributed through institutional foodservice channels frequently take longer to resolve. The extended shelf life of some of the recalled products, until March 2026, is another factor that can complicate and lengthen the verification process.\n\nToday is 2025-05-07.\n\nBefore answering you think:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n(e) You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
