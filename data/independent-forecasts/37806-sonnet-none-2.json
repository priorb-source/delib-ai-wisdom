    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Approximately 6 weeks until July 1, 2025",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No - no presidential action mentioning the Diversity Visa has been issued yet",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Trump continues to focus on other immigration priorities such as border security and enforcement without issuing a specific presidential action mentioning the Diversity Visa program. Any opposition to the program is expressed through speeches, social media, or administrative measures that don't qualify as formal presidential actions, or the issue simply doesn't rise to the level of presidential action priority in the remaining weeks.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Trump issues an executive order or proclamation attempting to terminate, suspend, or significantly modify the Diversity Visa program, explicitly mentioning it by name in the document. This aligns with his historical opposition to the program and is published on the White House presidential actions page before July 1.",
    "rationale": "Trump has historically criticized the Diversity Visa program, and immigration policy has been a signature issue for his administration. The background articles confirm conservative calls for eliminating the program, which aligns with Trump's 'America First' immigration stance. However, several factors limit the probability: (1) Time constraint - only 6 weeks remain, and presidential actions require drafting, legal review, and coordination; (2) No indication from available information that this specific action is currently being prepared or is an immediate priority; (3) The requirement is very specific - the exact words 'Diversity Visa' must appear in the presidential action; (4) Even if Trump opposes the program, he may address it through other means (speeches, administrative guidance, or different terminology like 'visa lottery'); (5) There may be competing immigration priorities like border security or refugee policy. The status quo strongly favors No since nothing has happened yet. I'm not higher because there's no evidence of imminent action and 6 weeks is a relatively short timeframe for policy implementation. I'm not lower because Trump's known positions and immigration focus make this plausible if it becomes a priority. I would update higher with reports of draft executive orders or administration officials discussing specific plans for the Diversity Visa program, and lower as time passes without action or if other priorities clearly dominate.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill President Trump issue a new presidential action mentioning the Diversity Visa before July 1, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\n[Federal judge’s order leaves many visa lottery winners out of luck](https://www.siliconvalley.com/2020/10/01/judges-order-leaves-many-visa-lottery-winners-out-of-luck/) | The American Conservative: [Trump Should Cancel the Diversity Visa Program](https://www.theamericanconservative.com/trump-should-cancel-the-diversity-visa-program/) | Mint: [US Green Card Diversity Visa 2026 Lottery results released: What you need to know](https://www.livemint.com/news/us-news/us-green-card-diversity-visa-2026-lottery-results-released-what-you-need-to-know-11746381683106.html)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if, before July 1, 2025, President Donald J. Trump issues a [presidential action](https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/) mentioning the \"Diversity Visa\" (using exactly those words). If this does not occur before that date, this resolves as **No**.\n\nTo count, the presidential action must be published and publicly accessible (appearing on the presidential actions section of the White House website) before the specified time. A verbal statement or other written announcement besides a presidential action (for example a post on social media), is not sufficient.\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nNo additional information available.\n\nToday is 2025-05-20.\n\nBefore answering you think:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n(e) You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
