    "review": "The other forecasters raise several compelling points I should weigh more heavily. Both emphasize that base rates favor most world leaders, especially newly installed ones, over Trump's historically low approval ratings. Forecaster 2 correctly notes that 'most world leaders, especially newly installed ones, tend to have higher approval than Trump' - this is a stronger prior than I initially incorporated. Forecaster 3's point about Trump's 'solid base that keeps his floor relatively high' while also having a limited ceiling (historically 45-46%) is well-taken. All three of us agree on the short time horizon reducing dramatic shifts, which means current conditions (unknown to us) will likely persist. However, I note that all forecasters, including myself, are essentially guessing without current data on either leader's approval rating. The fundamental uncertainty about whether Carney is even PM remains unresolved. That said, the question's framing strongly presupposes he is PM, and conditional on that, the new leader honeymoon effect combined with Trump's historical pattern of below-average approval creates a meaningful lean toward Yes.",
    "rationale": "Upon reflection, I was overly conservative at 48%. The other forecasters correctly emphasize that IF Carney is PM (which the question presupposes), the combination of (1) new leader honeymoon effects, (2) Trump's historical approval ceiling of ~45%, and (3) base rates showing most world leaders exceeding Trump's approval, creates a moderate lean toward Yes rather than near-parity. New Canadian PMs typically start in the 55-65% range, while Trump's polarized approval rarely breaks 46%. However, I'm not going as high as 60% because we lack any current data whatsoever - we don't know May 2025 approval ratings, don't have confirmation of Carney's PM status, and face genuine uncertainty about current political conditions in both countries. The 7-week timeframe means whatever the current state is will likely persist, but we simply don't know that state. I'm updating to 54% - acknowledging the valid base rate arguments while maintaining appropriate epistemic humility given the complete absence of current data.",
