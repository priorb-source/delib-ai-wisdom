  "information": "The Trump administration's current immigration policy focus is on a new 'Gold Card' visa plan designed to attract foreign investors with at least $5 million in funds. The plan, which is not yet passed by Congress, would grant permanent residence and work rights. Elon Musk confirmed on the social media platform X that the government is conducting a 'silent test' of the application website. The proposal has sparked debate on whether it will replace or supplement the existing EB-5 investment visa program. Separately, the administration opened the registration period for the H-1B visa program, which both Trump and Musk have supported, for the 2026 fiscal year in March 2025.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "The resolution date is on or after July 1, 2025. Today is May 22, 2025, so the outcome will be known in approximately five weeks.",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No. The Diversity Visa is not a prominent topic in current political or tech discourse. Neither Donald Trump nor Elon Musk are focused on this specific program, so the default expectation is that they will not tweet about it.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "The Diversity Visa program remains a low-profile issue. Donald Trump and Elon Musk focus on other priorities, such as the 'Gold Card' visa, H-1B visas, or other business and political matters. The short time frame to the deadline passes without any specific trigger event causing them to post about the topic using the exact required phrase.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "An unexpected news event, such as a prominent court case, a terrorist attack linked to a visa recipient, or a contentious legislative debate, thrusts the Diversity Visa program into the national spotlight. This prompts either Trump to comment on it as part of his broader immigration platform, or Musk to react to a viral post, using the exact phrase 'diversity visa' in their tweet.",
    "rationale": "My forecast is heavily weighted towards the status quo. The base rate for either of these specific individuals tweeting this exact, relatively obscure three-word phrase within the short, five-week timeframe is extremely low. The research assistant's report supports this, indicating their current focus in the immigration sphere is on other programs like the new 'Gold Card' and the H-1B visa, with no mention of the Diversity Visa. This suggests the topic is not top-of-mind for either of them. The resolution criteria are also very strict, requiring the exact phrase 'diversity visa', whereas a more common term like 'visa lottery' would not suffice. This significantly lowers the probability of a Yes outcome. My probability is not lower, however, because both individuals are prolific and unpredictable X users. Donald Trump has criticized this specific program in the past, and a minor trigger could prompt him to do so again. Elon Musk's engagement is broad and spontaneous; a single viral post on his timeline could elicit a response. The fact that he follows an account that recently tweeted on the topic represents a weak but non-zero signal. My forecast would increase if a major news event directly related to the Diversity Visa were to occur. It would decrease further as the deadline approaches without any such trigger.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill Donald Trump or Elon Musk tweet (X post) about the Diversity Visa before April 1, 2025\n\nQuestion background:\n[Federal judge’s order leaves many visa lottery winners out of luck](https://www.siliconvalley.com/2020/10/01/judges-order-leaves-many-visa-lottery-winners-out-of-luck/) | Recent tweet [here](https://x.com/fentasyl/status/1894451029934039492) from a Twitter/X account followed by Elon Musk.\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if, before July 1, 2025 either Donald Trump or Elon Musk tweet using the exact words \"diversity visa\" as shown through [this search](https://x.com/search?f=top&q=%22diversity%20visa%22%20(from%3Arealdonaldtrump%20OR%20from%3Aelonmusk)&src=typed_query) on Twitter/X, which will be checked by Metaculus on or after July 1, 2025. If a tweet (now renamed to X post) containing the phrase is seen by a Metaculus Admin at that time, this question resolves as **Yes**. If not, it resolves as **No**.\n\n\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nThe Trump administration's current immigration policy focus is on a new 'Gold Card' visa plan designed to attract foreign investors with at least $5 million in funds.

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
