    "review": "All three forecasters reached remarkably similar conclusions (94-96%), which provides reassuring evidence of consensus. We all identified the same core factors: SPÖ's 80-year winning streak, commanding 16-19 point polling lead with just 6 days remaining, multiple consistent polls, and strong incumbent advantages. Forecaster 2 made an excellent point about the combined swing requirement - it's not just SPÖ underperforming, but FPÖ also needing to massively overperform, requiring a 20+ point combined shift. Forecaster 3 helpfully enumerated the three specific failure modes. No one raised substantive concerns about the evidence or identified factors I had overlooked. The tight clustering of our forecasts (94-96%) suggests good calibration rather than any systematic error. The consensus itself provides weak positive evidence that we're in the correct range, though we're all working from the same research base so convergence is expected.",
    "rationale": "After reviewing the other analyses, I see no reason to significantly adjust my forecast. The evidence remains overwhelming: an unprecedented 80-year winning streak, a massive 16-19 point polling lead from multiple independent sources, only 6 days for any shifts to occur, and strong structural advantages for the incumbent SPÖ. The consensus range of 94-96% reflects appropriate epistemic humility while acknowledging the strength of evidence. The slight variance between 94%, 95%, and 96% essentially represents different calibrations on how much probability mass to reserve for black swan events and systematic polling failures. Given that polling errors large enough to flip this race (requiring roughly 10+ point SPÖ underperformance plus similar FPÖ overperformance) are virtually unprecedented in stable democracies with such short time horizons, 96% remains justified. I'm not updating higher because elections always carry irreducible uncertainty. I'm not updating lower because no new evidence or arguments were raised that weaken the case for SPÖ victory.",
