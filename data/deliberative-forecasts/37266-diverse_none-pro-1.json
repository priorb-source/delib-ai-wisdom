    "review": "The other two forecasters and I have reached a strong consensus. We all agree that the probability is low, with forecasts tightly clustered between 8% and 12%. Both forecasters presented reasoning that aligns with my own initial assessment but added valuable nuance and structure. Forecaster 2 strengthened the argument by explicitly framing the low likelihood in terms of a 'base rate,' noting that only 10-20 countries globally hold a Level 4 designation. Forecaster 3's analysis was particularly compelling, highlighting two key points I had not weighted as heavily: 1) The 'stickiness' of State Department advisories, implying a strong institutional inertia against rapid, multi-level escalation. 2) The critical distinction between the geographically concentrated insurgency in Cabo Delgado and the requirement for a *nationwide* Level 4 advisory. The bar for the latter is significantly higher and would require a catastrophic, widespread deterioration of security across the country, not just an intensification of the existing regional conflict or localized protests. Their reasoning was exceptionally convincing and solidified the case for a 'No' resolution.",
    "rationale": "After reviewing the other analyses, I am maintaining my core reasoning but adjusting my forecast downward slightly. My initial 10% was based on the high bar for a Level 4 advisory and the short timeframe. The other forecasters reinforced this view with stronger arguments. Specifically, Forecaster 3's point about the State Department's historical tendency to issue specific warnings for the Cabo Delgado province while keeping the rest of the country at a lower level is crucial. For the entire country to be elevated to Level 4, the current protests would need to spiral into widespread, extreme violence well beyond their current scope, or the northern insurgency would have to make significant advances into major southern population centers. Both are plausible tail risks but are very unlikely to materialize and trigger a State Department re-evaluation of this magnitude in under two months. The 'stickiness' of these advisories, as Forecaster 3 noted, means that a two-level jump from 'Level 2' to 'Level 4' is a rare event that requires an unambiguous, nation-destabilizing crisis. The current evidence does not suggest such a crisis is imminent. Therefore, I am lowering my forecast from 10% to 9% to reflect a stronger conviction in the status quo holding, based on the superior arguments presented regarding institutional inertia and the geographically contained nature of the primary security threat.",
