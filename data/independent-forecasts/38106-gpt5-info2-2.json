  "information": "In February 2025, there was media speculation, particularly from French sources, about a potential visit by Donald Trump to Moscow for the Victory Day celebrations on May 9, 2025. Former Russian Prime Minister Sergey Stepanov commented at the time that such a visit would be a 'big sensation.' On February 12, 2025, Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin held a 1.5-hour phone call during which they agreed to a personal meeting and extended mutual invitations to Washington and Moscow. The speculated May 9 visit did not occur.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "About 32 days (until July 1, 2025)",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No visit occurs before July 1, 2025.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "The White House prioritizes domestic agenda and allied summits; any Trump–Putin meeting is scheduled for later in 2025 or in a third country. No credible announcement or travel preparations for a Russia trip emerge in June.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "A late-breaking announcement (or minimally preannounced trip) for a June bilateral in Moscow or St. Petersburg—possibly tied to SPIEF or putative Ukraine talks—materializes, with rapid logistics put in place and public confirmation by both sides.",
    "rationale": "Time is short and such trips are typically telegraphed weeks in advance. The assistant’s report notes: (1) speculation around a May 9 Moscow visit that did not happen, and (2) a Feb 12 Trump–Putin call with mutual invitations and agreement to meet. Those facts raise the base chance of a 2025 meeting but do not specifically point to a June-in-Russia meeting. Countervailing factors: ongoing Russia–Ukraine war, political optics within NATO, security/logistics complexity of a presidential trip to Russia, and the greater plausibility of a first meeting on neutral ground or in the U.S. With just ~1 month left, the absence of credible reporting or official scheduling signals argues strongly for “No.” Reasons the forecast isn’t lower: Trump’s appetite for unconventional moves, explicit mutual invitations, and visible June hooks (e.g., SPIEF, possible Europe travel) keep a small chance of a surprise. Reasons it isn’t higher: no announcements, high diplomatic costs, allied pushback, and standard lead times for presidential travel. I would update upward on (a) credible leaks or official notice of June travel to Russia, (b) Russian/White House readouts naming a June Moscow/St. Petersburg bilateral, (c) flight/logistics indicators (NOTAMs, advance teams). I would update downward if June calendar hardens around other commitments (e.g., allied summits) with no gaps, or if either side signals a later/third-country venue.",

These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if, after May 19, 2025 and before July 1, 2025, President Donald Trump personally visits Russia.\n\n\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nIn February 2025, there was media speculation, particularly from French sources, about a potential visit by Donald Trump to Moscow for the Victory Day celebrations on May 9, 2025.

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
