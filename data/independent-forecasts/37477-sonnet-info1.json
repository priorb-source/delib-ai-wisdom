  "information": "Executives from major publishers, including The New York Times and News Corp, stated confidence in their businesses' ability to grow despite economic uncertainties from tariffs. In Q1 2025, The New York Times reported a 12% growth in digital advertising revenue, while most other publishers saw flat revenue. New York Times executives described the impact of tariffs as 'immaterial.' This contrasts with a survey indicating 54% of marketers plan to reduce their 2025 budgets due to tariff concerns. Following a Federal Reserve statement that it would wait for the full impact of tariffs before making decisions, communications-services stocks declined, though The New York Times and Walt Disney posted positive results.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "23 days (from May 9, 2025 to June 1, 2025)",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No - tariffs continue to appear on front pages of at least one newspaper every day",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Tariffs remain a dominant news story throughout the period, appearing on at least one paper's front page every single day through June 1st. This could occur if Trump continues implementing tariff policies, trade negotiations remain contentious, or economic impacts generate ongoing coverage requiring front-page treatment daily.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "On at least one day before June 1st, a major competing story dominates both papers' front pages (such as an international crisis, natural disaster, major political scandal, or significant domestic event). Alternatively, tariff news experiences a brief lull while editors prioritize other stories, particularly on a weekend edition when front-page selection differs from weekday patterns.",
    "rationale": "The critical insight is that we need only ONE day in the next 23 days where BOTH newspapers simultaneously omit 'tariff(s)' from their front pages. This is a significantly lower bar than tariffs permanently disappearing from coverage. The research indicates tariffs are economically significant—54% of marketers are cutting budgets due to tariff concerns, and the Federal Reserve is monitoring impacts. However, The New York Times characterized tariff impacts as 'immaterial' to their business, suggesting it may not be their dominant story every single day. To estimate probability: if each paper independently has a 95% chance of mentioning tariffs on any given day, then both papers mentioning it on the same day is 90.25%. Over 23 days, the probability of at least one day where both omit it is approximately 1-(0.9025)^23 ≈ 89%. If each paper has a 96-97% daily mention rate, this drops to roughly 60-75%. Given tariffs are a major but not necessarily THE dominant story every day, weekend editions have different priorities, and unexpected major news events occur, I estimate each paper has about a 95-96% chance of front-page tariff mention on any given day. My forecast is not higher because tariffs remain highly newsworthy with ongoing policy implementation and economic impacts. It's not lower because 23 days provides reasonable opportunity for at least one day where other stories dominate both front pages simultaneously. I would increase my forecast if major non-tariff news breaks (international crisis, natural disaster) or tariff policy announcements pause. I would decrease it if new major tariff actions are announced or economic data shows severe tariff impacts requiring sustained front-page coverage.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill the word \"tariff(s)\" disappear from the front print pages of The New York Times and Wall Street Journal by June 1, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nWhether reading the newspaper or social media or watching the news, it is highly likely you are going to see something about tariffs - mainly due to US President Donald Trump's renewed love for this somewhat antiquated form of taxation.\n\nThe New York Times and the Wall Street Journal are two of the largest print newspapers in the US. When, if ever, will we seen tariffs wiped from the front pages of both papers?\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question will resolve to \"Yes\" if, after \\[OPEN DATE] and before June 1, 2025, the words, \"tariff\" or \"tariffs\", do not appear on the print front page of The New York Times and the Wall Street Journal. The following URLs will be used to resolve the question:\n\n* The New York Times: [https://www.nytimes.com/section/todayspaper](https://www.nytimes.com/section/todayspaper)\n* Wall Street Journal:\t [https://www.wsj.com/print-edition/20250414/frontpage](https://www.wsj.com/print-edition/20250414/frontpage)\n\n***\n\n<sup>Note: WSJ front page URL for April 14, 2025. Format is: yyyy-mm-dd.</sup>\n\nGrammar is not relevant (e.g. \"TARIFF\" will suffice to prevent a \"No\" resolution).\n\n\"Tariff(s)\" must be omitted from both papers' front pages on the same day.\n\n\"Tariff(s)\" can appear anywhere on the page, it does not have to be in a title.\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nExecutives from major publishers, including The New York Times and News Corp, stated confidence in their businesses' ability to grow despite economic uncertainties from tariffs.

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
