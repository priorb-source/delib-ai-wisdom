    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Less than 2 months.",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No, the AfD remains a legal political party in Germany.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "The German political and judicial institutions continue their current course. While debates about a ban may persist, the high legal and political hurdles for banning a party are not overcome. The Federal Constitutional Court does not receive a formal request to ban the party, or if it does, the proceedings are not concluded by the July 1, 2025 deadline.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "A major, undeniable scandal surfaces, proving the AfD is actively and imminently seeking to overthrow the constitutional order. This prompts an unprecedentedly fast and unified action from the Bundestag, Bundesrat, and/or the federal government to petition the Federal Constitutional Court. The Court, in an emergency proceeding, accelerates its deliberation and issues a final ruling banning the party just before the deadline.",
    "rationale": "My forecast is based on the extremely high procedural, legal, and political barriers to banning a political party in Germany, combined with the very short timeframe of less than two months. \n\nThe status quo is that the AfD, despite being under surveillance and subject to intense debate, is a legally registered party with significant representation. The historical precedent for banning parties in post-war Germany is exceptionally rare (only two cases, the last in 1956) and the legal process is designed to be slow and deliberative to protect political pluralism. A previous attempt to ban the far-right NPD party took years and ultimately failed in 2017.\n\nThe process requires a formal application from the Bundestag, Bundesrat, or the federal government, followed by a lengthy judicial review by the Federal Constitutional Court. As of today, May 2, 2025, no such formal application has been made, despite ongoing debates. It is virtually impossible for the political consensus to be formed, the application filed, and for the Court to conduct a thorough hearing and issue a verdict all before July 1, 2025.\n\nMy probability is not lower than 1% because the political climate is volatile and the debate is active, as shown by the motion from 124 MPs. An unforeseen 'black swan' event could theoretically accelerate the timeline, although this is highly improbable.\n\nMy probability is not higher because the procedural and time constraints are immense. For me to increase my forecast, an official request to ban the party would need to be formally filed with the Constitutional Court. For my forecast to decrease, major political leaders would need to publicly rule out attempting a ban within this timeframe.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill Germany ban the AfD before July 1, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nLe Monde: [Germany's Bundestag debates banning far-right AfD party](https://www.lemonde.fr/en/international/article/2025/01/31/germany-s-bundestag-debates-banning-far-right-afd-party_6737637_4.html) \"A cross-party group of 124 MPs put a motion on the agenda to bring proceedings before the Federal Constitutional Court to ban the party, whose unprecedented alliance with the CDU caused a shock.\"\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if there is an official announcement of a ban on the Alternative for Germany (AfD) by a German government entity with the authority to make such an announcement (e.g., the Federal Constitutional Court).\n\n\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nNo additional information available.\n\nToday is 2025-05-02.\n\nBefore answering you think:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n(e) You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
