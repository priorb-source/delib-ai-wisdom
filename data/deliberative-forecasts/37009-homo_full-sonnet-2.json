    "review": "All three forecasters identify the same key evidence and largely agree on the analysis. Forecaster 3 and I arrived at identical 72% forecasts with nearly identical reasoning. Forecaster 2's more cautious 60% forecast raises two important considerations I should weigh more carefully: (1) the base rates argument that political announcements frequently face delays, and (2) the status quo bias principle that since she hasn't announced yet, we should weight that current reality more heavily. These are valid methodological points. However, I think Forecaster 2 may be overweighting these general considerations relative to the specific, credible, and recent evidence we have. The April 19 Politico report is only 2 days old and uses very specific language ('as early as next week'), suggesting an announcement in the April 21-27 window - a full 4-7 days before the May 1 deadline. The preparation signals (fundraising, staff expansion, House replacement outreach) are concrete and extensive, not speculative. While base rates matter, they should be updated based on strong specific evidence, which we have here.",
    "rationale": "After reviewing the other forecasters' analyses, I'm adjusting my forecast slightly downward to 70% to acknowledge the base rates consideration raised by Forecaster 2. Political announcements do frequently slip, and the tight timeline (9 days remaining) means less margin for error than I initially weighted. However, I'm not moving as low as 60% because the April 19 Politico reporting remains highly specific and credible - 'as early as next week' from April 19 means April 21-27, giving us a reasonable buffer before May 1. The concrete preparation indicators (campaign funds, staff expansion, House seat outreach) suggest this isn't just speculation but reflects actual planning. The 70% forecast acknowledges that while an announcement is more likely than not given the strong recent evidence, there's meaningful uncertainty from the tight timeline and the possibility that 'as early as' could slip to 'later than' next week.",
