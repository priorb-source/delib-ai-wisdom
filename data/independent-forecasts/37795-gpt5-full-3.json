  "information": "As of mid-May 2025, the Colorado Rockies held a record of 8-38, equivalent to a .174 winning percentage. Their run differential was -128. The team's pitching staff ranked last in the league with a 5.80 ERA and a 1.599 WHIP. Offensively, they had the league's worst On-base Plus Slugging (OPS), the most strikeouts at 418, a low walk rate of 7.7%, and a low home run rate of 2.3%. The next-worst team in the league at the time, the Chicago White Sox, had a winning percentage approximately 112 points higher at .286.\n\nThe Rockies' 7-36 record through their first 43 games marked one of the worst starts in Major League Baseball's modern era. The team was on pace to finish the season with a 26-136 record, which would surpass the record for most losses in a season set by the 2024 Chicago White Sox (121 losses). Notable losses included a 21-0 defeat to the San Diego Padres, part of a three-game stretch where they allowed 55 runs, the most by any MLB team in a similar span since 1950. This followed seasons with 103 losses in 2023 and 101 in 2024. Pre-season PECOTA projections had forecast a .343 winning percentage for the Rockies in 2025.\n\nDuring the season, the Rockies' manager Bud Black was fired and replaced by Warren Schaeffer. Hitting coach Jordan Pacheco was also part of the new staff. On May 18, 2025, the team achieved a 14-12 comeback win against the Arizona Diamondbacks, which was their first victory under Schaeffer. A key contributor to this win was shortstop Ezequiel Tovar, who had recently returned from injury and went 5-for-5 with his first home run of the season. The team's upcoming schedule before June 15 included games against several high-performing teams.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "~27 days (now through June 15, 2025)",
    "status_quo_outcome": "Yes — the Rockies remain last in MLB winning percentage by a clear margin",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "The Rockies play roughly .400–.500 ball over the next ~25 games while a current bottom-tier team (most plausibly the White Sox) goes into a historic slump (≈.200 or worse over a similar span), or another team crashes hard enough to fall below Colorado’s overall win% by June 15. A strict-interpretation tie not counting as “lowest” could also yield No if MLB shows a multi-team tie and adjudication requires sole lowest.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Colorado continues to play sub-.300 baseball over the next ~25 games against a tough schedule, while all other bottom teams remain at or above roughly .250–.270 overall. On June 15, MLB standings show the Rockies with the lowest win% (outright or tied, depending on how Metaculus treats ties).",
    "rationale": "Evidence and current baseline: As of mid-May, the Rockies were 8-38 (.174), with an extreme -128 run differential, last-place pitching (5.80 ERA, 1.599 WHIP), worst OPS, most strikeouts, low walk and HR rates. Even after their May 18 win under interim manager Warren Schaeffer, they remain far back. The next-worst team (White Sox) was about 112 points higher at .286. Upcoming schedule is reportedly strong, reducing the chance of a sustained hot streak.\nQuantitative intuition: Between now and June 15, Colorado likely plays ~23–27 games. Even if they play .400 (e.g., 10-15), their overall win% would still likely sit in the mid-.260s by mid-June. For the White Sox (or any other team) to fall below that, they’d generally need to go ≈5-20 or worse over the same span (≈.200), which is possible but not the base case for multiple teams at once. Given the Rockies’ very poor underlying metrics and a tough slate, the status quo strongly favors them remaining last.\nWhy not higher: Short windows in MLB are volatile. A two-week surge from Colorado (e.g., 8-5) combined with a simultaneous collapse by a competitor (e.g., 3-12) could narrow or erase the gap. Key player returns (e.g., Tovar already back) or a manager “bounce” could lift Colorado modestly. Tie-handling ambiguity could, in a strict reading, hurt a Yes if Metaculus requires sole possession of last and MLB shows a tie.\nWhy not lower: The starting gap (~.112 in win%) is large this early, and Colorado’s performance indicators are bottom-of-MLB across pitching and hitting. Their schedule through June 15 is strong, further reducing the odds of a big swing. The White Sox or another team would need an unusually bad stretch to undercut Colorado’s overall win% by the check date.\nUpdate triggers:\n- Upward (toward Yes): Continued sub-.300 Rockies results; other bottom teams play ~.350+; injuries or setbacks to Rockies; confirmation that ties count as “lowest.”\n- Downward (toward No): A Rockies hot streak (e.g., 8–10 wins in their next 15–20); a White Sox (or another basement team) freefall (e.g., 5–20); notable positive roster returns for Colorado (multiple impactful bats/arms healthy) or strong pitching call-ups that stabilize run prevention.",
