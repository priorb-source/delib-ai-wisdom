    "review": "Both forecasters raise critical points I underweighted. Most importantly, they challenge my assumption about the current baseline - Forecaster 2 states there are currently only 4 destinations (with possibly a 5th charter), while Forecaster 3 estimates 2-4 scheduled routes. I had assumed 5 destinations were currently operating without verification. This is crucial because if the baseline is 3-4, we need 2-3 new routes in just 40 days to reach 6+, which is far less likely than needing just 1 additional route. Forecaster 2's point about the resolution source (flightsfrom.com showing scheduled flights, not charters) is also important. Both forecasters correctly emphasize that international route establishment requires months of planning, regulatory approval, and marketing - making multiple new routes in 6 weeks extremely unlikely. The weak demand environment described in the background article supports this. My original forecast failed to adequately verify the current baseline and was too optimistic about route additions in such a short timeframe.",
    "rationale": "Upon reflection, I significantly overestimated both the current baseline and the likelihood of rapid route additions. The research assistant only confirmed two specific developments: the Brisbane route (operational since February 2025) and the Narita route (starting October 29, after the resolution date). I incorrectly assumed Manila, Seoul, and Taipei routes were definitely operating without evidence. If the current count is 3-4 destinations as the other forecasters suggest, reaching 6+ requires 2-3 new international routes in 40 days. International aviation route planning typically requires 6+ months for regulatory approvals, aircraft allocation, crew scheduling, and marketing. With weak tourism demand per the background article and no evidence of imminent route announcements beyond those already mentioned, the probability of adding sufficient routes by July 1 is very low. The only scenario supporting a higher probability would be if summer seasonal routes were already planned and filed but not yet public, or if the current baseline is higher than estimated. However, given the explicit statement about slow flight recovery, this seems unlikely. I should update significantly downward toward the other forecasters' assessments.",
