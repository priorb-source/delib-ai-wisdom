    "review": "Both forecasters provide compelling analyses that converge remarkably on 9-10% probability. Forecaster 2 adds crucial specificity about the lack of observable tunneling activity or logistical preparations at Punggye-ri, which is a stronger indicator than I initially weighted. Forecaster 3 usefully catalogs the specific 2025 conventional tests (IRBM, cruise missiles, UUV, destroyer weapons), demonstrating that North Korea has alternative signaling mechanisms without crossing the nuclear threshold. Both emphasize the diplomatic cost vis-à-vis China and Russia more explicitly than I did. Forecaster 3's mention of June 25 as a symbolically significant date (Korean War anniversary) is noteworthy but doesn't substantially change the calculus given the lack of preparation indicators. The convergence around 9-10% across all three independent analyses, using similar base rate reasoning and emphasis on observable evidence, increases my confidence that this range appropriately captures the situation. The most persuasive shared argument is that nuclear tests require detectable preparations that would show up in satellite imagery, and the absence of such signals with only 2 months remaining is a strong negative indicator.",
    "rationale": "After reviewing both forecasters' analyses, I'm reinforcing my initial assessment. The key evidence remains: (1) the 8-year testing hiatus creates strong status quo inertia, (2) only 2 months remain in our timeframe, (3) no credible reports of Punggye-ri test site preparations exist, and (4) North Korea has demonstrated multiple conventional capabilities in 2025 without nuclear testing. The additional detail from Forecaster 3 about specific 2025 tests (IRBM with HGV, strategic cruise missiles, Haeil-2 UUV, destroyer weapons) strengthens the case that Pyongyang is actively signaling military strength through non-nuclear means. Forecaster 2's emphasis on the diplomatic cost of alienating China and Russia adds weight to the constraints against testing. While Kim Jong Un's rhetoric about 'accelerating nuclear armament' cannot be dismissed entirely, the absence of observable preparations at Punggye-ri—which both forecasters highlighted—is decisive given the short window. All three forecasters independently arrived at 9-10% using similar reasoning, which validates rather than challenges my original analysis. I see no compelling reason to adjust my forecast.",
