  "information": "Several factors specific to this recall may influence its duration. Factors that could lead to a longer resolution time include the substantial volume of the product, the long production window, and the product's frozen nature, which means it may remain in consumer freezers for longer periods. Conversely, factors that could shorten the timeline include the recall's limited geographical scope (only New York), the reason being a misbranding/allergen issue rather than pathogen contamination (which typically involves a more complex investigation), and the company's proactive and voluntary initiation of the recall.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Approximately 8 weeks, as the question resolves based on the status on July 1, 2025.",
    "status_quo_outcome": "The recall is currently listed as 'Active' on the USDA FSIS website. If this status does not change by the resolution date, the question will resolve as No.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "The process of accounting for the nearly 65,000 pounds of recalled product, which has a long shelf-life due to being frozen and was produced over a one-year window, proves complex. The USDA's required recall effectiveness checks are not completed to their satisfaction, leaving the recall status as 'Active' on July 1, 2025.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "ACC Central Kitchen LLC moves quickly to notify its distributors and customers. Aided by the recall's limited geographical scope (New York only), the company is able to account for the majority of the product efficiently. The FSIS completes its verification checks and, satisfied with the company's actions, changes the recall's status to 'Closed' well before the July 1, 2025 deadline.",
    "rationale": "My forecast is based on weighing the factors that complicate this recall against those that simplify it. The status quo is that the recall is 'Active', and recalls take time to close. The primary factors suggesting a longer duration, and a potential 'No' resolution, are the large volume (nearly 65,000 lbs), the very long one-year production window, and the product's frozen nature, which means it could remain with consumers for an extended period. These factors certainly introduce complexity to the process of tracking and accounting for the product. However, I believe the factors pointing to a quicker resolution are more impactful. The most significant of these is the reason for the recall: misbranding and an undeclared allergen. This is fundamentally a labeling issue, not a pathogen contamination. Recalls of this nature are typically far less complex and are resolved more quickly than those involving E. coli or Salmonella, as the investigation is not focused on identifying a source of contamination. Furthermore, the recall is limited to a single state (New York), which vastly simplifies the logistics of notification and retrieval compared to a nationwide recall. The company also initiated the recall voluntarily, which often indicates a higher degree of cooperation and better record-keeping. The resolution window of just over two months (from early May to July 1) is a reasonable timeframe for this type of recall, even with the noted complexities. My forecast is not higher than 75% because the large volume and long production window create a non-trivial risk of administrative delays in completing the necessary verification checks. The frozen nature of the product adds another layer of uncertainty. My forecast is not lower because the allergen-based nature and single-state scope are very strong predictors of a relatively swift closure. I would increase my forecast if I learned the product was primarily sold to a few large commercial distributors rather than dispersed retail. I would decrease it if reports emerged of poor record-keeping by the company or an expansion of the recall.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill the USDA-posted recall by ACC Central Kitchen LLC of pork bun products issued April 24, 2025 be closed before July 1, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nConsumerAffairs: [Nearly 65,000 pounds of pork buns recalled for undeclared allergen](https://www.consumeraffairs.com/news/nearly-65000-pounds-of-pork-buns-recalled-for-undeclared-allergen-042525.html)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if the status of the recall posted by the U.S. Department of Agriculture’s Food Safety and Inspection Service (FSIS) is changed from Active to Closed on [this page](https://www.fsis.usda.gov/recalls-alerts/acc-central-kitchen-llc-recalls-pork-bun-products-due-misbranding-and-undeclared) before July 1, 2025. If the recall is still shown as Active when the link is accessed by Metaculus on or after July 1, 2025, this question resolves as **No**.\n\n\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nSeveral factors specific to this recall may influence its duration.

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
