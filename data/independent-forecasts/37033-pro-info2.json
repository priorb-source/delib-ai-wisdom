  "information": "The Zimbabwean government's compensation efforts are part of a broader strategy for international re-engagement and debt restructuring. Officials have linked the payments to efforts to clear arrears on a $21 billion national debt and have Western sanctions lifted. In a separate but related action in February 2025, the government paid $20 million to foreign farmers from several European nations, including Denmark, Germany, and Switzerland, whose 94 farms were seized despite being covered by bilateral investment protection agreements. This payment was the first installment of $145 million owed to this group, with the Treasury planning multi-year allocations through 2028 to cover the balance. In other signs of warming international relations, Zimbabwe suspended tariffs on US goods and President Mnangagwa hosted a delegation of Afrikaner business leaders.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Approximately 5 weeks (resolves June 1, 2025).",
    "status_quo_outcome": "The Zimbabwean government, having recently made a payment on April 9, 2025, continues with its stated policy of compensating farmers as part of its international re-engagement strategy, leading to another payment.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Despite stated intentions, bureaucratic delays or acute financial constraints within the Zimbabwean government prevent the processing and disbursement of another payment before the June 1, 2025 deadline.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "To maintain momentum and demonstrate commitment to international partners and creditors, the Zimbabwean government makes at least one more compensation payment, likely another small tranche, before June 1, 2025.",
    "rationale": "My forecast is based on the strong evidence of a deliberate strategy by the Zimbabwean government to use these compensation payments to advance its goals of international re-engagement, debt restructuring, and the lifting of sanctions. The payment made on April 9, 2025, and a separate payment to foreign farmers in February 2025, establish clear momentum and a pattern of action, not just rhetoric. Making another payment in the short term would be a powerful signal to the international community and financial institutions that the government is serious about its commitments. This political imperative appears to be the dominant driver. The amount paid is likely to be small relative to the government's overall financial challenges, making it a high-impact, low-cost diplomatic action. \n\nMy probability is not higher because the timeframe is short (around five weeks), and the Zimbabwean government faces severe fiscal constraints and bureaucratic hurdles. A minor administrative delay could easily push the next payment beyond the June 1 deadline. We lack insight into their internal payment schedule, introducing significant uncertainty.\n\nMy probability is not lower because the status quo is one of active implementation. The recent payments suggest that the political will and a mechanism, however slow, are in place. A failure to make another payment soon could undermine the goodwill generated by the April payment, which seems counterproductive to their overarching strategy.\n\nI would increase my forecast if Zimbabwean officials explicitly mention another payment planned for May. I would decrease it if credible reports emerge of a new domestic political or fiscal crisis diverting government resources and attention.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill the Zimbabwe, before June 1, 2025, make another payment to white farmers whose property was seized?\n\nQuestion background:\n[Zimbabwe reaffirms commitment to land compensation to spur growth, debt sustainability](https://www.thestar.com.my/news/world/2025/04/10/zimbabwe-reaffirms-commitment-to-land-compensation-to-spur-growth-debt-sustainability)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if, according to [credible sources](https://www.metaculus.com/faq/#definitions) the government of Zimbabwe after the launch of this question and before June 1, 2025 makes an additional payment to former farmers covered under the 2020 Global Compensation Deed.\n\nOn April 9, 2025, Zimbabwe [was reported](https://nehandaradio.com/2025/04/09/zimbabwe-pays-us3-1m-to-former-white-farmers-as-part-of-land-compensation-deal/) to have made its first compensation payment, of USD $3.1 million. Additional such disbursements made after the launch of this question and before June 1, 2025 would count.\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nThe Zimbabwean government's compensation efforts are part of a broader strategy for international re-engagement and debt restructuring.

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
