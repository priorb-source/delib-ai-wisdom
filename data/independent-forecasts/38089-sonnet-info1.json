  "information": "According to a visual analysis of a Morning Consult snapshot from May 8, 2025, Pedro Sánchez's approval rating was 35%, while Recep Tayyip Erdoğan's was 32%. A separate survey from January 21-27, 2025 by the same source, reported by El Economista, listed both leaders as having high disapproval rates. Regarding economic indicators, reports noted that Turkey's consumer confidence gained 5% in April, contrasted with a slump in Europe, and that Spain was experiencing an economic recovery.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Approximately 33 days until July 1, 2025",
    "status_quo_outcome": "Yes - Sánchez maintains higher approval rating than Erdoğan",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Erdoğan's approval rating increases due to continued positive economic indicators in Turkey (such as sustained consumer confidence gains), or a domestic political crisis or economic setback in Spain causes Sánchez's approval to drop below Erdoğan's current level. A tie would also result in No.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Both leaders maintain their current trajectory, with Sánchez continuing to benefit from Spain's economic recovery while Erdoğan remains constrained by Turkey's longer-term economic challenges and high disapproval rates. The 3-point margin (35% vs 32%) holds or widens.",
    "rationale": "The most recent data from May 8, 2025 shows Sánchez leading Erdoğan by 3 percentage points (35% to 32%). With only 33 days until the resolution date, I'm heavily weighting the status quo outcome, as approval ratings typically exhibit significant inertia over short time horizons. The margin is small enough to be concerning - a 3-point swing is plausible - but not so small that random noise alone would likely reverse it. Key factors supporting a Yes outcome include: (1) Spain's ongoing economic recovery provides tailwinds for Sánchez; (2) both leaders face structural disapproval challenges that won't resolve quickly; (3) no major political crises are currently indicated for either country. Factors that could push toward No include: (1) Turkey's improving consumer confidence (up 5% in April) could continue boosting Erdoğan; (2) the narrow margin leaves room for reversal; (3) any unexpected scandal or policy failure by Sánchez could quickly erode his position. My forecast is not higher because the 3-point margin is genuinely narrow and could swing with modest changes in either leader's fortunes. It's not lower because short-term stability is the norm for approval ratings absent major shocks, and the current data clearly favors Sánchez. I would update higher if June data showed Sánchez extending his lead or if major positive developments occurred for Spain. I would update lower if polling showed the gap narrowing, Turkey's economic indicators continued strengthening substantially, or if Spain faced a political crisis.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill Spanish Prime Minister Pedro Sánchez have a higher approval rating than Turkey's President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan on July 1, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nResolution source updates monthly. According to Morning Consult for January 2025: \"The latest approval ratings are based on data collected from Jan. 21-27, 2025. Ratings reflect a trailing seven-day simple moving average of views among adults in each country surveyed.\"\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if Pedro Sánchez has a higher approval rating than Recep Tayyip Erdoğan according to [Morning Consult](https://pro.morningconsult.com/trackers/global-leader-approval) when checked by Metaculus on or after July 1, 2025. If this not the case (including due to a tie), this resolves as **No**.\n\n\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nAccording to a visual analysis of a Morning Consult snapshot from May 8, 2025, Pedro Sánchez's approval rating was 35%, while Recep Tayyip Erdoğan's was 32%. A separate survey from January 21-27, 2025 by the same source, reported by El Economista, listed both leaders as having high disapproval rates. Regarding economic indicators, reports noted that Turkey's consumer confidence gained 5% in April, contrasted with a slump in Europe, and that Spain was experiencing an economic recovery.\n\nToday is 2025-05-29.\n\nBefore answering you think:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n(e) You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
