    "review": "My initial forecast of 85% was too high. The other forecasters introduced crucial arguments I had overlooked. Forecaster 3 provided the most compelling analysis, grounded in specific financial data from the company's reporting: a near-zero cash balance ($0.23M) at the start of 2025, but also a very low debt-to-equity ratio. The low debt is a powerful counterargument to an imminent and forced bankruptcy, as it reduces creditor pressure and provides management with more flexibility to pursue an asset sale or an orderly wind-down outside of court. Forecaster 2's point about 'status quo bias'—that distressed companies often limp along for longer than expected—is also relevant and supports a lower probability within this short 57-day timeframe. While Forecaster 2's 25% seems too low given the company's explicit 'going concern' warning, Forecaster 3's reasoning for a probability around a coin-flip is very persuasive.",
    "rationale": "I am significantly lowering my forecast from 85% to 65%. The primary reason for this large update is the new information and arguments raised by the other forecasters, specifically the company's low debt structure. My initial analysis did not account for this, and it fundamentally changes the dynamic. Low debt reduces the likelihood of a creditor-forced bankruptcy, giving the company more time and options to pursue alternatives like an asset sale or an out-of-court dissolution, either of which could easily extend beyond the July 1, 2025 deadline. However, I am maintaining a forecast above 50% because the situation remains critical. The company stated in late March that it lacked sufficient liquidity, and it started the year with only $230,000 in cash. It is now May, and while they have managed to survive, their runway must be nearly exhausted. Without a announced asset sale or financing, a voluntary bankruptcy filing remains the most standard and probable path for a public company to formally wind down its affairs in an orderly manner. My updated 65% forecast balances the extreme liquidity crisis against the flexibility afforded by the low debt.",
