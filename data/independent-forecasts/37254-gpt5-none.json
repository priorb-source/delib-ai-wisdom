    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "About 61 days (until June 30, 2025, inclusive)",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No — the U.S. makes no such accusation.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Russia keeps its ground campaign confined to Ukraine; any cross-border frictions elsewhere (e.g., small border incidents, hybrid ops, flights, missiles, or cyber) do not involve Russian ground units entering another sovereign state without consent, and U.S. officials avoid the specific term \"invasion.\"",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "A salient new ground incursion occurs and Washington labels it an invasion, e.g., (a) Russian forces move from Transnistria or via another route into Moldova beyond existing positions without Chisinau’s consent; (b) a renewed push from occupied Abkhazia/South Ossetia deeper into Georgia; or (c) a significant, undeniable crossing by Russian troops into a NATO-adjacent state (e.g., Baltics/Finland) that the U.S. publicly characterizes as an invasion rather than a minor incursion.",
    "rationale": "- Status quo and base rates: Over the last 15+ years, Russia has launched major ground invasions of Georgia (2008) and Ukraine (2014/2022). Outside those, Russian deployments abroad have typically been by host consent (Syria, CSTO missions, various African states via MoUs). The U.S. generally reserves the term “invasion” for large, unmistakable ground entries. In a short, two‑month window, the base rate for a fresh invasion accusation is very low.\n- Constraints on Russia: Opening a new front while prosecuting the war in Ukraine is risky, stretches logistics/manpower, and risks NATO confrontation. Moldova is geographically hard to reach for Russian ground forces without an air/sea bridge or a land corridor; Georgia can be pressured politically and through existing occupations without overt new advances. A deliberate crossing into NATO territory would be extraordinarily escalatory.\n- Accusation threshold: The resolution requires a U.S. government public accusation that Russia invaded (i.e., sent ground forces without consent). Minor border incidents or hybrid actions are more likely to be labeled “incursions,” “violations,” or “provocations,” not “invasion.” That linguistic threshold further lowers odds.\n- Time left: Only ~2 months remain, so I put extra weight on continuity of the status quo.\n- Research assistant input: No additional info was provided, so no known fresh indicators elevate the risk.\nWhy not higher? A new Russian ground entry outside Ukraine would be a major, escalatory move; it’s logistically and politically costly, and the U.S. is careful with “invasion” rhetoric. Why not lower? Nonzero tail risks remain: a sudden move in or around Transnistria, a sharper push from Abkhazia/South Ossetia into Georgia, or a miscalculation along a northern border that Washington decides to label an invasion.\nUpdate signals:\n- Up: Credible reporting of Russian troop buildups or airlift preparations near Moldova/Transnistria; unusual movements in Abkhazia/South Ossetia; warnings from U.S./allied intel; overt threats framed as “protecting compatriots” in non‑NATO states. A U.S. rhetorical shift telegraphing readiness to call a prospective move an invasion.\n- Down: Passage of time without such indicators; clear Russian focus on Ukraine-only operations; visible Russian troop drawdowns near other borders; conciliatory Russia–Georgia/Moldova dynamics.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nBefore July 1, 2025, will the United States accuse Russia of invading any country other than Ukraine?\n\nQuestion background:\nSky News [Ukraine war: Which countries could Putin go for next? Is Europe vulnerable to a nuclear-armed bully? Your questions answered](https://news.sky.com/story/ukraine-war-which-countries-could-putin-go-for-next-is-europe-vulnerable-to-a-nuclear-armed-bully-your-questions-answered-13317497)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if, before July 1, 2025, the US government publicly accuses Russia of invading any country other than Ukraine, by Russia sending its ground military forces into that country without consent from the government of the country.\n\n\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nNo additional information available.\n\nToday is 2025-05-01.\n\nBefore answering you think:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n(e) You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
