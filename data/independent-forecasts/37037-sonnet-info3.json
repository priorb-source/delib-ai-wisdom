  "information": "The imposition of new U.S. tariffs prompted various international reactions. The Southern African Development Community (SADC) began assessing the tariffs' impact on the region and planned a high-level summit for June. Within the SADC, Zimbabwe's decision to remove its own tariffs on American imports was criticized by some as undermining regional solidarity. The European Union announced it would delay its own trade countermeasures against the U.S. for 90 days to allow for negotiations. China responded by imposing its own retaliatory tariffs of 34% and filing a formal complaint with the World Trade Organization (WTO).",

    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Approximately 39 days until June 1, 2025",
    "status_quo_outcome": "Yes - Lesotho likely continues to have 50% tariffs",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Lesotho's current tariffs are either not 50% (perhaps 25%, 40%, or 60%) and no policy change occurs by June 1, or they are 50% but are reduced or modified before June 1 due to diplomatic negotiations or policy adjustments.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Lesotho currently faces 50% tariffs under the U.S. harmonized tariff schedule and these remain in place through June 1, 2025, or tariffs are adjusted to exactly 50% in the coming weeks as part of ongoing trade policy implementation.",
    "rationale": "The AP article title explicitly states Lesotho has 'the highest US tariffs in the world,' suggesting significant tariffs are already in place. The question's specificity about the 50% figure, combined with the Trump administration's pattern of imposing round-number tariffs (10%, 25%, 50%), suggests 50% is a realistic level for these 'highest' tariffs. With only 39 days until resolution, I heavily weight the status quo - major tariff policy changes typically require deliberation and don't happen rapidly. The research assistant's report indicates ongoing trade tensions but no specific mention of Lesotho tariff adjustments. The SADC assessment and potential June summit occur around the resolution date, making pre-June 1 changes less likely. My forecast is not higher because: (1) I cannot confirm the current exact tariff rate is 50% rather than another high figure like 40% or 60%, and (2) there's diplomatic pressure that could lead to last-minute reductions. My forecast is not lower because: (1) the article strongly implies very high tariffs are already in effect, (2) the 39-day timeframe heavily favors status quo, and (3) 50% is a typical round number for such policies. I would update higher with confirmation that current tariffs are already at 50%, or lower if evidence emerges of imminent policy changes or if current tariffs are definitively at a different level.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill the US government's harmonized tarifff schedule list the tariff on Lesotho as 50% on June 1, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nAP: [How tiny Lesotho ended up with the highest US tariffs in the world](https://apnews.com/article/lesotho-us-trump-tariffs-b337efa47290e889aa076cc9ede7bc9d)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if the duty provided in the applicable subheading is + 50% for Lesotho at the American government's [harmonized tariff schedule](https://hts.usitc.gov/search?query=lesotho) when accessed by Metaculus on or after June 1, 2025.\n\nWhether the provision is listed as suspended will not affect resolution.\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nThe imposition of new U.S. tariffs prompted various international reactions.

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
