    "review": "Both forecasters emphasize dynamics I partly underweighted: (1) new boundaries/seat reduction typically erode the advantage of the party defending a prior landslide; (2) Northampton likely accounts for a large share of seats, increasing Labour’s path to plurality; (3) a tie for most seats resolves as No; and (4) the hinge importance of Reform’s candidate coverage in rural wards under multi-member FPTP. I agree with their framing that Reform’s vote is often inefficient but still damaging to Conservatives by splitting the right, and that Lib Dem targeting in South Northants/Daventry could compound losses. I find their focus on candidate slate breadth and tactical voting signals convincing and a useful refinement over my earlier analysis. I also agree that leadership turnover marginally weakens incumbency effects.",
    "rationale": "I initially had Conservatives at 45% to finish with the most seats, expecting substantial losses but a plausible plurality via rural strength and opposition fragmentation. After weighing the others’ points, I’m nudging down. The seat reduction from 93→76 after a big 2021 Conservative win increases regression risk; boundary redraws often blunt incumbent efficiencies. Northampton’s likely larger seat share raises the probability that Labour’s urban dominance translates to a plurality even if rural areas fragment. The tie-as-No consideration trims the Conservative tail further. I still see a meaningful path for Conservatives—Reform’s conversion to seats is uncertain, opposition fragmentation persists, and rural incumbency can still carry multi-member wards—but the modal picture is No Overall Control with Labour narrowly ahead on seats, not Conservatives. Accordingly, I lower my estimate from 45% to 40%.",
