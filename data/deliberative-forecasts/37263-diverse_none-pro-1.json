    "review": "The other two forecasters provided analyses that strongly align with my own, focusing on the short time frame, the protective regulatory environment, the small market size, and the complete lack of positive evidence. Their reasoning is highly convincing. I found two points particularly valuable: Forecaster 3's specific mention of precedent in other resistant Caribbean markets like the Cayman Islands and Bahamas, which strengthens the base rate argument against a launch. Secondly, Forecaster 3 also articulated the most plausible, albeit unlikely, path to a 'Yes' outcome: a rapid partnership with existing licensed taxi operators. This is a more concrete scenario than a generic 'surprise launch' and helped me better calibrate the small probability of a positive resolution. The consensus at 8% suggests I may have been slightly under-weighting these tail-risk possibilities.",
    "rationale": "I am maintaining my core thesis that a 'Yes' outcome is highly unlikely. The status quo is that Uber is not present, the two-month timeframe is exceptionally short for a new market entry, and the local political environment, as evidenced by the warning against illegal taxis, is hostile to new ride-sharing entrants. However, the other forecasters' analyses have convinced me to slightly increase my probability. My initial 5% forecast was heavily anchored on the lack of any positive signals. The other forecasters correctly point out plausible, though low-probability, scenarios for a 'Yes' outcome, such as an unannounced, pre-negotiated partnership with a local taxi association—a model Uber has used elsewhere to enter difficult markets quickly. This specific mechanism is more plausible than a standard grassroots launch. The consensus view that the probability is slightly higher than my initial estimate makes me believe I was slightly under-pricing this tail risk. Therefore, I am updating my forecast upward from 5% to 7% to better reflect this small but non-zero possibility.",
