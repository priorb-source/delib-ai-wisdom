  "information": "The most recent poll, conducted on April 22, 2025, projects the Progressive Reform Party (VHP) winning 29% of seats, the National Democratic Party (NDP) 24%, and the National Party of Suriname (NPS) 14%. An earlier poll from January 2025 showed the NDP at 54% and the VHP at 29%. The incumbent VHP, led by President Chandrikapersad Santokhi, aims to secure at least 26 of the 51 available seats in the National Assembly. The opposition NDP has publicly ruled out any post-election collaboration with the VHP.\n\nPositive economic factors for the incumbent VHP government include a reduction in inflation from 60% to 10%, compliance with an IMF program, and the signing of a Final Investment Decision with TotalEnergies for the Granmorgu oil field. The government also instituted a 15% salary increase for government employees and pensioners in 2024, with an additional 5% in January 2025. Conversely, negative factors include high public dissatisfaction, with 56% of the public dissatisfied with the current government and 66% believing the country is worse off than five years prior. The country faces persistent poverty and a $4 billion national debt. One report cited President Santokhi's approval rating at approximately 3%.\n\nThe general election is scheduled for May 25, 2025. A significant change in the electoral process is the shift to a National Proportional Representation system, which replaces the previous district-based system and will be used for the first time. The opposition is described as fragmented. The NDP is facing challenges after the death of former leader Desi Bouterse. Some smaller parties, including the Sociaal Democratische Unie (SDU), Permanente Voorspoed Republiek Suriname (PVRS), and De Nieuwe Wind (DNW), have formed an alliance to run together under the SDU banner.",

    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Less than one month. The election is scheduled for May 25, 2025, and the outcome will be known once the official results are announced.",
    "status_quo_outcome": "The Progressive Reform Party (VHP) wins a plurality of seats, as the most recent polling from late April 2025 indicates they have a lead over their nearest competitor.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Widespread public dissatisfaction with the incumbent government, currently at 56%, galvanizes voters to consolidate behind an opposition party in the final weeks. The National Democratic Party (NDP) recovers from its recent internal issues, or another party like the National Party of Suriname (NPS) surges, overtaking the VHP's narrow lead.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "The VHP's recent economic successes, such as reducing inflation and securing a major oil investment, combined with pre-election salary increases, prove sufficient to hold their base. The opposition remains fragmented, particularly the NDP, which fails to recover from the death of its former leader, allowing the VHP to win a plurality with around 30% of the vote.",
    "rationale": "My forecast is primarily based on the most recent polling data from April 22, 2025, which places the incumbent Progressive Reform Party (VHP) in the lead with 29% of projected seats, compared to 24% for the National Democratic Party (NDP). This poll is significant as it is very close to the May 25 election date. The key factor underpinning this lead appears to be the dramatic collapse of the main opposition party, the NDP, whose support plummeted from 54% in January to 24% in April, likely due to instability following the death of its longtime leader, Desi Bouterse. While the VHP-led government suffers from extremely high public dissatisfaction (56% dissatisfied) and a presidential approval rating of only 3%, the opposition's fragmentation and the NDP's internal crisis may allow the VHP to win a plurality by default. The VHP can also point to tangible economic achievements, including a drastic reduction in inflation, compliance with an IMF program, and a major foreign investment deal in the oil sector. However, my confidence is tempered by the profound public discontent, which creates a volatile environment where anti-incumbent sentiment could coalesce behind an alternative late in the campaign. The introduction of a new National Proportional Representation system also adds a degree of uncertainty. I would increase my probability if a new poll confirms the VHP's lead or shows it widening. I would decrease my probability if there are signs of the NDP recovering or if a significant opposition coalition emerges.",
