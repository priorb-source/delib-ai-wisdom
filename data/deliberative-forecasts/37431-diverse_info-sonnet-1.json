    "review": "Both forecasters raised critical factors I significantly underweighted. Forecaster 2 makes a compelling case that allergen/misbranding recalls are fundamentally simpler than pathogen recalls - there's no source investigation, no evolving contamination scope, just verification that mislabeled products are removed. This is a crucial distinction I missed. Even more importantly, BOTH forecasters emphasized the single-state distribution (NY only), which I completely overlooked. This dramatically simplifies logistics, notifications, and effectiveness checks compared to nationwide recalls. Forecaster 2's point about voluntary recalls indicating cooperation is also well-taken. Forecaster 3 provides good balance by noting the Class I designation, long production window back to November 2023, and frozen product concerns, plus the interesting point about potential website lag. However, I think Forecaster 3 may be slightly underweighting how predictive the recall type and geographic scope are. My original 47% was too anchored on raw statistical distributions without properly accounting for the specific characteristics that make THIS recall simpler than average.",
    "rationale": "After reviewing both analyses, I'm updating significantly upward. My original forecast relied too heavily on general statistics without differentiating recall types. The key insight is that allergen/misbranding recalls are categorically simpler than pathogen recalls - they involve documentation and labeling verification rather than source investigations. Combined with NY-only distribution (versus nationwide), this substantially increases the probability of closure within 68 days. The voluntary nature suggests good cooperation. However, I'm not moving all the way to 75% because the complicating factors are real: 65,000 lbs is substantial, the November 2023 production start creates a long tracking window, and frozen products remain in consumer freezers longer. The Class I designation also adds weight. We're 11 days into a 68-day window - if this were a simple recall, we'd expect closure within 30-50 days, giving us ample time. But the production window complexity means effectiveness checks could extend into the 60-80 day range. Balancing the strong simplifying factors against real complications, I'm settling at 60% - acknowledging this is more likely to close than not, but with meaningful uncertainty remaining.",
