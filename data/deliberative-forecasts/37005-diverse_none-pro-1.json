    "review": "All three forecasters agree that a Liberal majority is a low-probability outcome, anchoring on the party's significant and sustained deficit in the polls. Forecaster 2 adds a useful historical base rate: minority governments typically lose, rather than gain, seats in subsequent elections. Forecaster 3 provides the most compelling and granular analysis. Their key arguments are that a Liberal victory would require the confluence of *multiple* low-probability events (e.g., a major Conservative scandal, a rapid economic turnaround, and a collapse of NDP support to the Liberals), and that the Liberals face structural seat-growth ceilings in key regions like Quebec and the West. This framing of the problem as a compound probability of several unlikely events occurring simultaneously is a powerful argument for an even lower forecast.",
    "rationale": "I am lowering my forecast from 8% to 3%. My initial analysis was based correctly on the large polling deficit and unfavorable economic sentiment for the incumbent government. However, the deliberation has sharpened my thinking. Specifically, Forecaster 3's rationale convinced me that I had underweighted two key factors. First, the path to a Liberal majority is not a single event but requires several independent, low-probability events to all break their way. The probability of this compound outcome is significantly lower than the probability of any single event. Second, the point about regional dynamics creating a 'seat ceiling' is crucial; even a significant national swing in the popular vote may not translate efficiently into the 172 seats required for a majority due to strong Bloc support in Quebec and Conservative dominance in the prairies. These structural barriers make the already difficult task of closing a double-digit polling gap even more formidable. My updated forecast of 3% reflects this higher bar and the compounded improbability of the 'Yes' scenario.",
