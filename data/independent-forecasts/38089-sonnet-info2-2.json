  "information": "Spanish Prime Minister Pedro Sánchez has taken a vocal stance on the conflict in Gaza, describing the situation as a 'genocide' and vowing to raise Spain's voice to end the 'massacre.' In May 2024, his government officially recognized the State of Palestine, and Spain is expected to impose sanctions on Israel. Sánchez is also pushing for stronger EU action, including a review of the EU-Israel Association Agreement. Domestically, his activities include efforts for Catalan language recognition and social policies such as early retirement reforms.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Approximately 33 days until July 1, 2025",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No - Erdoğan maintains higher approval rating than Sánchez",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Erdoğan's approval remains stable or improves relative to January 2025 levels, maintaining his traditional advantage over Sánchez. Turkey's economy shows signs of stabilization, or nationalist sentiment rallies around Erdoğan. Meanwhile, Sánchez faces domestic criticism over coalition management, economic policies, or his international stances fail to translate into higher domestic approval.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Turkey's persistent inflation and economic challenges significantly erode Erdoğan's support over the next month. Simultaneously, Sánchez's policies on social issues, Catalan language recognition, and retirement reforms resonate positively with Spanish voters. His principled stance on Palestine/Gaza gains him domestic approval, while Erdoğan faces a specific crisis or scandal that damages his standing.",
    "rationale": "The extremely short timeframe (33 days) strongly favors status quo outcomes. Historically, Erdoğan has typically maintained higher approval ratings than Sánchez, despite Turkey's economic challenges. Erdoğan has a more consolidated power base and nationalist appeal that has kept his ratings relatively resilient, often in the 40-50%+ range. Sánchez, leading a coalition government, has faced more volatility and typically lower approval ratings in the 30-40% range. The research assistant notes Sánchez's vocal Gaza stance and domestic reforms, but these policies are divisive - while they energize his base, they also create opposition. His Palestine recognition could be popular among left-wing voters but controversial among others. In just one month, approval ratings rarely shift dramatically unless there's a major crisis or event. Turkey's ongoing economic struggles (high inflation, currency instability) present the main risk to Erdoğan's approval, but these are chronic issues already priced into current ratings. Without the specific January 2025 baseline numbers, I must rely on historical patterns suggesting Erdoğan typically leads. For my forecast to move higher, I'd need evidence that: (1) the January 2025 gap was already narrow, (2) Turkey faces an acute new crisis, or (3) Sánchez has gained significant momentum. For it to move lower, I'd need evidence of a large existing gap or Erdoğan showing renewed strength. Given the status quo bias appropriate for short timeframes and typical historical patterns, I estimate a 35% probability of Sánchez having higher approval.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill Spanish Prime Minister Pedro Sánchez have a higher approval rating than Turkey's President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan on July 1, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nResolution source updates monthly. According to Morning Consult for January 2025: \"The latest approval ratings are based on data collected from Jan. 21-27, 2025. Ratings reflect a trailing seven-day simple moving average of views among adults in each country surveyed.\"\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if Pedro Sánchez has a higher approval rating than Recep Tayyip Erdoğan according to [Morning Consult](https://pro.morningconsult.com/trackers/global-leader-approval) when checked by Metaculus on or after July 1, 2025. If this not the case (including due to a tie), this resolves as **No**.\n\n\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nSpanish Prime Minister Pedro Sánchez has taken a vocal stance on the conflict in Gaza, describing the situation as a 'genocide' and vowing to raise Spain's voice to end the 'massacre.'

Domestically, his activities include efforts for Catalan language recognition and social policies such as early retirement reforms.\n\nToday is 2025-05-29.\n\nBefore answering you think:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n(e) You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
