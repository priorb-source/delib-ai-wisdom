  "information": "Dan Osborn, an independent from Nebraska, is exploring a potential run for the U.S. Senate in 2026 against incumbent Republican Pete Ricketts. In early April 2025, Osborn formed an exploratory committee. He previously ran for the Senate in 2024 against Deb Fischer, losing by approximately six percentage points in a race that attracted $14 million in fundraising. Osborn has also launched a political action committee, the Working Class Heroes Fund, aimed at training and supporting working-class candidates for office. In public statements regarding a potential 2026 run, Osborn has framed the race as a choice to \"replace a billionaire with a mechanic.\"\n\nThe incumbent Senator, Pete Ricketts, is expected to seek re-election in 2026. Former President Donald Trump endorsed Ricketts for his reelection bid on April 11, 2025, calling Osborn a \"Radical Left Open Border Extremist\" while praising Ricketts. Ricketts is the seventh richest member of Congress and has a significant political and financial operation in Nebraska. Osborn runs as an independent but received support from the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee during his 2024 campaign.\n\nHistorical data shows that Senate exploratory committees often last three to six months before a formal campaign launch. Many candidates for the 2026 cycle in other states, such as Andy Barr in Kentucky and Haley Stevens in Michigan, announced their candidacies in April 2025. In his previous 2024 Senate run, Osborn formally announced his candidacy in July 2023, approximately 16 months before the election. A similar timeline for the 2026 race would place his announcement in June or July of 2025. Osborn himself has publicly stated that he will \"decide by early summer.\"",

    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "About 39 days (until 2025-06-01)",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No — no announcement before June 1, 2025.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Osborn keeps his exploratory phase through late spring, continues fundraising and coalition-building via his PAC, and targets a formal launch in June or July (or even decides not to run), leaving May without an announcement.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Osborn accelerates and holds a late‑May rollout (e.g., around Memorial Day) to seize media attention, start Q2 fundraising in earnest, and frame the race early against Ricketts, issuing a clear public declaration of candidacy before June 1.",
    "rationale": "- Evidence and timelines: According to the Nebraska Examiner and the assistant’s report, Osborn formed an exploratory committee in early April and has said he will “decide by early summer.” Typical exploratory phases last 3–6 months, which would normally push a formal launch to July–September. His prior 2024 run was announced in July 2023 (~16 months out), implying a similar or slightly earlier June/July 2025 window for 2026—still mostly after June 1. \n- Incentives to wait: As an independent with no imminent filing deadline, there’s little structural pressure to announce in May. Remaining exploratory gives him time to assess fundraising viability (especially after a recent 2024 loss), recruit supporters, and gauge DSCC-aligned interest before committing. \n- Incentives to move early: Trump’s April endorsement of Ricketts could tempt an earlier announcement to shape the narrative and begin Q2 fundraising under a declared campaign. He also retains statewide name recognition from 2024, which could reduce the need for a long exploratory period. \n- Weighing status quo: The status quo leans toward a later decision (June/July), and candidates often stick with deliberate timelines. That pushes the base case to No before June 1. \n- Why not higher: The combination of a fresh exploratory launch in April, the 3–6 month norm, and his own “early summer” phrasing points away from a May announcement. \n- Why not lower: He could plausibly target a late‑May kickoff to capitalize on media cycles and Q2 fundraising or simply because he’s already built infrastructure from 2024. \n- What would move me up: Reports of venue bookings or media advisories for a late‑May event; FEC filings indicating a principal campaign committee; clear quotes from Osborn or close allies committing to a May decision. \n- What would move me down: Statements indicating a June/July decision, continued emphasis on “exploration,” or scheduling signals that push any major events into June or later.",
