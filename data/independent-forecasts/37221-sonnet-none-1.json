    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Approximately 3-7 days. Euro Area inflation data for April 2025 is typically released by Eurostat in early May, so the outcome should be known by early May 2025.",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No - inflation comes in at or below 2.2%. The background information indicates downward revisions to eurozone inflation in February 2025, suggesting a disinflationary trend continuation. The ECB's target is 2.0%, and the question threshold of 2.2% is only marginally above this target.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "The disinflationary trend continues through April 2025. Energy prices remain stable or decline, core inflation moderates further as services inflation eases, and there are no unexpected supply shocks. Inflation measures at 2.2% or below, consistent with the ECB's target range and the downward trajectory observed in February.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "April 2025 sees a temporary spike in inflation above 2.2%. This could result from unexpected energy price increases, seasonal factors affecting food prices, base effects from year-ago comparisons, or a temporary uptick in services inflation. Supply chain disruptions or geopolitical events could also cause a brief reversal of the disinflationary trend.",
    "rationale": "The key factors informing this forecast are: (1) The timing - we are extremely close to the April data release, meaning the outcome has already occurred and will be revealed within days; (2) The February 2025 downward revisions indicate a disinflationary trend was continuing; (3) The threshold of 2.2% is only 20 basis points above the ECB's 2% target, making it a relatively tight margin. Without specific March 2025 data or preliminary April estimates, I must rely on the observed trend. The downward revision trend suggests inflation is likely tracking close to the 2% target. However, month-to-month volatility in inflation data is common, and the question asks about a threshold very close to target. I weight the status quo heavily - the disinflationary trend continuing - but acknowledge meaningful uncertainty given: the proximity of the threshold to target, normal monthly volatility, and lack of specific recent data points. My forecast is not higher because the trend shows downward pressure and there's no evidence of major inflationary shocks. It's not lower because the 2.2% threshold is quite close to the 2% target, leaving room for normal volatility to push the reading slightly above. I would update higher if I had evidence of March inflation above 2.3% or preliminary April signals of acceleration; I would update lower with evidence of March inflation well below 2% or clear continuation of disinflationary momentum.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill the Euro Area Inflation Rate be above 2.2% for April 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nEuro News: [Euro falls as eurozone inflation sees downward revisions in February](https://www.euronews.com/business/2025/03/19/euro-falls-as-eurozone-inflation-sees-downward-revisions-in-february)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if the Eurozone inflation rate for April 2025 is above 2.2% on an annualized basis according to [Trading Economics](https://tradingeconomics.com/euro-area/inflation-cpi).\n\n\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nNo additional information available.\n\nToday is 2025-04-28.\n\nBefore answering you think:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n(e) You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
