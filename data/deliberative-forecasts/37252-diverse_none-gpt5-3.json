    "review": "Forecaster 2 leans heavily on the severity of a (reported) martial law declaration and South Korea’s capacity for mass mobilization. That highlights a genuine catalyst, but their analysis does not engage with two key constraints: (1) the Global Protest Tracker’s curation (it tends to log distinct movements, not every large rally), and (2) the requirement that the GPT entry’s start date be after the question’s launch. If the major 2024–early 2025 protests are treated as one movement starting in December 2024, that likely won’t qualify. They briefly note reporting lag but not the start-date issue, so 75% feels too high.\n\nForecaster 3 usefully incorporates the passage of five months since the December crisis, acknowledging potential stabilization and protest fatigue, and flags GPT capture uncertainty. However, they also don’t explicitly weigh the start-date constraint, which is pivotal. Their 45% seems to overstate the chance that a new, distinct movement will start within the short window and be recognized by GPT.\n\nBoth analyses reinforce that South Korea can quickly produce 10k+ protests under stress, but neither directly addresses the high bar for a new GPT entry starting after launch. That keeps my estimate on the lower side, though I acknowledge the severe catalyst could spawn a fresh wave.",
    "rationale": "Key considerations unchanged: about two months remain; GPT is selective and typically records distinct movements with start dates tied to when a wave begins; and the December 2024 surge likely already anchors any ongoing anti-government movement’s start date before the question’s launch. For a Yes, we’d need a clearly new, large-scale movement (10k+) that GPT deems distinct, beginning after launch. That’s possible if a fresh trigger (e.g., arrests, controversial legislation, or a new government action) sparks renewed mass mobilization that’s framed as a separate wave. \n\nWhy not higher: The start-date requirement and GPT’s curation materially reduce odds; large rallies continuing under the same umbrella as the December movement likely won’t qualify. Time is short, and GPT sometimes lags.\n\nWhy not lower: The reported severity of the late-2024 crisis implies latent mobilization capacity and potential for a new flashpoint within two months.\n\nUpdate: I modestly raise from 20% to 25% to reflect the credible possibility of a fresh trigger producing a distinct movement, but I remain well below the other forecasters due to the start-date constraint and GPT selectivity.",
