  "information": "The time between Starlink receiving a license and its service becoming \"Available\" varies. For several African nations, the lag has been several months: Nigeria's service went live approximately four months after licensing in 2023, while Rwanda's took about four months. The median time for recent African launches has been estimated at 4–8 months. However, some rollouts have been much faster; for example, Bangladesh's service became available in about two weeks in May 2025. Conversely, some countries, such as Zambia, India, and Vietnam, have remained in a \"Coming Soon\" status for many months after receiving licenses.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Approximately 47 days (from May 15, 2025 to July 1, 2025)",
    "status_quo_outcome": "NO - Somalia does not appear as 'Available' on the Starlink map, remaining in 'Coming Soon' status or not listed at all",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Starlink follows the typical African deployment timeline of 4-8 months. Infrastructure deployment, ground station setup, local partnerships, and logistical challenges in Somalia's complex security environment cause delays. The service remains in 'Coming Soon' status through July 1, with a planned launch later in 2025.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Starlink executes an exceptionally rapid deployment similar to Bangladesh's two-week rollout. The company had pre-positioned equipment and established ground infrastructure before the license announcement. Leveraging existing satellite coverage and strong government cooperation, Somalia appears as 'Available' on the map within the 6.5-week window.",
    "rationale": "The extremely tight timeline is the dominant factor in this forecast. With only 47 days until resolution, we're looking at a deployment window of approximately 6.5 weeks. The research assistant's data shows that African Starlink deployments typically take 4-8 months, with Nigeria and Rwanda both requiring approximately 4 months. This suggests the base rate for sub-2-month deployment in Africa is very low. However, Bangladesh's exceptional 2-week rollout in May 2025 demonstrates that rapid deployment is technically possible under optimal conditions. This creates tension between the historical base rate (suggesting <5% probability) and the proven possibility of accelerated timelines (suggesting higher). Somalia presents unique challenges: it's a fragile state with ongoing security concerns, which typically complicate infrastructure deployment. This likely makes it more similar to the 4-8 month African cases than to Bangladesh's rapid rollout. The status quo strongly favors NO since the license was only recently announced and no deployment has occurred yet. My 15% forecast weights the historical base rate heavily while acknowledging the Bangladesh precedent. Why not higher: The 4-8 month median for African countries is compelling evidence that 6.5 weeks is insufficient. Even the fastest African cases took 4 months. Bangladesh appears to be an exceptional outlier rather than the new normal. Why not lower: Bangladesh proves ultra-rapid deployment is technically possible. The license announcement suggests some regulatory groundwork is complete. Going below 10% would essentially dismiss the possibility entirely, which seems unjustified given existing precedent. I would revise upward if: evidence emerges of ground stations being installed, local partnerships announced, or Starlink explicitly commits to an accelerated Somalia timeline. I would revise downward if: we reach mid-June without deployment news, security incidents complicate operations, or Starlink indicates standard timelines will apply.",
