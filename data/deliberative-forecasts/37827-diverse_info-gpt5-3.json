    "review": "Forecaster 2 usefully emphasizes the feasibility demonstrated by the Rwanda case, but likely overstates it by treating that January 2025 report as a confirmed pilot report; the example provided doesn’t clearly indicate it was pilot-tagged. That weakens the case for a large upward adjustment. Forecaster 3 adds the most new value with a quantitative base rate (4–6 African pilot reports over 10 years → ~3–5% monthly). This aligns with my qualitative sense that the monthly chance is low single digits and supports a slight downward nudge from my prior 8%. Both note relevant gates (Africa location, pilot classification, timing) and NUFORC’s US-centric bias; I find F3’s argument more convincing due to explicit base-rate framing, with the caveat that the exact counts aren’t independently verified here.",
    "rationale": "Key constraints remain: an African location, pilot-tag classification on NUFORC’s subindex, and occurrence specifically in June. Africa is underrepresented in NUFORC data and in pilot-tagged reports. A reasonable base rate is ~3–5% per month (per F3), with modest upward pressure because (a) a very recent African NUFORC report shows the pathway is active (even if not pilot-tagged) and (b) postings after July 1 still count if the occurrence date is June. Offsetting that, NUFORC’s pilot-tagging can be inconsistent, and there’s no evidence of an ongoing regional cluster or elevated reporting that would make June special. Netting these, I trim my estimate slightly from 8% to 7%, giving modest credit for feasibility but hewing closer to the low base rate.",
