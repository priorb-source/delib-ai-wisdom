    "review": "The other forecasters both arrived at a 20% probability, arguing that diplomatic inertia and previous statements about no planned calls make the outcome unlikely. Forecaster 2 introduced two critical pieces of information I had not considered: a Kremlin statement from April 4 that 'no calls were planned for the near future,' and, more importantly, that Trump and Putin have already spoken twice in 2025 (February and March). Forecaster 3 interpreted the Kremlin's May 5 statement about needing 'adequate preparation' as a sign of 'lack of urgency,' whereas I had interpreted it as a standard caveat accompanying a strong statement of intent ('certainly necessary'). While their caution is noted, I find their reasoning unconvincing and their final probability too low. They seem to be overweighting the now-outdated April 4 statement and underestimating the significance of the two prior calls. The precedent of two calls already happening this year fundamentally lowers the logistical barrier for a third.",
    "rationale": "My initial forecast was 35%. After reviewing my peers' analyses, I am updating my forecast upwards. The most decisive new piece of information, provided by Forecaster 2, is that two calls have already taken place in 2025. This dramatically reduces my primary concern about the logistical and preparatory hurdles required to arrange such a call within a short, one-month timeframe. A precedent and a process are clearly in place. This new information, combined with the timeline of Russian statements—evolving from 'no calls planned' on April 4 to a call being 'certainly necessary' by May 5—indicates strong and accelerating momentum towards another conversation. While the need for 'adequate preparation' remains a factor that could cause delays beyond the June 15 deadline, and we still lack a public statement from the Trump side, the established recent precedent for communication makes a third call significantly more likely than I originally assessed. I am therefore increasing my probability from 35% to 50%, reflecting a belief that the event is now as likely to happen as not.",
