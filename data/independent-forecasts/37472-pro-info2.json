  "information": "The political landscape in Bangladesh is currently shaped by an interim government led by Chief Advisor Muhammad Yunus. This government has stated its priority is a reform agenda and has indicated that national elections might be delayed until June 2026. On May 6, 2025, former Prime Minister Khaleda Zia, Sheikh Hasina's long-time political rival, returned to Bangladesh after receiving four months of medical treatment in London. Following her return, her party, the Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP), has increased pressure on the interim government to hold elections sooner, with some leaders demanding polls be held by December 2025.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Less than two months, until July 1, 2025.",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No. Sheikh Hasina is currently in exile and the political environment in Bangladesh is hostile to her return.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Sheikh Hasina, assessing the significant legal and personal risks posed by the hostile interim government, decides that the strategic benefits of remaining in exile in India outweigh the political pressures to return. She opts to wait for a more opportune moment, after the political situation in Bangladesh has stabilized or shifted in her favor.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Compelled by the recent return of her political arch-rival Khaleda Zia and aiming to re-energize her Awami League party base, Sheikh Hasina makes a calculated but risky return to Bangladesh. She decides that the risk of losing political relevance by remaining in exile is greater than the risk of potential arrest upon her arrival.",
    "rationale": "The current status quo is that Sheikh Hasina is in exile and faces a hostile interim government in Bangladesh, making her return fraught with legal and personal risk. This is the most powerful factor supporting a 'No' outcome, as the path of least resistance and greatest personal safety is for her to remain outside the country. The interim government has little incentive to facilitate her return, which would likely be a destabilizing political event. However, the situation is not static. The recent return of her long-time rival, Khaleda Zia, on May 6, 2025, creates significant political pressure. In the personality-driven politics of Bangladesh, a leader's physical presence is critical. Hasina's continued absence while Zia is actively engaged could be perceived as weakness and erode her leadership over the Awami League. Hasina has also publicly vowed to return. The forecast probability of 20% reflects that while the risks of returning are very high, the political pressure to do so is a significant, non-trivial factor that could force her hand. The short timeframe of less than two months makes a 'No' outcome more likely, as the complex political maneuvering or security guarantees needed for a safe return would be difficult to arrange so quickly. My forecast is not lower because the return of her rival is a major political development that could force a rapid, high-stakes response. It is not higher because the threat of immediate arrest and prosecution upon arrival is a powerful deterrent that is likely to override the political pressure in this short window. I would increase the probability if credible reports emerged of back-channel negotiations for her safe return or if a major international power began publicly advocating for it. I would decrease the probability if the interim government were to issue an arrest warrant or make explicit public threats against her.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill Sheikh Hasina return to Bangladesh before July 1, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nFirstpost: [Bangladesh has turned into a ‘terrorist country’: Sheikh Hasina targets Yunus, vows to return](https://www.firstpost.com/world/bangladesh-has-turned-into-a-terrorist-country-sheikh-hasina-targets-yunus-vows-to-return-13878191.html)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if Sheikh Hasina after May 12, 2025 and before July 1, 2025 enters territory of Bangladesh according to [credible sources](https://www.metaculus.com/help/faq/#definitions).\n\nThe circumstances of her entering Bangladeshi territory, whether voluntarily or due to her extradition from India, will not affect resolution.\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nThe political landscape in Bangladesh is currently shaped by an interim government led by Chief Advisor Muhammad Yunus.

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
