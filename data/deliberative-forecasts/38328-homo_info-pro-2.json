    "review": "My initial forecast was primarily based on a combination of the historical base rate of resignations and the generalized pressure from the Huawei scandal. Both other forecasters introduced crucial new perspectives that have refined my thinking. Forecaster 2 provided the specific, high-impact detail that an MEP had been arrested, which is a much stronger catalyst than I had assumed. However, they also convincingly used the 'Qatargate' precedent to argue that even an arrest may not lead to an immediate resignation, which tempers the certainty of this pathway. Forecaster 3's analysis was highly valuable as it identified a completely separate and concrete driver for a 'Yes' outcome that I had overlooked: the high likelihood of MEPs being appointed to national governments, particularly in Portugal, following recent elections. This gives a specific, timely mechanism for the historical base rate to manifest.",
    "rationale": "After reviewing my peers' analyses, I am increasing my forecast. My original reasoning was sound but not sufficiently detailed. The key insight from the deliberation is that there are at least two strong, independent pathways to a 'Yes' resolution, making the overall probability higher than I initially assessed.\n\nFirst, as highlighted by Forecaster 2, the Huawei scandal is more acute than I realized due to the arrest of a sitting MEP. While their point about the 'Qatargate' precedent is well-taken and suggests a scandal-driven resignation is not guaranteed within the short time frame, the pressure created by an arrest is immense and makes this a very plausible outcome for at least one of the five implicated MEPs.\n\nSecond, and more importantly, Forecaster 3 identified a completely separate driver for resignations: appointments to national governments. The specific mention of rumors surrounding Portuguese MEPs following the conclusion of their government formation in May provides a concrete, non-scandal-related reason for a resignation to occur within the resolution window. This substantially strengthens the 'base rate' argument I initially made.\n\nConsidering these two distinct scenarios together increases my confidence. For the question to resolve 'No', we would need to see zero resignations driven by the major corruption scandal and zero resignations driven by post-election government reshuffles across several member states, in addition to zero resignations for any other personal or health reason. The existence of multiple, strong, and largely independent potential triggers makes the 'No' outcome significantly less likely. Therefore, I am increasing my probability from 75% to 80%.",
