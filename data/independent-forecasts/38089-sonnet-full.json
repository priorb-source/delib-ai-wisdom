  "information": "According to a visual analysis of a Morning Consult snapshot from May 8, 2025, Pedro Sánchez's approval rating was 35%, while Recep Tayyip Erdoğan's was 32%. A separate survey from January 21-27, 2025 by the same source, reported by El Economista, listed both leaders as having high disapproval rates. Regarding economic indicators, reports noted that Turkey's consumer confidence gained 5% in April, contrasted with a slump in Europe, and that Spain was experiencing an economic recovery.\n\nSpanish Prime Minister Pedro Sánchez has taken a vocal stance on the conflict in Gaza, describing the situation as a 'genocide' and vowing to raise Spain's voice to end the 'massacre.' In May 2024, his government officially recognized the State of Palestine, and Spain is expected to impose sanctions on Israel. Sánchez is also pushing for stronger EU action, including a review of the EU-Israel Association Agreement. Domestically, his activities include efforts for Catalan language recognition and social policies such as early retirement reforms.\n\nTurkish President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan has initiated work on a new constitution, appointing a team of legal experts to draft it. Erdoğan stated the current constitution is outdated, while critics raised concerns the move could be intended to extend his presidency beyond 2028, a claim he has denied. Erdoğan also ruled out early elections. In foreign affairs, he publicly criticized Pedro Sánchez for showing support for the detained Istanbul Mayor, Ekrem İmamoğlu. The two leaders met in Istanbul in May 2025 to discuss bilateral relations, including trade, security, and the situation in Gaza.",

    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Approximately 32 days until July 1, 2025",
    "status_quo_outcome": "Yes - based on the most recent available data from May 8, 2025, Sánchez has 35% approval compared to Erdoğan's 32%",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Erdoğan's approval rating rises or Sánchez's falls by at least 3 percentage points, causing Erdoğan to equal or exceed Sánchez's rating. This could occur due to a major scandal affecting Sánchez, positive economic or diplomatic developments benefiting Erdoğan, or backlash against Sánchez's controversial Gaza stance and domestic policies. Erdoğan's constitutional reform initiative, if well-received by supporters, could also boost his approval.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Sánchez maintains his current 3-point lead over Erdoğan. This status quo continues if no major events disrupt current trends, Spain's economic recovery continues to benefit Sánchez politically, or Erdoğan faces continued criticism over his constitutional changes and perceived attempts to extend his presidency. Given the short timeframe and typical stability of approval ratings, this scenario requires no significant changes.",
    "rationale": "The most recent data from May 8, 2025 shows Sánchez leading Erdoğan by 3 percentage points (35% vs 32%). With only 32 days until resolution, I strongly weight this status quo outcome. Approval ratings for established leaders typically exhibit short-term stability, and significant shifts usually require major events. Both leaders have high disapproval rates and occupy controversial positions, suggesting their ratings are relatively entrenched. Economic factors cut both ways - Spain's recovery could help Sánchez while Turkey's consumer confidence gains could help Erdoğan, but such economic effects typically take time to materialize in approval ratings. Political developments like Erdoğan's constitutional reform push face criticism and could hurt him, while Sánchez's Gaza stance, though polarizing, may energize his base. The 3-point margin is meaningful but not insurmountable - it's large enough that random volatility alone is unlikely to erase it, but small enough that a significant event could swing the outcome. I'm not forecasting higher because the margin is relatively narrow and Morning Consult tracking can show month-to-month volatility. I'm not lower because the status quo strongly favors YES, the timeframe is very short, and no clear catalysts suggest an imminent reversal. I would update higher if additional data showed a widening gap or if Erdoğan faced major scandals. I would update lower if any interim data showed convergence or if Sánchez faced domestic crises.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill Spanish Prime Minister Pedro Sánchez have a higher approval rating than Turkey's President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan on July 1, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nResolution source updates monthly. According to Morning Consult for January 2025: \"The latest approval ratings are based on data collected from Jan. 21-27, 2025. Ratings reflect a trailing seven-day simple moving average of views among adults in each country surveyed.\"\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if Pedro Sánchez has a higher approval rating than Recep Tayyip Erdoğan according to [Morning Consult](https://pro.morningconsult.com/trackers/global-leader-approval) when checked by Metaculus on or after July 1, 2025.

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower.
