    "review": "Forecaster 2 usefully quantified the recent base rate: roughly 5 of the last 9 awards (2014–2024, excluding the hiatus) went to women, implying ~55% in that narrow window. They also note the last two winners were men, suggesting we shouldn’t assume continued female outperformance. Forecaster 3 emphasized finalist composition as the key driver and highlighted that if only 1 of 5 finalists is a woman, the chance is closer to ~20%, with 0% if no women are finalists. I find F3’s focus on finalist composition directionally correct and an important check on relying solely on winner base rates, though I think the probability of zero women finalists is quite low given post-2022 reforms. F2’s framing aligns with my prior, but their 45% might slightly overstate the chance if 2025 finalists skew male (as 2023 reportedly did).",
    "rationale": "I began near even odds based on recent winners and the Foundation’s equity push since 2022. The decisive variable is the 2025 finalist slate; without it, we must blend two inputs: (1) recent winner base rate for women (~55% in the last decade window) and (2) plausible finalist composition (often 1–2 women out of 5, though sometimes more). Forecaster 3’s reminder that composition can drag the probability down meaningfully if only one woman is in the field is salient, and 2023 reportedly had 1 woman finalist. That warrants a slight downward adjustment from my initial 45% to reflect the risk that 2025 could again be male-skewed. Countervailing forces (JBF reforms and multiple recent female winners) keep the probability well above 30%. Net: I modestly lower my estimate to 42%. I would update to ~55–65% if the finalists include 3+ women or there’s credible reporting of a female frontrunner; I’d drop to ~20–25% if only one woman is a finalist, and to ~0% if none are finalists.",
