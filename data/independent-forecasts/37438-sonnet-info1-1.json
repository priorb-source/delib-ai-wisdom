  "information": "Based on its Q4 Fiscal Year 2025 results (for the quarter ending January 31, 2025), ChargePoint reported having $225.6 million in cash, cash equivalents, and restricted cash. The company's operating cash usage decreased to $3 million in Q4, down from $31 million in the previous quarter. The non-GAAP gross margin improved to 30%. While overall Q4 revenue declined 12% year-over-year, subscription revenue grew by 14% to $38 million. The company has no debt maturities until 2028. For Q1 of Fiscal Year 2026, ChargePoint guided for revenues between $95 million and $105 million.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "57 days (from May 5, 2025 to July 1, 2025)",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No - ChargePoint does not file for bankruptcy",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "ChargePoint continues operating with its $225.6 million cash position, maintains its dramatically improved cash burn rate of $3 million per quarter, executes on its Q1 FY2026 revenue guidance of $95-105 million, and manages through the next two months without any liquidity crisis. The company's improving operational efficiency and lack of debt maturities until 2028 allow it to continue operations normally.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "ChargePoint experiences an unexpected catastrophic event such as a major customer bankruptcy causing significant accounts receivable losses, discovery of a major undisclosed liability, sudden loss of access to cash reserves, or a dramatic acceleration in cash burn that creates an immediate liquidity crisis forcing emergency bankruptcy filing.",
    "rationale": "ChargePoint's financial position as of January 31, 2025 does not indicate imminent bankruptcy risk. The company has $225.6 million in cash with dramatically improved operating cash usage of only $3 million in Q4 (down from $31 million in Q3), providing approximately 75 quarters of runway at the current burn rate. Critically, there are no debt maturities until 2028, eliminating a major near-term bankruptcy trigger. The company is still generating revenue (~$95-105 million guided for Q1 FY2026) and showing operational improvements including positive trends in subscription revenue (up 14%) and gross margins (30%). For bankruptcy to occur in just 57 days, something catastrophic and unforeseen would need to happen. Companies typically don't file for bankruptcy this quickly unless facing immediate liquidity crises, which nothing in the data suggests. The base rate of bankruptcy for companies with healthy cash positions and no imminent debt obligations is extremely low over such a short timeframe. Why not lower (0-1%): While very unlikely, we're working with data from January 31 and it's now May 5. Unexpected liabilities, fraud, or other black swan events could emerge. The overall business is still shrinking (revenue down 12% YoY) and operates in a competitive market. Why not higher (5%+): The financial metrics simply don't support near-term bankruptcy risk. The combination of substantial cash, minimal burn rate, no debt maturities, and extremely short timeframe (57 days) makes bankruptcy highly improbable. Would update higher if: evidence emerged of hidden liabilities, accelerating cash burn, or loss of access to capital. Would update lower if: Q1 results showed continued improvement in cash flow metrics.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill ChargePoint file for bankruptcy before July 1, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\n[ChargePoint Reports Fourth Quarter and Full Fiscal Year 2025 Financial Results](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1777393/000177739325000009/chpt8-kerfy2025q4exx991.htm)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question will resolve as **Yes** if ChargePoint Holdings, Inc., files any petition for bankruptcy protection in the United States, under any chapter of the United States Bankruptcy Code, before July 1, 2025. The question will resolves on the filing of such a petition, not on whether any bankruptcy protection is granted by a court. If no such petition is filed by that date, this question will resolve as **No**.\n\n\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nBased on its Q4 Fiscal Year 2025 results (for the quarter ending January 31, 2025), ChargePoint reported having $225.6 million in cash, cash equivalents, and restricted cash. The company's operating cash usage decreased to $3 million in Q4, down from $31 million in the previous quarter. The non-GAAP gross margin improved to 30%. While overall Q4 revenue declined 12% year-over-year, subscription revenue grew by 14% to $38 million. The company has no debt maturities until 2028. For Q1 of Fiscal Year 2026, ChargePoint guided for revenues between $95 million and $105 million.\n\nToday is 2025-05-05.\n\nBefore answering you think:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n(e) You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
