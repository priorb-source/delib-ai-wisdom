  "information": "A Politico report from April 24, 2025, citing multiple sources, claimed the White House was discussing the possibility of lifting sanctions on the Nord Stream 2 pipeline as part of negotiations to end the conflict in Ukraine. The report stated that U.S. Special Envoy Steve Wietkoff was the main proponent of the initiative and had instructed his team to compile a list of all energy sanctions imposed on Russia. Other reports have mentioned proposals from American investors and the former CEO of Nord Stream 2 AG to restart the pipeline with U.S. participation.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Less than 2 months, with a resolution date of July 1, 2025.",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No. Nord Stream 2 AG remains on the OFAC sanctions list.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Negotiations to end the war in Ukraine stall or fail to produce a breakthrough. Domestic political pressure within the US and opposition from key European allies (like Poland and the Baltic states) make it politically untenable for the White House to lift the sanctions. The administration prioritizes maintaining a united front against Russia, and the July 1, 2025 deadline passes with Nord Stream 2 AG still on the OFAC SDN list.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "A significant and rapid breakthrough in peace negotiations occurs, leading to a ceasefire or a broader settlement in Ukraine. As a key part of this agreement, and to incentivize Russian compliance, the White House makes a swift decision to lift the Nord Stream 2 sanctions. Proponents of the move within the administration successfully argue it is a necessary concession for peace, and the entity is removed from the OFAC SDN list before July 1, 2025.",
    "rationale": "My forecast is based on the significant political and bureaucratic inertia that favors the status quo. Lifting sanctions on Nord Stream 2 is a major policy shift that would require an extraordinary catalyst, such as a definitive end to the war in Ukraine, which seems highly unlikely to be fully negotiated and agreed upon within the next seven weeks. The Politico report indicating that this is being discussed within the White House is the primary evidence for a 'Yes' outcome and prevents this forecast from being lower. It signals that the possibility is being seriously considered as a diplomatic tool. However, such a move would face immense opposition from a bipartisan majority in Congress and key US allies in Eastern Europe, creating a high political cost for the administration. The short timeframe is the most critical factor; major foreign policy shifts involving complex sanctions architecture rarely happen this quickly without a preceding geopolitical earthquake.\n\nMy forecast is not lower because the high-level discussions reported by Politico suggest a non-zero probability of a rapid, unexpected diplomatic development where sanctions relief is a pre-negotiated component. \n\nMy forecast is not higher because the structural barriers—the ongoing conflict, domestic political opposition, allied concerns, and the sheer slowness of bureaucracy—are formidable and make the status quo overwhelmingly the most likely outcome.\n\nI would increase my forecast upon seeing credible reports of an imminent peace deal or public statements from senior US officials preparing the ground for a policy change. I would decrease it following a definitive White House statement ruling out the lifting of these sanctions or a significant escalation in the conflict.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill the US lift its sanctions on Nord Stream 2 before July 1, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\n[White House debates lifting sanctions on Russian energy assets, Nord Stream](https://www.politico.com/news/2025/04/23/white-house-debating-lifting-sanctions-on-russian-energy-assets-00306486)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if NORD STREAM 2 AG does not appear at Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) [Sanctions List Search tool](https://sanctionssearch.ofac.treas.gov/) when checked by Metaculus on or after July 1, 2025. If it does appear on the Specially Designated Nationals and Blocked Persons (SDN) List at that time, then this question resolves as **No**.\n\nAt the time of this question, the current listing of Nord Stream 2 by OFAC can be found [here](https://sanctionssearch.ofac.treas.gov/Details.aspx?id=31926).\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nA Politico report from April 24, 2025, citing multiple sources, claimed the White House was discussing the possibility of lifting sanctions on the Nord Stream 2 pipeline as part of negotiations to end the conflict in Ukraine.

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
