    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "About 10–12 days (polling day is 1 May 2025; most results expected overnight into 2 May).",
    "status_quo_outcome": "The Conservatives currently hold the most seats on West Northamptonshire Council (from the 2021 all-out election).",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Labour sweeps most multi-member wards in Northampton town and gains in some suburbs; Lib Dems/Greens/Independents chip away at Conservatives in select rural or market-town wards, leaving Labour as the largest party (possibly with no overall control).",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Conservatives dominate rural wards (South Northants, Daventry areas) and retain enough marginal/suburban Northampton seats to stay the largest party, even if the council ends up with no overall control.",
    "rationale": "Baseline: Conservatives entered this election as the largest party with a sizable cushion from 2021. Good forecasting gives extra weight to that status quo. Countervailing forces are strong: post–general election national environment is poor for the Conservatives, and Northampton town (a large share of the unitary’s seats) leaned Labour at the 2024 general election, suggesting Labour is positioned to win many of the town’s multi-member wards. If Labour takes a large majority of Northampton seats, they can plausibly become the largest group overall, even if Conservatives hold most rural divisions. Fragmentation matters: Lib Dems/Greens could take some anti-Conservative votes in rural/edge wards, which would hinder the Conservatives’ path to a plurality. On the other hand, incumbency and Conservative strength in South Northamptonshire and Daventry can still deliver a large block of seats, and opposition vote-splitting in certain town wards could allow Conservatives to remain largest without a majority. Unknowns include whether ward boundaries have changed for 2025 and the full candidate slate distribution; boundary changes that increase the weight of Northampton town would favor Labour, while unchanged boundaries and strong Conservative incumbents would favor Conservatives. My research assistant had no additional data, so I’m leaning on national trend, 2024 GE signals in local constituencies (Labour gains in Northampton North/South), and typical urban–rural seat patterns in unitary councils. Why not higher: national headwinds for Conservatives and likely Labour strength in the town make a Conservative plurality meaningfully less than even. Why not lower: Conservatives retain a robust rural base; even in bad national cycles they often emerge as the largest party in mixed urban–rural unitaries due to rural seat concentration and incumbency. What would move me up: evidence of minimal boundary changes, strong Conservative incumbency/candidate coverage, local polling showing Labour underperformance in Northampton, or significant opposition fragmentation. What would move me down: confirmation of boundary changes that add Northampton-weight, reports of strong Labour ground game and full slates in the town, notable Conservative retirements/defections, or credible local polling showing Labour ahead in many town wards.",
