    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Approximately 41 days. June 2025 begins in 10 days (May 21 to June 1), then the full month of June is 30 days, and resolution occurs on or after July 1, 2025.",
    "status_quo_outcome": "Yes - cube-shaped UFO sightings continue to be reported to NUFORC at rates similar to recent months",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "No witnesses report cube-shaped UFO sightings to NUFORC during June 2025, or any such reports are delayed and not posted to the website before the July 1st resolution date. Alternatively, June experiences unusually low UFO reporting activity overall, or witnesses who observe cube-shaped objects describe them using different geometric terms.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "At least one person observes and reports what they describe as a cube-shaped UFO/UAP to NUFORC during June 2025, and NUFORC processes and posts this report on their website in a timely manner before or on July 1, 2025. Given typical reporting patterns, this could involve 1-6 such sightings based on December 2024 data.",
    "rationale": "The most critical piece of evidence is that December 2024 had 6 cube-shaped sightings reported to NUFORC. While described as 'rare,' this demonstrates that cube sightings do occur with some regularity - at least several times per month in recent periods. The question only requires ONE such sighting in June 2025, setting a low bar compared to December's six reports. NUFORC has processed over 180,000 reports since 1974 (roughly 3,600 per year), indicating an active reporting system. There's no reason to expect June 2025 would be dramatically different from December 2024 in terms of reporting patterns - both are typical calendar months with no known special circumstances. The status quo strongly favors continuation of recent patterns. My forecast is not higher (85-95%) because 'rare' suggests genuine month-to-month variation exists, December might have been unusually active, and there's inherent unpredictability in witness reports. My forecast is not lower (50-60%) because we have concrete recent evidence of regular cube sightings, we only need one occurrence (not six), and the reporting infrastructure appears functional. I would update higher if I learned June typically has more outdoor activity/sightings or if January-May 2025 data showed continued cube reports. I would update lower if I learned December was a statistical outlier or if cube sightings were actually much rarer than monthly occurrences.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill the National UFO Reporting Center report a sighting of a cube-shaped UFO in June 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nAccording to the [National UFO Reporting Center](https://nuforc.org/about-us/): \"The National UFO Reporting Center was founded in 1974 by noted UFO investigator Robert J. Gribble. The Center’s primary function over the past five decades has been to receive, record, and to the greatest degree possible, corroborate and document reports from individuals who have been witness to unusual, possibly UFO-related events. Throughout its history, the Center has processed over 180,000 reports, and has distributed its information to thousands of individuals.\"\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if The National UFO Reporting Center posts a report of a sighting of a UFO/UAP shaped like a cube in June 2025 at [this link](https://nuforc.org/ndx/?id=event) when accessed by Metaculus on or after July 1, 2025.\n\nFor example, although rare in the history of NUFORC, the month of December 2024 [had](https://nuforc.org/subndx/?id=e202412) six sightings with a cube shape.\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nNo additional information available.\n\nToday is 2025-05-21.\n\nBefore answering you think:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n(e) You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
