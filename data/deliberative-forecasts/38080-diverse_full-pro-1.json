    "review": "The other two forecasters and I are in broad agreement on the core dynamics: the Temporary Restraining Order (TRO) establishes a favorable status quo for Harvard, and the upcoming May 29 preliminary injunction hearing is the pivotal event. We all concur that Harvard's legal and equitable arguments (irreparable harm to 6,800 students) are very strong. The key difference is in the quantification of uncertainty. Both Forecaster 2 (78%) and Forecaster 3 (72%) assigned lower probabilities than my initial 92%, and their reasoning is convincing. The most important point they raised, which I had underweighted, is the principle of judicial deference to the executive branch on matters of immigration and national security. The administration has explicitly framed this issue in those terms (invoking the Chinese Communist Party), and a judge could be hesitant to overrule the DHS on these grounds, regardless of the apparent political motivations. Forecaster 3 also introduced the plausible, albeit low-probability, scenario of DHS attempting to reissue a procedurally sounder revocation if the first one is struck down, creating new legal challenges within the short timeframe. These arguments persuasively demonstrate that there are more significant paths to a 'No' outcome than I had initially calculated.",
    "rationale": "After reviewing the other forecasts, I am lowering my probability from 92% to 85%. My initial confidence was based on a straightforward application of the four-factor test for a preliminary injunction, where Harvard's case, particularly on irreparable harm, seems overwhelming. The existence of the TRO further supported this view. However, the other forecasters rightly emphasized external factors that increase uncertainty. The argument regarding judicial deference to executive authority on national security and immigration is a critical source of risk that I did not sufficiently appreciate. Even if the administration's claims seem pretextual, a judge might decide the court is not the proper venue to second-guess such executive determinations, increasing the chance the preliminary injunction is denied. While I still believe this is unlikely, I must increase the probability I assign to this failure mode. Furthermore, the other analysts correctly highlighted the aggressive legal posture of the administration and the non-zero chance of complex appellate actions (like an emergency stay from the First Circuit) or novel administrative moves (like reissuing the revocation). My new forecast of 85% still reflects my belief that Harvard is the strong favorite to have its certification on July 1, but it now incorporates a larger (15%) allowance for judicial deference, unpredictable legal maneuvering by the administration, and the inherent uncertainty of high-stakes litigation.",
