  "information": "The Trump administration has threatened to revoke Harvard University's 501(c)(3) status, citing the university's DEI programs, alleged anti-Semitism, and refusal to comply with demands for reforms to governance and leadership. The administration has frozen $2.2 billion in federal funding and $60 million in contracts intended for the university. In response, Harvard has filed a lawsuit against the administration, arguing that its actions are arbitrary, capricious, and outside the scope of its legal authority. The university has rejected the administration's demands, with its spokesperson stating there is 'no legal basis for revoking the University's exemption.'\n\nThe authority to revoke a 501(c)(3) tax-exempt status rests with the Internal Revenue Service (IRS), not the President. According to legal precedent, revocation typically requires evidence that an organization is violating public policy or engaging in illegal activities. The key Supreme Court case, Bob Jones University v. United States (1983), affirmed that tax-exempt status could be revoked for organizations violating clear public policy, such as racial discrimination. The legal and administrative process in the Bob Jones case took over seven years to resolve. Historically, no major university has had its tax-exempt status revoked in recent decades.\n\nLegal experts and former IRS officials state that the revocation process normally involves a multi-step, years-long procedure including an audit, formal notice, appeals, and litigation. Statutory safeguards, such as IRC § 7217 and a 1998 anti-targeting law, are intended to prevent direct presidential direction or politically motivated targeting. The IRS is also reportedly experiencing significant internal challenges, including leadership turnover with three acting directors in one week and workforce reductions. Despite these procedural hurdles, multiple news outlets have reported the Trump administration has formally asked the IRS to begin revocation proceedings and that the agency is 'making plans' to rescind Harvard’s exemption.",

    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "About 2 months (≈66 days)",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "IRS opens or plans a proceeding, but only issues preliminary notices (e.g., a proposed adverse determination). Harvard files an immediate protest and/or gets a court injunction. No final adverse determination letter is issued, and IRS databases still list Harvard as 501(c)(3) by July 1, 2025.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "An extraordinary, accelerated action: the IRS issues a final adverse determination letter revoking Harvard’s 501(c)(3) (or Congress enacts a targeted statute and the IRS implements it) before July 1, and credible outlets report that Harvard’s 501(c)(3) status has been revoked. Alternatively, the IRS updates its official exempt-organization listings to show Harvard as revoked before July 1.",
    "rationale": "Baseline: The authority to revoke a 501(c)(3) lies with the IRS, not the President. The revocation path is typically a multi-step, months-to-years process: examination, proposed adverse determination, protest to IRS Appeals, final adverse determination, and then litigation. In Bob Jones University v. United States (1983)—the key precedent—the process spanned years, and no modern precedent exists for a major university losing 501(c)(3) on a weeks-long timeline.\n\nFrom the research assistant: The administration has threatened revocation, frozen funding and contracts, and reportedly asked IRS to begin proceedings. Harvard has sued and says there’s no legal basis. Statutory safeguards (e.g., 1998 anti-targeting provisions) limit political direction of the IRS. IRS operational churn is reported, but that does not remove due-process steps. Media reports that IRS is “making plans” are a long way from a final adverse determination.\n\nWhy the forecast isn’t higher: The window is short (~2 months). Even a highly aggressive IRS move would normally start with a proposed adverse determination; a timely protest keeps the case within the IRS and typically preserves exemption pending Appeals. Courts would almost certainly entertain immediate injunctive relief for a school of Harvard’s prominence, further slowing or staying any revocation’s effect. Legally, grounding a revocation in alleged DEI practices or campus climate would be far more tenuous than the clear public-policy violation in Bob Jones, implying heavy litigation and caution by IRS counsel.\n\nWhy the forecast isn’t lower: Non-zero tail risk exists. The administration may push for unprecedented speed; leadership turnover could produce anomalous decisions; IRS could attempt to issue a final adverse determination with immediate effect (even if quickly enjoined), or Congress could try a targeted statutory maneuver. If the IRS were to post a revocation to its official databases or publicly announce a final revocation, many outlets would credibly report that Harvard “lost” its status.\n\nWhat would move me up: (1) Credible reporting of a proposed adverse determination with unusually compressed response timelines; (2) public signals that IRS will skip or truncate Appeals or issue a final adverse determination imminently; (3) replacement of key IRS/EO leadership with stated intent to act before July 1; (4) a fast-tracked congressional measure specifically stripping Harvard’s 501(c)(3) that gains real traction.\n\nWhat would move me down: (1) IRS statements committing to normal procedure and timelines; (2) court orders enjoining any IRS revocation steps; (3) reporting that IRS declined to open or has paused any revocation action; (4) signs of de-escalation (e.g., funding freeze lifted or settlement talks that don’t include status loss).",
