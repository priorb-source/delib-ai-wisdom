    "review": "Forecaster 2 raises important points about concrete institutional preparations that I underweighted - the draft constitution completing public consultation in mid-April 2025 and laws banning central government agencies represent substantive steps beyond rhetoric. However, I find Forecaster 2's 30% forecast somewhat high given the critical distinction between institutional preparation and actually announcing a referendum date. Forecaster 2's own argument about bargaining leverage actually cuts against a higher probability - if the threat is more valuable than execution, why announce now? Forecaster 3's analysis aligns closely with mine and makes a compelling observation: there are no current reports of concrete referendum preparation. If RS intended to announce by July 1, we would expect to see more explicit referendum planning by May 2. The 60-day window is genuinely constraining. Both forecasters and I agree on the fundamental tension: RS has shown willingness to defy authorities and has made preparations, but the gap between preparation and announcement remains significant, especially for such a consequential action with severe international ramifications.",
    "rationale": "Upon reflection, I should modestly adjust upward from my initial 18% to account for the concrete institutional steps Forecaster 2 highlighted. The draft constitution and laws banning central agencies indicate more advanced preparation than I initially credited. However, I don't find justification for moving to 30% because: (1) There's a crucial distinction between building institutional framework and actually scheduling a referendum - the latter is a major escalation; (2) The bargaining leverage argument suggests keeping threats ambiguous may be strategically preferable to announcement; (3) No reports of concrete referendum planning exist despite having only 60 days remaining; (4) Historical pattern shows RS repeatedly threatens but doesn't follow through; (5) International deterrence remains strong with explicit warnings from US/EU. The short timeframe is particularly constraining - if they were planning to announce by July 1, we should see clearer signals now. I'm adjusting to 22% to acknowledge the more advanced institutional preparations while maintaining that the probability of actual announcement remains relatively low given the timeframe and strategic considerations.",
