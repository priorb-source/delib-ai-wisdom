    "review": "Both forecasters emphasize the very short runway (~60 days), entrenched taxi interests, and the small market size (40–50k residents) as key barriers. Forecaster 3’s explicit point about Uber historically deprioritizing very small island markets adds weight I hadn’t explicitly quantified. Forecaster 2’s focus on the lack of any public negotiation signals aligns with my prior view. I also note that the resolution requires Uber’s website listing or credible sources, which makes a stealth/quiet launch less likely to count. Overall, their arguments are consistent with mine and nudge me slightly lower due to the market-size constraint and compressed timeline.",
    "rationale": "- Time left: ~2 months to July 1, 2025—typically too short for a full new-country launch absent prior visible groundwork.\n- Status quo: Uber not listed/operating in TCI; local authorities signaling crackdowns on unlicensed transport and reinforcing the licensed taxi system.\n- No scenario: Continued enforcement posture; no public government-Uber agreement; no driver onboarding signals; Uber site remains without TCI listing.\n- Yes scenario: Rapid government-sanctioned Uber Taxi model partnering with licensed taxis, with quick approvals, driver onboarding, and public announcements reflected on Uber’s site or in credible local press.\n- Assessment: The combination of a small market, strong taxi incumbents, and no visible pre-launch signals makes a near-term launch unlikely. While Uber has expanded taxi integrations rapidly in some places, those moves typically leave a trace (press, recruitment, regulatory hints). Given the resolution requires website listing or credible sources, a last-minute, minimally publicized launch is even less probable.\n- Update: I lower slightly from 8% to 6% based on the added weight of market-size and timeline arguments, and the lack of any enabling signals.",
