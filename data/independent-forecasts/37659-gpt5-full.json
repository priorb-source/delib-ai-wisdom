  "information": "According to multiple independent news sources from April 2025, the Project 2025 Tracker showed significant progress. A Blick.ch report from April 8 stated that 100 out of 302 objectives were completed. A week later, on April 16, a Medium.com article reported the number had risen to 105 completed objectives, with an additional 44 listed as \"in progress\". An earlier report from The Daily Dot on February 25 noted that over 36% of its monitored objectives were implemented. One analysis contained in the reports calculated the historical completion rate at approximately 2.2 objectives per day.\n\nProject 2025 is a 922-page strategic document authored by the Heritage Foundation. Its stated aims include restructuring the US government and shrinking the federal bureaucracy. Specific objectives mentioned in news reports include dismantling the United States Agency for International Development (USAID), removing funding for the United Nations Human Rights Council and the W.H.O., allowing political appointees to personally authorize appropriated funding, reducing education programs, and imposing higher tariffs on imports from various countries.\n\nThe Project 2025 Tracker is a public website created by Redditors from the r/Keep_Track subreddit, with Adrienne Cobb identified as its creator. The site monitors and visually demonstrates the progress of the administration's initiatives based on the Project 2025 plan, breaking down the status of objectives by government agency. According to an April 2025 report, the tracker website was attracting between 50,000 and 100,000 visitors daily, with approximately 10% of the traffic originating from outside the United States.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "About 46 days (until July 1, 2025)",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No — current public reports in April had the count below 120, so if nothing changed it would remain <120.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "The tracker’s “Done” count plateaus or is revised downward: legal injunctions or agency walk-backs cause reclassification from Done to In Progress/Blocked; low‑hanging executive actions are exhausted; site maintainers tighten criteria or slow updates; by July 1 the Done total remains ≤119.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "The administration continues steady executive/regulatory actions and some of the 44 “in progress” items convert; the tracker adds at least ~15 more “Done” between mid‑April and July 1, pushing the total to ≥120 when Metaculus checks.",
    "rationale": "Starting point and pace: The assistant’s report cites 100 Done on Apr 8 and 105 on Apr 16, plus 44 In Progress. Getting from 105 (mid‑April) to 120 by Jul 1 requires +15 over ~76 days from Apr 16 (~0.2/day) or +15 over ~46 days from today (~0.33/day). The observed Apr 8–16 increment (5 in 8 days ≈0.63/day) exceeded that needed pace, though early‑term surges often slow. The reported 2.2/day historical figure is likely an early burst and not sustainable; I discount it heavily.\n\nPipeline: The presence of 44 “in progress” items as of Apr 16 is a strong signal of near‑term conversion potential. Even a modest conversion rate (e.g., one‑third to one‑half by July 1) would yield 15–22 additional Done items, enough to clear 120 by the deadline.\n\nRisks that keep me from going higher: (1) Deceleration after early executive actions; (2) possible reclassification if courts or agencies reverse/slow actions; (3) uncertainty in reporting accuracy and criteria changes by the tracker; (4) the Feb 25 “>36% implemented” claim conflicts with the April counts, suggesting some source noise. Any of these could keep the Done count under 120 through July 1.\n\nWhy not lower: The gap to 120 is small, time remains, and recent cadence plus a visible pipeline makes a modest increase plausible. The tracker appears active and widely watched, reducing the chance that updates stall.\n\nKey update signals: I would raise the forecast if by mid‑June the tracker shows ≥115 Done or clear movement converting In Progress to Done; I would lower it if by mid‑June the count is ≤110, if multiple items are reclassified out of Done, or if legal blocks pause major strands of the agenda.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill the Project 2025 Tracker classify at least 120 objectives as \"Done\" on July 1, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nThe 2025 Tracker is a project of the Keep_Track subreddit and is explained [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/Keep_Track/comments/1ii7tbr/project_2025_tracker_is_now_live/).\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if the [Project 2025 Tracker](https://www.project2025.observer/) has ≥120 Objectives classified as Done when accessed by Metaculus on or after July 1, 2025. If it is less than 120, this resolves as **No**.\n\n\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nAccording to multiple independent news sources from April 2025, the Project 2025 Tracker showed significant progress.

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
