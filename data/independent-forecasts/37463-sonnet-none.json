    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Approximately 7 days. 13F filings are due 45 days after quarter end (March 31, 2025), meaning the filing should be available by mid-May 2025, around May 15th.",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No - Berkshire maintains holdings below 10 million shares",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Berkshire Hathaway continues to hold a relatively modest position in Amazon (under 10 million shares) consistent with their historically cautious approach to high-valuation tech stocks, or potentially reduces their position as part of their recent pattern of being net sellers of equities and building cash reserves.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Berkshire Hathaway has significantly increased their Amazon position during or before Q1 2025, viewing it as attractively valued or a compelling long-term investment, bringing their total holdings above the 10 million share threshold (approximately $1.8-2 billion at current prices).",
    "rationale": "Without specific current holding data from the research assistant, I must rely on general knowledge of Berkshire's investment patterns. Berkshire initially purchased Amazon stock in 2019, which was notable given Warren Buffett's historical skepticism of technology investments. The position was relatively small compared to Berkshire's other holdings. Key factors influencing this forecast: (1) Berkshire has been a net seller of equities in recent quarters, building substantial cash reserves, suggesting a defensive posture; (2) Amazon's valuation remains elevated by traditional value investing standards that Berkshire typically follows; (3) 10 million shares represents roughly $1.8-2 billion, which while not massive for Berkshire's portfolio, would still represent a meaningful position in a single tech stock; (4) The resolution depends on holdings as of March 31, 2025, meaning any changes would already have occurred. The forecast is not higher because there's no evidence of Berkshire aggressively accumulating Amazon shares, and their recent behavior suggests caution. The forecast is not lower because: (a) the threshold of 10M shares is achievable for Berkshire; (b) they have shown willingness to own Amazon previously; (c) significant uncertainty exists without current position data. To update upward, I would need evidence of recent large purchases or statements indicating increased tech allocation. To update downward, I would need confirmation of recent sales or very small current positions.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill Berkshire Hathaway reveal a purchase of more Amazon stock in its Q1 2025 13F filing?\n\nQuestion background:\nStockCircle: [Berkshire Hathaway's Amazon Stake](https://stockcircle.com/portfolio/warren-buffett/amzn/transactions)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if the 13F filing for Berkshire Hathaway, Inc., filed for the period ending 2025-03-31, reports the company holding greater than 10,000,000 shares of Amazon.com, Inc.\n\n\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nNo additional information available.\n\nToday is 2025-05-08.\n\nBefore answering you think:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n(e) You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
