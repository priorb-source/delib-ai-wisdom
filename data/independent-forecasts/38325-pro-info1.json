  "information": "The advance estimate for Q1 2025 annualized real GDP growth was -0.3%. The second estimate, released on May 29, 2025, was an upward revision to -0.2%. Key factors driving the contraction in the first quarter included a significant increase in imports, which subtracted 4.90 percentage points from GDP, and a reduction in government spending, which subtracted 0.12 percentage points. These negative factors were partially offset by positive contributions from investment (+3.98 percentage points) and consumer spending (+0.80 percentage points).",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Approximately 3 weeks. The third estimate for Q1 GDP is typically released at the end of the third month following the quarter, so late June 2025.",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No. The second estimate for Q1 2025 real GDP growth was -0.2%. If no new information changed this, the growth rate would be less than 0.0%.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "The more complete data used for the third estimate confirms the weakness seen in earlier estimates. Final March trade data might show an even larger trade deficit, or revisions to business inventories or consumer spending on services could be negative, resulting in a final growth rate of 0.0% or lower.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Data that becomes available between the second and third estimates proves to be stronger than anticipated, leading to an upward revision of at least 0.3 percentage points. This could be driven by a significant positive revision to net exports (e.g., lower final import figures for March) or stronger-than-expected business investment as more complete corporate profit data is incorporated.",
    "rationale": "My forecast is based on the current second estimate of -0.2% and the typical size of revisions between the second and third estimates. The status quo strongly favors a 'No' outcome, as a significant upward revision of at least 0.3 percentage points is required to push the growth rate into positive territory. Historically, the average absolute revision from the second to the third estimate is small, typically around 0.1 to 0.2 percentage points. The initial revision from the advance (-0.3%) to the second estimate (-0.2%) was positive but modest (+0.1 pp). A revision of a similar magnitude would result in a final reading of -0.1%, which is still a 'No' outcome. However, the components driving the current negative estimate, particularly the massive -4.90 percentage point drag from net imports, are volatile and subject to potentially large revisions as more complete trade data becomes available. A meaningful correction in this single component could be sufficient to flip the headline number positive. My probability is not higher than 40% because a 0.3 pp revision is larger than average, and the base case is a negative print. My probability is not lower because the initial revision was already positive, and the volatility in the underlying trade data creates a plausible path to a 'Yes' outcome. I would increase my forecast if final March international trade data shows a markedly smaller deficit. I would decrease it if revised data on business inventories or services consumption comes in weaker than previously estimated.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill the third estimate of Q1 2025 annualized real GDP growth show an increase?\n\nQuestion background:\nAdvisor Perspectives: [Q1 GDP Advance Estimate: Real GDP at -0.3%, Lower Than Expected](https://www.advisorperspectives.com/dshort/updates/2025/04/30/gdp-gross-domestic-product-q1-2025-advance-estimate)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if the Bureau of Economic Analysis' Gross Domestic Product, 1st Quarter 2025 (Third Estimate) release shows that real gross domestic product (GDP) increased at an annual rate greater than 0.0%.

Key factors driving the contraction in the first quarter included a significant increase in imports, which subtracted 4.90 percentage points from GDP, and a reduction in government spending, which subtracted 0.12 percentage points.

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
