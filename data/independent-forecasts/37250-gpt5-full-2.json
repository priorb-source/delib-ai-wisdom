  "information": "The U.S. Supreme Court unanimously ruled that Kilmar Abrego Garcia's deportation was unlawful and ordered the Trump administration to 'facilitate' his return. Subsequently, U.S. District Judge Paula Xinis ordered the administration to explain its diplomatic efforts with El Salvador regarding his return and set deadlines for the government to provide information and documents. An earlier court-ordered deadline for Garcia's return of April 7, 2025, passed without compliance.\n\nThe Trump administration has publicly resisted the court orders. President Trump stated the case is 'in the hands of lawyers' but also claimed he 'could' have Garcia returned with a single phone call but would not, citing alleged MS-13 gang affiliations. The Department of Homeland Security acknowledged the initial deportation was an 'administrative mistake'. Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem stated that if Garcia were to return to the U.S., he would be immediately deported again.\n\nKilmar Abrego Garcia was deported to El Salvador around March 15, 2025, and is being held in a maximum-security prison. The President of El Salvador, Nayib Bukele, has publicly labeled Garcia a 'terrorist' and has stated that he will not be released or returned to the United States. U.S. Senator Chris Van Hollen traveled to El Salvador to demand Garcia's release from prison, but reported that the U.S. embassy in El Salvador had not received instructions to assist in the matter.",

    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "About 61 days (until July 1, 2025)",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "The Trump administration continues resisting court orders and does not instruct U.S. diplomats to secure Garcia’s release or travel documents; El Salvador keeps Garcia in maximum-security detention per President Bukele’s public stance; court proceedings yield documentation of “efforts” but no concrete transfer; time expires without Garcia entering U.S. territory.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Escalating court pressure (e.g., enforceable contempt, personal sanctions) compels the administration to meaningfully engage; a quiet diplomatic deal is struck with El Salvador to release and expel or parole Garcia directly onto U.S. soil (any U.S. territory, e.g., a U.S. airport), after which DHS could remove him again; or a political decision by Trump and/or Bukele abruptly reverses prior positions to resolve the dispute quickly.",
    "rationale": "Baseline: Status quo strongly points to No. As of May 1, 2025, multiple veto points block Garcia’s return within a short window: (1) the U.S. administration is publicly resisting a Supreme Court directive to “facilitate” return and missed a court-imposed date (April 7) without compliance; (2) El Salvador is detaining Garcia in a maximum-security facility, with President Bukele labeling him a “terrorist” and vowing not to release or return him; (3) the U.S. embassy reportedly lacks instructions to assist. With only about two months left, inertia usually dominates.\n\nKey evidence from the research assistant that pushes the probability down:\n- Supreme Court ruling in Garcia’s favor notwithstanding, the executive branch is resisting; district court oversight continues but hasn’t produced compliance.\n- DHS called the original deportation an “administrative mistake,” yet leadership (Secretary Noem) publicly signals immediate re-deportation if he arrives, underscoring intent not to facilitate return.\n- Garcia is in El Salvador’s maximum-security system, and Bukele has taken a hardline public stance against release.\n\nWhy not lower than this: There are credible, if low-probability, pathways to a rapid reversal. Court escalation (e.g., enforceable contempt with real consequences for officials) could force a policy pivot; a face-saving diplomatic arrangement could emerge if both sides see advantage in quickly returning Garcia to U.S. soil and then promptly removing him again; or political calculations could shift suddenly (e.g., coordinated statements, instructions to the embassy, issuance of travel documents, or Bukele signaling willingness to transfer custody). The Supreme Court’s unanimous ruling adds legal pressure that can sometimes catalyze late movement.\n\nWhy not higher: Two sovereign decision-makers currently oppose the return, and either can block it. Extracting a detainee from a foreign maximum-security prison requires at least tacit host-government consent; the U.S. executive has shown little willingness to expend political capital here. With only ~61 days left and no visible diplomatic groundwork, the bar for a turnaround is high.\n\nWhat would move the forecast up:\n- Credible reporting that the U.S. has instructed the embassy to secure his release, issued travel documents/parole, or scheduled transport.\n- El Salvador signaling openness to release/expulsion or transferring Garcia to a status consistent with imminent removal.\n- Court actions imposing immediate, personal consequences on U.S. officials for noncompliance.\n\nWhat would move it down:\n- Further public entrenchment by Trump, DHS, or Bukele; new Salvadoran legal actions extending detention; court acceptance of minimal “best efforts” without enforcement; or another missed court milestone with no consequence.\n\nNetting these factors and weighting the slow-changing status quo, I estimate a low but nonzero chance of a sudden, negotiated or court-driven resolution that gets Garcia onto U.S. territory before July 1, 2025.",

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
