  "information": "The US government documented 757 UFO sightings between May 2023 and June 2024. A notable concentration of these incidents occurred in Arizona, which has become a hotspot for sightings, particularly involving military aircraft. On January 19, 2023, a US Air Force F-16 fighter jet was hit by an object described as an 'orange-white uncrewed aerial system' over Arizona, damaging the plane's canopy. This was one of 22 UFO sightings reported by Air Force pilots between October 2022 and June 2023. Some US officials have suggested that the mysterious objects could be advanced drones used by foreign drug cartels for surveillance and smuggling operations.\n\nAccording to news reports, Florida ranks among the top three US states for total UFO sightings, with 8,623 reported cases documented by the National UFO Reporting Center (NUFORC). On March 28, 2025, a US military aircraft encountered a large group of unidentified objects described as glowing spheres in the sky over Florida. A leaked audio recording of the pilot's radio conversation with an air traffic controller indicated the pilot saw several high-speed objects, experienced communication disruptions, and observed an unusual glow around the plane. A Lockheed AC-130 Spectre gunship was reportedly dispatched to the area in response to the incident.\n\nData from the National UFO Reporting Center (NUFORC) indicates that California has the most reported UFO sightings in the US, with 36,286 sightings since 1974. Following California in total sightings are Washington, Florida, Oregon, and New York. NUFORC's public archive shows approximately 100-150 pilot-flagged reports are logged nationwide in a typical year, which averages 8-12 per month. The distribution of these pilot reports is skewed, with California and Florida being the two most common states for such reports, followed by a tier including Arizona, Texas, and Washington. In March 2025, a US Air Force pilot in California reported seeing 'three orange-like lights' hovering above Los Angeles.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Approximately 41 days until outcome is known (resolution will be determined after July 1, 2025 when checking June 2025 data)",
    "status_quo_outcome": "California would have the most pilot UFO sightings in June 2025, as it historically has the highest total UFO reports and competes with Florida for the top position in pilot-specific sightings",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "California or another state like Arizona records more pilot UFO sightings than Florida in June 2025. Given that only 8-12 pilot reports occur nationwide per month on average, even a difference of 1-2 reports would determine the outcome. California could receive 3 pilot reports while Florida receives 2, resulting in a No resolution.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Florida receives more pilot UFO sightings than any other state in June 2025, potentially building on the increased activity suggested by the March 28, 2025 military aircraft encounter with unidentified objects over Florida. With military presence in the state and the recent incident, pilots might report 3-4 sightings while California reports 2-3.",
    "rationale": "The research indicates California and Florida are historically the top two states for pilot UFO sightings, with approximately 8-12 pilot reports occurring nationwide per month. This creates a highly competitive situation where small differences matter significantly. California has the overall edge with 36,286 total sightings versus Florida's 8,623, suggesting California likely receives more reports on average. However, the March 28, 2025 military aircraft incident over Florida could indicate heightened activity in that region, though we're forecasting three months into the future which diminishes the relevance of this single event. The key challenge for Florida is that it must have MORE sightings than any other state - ties resolve as No. With such small monthly numbers (likely 0-3 pilot reports per state), random variation plays a major role. The status quo suggests California has a slight edge, but the competitive nature between these two states and the recent Florida incident provide some upside for Florida. I'm not forecasting higher because California's historical dominance and larger overall volume suggest it remains the favorite. I'm not forecasting lower because Florida is clearly one of the top two states and the recent incident suggests potential for elevated activity. To update higher, I would need evidence of sustained increased military or commercial pilot activity over Florida, or data showing Florida has been leading in recent months. To update lower, I would need evidence that the March incident was isolated or that California is experiencing particularly high activity.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill Florida have the most pilot sightings of UFOs of any US state in March 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nAccording to the [National UFO Reporting Center](https://nuforc.org/about-us/): \"The National UFO Reporting Center was founded in 1974 by noted UFO investigator Robert J. Gribble. The Center’s primary function over the past five decades has been to receive, record, and to the greatest degree possible, corroborate and document reports from individuals who have been witness to unusual, possibly UFO-related events. Throughout its history, the Center has processed over 180,000 reports, and has distributed its information to thousands of individuals.\"\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if The National UFO Reporting Center posts more pilot reports of a UFO/UAP having occurred in the state of Florida than any other state, for the month of June 2025 at [this link](https://nuforc.org/subndx/?id=x) when accessed by Metaculus on or after July 1, 2025.\n\nIf Florida is tied with another state, resolves as No.\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nThe US government documented 757 UFO sightings between May 2023 and June 2024.

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower.
