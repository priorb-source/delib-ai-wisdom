    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Approximately 55 days until July 1, 2025",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No - the resolution criteria have not yet been satisfied according to the question background",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "No large-scale protests materialize in Turkey between now and July 1, 2025 that meet the 10,000+ participant threshold, or such protests occur but are not captured/reported by the Global Protest Tracker database, or any qualifying protests already occurred before this question launched",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "A significant protest movement emerges in Turkey over the next 55 days driven by political, economic, or social grievances, drawing 10,000+ participants, and this protest is documented by the Carnegie Endowment's Global Protest Tracker with the required participant count and timing",
    "rationale": "The most significant piece of evidence is the reference to a Wikipedia article titled '2025 Turkish protests,' which strongly suggests that notable protests are occurring or have occurred in Turkey in 2025. Wikipedia articles about ongoing protest movements are typically created only when events are significant and well-documented, indicating substantial public demonstrations. Turkey has a demonstrated history of large-scale protests (e.g., Gezi Park 2013) and ongoing political tensions under the current government that could fuel mass demonstrations. However, several uncertainties temper confidence: (1) The specific threshold of 10,000+ participants is substantial and not all protests reach this scale; (2) The Global Protest Tracker must specifically document the protest with this participant count - data coverage varies; (3) The protest must have occurred after the question launched, meaning some 2025 protests may have already happened and wouldn't count; (4) With only 55 days remaining, the time window is relatively short. The status quo outcome is 'No' since criteria haven't been met yet. My forecast would be higher if I had confirmation that recent protests approached but didn't yet reach the 10,000 threshold, or if there were clear catalyzing events on the horizon. It would be lower if the Wikipedia article described only historical protests or if Turkish authorities had successfully suppressed recent organizing efforts. The Wikipedia article's existence is the key driver pushing probability above 50%, but specific resolution criteria create meaningful uncertainty.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill the Global Protest Tracker report any protests in Turkey (Türkiye) with 10,000+ participants, before July 1, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nWikipedia: [2025 Turkish protests](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2025_Turkish_protests)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if the [Global Protest Tracker](https://carnegieendowment.org/features/global-protest-tracker?lang=en) reports a protest in Turkey (Türkiye) with 10,000 or more participants with a start date after the launch of this question and before July 1, 2025.\n\nPlease note that the Global Protest Tracker uses the name Türkiye in its database.\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nNo additional information available.\n\nToday is 2025-05-07.\n\nBefore answering you think:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n(e) You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
