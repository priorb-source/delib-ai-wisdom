    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "About 32 days (until July 1, 2025)",
    "status_quo_outcome": "Yes — the BC Hydro home charger rebate page continues to state Tesla products are not eligible.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "BC Hydro updates the page before July to remove the explicit brand call-out (e.g., switches to a generic ‘Canadian-made only’ rule or just lists eligible models) so the page no longer mentions Tesla’s ineligibility, or BC reverses course and re-allows Tesla.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "The March 12, 2025 exclusion policy remains in force and the page continues to explicitly state that Tesla chargers are not eligible for the single-family home rebate.",
    "rationale": "- Status quo and timing: As of March 12, 2025, BC Hydro/CleanBC explicitly excluded Tesla products from rebates to preference Canadian goods and exclude U.S.-produced goods where practicable. With only about a month until July 1, rapid reversal is unlikely. Government procurement/rebate policies typically persist for months or longer unless there’s a strong legal or political impetus to change. This favors a Yes.\n- Incentives to keep explicit mention: Tesla chargers are popular in BC; programs often name high-visibility exceptions to reduce customer confusion and support call volumes. That makes it more likely the explicit ‘Tesla not eligible’ line remains on the exact page the resolution will check. \n- Risks pulling the probability down: The resolution hinges on the wording on that specific BC Hydro page. Even if Tesla remains excluded, BC Hydro might redesign content (e.g., move details to an eligibility list or a separate FAQ, or switch to generic country-of-origin language) and drop the explicit Tesla mention, which would resolve No. A policy reversal by July is possible but less likely given the recency and government backing.\n- External pressures: Any CUSMA/trade-challenge-driven policy shift would likely take longer than a few weeks to translate into a public-facing reversal. That tempers downside risk of rapid change.\n- Research assistant summary: No additional info beyond the March 12 announcement; thus the forecast relies on the recency and typical inertia of government program pages.\n- Why not higher: The resolution’s sensitivity to exact page wording presents a real chance of a No even if the exclusion continues; plus website refreshes around fiscal or program updates happen. \n- Why not lower: The policy is new, politically signaled, and likely to persist through July; removing a high-salience brand call-out so soon would be atypical absent a deliberate communications shift.\n- Update triggers: I would raise the forecast if there are any reaffirmations of the exclusion or if the page currently (near end of May/June) still explicitly names Tesla. I would lower it if I see signals of a trade/legal pushback causing BC to soften the policy, or if BC Hydro migrates to a brand-agnostic eligibility list without naming ineligible brands.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill BC Hydro still exclude Tesla from its EV charger rebate program for single-family homes in July 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nAccording to the resolution source, \"The Government of B.C. and BC Hydro are taking action to preference Canadian goods in our rebate programs going forward and to exclude, where practicable, U.S. produced goods. As of March 12, 2025, Tesla products (electric vehicle chargers, energy storage batteries and inverters) are not eligible for CleanBC and BC Hydro rebates. If you purchased or have received pre-approval for your Tesla product before March 12, 2025, it can still qualify for rebates and will be processed as normal.\"\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if BC Hydro at [this page](https://www.bchydro.com/powersmart/electric-vehicles/rebates-incentives/rebates-home-chargers.html) when checked by Metaculus on or after July 1, 2025, says that Tesla products are not eligible for the EV charger at home program. If it does not mention Tesla being ineligible, then this question resolves as **No**.\n\n\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nNo additional information available.\n\nToday is 2025-05-30.\n\nBefore answering you think:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n(e) You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
