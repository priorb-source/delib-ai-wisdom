    "review": "The other two forecasters and I converged on the same core evidence: the historical base rate of 1-3 pilot reports from South America on NUFORC per year. We all agree this is the most critical factor. The primary difference was in translating this low annual rate into a single-month probability. Their forecasts of 12% and 15% relied more directly on a pro-rata calculation (e.g., 2 reports / 12 months ≈ 17%), with a modest downward adjustment. My initial 8% was based on a more aggressive downward adjustment, emphasizing the filtering effects of the NUFORC platform. Their reasoning prompted me to reconsider this. I now believe my initial analysis double-counted the filtering effect; the low observed base rate of 1-2 reports per year already reflects these barriers to reporting. Applying a more formal Poisson distribution model to this base rate, as their analyses implicitly encouraged, provides a more robust estimate that aligns better with their higher forecasts.",
    "rationale": "I am updating my forecast upwards from 8% to 12%. The deliberation with my colleagues was valuable and highlighted a flaw in my initial reasoning. While we all correctly identified the low base rate of 1-2 qualifying reports per year as the key driver, I made an error by applying an additional, intuitive downward adjustment for reporting friction (e.g., language barrier, US-centric platform). The other forecasters' more direct mathematical approach is more sound, as the observed historical base rate of 1-2 reports per year *already* accounts for these frictions. A more formal approach is to model this as a Poisson process. Assuming an average rate of 1.5 reports per year (the midpoint of the 1-2 range), the rate for a single month is 0.125. The probability of at least one event in that month is 1 - e^(-0.125), which is approximately 11.8%. This calculation strongly supports a forecast near 12% and suggests my initial 8% was too conservative. I am therefore aligning my forecast with this more robust, model-driven interpretation of the agreed-upon evidence.",
