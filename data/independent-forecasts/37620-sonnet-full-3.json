  "information": "On May 6, 2025, Ramzan Kadyrov publicly stated that he was asking to be relieved of his duties, expressing a hope that his request would be supported to allow for new leadership in the region. He subsequently clarified on his Telegram channel that the final decision rests solely with Russian President Vladimir Putin, stating, \"I do not decide whether I will remain as the head of the Chechen Republic or not.\" By May 12, Kadyrov again addressed the rumors, attributing his recent serious demeanor not to a potential resignation, but to the ongoing special military operation in Ukraine, in which he said 11,000 Chechen troops were involved.\n\nMultiple media outlets, including Novaya Gazeta Europe, The Insider, and the Kyiv Independent, have reported on Kadyrov's deteriorating health, with some specifying conditions such as pancreatic necrosis and kidney problems. In parallel, reports indicate Kadyrov is engaged in succession planning. He has promoted his 17-year-old son, Adam Kadyrov, to several high-ranking positions, including secretary of the republic's security council and head of his own security department. Kadyrov's 26-year-old daughter, Aishat, also holds the position of vice-president of the Chechen government.\n\nRamzan Kadyrov met with Russian President Vladimir Putin on May 7, 2025. Following the meeting, Kadyrov stated he received \"full understanding and support,\" and Russian state media reported that Putin praised the Chechen Republic's achievements. This is not the first time Kadyrov has publicly discussed stepping down; similar statements were made in 2016, 2020, and 2022, none of which resulted in his departure. The authority to appoint or dismiss the Head of the Chechen Republic rests exclusively with the President of Russia. Kadyrov has held the position since April 2007.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Approximately 20 days (from May 12, 2025 to June 1, 2025)",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No - Kadyrov remains head of the Chechen Republic",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Kadyrov continues as head of the Chechen Republic through June 1, 2025. Putin does not formally accept his resignation request, and Kadyrov remains in his position as he has since April 2007. His May 6 statements prove to be similar to his previous statements in 2016, 2020, and 2022 that did not result in departure.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Putin formally accepts Kadyrov's resignation before June 1, 2025, and a successor is appointed. This could be accelerated by Kadyrov's deteriorating health conditions forcing an immediate transition, possibly to his son Adam or another designated successor.",
    "rationale": "The status quo strongly favors No. Kadyrov has held this position for 18 years and has made similar resignation statements at least three times before (2016, 2020, 2022) without any actual departure. This pattern suggests these statements may serve as loyalty displays to Putin rather than genuine resignation intentions. Critical recent evidence: (1) Kadyrov's May 7 meeting with Putin resulted in praise and 'full understanding and support' but no announced transition; (2) On May 12, Kadyrov himself downplayed resignation rumors, attributing his demeanor to Ukraine operations rather than departure plans; (3) Only 20 days remain until June 1 - an extremely short window for such a major leadership transition in Russia's political system. Factors that could favor Yes include documented health issues (pancreatic necrosis, kidney problems) and active succession planning with family members. However, Putin has shown no indication of accepting any resignation, and formal transitions in Russian regional leadership typically require explicit Kremlin approval and take considerable time. The base rate of status quo continuity, especially given the pattern of false alarms, heavily weighs against a transition occurring in this narrow timeframe. I would update higher if the Kremlin announces Putin has accepted the resignation, if official transition documents emerge, or if Kadyrov disappears from public view. I would update lower as more days pass without action or if clear Kremlin statements confirm Kadyrov's continuation.",
