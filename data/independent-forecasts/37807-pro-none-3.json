    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Approximately 1.5 months.",
    "status_quo_outcome": "Yes. As of May 2025, the USDA page explicitly lists 'snack foods' as an eligible item for purchase with SNAP benefits.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "A new presidential administration, taking office in January 2025, prioritizes restricting SNAP benefits. The new Secretary of Agriculture directs the Food and Nutrition Service (FNS) to update its public guidance to reflect this policy shift. Before July 1, 2025, the 'What Can SNAP Buy?' webpage is edited to remove the specific phrase 'snack foods'.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Despite potential policy discussions from a new administration, the process of changing SNAP eligibility rules proves too complex and time-consuming to implement in under six months. Due to bureaucratic inertia, the need for a formal rulemaking process, and potential political opposition, the USDA's 'What Can SNAP Buy?' webpage remains unchanged by the resolution date.",
    "rationale": "The current status quo is that 'snack foods' are listed on the USDA's webpage, making 'Yes' the default outcome. The primary catalyst for a 'No' outcome would be a new presidential administration actively pursuing restrictions on SNAP purchases, as suggested by the background article. However, the timeframe between a new administration taking office (January 20, 2025) and the resolution date (July 1, 2025) is approximately 5.5 months. This is a very short period for implementing such a significant and controversial policy change within the federal government. Major changes to large programs like SNAP typically require a lengthy rulemaking process, including public comment periods, which often takes over a year. While updating a webpage is technically simple, doing so to reflect a major policy shift without the underlying regulations in place is not standard procedure and could attract legal challenges. Therefore, bureaucratic inertia and the procedural requirements for policy change are the strongest factors supporting a 'Yes' outcome. The probability is not higher than 85% because a new administration could make a swift, symbolic change to the website's text as a statement of intent, even if the formal regulatory changes are not yet complete. The resolution criteria depend solely on the text of the webpage, making such a symbolic change sufficient to trigger a 'No' resolution. The probability is not lower because the path of least resistance is inaction. The administrative complexity, potential for political backlash, and the sheer number of other priorities for a new administration make it highly likely that this specific webpage will not be updated by the deadline. I would lower my forecast if there were clear signals by March 2025, such as an executive order or explicit statements from the new USDA leadership, that this change is a top-level, fast-tracked priority. Conversely, I would raise my forecast if the new administration's initial focus is clearly on other matters.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill the USDA still list \"snack foods\" on its \"What Can SNAP Buy?\" page on July 1, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nNY Post: [Americans on food stamps could be banned from buying ‘bad food and sugary drinks,’ Trump USDA chief says](https://nypost.com/2025/02/14/us-news/americans-on-food-stamps-could-be-banned-from-buying-bad-food-and-sugary-drinks-trump-usda-chief-says/)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if \"snack foods\" is specifically listed on the United States Department of Agriculture's [What Can SNAP Buy?](https://www.fns.usda.gov/snap/eligible-food-items) webpage as something that is explicitly mentioned as something that can can be purchased by recipients of the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program. (Forecasters please note that it *is* explicitly mentioned as of May 5, 2025.) If it is *not* explicitly mentioned when checked by Metataculus on or after July 1, 2025, this resolves as **No**.\n\nIn order to streamline resolution, synonyms will not count; the phrase must specifically be \"snack foods.\" The question will resolve as soon as the page is accessed by Metaculus Admins on the resolution date. However, if there are issues accessing the page, then resolution will wait up to the end of the question resolutions period, at which point if Metaculus has still not been able to access the resolution source, this question will be **annulled**.\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nNo additional information available.\n\nToday is 2025-05-20.\n\nBefore answering you think:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n(e) You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
