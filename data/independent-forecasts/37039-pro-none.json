    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Approximately 5 weeks. The outcome will be known on June 1, 2025.",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No. The Harmonized Tariff Schedule does not currently list an additional 31% tariff for Switzerland under the specified subheading (9903.01.60). Such a tariff would be a new measure.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "The proposed tariff is not formally implemented by the June 1, 2025 deadline. This could occur if the proposal was a negotiating tactic that is retracted, if diplomatic or domestic lobbying efforts are successful in delaying or stopping it, or if the standard administrative and legal processes for implementation take longer than the time available.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "The presidential administration prioritizes the tariff and uses executive authority to expedite its implementation. A presidential proclamation is issued, directing relevant agencies to update the Harmonized Tariff Schedule, and the change is officially listed on the government website by June 1, 2025.",
    "rationale": "My forecast is based primarily on the specific, albeit fictional, context provided. The New York Times article implies a strong intent from a Trump administration to impose this tariff. Historically, this administration has shown a willingness to use executive authority to implement trade policies rapidly, often viewing procedural norms as secondary to political objectives. The status quo is 'No,' and typically, significant changes to the tariff schedule involve lengthy processes that would make a June 1 implementation unlikely. However, the strong signal from the provided background information suggests this is a high-priority action. The primary uncertainty is not the intent, but the speed of execution against bureaucratic and potential legal hurdles. My probability of 65% reflects a belief that the administration's political will is more likely than not to overcome these hurdles within the specified timeframe. My forecast is not higher because the timeline of roughly two months from announcement to implementation is very aggressive, and any procedural delay could easily push the effective date past June 1. It is not lower because dismissing the direct evidence of intent provided in the prompt would be a forecasting error; this specific information should be weighted more heavily than the general base rate of how quickly tariff policy changes. I would increase my forecast upon news of a signed presidential proclamation or a notice in the Federal Register. I would decrease it upon reports of successful high-level negotiations, legal challenges causing delays, or shifting administration priorities.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill the US government's harmonized tariff schedule list the tariff on Switzerland as 31% on June 1, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nNew York Times: [Swiss Indignant to Make the Top 10 of Trump’s Tariffs List](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/04/business/trump-tariffs-switzerland.html)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if the duty provided in the applicable subheading is + 31% for Switzerland at the American government's [harmonized tariff schedule](https://hts.usitc.gov/search?query=switzerland) when accessed by Metaculus on or after June 1, 2025.\n\nWhether the provision is listed as suspended will not affect resolution.\r\n\r\nPlease note that this question is asking whether the cell in the 'RATES OF DUTY' column '1, General' appearing alongside subheading 9903.01.60 on the Harmonized Tariff Schedule indicates an additional ad valorem duty rate of 31% for articles the product of Switzerland, regardless of any specificities noted in the 'Article Description' column.\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nNo additional information available.\n\nToday is 2025-04-24.\n\nBefore answering you think:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n(e) You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
