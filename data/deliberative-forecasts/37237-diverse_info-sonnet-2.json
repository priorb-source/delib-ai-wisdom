    "review": "Forecaster 2 raises a critical point I completely missed: March 2025 hit a record $342.7 billion due to front-running ahead of the tariffs. This means demand was pulled forward FROM April into March, making an April decline likely even before considering ongoing tariff effects. The threshold of $338.483 billion is only 1.2% below this panic-driven all-time record, which is an extremely high bar. Forecaster 3 makes valid points about trade diversion to Mexico (up 9.6% y/y, now top trading partner) and robust services imports that could partially offset goods weakness. However, I'm skeptical these fully compensate for the massive declines in real-time indicators. A 9.6% Mexico increase cannot offset a 30% China decline when China represents 36% of goods imports. The services component, while stable, is only 15-20% of total imports. Forecaster 3's 42% seems too optimistic given that achieving the threshold requires near-record performance in a month following historic front-running and facing major tariff headwinds. Both forecasters provide important context, but the fundamental challenge remains: multiple independent real-time indicators (64% order collapse, 35% LA port drop, 30% China decline, 40% Drewry overall decline) consistently show catastrophic drops, and the threshold requires essentially record-level imports.",
    "rationale": "I'm updating my forecast upward modestly to account for the front-running context and trade diversion effects I hadn't fully weighted. The March 2025 record of $342.7 billion explicitly due to panic buying ahead of tariffs is crucial context - it means April faced both a demand drain from March pull-forward AND the tariff impacts themselves. However, I remain more bearish than the other forecasters because: (1) The threshold requires performance within 1.2% of an all-time panic-driven record, which seems extremely unlikely post-surge and post-tariff; (2) Multiple independent real-time sources consistently show 30-40%+ declines with remarkable consistency across different methodologies; (3) While Mexico trade diversion helps (9.6% increase), the arithmetic doesn't work - it cannot offset 30% declines from China (36% of goods imports); (4) Services stability provides some buffer but only represents 15-20% of total imports; (5) The $16.5 billion in tariff revenue over 28 days suggests continued import activity but at dramatically reduced volumes with higher rates. I'm moving from 15% to 20% to acknowledge the valid points about trade complexity, but maintaining a low probability because the preponderance of evidence - both the impossibly high threshold and the consistently catastrophic real-time data - strongly indicates April 2025 imports will fall well short of the $338.483 billion needed.",
