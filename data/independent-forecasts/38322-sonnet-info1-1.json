  "information": "The final University of Michigan Consumer Sentiment index for May 2025 was 52.2, an improvement from the preliminary reading of 50.8, but a decline from 57.0 in March and 64.7 in February. The index has fallen nearly 30% since January 2025. Within the May report, the Current Economic Conditions Index decreased to 58.9 points from 59.8 in April, while the Economic Expectations Index increased to 47.9 points from 47.3. In a separate survey, the Conference Board's consumer confidence index rose to 98 in May from a revised 85.7 in the prior month. Other economic indicators showed soft growth signals, with the ISM services index at 49.9 and the manufacturing index at 48.5.",

    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Approximately 23 days until June 27, 2025, when the final report is expected to be published on the last Friday of June.",
    "status_quo_outcome": "Yes - the index stays below 54.0",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Consumer sentiment rebounds in June, with the index rising 1.8+ points from May's 52.2 to reach 54.0 or higher. This could occur if tariff concerns ease, positive economic data emerges, or if the Conference Board's improved consumer confidence reading signals broader sentiment improvement. The preliminary to final improvement seen in May (50.8 to 52.2) could represent the start of a recovery trend.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "The index remains below 54.0, either staying near the May level of 52.2 or declining further. Given the sharp downward trend (nearly 30% decline since January, dropping from 64.7 in February to 52.2 in May), the ongoing tariff concerns mentioned in the Axios article, and depressed economic expectations (47.9 in May), sentiment could continue to languish or worsen in June.",
    "rationale": "The May 2025 final reading of 52.2 is already 1.8 points below the 54.0 threshold, establishing a status quo that favors a Yes outcome. The index has shown a consistent downward trajectory through early 2025, with particularly weak economic expectations (47.9) suggesting ongoing pessimism. The Axios article highlighting tariff concerns indicates persistent structural issues affecting consumer sentiment. However, several factors create meaningful uncertainty: (1) The 52.2 reading is quite close to the 54.0 threshold, requiring only a modest 3.4% increase to cross it; (2) May showed improvement from the preliminary reading (50.8) to final (52.2), demonstrating some resilience; (3) The Conference Board's consumer confidence jumped significantly in May (from 85.7 to 98), suggesting mixed signals in consumer psychology; (4) Month-to-month volatility in sentiment indices can be substantial. My forecast is not higher because the recent trend is clearly downward, tariff concerns appear ongoing, and good forecasters weight toward continuity. It's not lower because the gap to 54.0 is small enough that normal monthly variation could easily push the index above the threshold, and the Conference Board data suggests consumer psychology isn't uniformly deteriorating. For me to update higher (toward No), I would need to see preliminary June data showing significant improvement, resolution of tariff policy uncertainty, or other positive economic catalysts. To update lower (toward Yes), I would need evidence of accelerating sentiment deterioration or new economic shocks.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill the June 2025 University of Michigan Consumer Sentiment Final Report number be less than 54.0?\n\nQuestion background:\nAxios: [Why the consumer sentiment plunge is different now](https://www.axios.com/2025/05/19/tariffs-consumer-economy-sentiment)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if the University of Michigan's reported June Final Results of the Index of Consumer Sentiment, expected to be posted [here](https://data.sca.isr.umich.edu/reports.php) on the final Friday of June 2025, is less than 54.0 for June 2025. Greater than or equal to that amount resolves the question as **No**.\n\n\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nThe final University of Michigan Consumer Sentiment index for May 2025 was 52.2, an improvement from the preliminary reading of 50.8, but a decline from 57.0 in March and 64.7 in February. The index has fallen nearly 30% since January 2025.

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
