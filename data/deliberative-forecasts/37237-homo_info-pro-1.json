    "review": "The other forecasters introduced a crucial set of new evidence that I had not considered: high-frequency, real-time data for April 2025. My initial forecast was based on the logical inference that the record March imports due to front-running tariffs would cause a 'hangover' or drop in April. Both other forecasters corroborated this, but Forecaster 2 in particular provided powerful, quantitative evidence on the scale of this drop. The data points about a 64% collapse in new import orders, a 35% fall in container arrivals at a major port, and industry estimates of a 30-40% overall decline in import activity are extremely compelling. Forecaster 3's points about 'blank sailings' and half-full vessels from Asia further strengthen this conclusion. This new data moves the forecast from an inference-based conclusion to one grounded in direct, albeit preliminary, evidence from the resolution month itself.",
    "rationale": "I am significantly updating my forecast downward based on the new evidence presented. My initial 20% probability was based on the principle that the March front-running would lead to a subsequent drop in April. The real-time data for April provided by the other forecasters confirms this hypothesis and suggests the magnitude of the drop is far more severe than one might have cautiously assumed. A 30-40% decline in import activity, as suggested by multiple trackers, is a massive economic shock that makes it almost impossible for the nominal value of imports to register a year-over-year increase. The arguments that could support a 'Yes' outcome, such as trade diversion to Mexico or underlying consumer demand, are plausible but are dwarfed by the sheer scale of the reported collapse in shipping volumes and new orders, particularly from Asia. The evidence presented by Forecaster 2 is especially convincing and has compelled me to reassess the probability of a 'No' outcome from 'likely' to 'nearly certain'. I am therefore reducing my forecast probability by 15 percentage points to align with this new, powerful evidence.",
