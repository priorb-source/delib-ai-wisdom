    "review": "Forecaster 2’s emphasis on Vienna’s long-run SPÖ dominance, organizational strength, and opposition fragmentation is well-grounded and aligns with my baseline reasoning. They appropriately avoid overconfidence and set sensible update triggers. Forecaster 3’s core point—that current polling shows a large SPÖ lead—is directionally persuasive, but their claim that this is “less than a week before the election” appears incorrect given the current date (April 2025) and the Vienna election schedule, which is months away. If the cited margins (SPÖ ~38–40 vs FPÖ ~21–24) are representative of recent Vienna polls (e.g., March), that materially strengthens the case for SPÖ plurality, but not to the 97% level given the time remaining and potential for national dynamics or shocks to shift preferences. Overall, I find F2’s reasoning solid and F3’s polling-based confidence partly justified by the margin, though overconfident about timing and residual risk.",
    "rationale": "Time left matters: with roughly half a year until the Vienna election, large leads can narrow. Still, Vienna is structurally favorable to SPÖ, and recent polling showing a double-digit SPÖ lead over FPÖ meaningfully increases the likelihood of a plurality of seats for SPÖ. Seat rank in Vienna closely tracks vote rank, so a clear vote lead typically translates to most seats. Countervailing risks include: national momentum for FPÖ, issue salience shifts (migration/security), or a local SPÖ scandal. But Vienna historically underperforms FPÖ relative to national trends, and opposition fragmentation (FPÖ/ÖVP/Greens/NEOS) raises the bar for any one party to overtake SPÖ. Given the combination of a sizeable current polling lead and entrenched local advantages—but allowing for months of potential movement—I’m updating upward from 68% to 82%. I would raise further if multiple pollsters continue to show SPÖ 10–12+ points ahead into late summer; I would cut notably if two or more reputable polls place FPÖ within ~5 points for several weeks or a major SPÖ Vienna scandal emerges.",
