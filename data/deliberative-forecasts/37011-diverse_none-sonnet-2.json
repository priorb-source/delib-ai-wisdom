    "review": "Both forecasters provide compelling structural arguments that align with and strengthen my analysis. Forecaster 2's specific data point - Conservatives currently hold 45 seats while Reform has 0 - makes the magnitude of the required swing starkly clear. Forecaster 3 raises a critical practical constraint I underweighted: Reform likely won't field a full slate of candidates, making it mathematically difficult or impossible to win most seats even in a favorable scenario. Both emphasize that Labour, not Reform, is better positioned to capitalize on Conservative decline due to superior local organization and vote efficiency in FPTP systems. The vote-splitting mechanism they both highlight is important - Reform's most likely effect is to help Labour win seats rather than winning themselves. Forecaster 3's emphasis on the extremely short timeframe (two weeks) is also well-taken - there's virtually no time for the kind of organizational build required. The lower 1% forecast from Forecaster 3 is defensible given these constraints, though I want to preserve slightly more tail risk for the 'unusual' campaign mentioned by the BBC.",
    "rationale": "Upon review, the candidate coverage argument is particularly persuasive and something I insufficiently weighted. Without fielding candidates in most divisions, Reform cannot mathematically win the most seats regardless of vote share where they do compete. Combined with the two-week timeframe, Labour's superior positioning as the Conservative alternative, and the lack of any Derbyshire-specific evidence of Reform strength, the probability should be lower than my initial 3%. However, I'm maintaining some distance from 1% because: (1) the 'unusual' campaign descriptor suggests something non-standard is occurring, (2) political volatility can occasionally produce outlier results, and (3) we lack definitive information about Reform's candidate slate. The structural arguments for a Labour breakthrough versus a Reform one are overwhelming, but I want to preserve a small tail risk. Moving from 3% to 2% reflects these considerations while acknowledging the strength of the arguments for an even lower probability.",
