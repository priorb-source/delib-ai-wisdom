  "information": "Colombia has declared a national health emergency due to a yellow fever outbreak. As of April 2025, there have been 79 reported cases and 36 deaths since 2024, with the departments of Tolima and Putumayo being the most affected. The government has implemented mobility restrictions in high-risk areas and vaccination requirements for travelers. In response to rising cases in South America, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has issued a level 2 travel notice for the continent, citing spread to newly affected areas in Bolivia, Colombia, and Peru.\n\nThe Pan American Health Organization (PAHO) issued an epidemiological alert in early April 2025 due to an increase in yellow fever cases in the Americas. In the first three months of 2025, 131 human cases and 53 deaths were confirmed in the region, primarily in Brazil, Colombia, and Peru. This case count is more than double the total for all of 2024. Separately, the United Nations has warned that global aid funding cuts are disrupting child vaccination programs at a level similar to the COVID-19 pandemic, contributing to a rise in yellow fever cases after years of decline.\n\nSeveral countries near the outbreak zones have implemented preventive measures. Panama has activated health protocols, although it has not reported a human case since 1974 and has vaccination coverage of over 95% in high-risk areas. Ecuador has also activated protocols and is conducting preventive vaccination campaigns. Costa Rica has made the yellow fever vaccine mandatory for travelers arriving from 43 countries, including many in South America, as of March 11, 2025, due to the presence of the Aedes aegypti mosquito vector in the country.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Approximately 5 weeks",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "The yellow fever outbreak in South America is contained or its northward spread is slowed by geographic barriers and preventative public health measures. Countries like Panama and Costa Rica effectively screen travelers and respond to any imported cases, preventing local transmission. Consequently, no North American country has a confirmed local outbreak sufficient to trigger a CDC travel advisory by the resolution date.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "The severe outbreak in Colombia leads to the virus spreading across the border into Panama or another Central American country via an infected traveler. Local transmission occurs due to the presence of the Aedes aegypti mosquito vector. The detection of this new local transmission in a country previously free of yellow fever prompts the CDC to swiftly issue a travel health notice for that country before June 1, 2025.",
    "rationale": "My forecast is based on the strong tendency of the status quo to persist, especially over a short time frame, while acknowledging a heightened risk from the regional outbreak. The current status is that no North American country has a CDC yellow fever advisory. With only five weeks until the resolution date, this is the most likely outcome to continue.\n\nThe primary factors supporting a 'No' outcome are the short timeline, existing public health responses, and geography. Establishing local transmission of a vector-borne disease in a new country and having it reach a level that triggers an international travel advisory within five weeks is a rapid escalation. Furthermore, countries bordering the outbreak zone, such as Panama, have activated health protocols and implemented vaccination requirements for travelers, which serve as crucial barriers to introduction and spread. The Darién Gap between Colombia and Panama also presents a significant natural obstacle to easy movement.\n\nHowever, the probability is not zero. The key factors supporting a potential 'Yes' outcome are the severity of the ongoing outbreak in South America and the presence of the competent mosquito vector throughout Central America and Mexico. The PAHO alert highlights that the 2025 case count has more than doubled the total for all of 2024, indicating high 'viral pressure' on neighboring regions. If an infected individual travels to a receptive area, local transmission is possible. The CDC has already demonstrated its vigilance by issuing a notice for the continent of South America, suggesting they may act quickly if local transmission is confirmed in a new country.\n\nMy forecast is not lower than 8% because the severity of the South American outbreak creates a tangible risk of exportation that cannot be dismissed. The UN warning about disruptions to vaccination programs suggests there may be pockets of vulnerability. My forecast is not higher than 8% because the combination of the very short time frame, active public health interventions in border countries, and geographic barriers makes a successful introduction and establishment of the virus leading to a CDC notice an unlikely event. I would increase my forecast upon confirmed reports of local transmission in Panama or Costa Rica. I would decrease it if reports indicate the South American outbreak is being successfully controlled.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill any North American country be listed as having a CDC yellow fever travel advisory on June 1, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\n[PAHO issues new epidemiological alert amid rising yellow fever cases in the Americas](https://www.paho.org/en/news/31-3-2025-paho-issues-new-epidemiological-alert-amid-rising-yellow-fever-cases-americas)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below.

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any).
