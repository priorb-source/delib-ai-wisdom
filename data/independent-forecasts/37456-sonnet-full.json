  "information": "On March 28, 2025, Cargill Kitchen Solutions recalled approximately 212,268 pounds of liquid egg products, including items under the Egg Beaters and Bob Evans brands. The recall was due to potential contamination with sodium hypochlorite, a cleaning solution. The affected products were produced on March 12 and 13, 2025, have 'use by' dates in August 2025 and March 2026, and bear the establishment number 'G1804' on the carton. The products were shipped to distributors in Ohio and Texas and for foodservice use in at least six other states, with potential for nationwide distribution.\n\nThe U.S. Department of Agriculture’s Food Safety and Inspection Service (FSIS) has designated this a Class III recall. This classification is used when the use of or exposure to a violative product is not likely to cause adverse health consequences. No adverse health effects or illnesses have been reported in connection with the consumption of these products. Cargill stated the recall was issued 'out of an abundance of caution.'\n\nHistorical data on FSIS recalls shows that resolution times vary based on classification and complexity. Class I (high-risk) recalls typically close in 2-4 months. Class III recalls often close within 1-3 months, with a median time of approximately 90 days. However, recalls that span multiple states, involve large product volumes, or are distributed through institutional foodservice channels frequently take longer to resolve. The extended shelf life of some of the recalled products, until March 2026, is another factor that can complicate and lengthen the verification process.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "55 days until July 1, 2025 resolution date. The recall was issued March 28, 2025, meaning 95 total days from recall to resolution date.",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No - the recall remains Active as of today (May 7, 2025), which is the current state 40 days after issuance",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "The recall verification process extends beyond July 1, 2025 due to complications in retrieving products from multi-state foodservice distribution, challenges tracking products with extended shelf life (some until March 2026), or routine bureaucratic delays in completing all required verification activities",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "FSIS completes all verification activities within the next 55 days, confirming successful product retrieval and disposal. The Class III classification (low risk), absence of reported illnesses, and cooperation from major brand distributors (Egg Beaters, Bob Evans) enable faster-than-average closure around the 90-day median timeframe",
    "rationale": "This recall has been active for 40 days as of May 7, 2025. The question resolves on July 1, which provides 95 total days from recall issuance. Historical data indicates Class III recalls have a median closure time of approximately 90 days, which would place closure just before the July 1 deadline. However, several complicating factors create uncertainty. The recall involves multi-state distribution (Ohio, Texas, plus at least 6 other states), foodservice channels that are harder to track than retail, and a substantial volume of 212,268 pounds. Most significantly, some products have shelf life extending to March 2026, which can complicate verification processes as FSIS typically wants to ensure products are removed from commerce. Factors supporting faster closure include the Class III classification (lowest risk category), zero reported illnesses, the 'out of abundance of caution' nature of the recall, and the involvement of major brands with established distribution tracking systems. The timing is extremely tight - we need closure within 55 days when the median is 90 days total, and this recall has multiple characteristics associated with longer resolution times. Given the status quo is that the recall remains Active, and recalls with multi-state foodservice distribution and extended shelf life often exceed median closure times, I estimate roughly 40% probability of closure before July 1. This forecast would increase if evidence emerges of rapid product retrieval progress or if FSIS signals the recall is approaching closure. It would decrease if we pass day 70-80 without closure indicators, or if complications in product tracking emerge.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill the USDA-posted recall by Cargill Kitchen Solutions of its liquid egg product for an unapproved substance issued March 28, 2025 be closed before July 1, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nABC News: [Liquid eggs recalled due to potential cleaning solution contamination](https://abcnews.go.com/GMA/Food/liquid-eggs-recalled-due-potential-cleaning-solution-contamination/story?id=120329600)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if the status of the recall posted by the U.S. Department of Agriculture’s Food Safety and Inspection Service (FSIS) is changed from Active to Closed on [this page](https://www.fsis.usda.gov/recalls-alerts/cargill-kitchen-solutions-recalls-liquid-egg-products-due-unapproved-substance) before July 1, 2025.

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
