  "information": "Libya's Economy and Trade Minister, Muhammed Huveyc, announced in May 2025 that the country aims to increase its trade volume with Turkey from $3.7 billion to $10 billion. To facilitate this, joint committees have been established to address issues such as the return of Turkish companies to projects in Libya and the resolution of bank guarantees. The two countries are also working towards eliminating taxes and establishing a free trade zone, with the stated goal of using Libya's strategic location to facilitate the transport of Turkish industrial products to the broader African market.\n\nAs of late April 2025, the African Continental Free Trade Area (AfCFTA) has achieved a 92% consensus on trade rules. Forty-nine of the 54 African countries have joined the agreement, with 23 having commenced implementation of the new trade rules. Supporting infrastructure includes the Pan-African Payment and Settlement System (PAPSS), which now connects over 20 central banks and 160 commercial banks, enabling easier payment for goods in local currencies. Additionally, Afreximbank is organizing specialized training programs to help African businesses understand the AfCFTA's commercial implications and regulatory landscape.\n\nImplementation of the AfCFTA faces several challenges. Six years after its inception, key decisions regarding tariff liberalization and rules of origin remain pending for a number of state parties. Some countries, including South Africa, have not yet submitted full tariff offers for sensitive goods, pending the finalization of rules of origin for key sectors such as automotive and textiles. The deadline for finalizing these rules is October 2025. The overall target for the removal of tariffs on 90% of goods has been moved back to 2034. Some analysts note that production-related challenges, like low industrial output and poor infrastructure, must be addressed before the full benefits of tariff removal can be realized.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Two months. The question resolves on July 1, 2025.",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No. Libya has not ratified the AfCFTA agreement, and the default outcome is that this status remains unchanged without a specific legislative and political action to ratify it.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "The Libyan government, preoccupied with its internal political complexities and focused on finalizing a bilateral free trade agreement with Turkey, does not prioritize the AfCFTA ratification. The two-month timeframe is insufficient to navigate the domestic political and legislative processes required for ratification, and the process is not completed by the July 1, 2025 deadline.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "A powerful faction within the Libyan government decides that ratifying AfCFTA is a key strategic priority to signal the country's reintegration into the African community and to diversify its trade partners. They successfully fast-track the ratification process, overcoming domestic political hurdles and completing all necessary steps before July 1, 2025.",
    "rationale": "My forecast is based on three main factors: the short timeframe, Libya's stated priorities, and the broader context of the AfCFTA's implementation. Firstly, with a deadline of July 1, 2025, there are only two months remaining. This is an extremely short window for any country to complete the full domestic legislative and bureaucratic process of ratifying a major international treaty. The status quo is non-ratification, and overcoming this inertia on such a timescale is difficult. Secondly, the provided intelligence from May 2025 indicates that Libya's immediate trade policy focus is on a bilateral relationship with Turkey, with the goal of increasing trade volume to $10 billion and creating a dedicated free trade zone. This suggests that political capital and administrative resources are currently directed toward this specific goal, not the multilateral AfCFTA. Thirdly, the AfCFTA itself is still finalizing key rules of origin, with a deadline of October 2025. This reduces the urgency for remaining countries to ratify immediately, as some core operational details of the agreement are not yet fully settled. The probability is not lower than 5% because the political situation in Libya can be volatile, and a sudden executive decision or a swift political alignment could theoretically push ratification through unexpectedly. The probability is not higher because all current evidence points to a lack of urgency and a focus on other trade priorities, making ratification within the next two months highly improbable. I would increase my forecast if there were official statements from the Libyan government indicating that a ratification bill was being tabled or fast-tracked. Conversely, I would lower it if Libya formally signed the free trade agreement with Turkey, further cementing that as its primary focus.",
