  "information": "A Russian delegation is scheduled to visit Istanbul on June 2, 2025, for a second round of peace talks with Ukraine. Kremlin Spokesman Dmitriy Peskov stated that a high-level summit involving President Trump would depend on the achievement of results from these direct talks between the two delegations. Russia proposed the June 2 date, following a previous meeting on May 16. The United States will not send an official delegation, but White House press secretary Caroline Levitt said, 'We will let you know if the President has plans to send a representative.'\n\nIn February 2025, there was media speculation, particularly from French sources, about a potential visit by Donald Trump to Moscow for the Victory Day celebrations on May 9, 2025. Former Russian Prime Minister Sergey Stepanov commented at the time that such a visit would be a 'big sensation.' On February 12, 2025, Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin held a 1.5-hour phone call during which they agreed to a personal meeting and extended mutual invitations to Washington and Moscow. The speculated May 9 visit did not occur.\n\nIn late May 2025, following a major Russian drone and missile attack in Ukraine, President Donald Trump referred to President Vladimir Putin as 'absolutely crazy.' In a separate statement, Trump also expressed his disappointment with Putin's continued attacks, saying, 'I am very disappointed, very, very disappointed.' Trump indicated he would observe Russia's intentions over a two-week period to determine if they were genuine about achieving peace.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "About 32 days (until July 1, 2025)",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "June 2 Istanbul talks stall or yield only modest progress; the White House opts for calls or a meeting in a neutral location later; domestic/ally optics and security concerns make a Moscow trip unattractive; no travel announcement is made in June, so Trump does not go to Russia before July 1.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Direct talks produce a tangible breakthrough (e.g., ceasefire framework) in early-to-mid June; both sides want a dramatic photo-op; Trump accepts Putin’s invitation and flies to Moscow in late June to formalize or advance the deal, resulting in a brief, highly choreographed visit within the window.",
    "rationale": "Time is short, and there is no current announcement of a Russia trip. The baseline in international diplomacy—especially amid an ongoing war—is to meet on neutral territory rather than in Moscow. The White House has already said it will not send a delegation to the June 2 Istanbul round, and Trump recently called Putin “absolutely crazy,” signaling caution and political risk. He also said he’d watch Russia’s intentions for about two weeks, which pushes any potential in-person engagement into mid-to-late June, leaving little runway for planning a high-security Moscow visit. Historically, US presidential trips to Russia are rare, planned, and politically sensitive; the domestic and allied optics of a Moscow visit during active hostilities are challenging. The RA report notes: (1) a possible high-level summit is contingent on concrete results from direct Russia–Ukraine talks; (2) the rumored May 9 visit did not occur despite mutual invitations; (3) Trump’s tone hardened after late-May Russian strikes, further lowering near-term odds. Why not higher: lack of announced plans, strong incentives to pick a neutral venue, and escalating conflict dynamics. Why not lower: Trump’s penchant for dramatic, rapid moves; explicit mutual invitations; a peace breakthrough could create a narrow window for a headline-grabbing Moscow visit. Updaters: I would raise the probability if (a) June talks yield a credible, public breakthrough (ceasefire/roadmap) and both sides signal a summit in Moscow, or (b) the White House/ Kremlin issue concrete travel planning signals (advance teams, NOTAMs, or official schedule). I would lower it if (a) talks falter or fighting intensifies, (b) announcements point to a neutral-location meeting, or (c) domestic/ally pushback hardens against any Moscow visit in June.",
