  "information": "Donald Trump has a history of attending UFC events in the United States, typically appearing at 2 to 4 cards per year since 2019. All of his previous appearances have been at domestic events. He has a strong personal relationship with UFC President Dana White. Trump recently attended a UFC event in Miami in April 2025. Historically, he has not attended two consecutive numbered UFC cards within a one-month span; UFC 315 is scheduled to take place four weeks after the Miami event.\n\nUFC 315 is scheduled for May 10, 2025, at the Bell Centre in Montreal, Quebec, Canada. The event's fight card includes two title fights, with a welterweight championship bout between Belal Muhammad and Jack Della Maddalena as one of the main events. No sitting or former U.S. president has previously attended a UFC event held in Canada or any other foreign country.\n\nJoe Rogan, a prominent UFC commentator, has publicly announced he will not be attending UFC 315 in Montreal. He cited his discontent with the Canadian government as the reason, stating he 'doesn't go to Canada anymore' and would 'rather go to Russia.' Rogan also mentioned that he had discussed US-Canada relations with Donald Trump, who had joked about Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "About 12 days (until May 10, 2025)",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No — he does not travel to Montreal for UFC 315.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Trump remains in the U.S. and spends May 10 on other political or personal engagements; no official or campaign trip to Canada is scheduled, so he does not appear at the Bell Centre.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Trump pairs a brief Montreal stop with other meetings or events in Canada (or a near-border U.S. swing) and makes a short, highly publicized cageside appearance to support Dana White and the UFC.",
    "rationale": "Baseline and trends: Trump attends 2–4 UFC cards per year, all historically in the U.S. Attending any given U.S. numbered card might be on the order of tens of percent, but international attendance has been effectively zero to date. UFC 315 is in Montreal, which introduces added logistics, security planning, and political calculus for a sitting president. No sitting or former U.S. president has attended a UFC event abroad. These factors make the status quo “No” more likely.\n\nRecent behavior: He attended a Miami UFC event in April 2025. The assistant notes he hasn’t historically attended two consecutive numbered cards within a month. UFC 315 is four weeks later, so recency lowers odds further. While his relationship with Dana White is a positive signal, it likely isn’t enough to overcome the international trip hurdle absent another compelling reason to be in Canada.\n\nEvent draw: UFC 315 has strong sporting merit (two title fights) but lacks an obvious mega-star magnet (e.g., McGregor) that consistently correlates with Trump’s attendance spikes. Joe Rogan’s announced absence from Montreal slightly weakens the “orbit” effect for a Trump appearance, though it’s a weak signal.\n\nNet: Weighing the status quo heavily, a Canadian venue, added security/optics of a foreign trip, and the recent April appearance, the probability he attends UFC 315 is low but non-zero given his affinity for UFC and Dana White.\n\nWhy not higher: International venue, lack of precedent, security/optics costs, and the short interval since his last appearance.\nWhy not lower: Strong personal ties to Dana White; Trump’s pattern of leveraging high-visibility sports events; Montreal is relatively close to the U.S. Northeast.\n\nWhat would move the forecast up: Credible reporting of a planned Canada visit around May 10; local security preparations at the Bell Centre indicating VIP/presidential attendance; on-record hints from Dana White/UFC PR; late card changes adding a mega-star.\nWhat would move it down: Public schedule conflicts; reports he’ll be elsewhere on May 10; indications of diplomatic friction or security constraints specific to Montreal/Quebec that weekend.",
