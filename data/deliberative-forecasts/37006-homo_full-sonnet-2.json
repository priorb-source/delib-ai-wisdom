    "review": "Both forecasters make compelling arguments and arrive at 82% forecasts. I find Forecaster 3's point particularly strong: even at the extreme ends of current projection ranges (19 Bloc seats vs 12 Conservative seats), the Bloc still wins by 7 seats. This is a more robust signal than I initially weighted. Both forecasters also emphasize structural factors I mentioned but perhaps underweighted - the Conservative geographic concentration creating a ceiling effect, and the Liberal surge primarily affecting Bloc support without changing the Bloc-Conservative competitive dynamic. \n\nHowever, I notice we all cite identical data and reach similar conclusions with only a 4-percentage-point spread (78-82%). This suggests we're converging on the right probability range. The key question is whether the 6-month time horizon and ongoing political volatility warrant 78% versus 82%. Both forecasters acknowledge these uncertainties but weight the structural advantages more heavily.",
    "rationale": "Upon reflection, I should update upward slightly but not fully to 82%. The \"worst-case projection still favors Bloc\" argument from Forecaster 3 is particularly persuasive - it suggests the margin is robust even accounting for projection uncertainty. The Conservative ceiling appears structurally limited by their geographic concentration around Quebec City, with stable ~23% support translating to 10-12 projected seats. Meanwhile, even a weakened Bloc at 23-27% support projects to 19-25 seats due to better geographic distribution.\n\nHowever, I maintain some additional caution because: (1) we're 6 months from the election with an unprecedented Liberal surge still unfolding, (2) the Bloc's 10-14 point decline demonstrates vulnerability to further erosion, and (3) polling-to-seat conversion models contain uncertainty that could compress the gap. The historical pattern is strong, but political environments do shift.\n\nBalancing these factors, I'll update to 80% - acknowledging the robust nature of current projections while preserving modest additional uncertainty for the time horizon and volatility factors.",
