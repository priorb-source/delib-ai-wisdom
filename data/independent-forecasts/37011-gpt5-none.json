    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "About 2 weeks (results expected around 2 May 2025)",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No — a mainstream party (likely Labour, possibly Conservatives) wins the most seats, not Reform UK.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Reform UK fields an incomplete slate and/or runs a diffuse ~10–20% vote across many divisions, translating into few or no wins under single-member FPTP. Labour benefits from national momentum and anti-Conservative swing in Derbyshire, taking a plurality of seats; Conservatives hold pockets; Lib Dems/Greens pick up a few. Result: Reform wins very few seats and is far from the largest party.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "An unprecedented local surge: Reform fields a near-full slate with strong local candidates, multiple high-profile local Conservatives defect to Reform, the Conservative vote collapses unevenly, and Labour’s vote is insufficiently concentrated in key divisions. Reform narrowly tops many three-way races and ends election night with the largest seat tally. This would likely require a dramatic, late-campaign local realignment unlike anything seen in recent UK county elections.",
    "rationale": "- Base rates: Reform UK has not led or controlled any county council and has minimal local-government seat wins historically. County divisions are single-member FPTP, which penalizes diffuse support and rewards entrenched parties with local networks.\n- Local context: Derbyshire County Council is currently controlled by the Conservatives. After the 2024 general election, Labour is generally ascendant in Derbyshire constituencies. If the Conservatives decline, the more plausible beneficiary in seat terms is Labour, not Reform, given Labour’s organization and vote efficiency in local elections.\n- Candidate coverage: Reform often struggles to field a full slate and robust ground campaigns in shire counties. Without near-full coverage, it is mathematically implausible to win “the most seats.”\n- Polling/translation: Even if Reform polls in the mid-teens locally, their vote is likely spread thin, yielding few first-place finishes. The party’s vote more often splits the right, aiding Labour.\n- Status quo weighting: The world changes slowly; given institutional and logistical hurdles, a sudden leap to being the largest party on a county council is extraordinarily unlikely within two weeks.\n- Why not higher: To be the largest party, Reform would need dozens of wins in Derbyshire—well beyond any demonstrated local performance to date, plus full candidate coverage and strong localized swings. No public evidence suggests this is underway.\n- Why not lower (not zero): Local idiosyncrasies, potential late defections, and unusually poor Conservative ground game could, in theory, create a cluster of narrow Reform wins. The BBC’s note of an “unusual” campaign adds a sliver of tail risk, though with no specifics indicating a Reform surge.\n- What would move me up: Verified reports of a near-full Reform slate with strong local names; multiple incumbent councillors defecting to Reform; reputable ward-level polling showing Reform leading in a significant share of divisions; coordinated anti-Conservative tactical voting favoring Reform rather than Labour.\n- What would move me down: Evidence Reform is fielding a partial slate or thin campaigns; local polling/coverage indicating Labour leads widely; Conservative vote holding up in rural divisions; minimal Reform presence on the ground.\n- Research assistant note: No additional information provided; forecast based on general electoral dynamics, recent national context, and known structural constraints in county elections.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill Reform UK win the most seats in the 2025 Derbyshire County Council election?\n\nQuestion background:\nBBC: ['Unusual' election campaign under way in Derbyshire](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cg41lzylq64o)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below.

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
