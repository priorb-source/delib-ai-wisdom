  "information": "Libya's Economy and Trade Minister, Muhammed Huveyc, announced in May 2025 that the country aims to increase its trade volume with Turkey from $3.7 billion to $10 billion. To facilitate this, joint committees have been established to address issues such as the return of Turkish companies to projects in Libya and the resolution of bank guarantees. The two countries are also working towards eliminating taxes and establishing a free trade zone, with the stated goal of using Libya's strategic location to facilitate the transport of Turkish industrial products to the broader African market.\n\nAs of late April 2025, the African Continental Free Trade Area (AfCFTA) has achieved a 92% consensus on trade rules. Forty-nine of the 54 African countries have joined the agreement, with 23 having commenced implementation of the new trade rules. Supporting infrastructure includes the Pan-African Payment and Settlement System (PAPSS), which now connects over 20 central banks and 160 commercial banks, enabling easier payment for goods in local currencies. Additionally, Afreximbank is organizing specialized training programs to help African businesses understand the AfCFTA's commercial implications and regulatory landscape.\n\nImplementation of the AfCFTA faces several challenges. Six years after its inception, key decisions regarding tariff liberalization and rules of origin remain pending for a number of state parties. Some countries, including South Africa, have not yet submitted full tariff offers for sensitive goods, pending the finalization of rules of origin for key sectors such as automotive and textiles. The deadline for finalizing these rules is October 2025. The overall target for the removal of tariffs on 90% of goods has been moved back to 2034. Some analysts note that production-related challenges, like low industrial output and poor infrastructure, must be addressed before the full benefits of tariff removal can be realized.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "2 months",
    "status_quo_outcome": "Libya has not ratified the AfCFTA. Given the very short timeframe, the status quo is for the July 1, 2025 deadline to pass without ratification.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "The Libyan government continues to prioritize its bilateral trade relationship and free trade zone with Turkey, dedicating its administrative and political resources to that effort. The legislative process for AfCFTA ratification is not prioritized or initiated, and the two-month window closes before any action is taken.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "In a surprise strategic shift, a powerful faction within the Libyan government fast-tracks the AfCFTA ratification process, framing it as a necessary step to complement the Turkey deal and enhance Libya's role as a pan-African trade hub. The legislature is convened for an emergency session in June and quickly approves the agreement, allowing for the instrument of ratification to be deposited just before the deadline.",
    "rationale": "My forecast is very low due to the extremely short timeframe of two months. The ratification of a major international treaty like AfCFTA is a complex legal and political process that typically takes much longer. \n\nThe information provided indicates that Libya's current trade policy focus is on a bilateral agreement with Turkey. The Economy Minister's announcement in May 2025 about increasing trade volume with Turkey to $10 billion and establishing a free trade zone shows where political and administrative attention is directed. This competing priority makes a sudden pivot to ratify AfCFTA highly unlikely.\n\nFurthermore, the broader context of AfCFTA implementation shows a slow pace, with key rules of origin not due until October 2025 and full tariff liberalization delayed until 2034. This reduces external pressure on Libya to ratify urgently. \n\nMy forecast is not lower than 5% because political dynamics can change unexpectedly. A sudden political consensus or a desire to make a symbolic gesture of pan-African unity could, in theory, expedite the process, though this is a remote possibility. \n\nMy forecast is not higher because there is no evidence whatsoever of any ongoing domestic process or political will in Libya to ratify the agreement before the deadline. The status quo is strongly in favor of non-ratification within this period.\n\nI would increase my forecast if there were official announcements from the Libyan government about initiating the legislative process for ratification. I would decrease it if Libya signs the formal free trade agreement with Turkey, further solidifying its alternative trade focus.",

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any).
