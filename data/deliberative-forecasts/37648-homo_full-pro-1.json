    "review": "The other forecasters and I are in broad agreement on the central tension of this question: the significant, positive momentum in high-level back-channel negotiations versus the seemingly irreconcilable public 'red lines' of both the United States and Iran. We all correctly identified the recent cadence of talks, the constructive language used by negotiators, and the Israeli media report as the strongest evidence in favor of a deal. Forecaster 3 provided a particularly useful insight by emphasizing the broadness of the resolution criteria, which would be satisfied by even a limited, interim agreement. This strengthens the case for a 'Yes' outcome, as a 'less-for-less' deal is a far more plausible outcome by the deadline than a comprehensive treaty that satisfies all of America's 14 publicly stated conditions. While Forecaster 3 assigned a more cautious probability of 55%, their reasoning paradoxically strengthens my conviction in a higher probability.",
    "rationale": "I am maintaining my forecast of 65%. The deliberation process has reinforced my initial analysis rather than revealed a flaw in it. The other forecasters did not present new evidence but confirmed that we are all weighing the same key factors. Specifically, Forecaster 3's emphasis on how a limited, interim deal would satisfy the resolution criteria strengthens the case for a 'Yes' outcome. Such a deal provides a politically viable off-ramp for both sides, allowing them to de-escalate, claim a victory, and bypass the current public impasse over their maximalist 'red lines.' This makes a positive resolution more likely than a complete breakdown of talks. My 65% forecast continues to be driven primarily by the high tempo of negotiations and the powerful external signal from the Israeli intelligence community, which suggests that substantive progress toward an agreement is being made behind the scenes. This forecast acknowledges the significant risk of failure but weights the compelling evidence of positive momentum more heavily, especially given the plausibility of an interim deal.",
