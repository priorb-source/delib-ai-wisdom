    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Approximately 6 months (Vienna votes in autumn 2025, likely October); result known on election night.",
    "status_quo_outcome": "Yes — SPÖ wins the most seats.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "A sustained late-campaign surge lifts the FPÖ to first place in votes (helped by national tailwinds, salience of migration/security, or a SPÖ Vienna leadership stumble), and the proportional seat translation gives FPÖ the most seats.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "SPÖ maintains its traditional Vienna lead, benefits from incumbency and a fragmented field (FPÖ, ÖVP, Greens, NEOS, and possibly KPÖ+ all splitting opposition votes), and converts a vote plurality into a seat plurality.",
    "rationale": "- Baseline: Vienna is historically SPÖ territory; they won comfortably in 2020 and have led most city-specific polls since. The linked PolitPro/IFDD March 24, 2025 poll places SPÖ ahead, consistent with the broader pattern that SPÖ typically tops Vienna polling.\n- Structure: Vienna’s proportional system usually aligns seats with vote rank; the party leading in votes almost always leads in seats. SPÖ benefits from incumbency, a well-known mayoral brand, and strong district-level networks.\n- Competitive landscape: Nationally, FPÖ has momentum, but its ceiling in Vienna is lower than in many other states. ÖVP has weakened compared to its 2020 surge, while Greens/NEOS are stable. The main risk to SPÖ is a consolidated right-populist surge plus left fragmentation (e.g., KPÖ+ crossing 5%), which could narrow the gap.\n- Why not higher: Several plausible ways for SPÖ to lose first place exist—an FPÖ urban upswing, a salient public-safety or migration shock, or adverse headlines involving the SPÖ Vienna leadership. If KPÖ+ gains mainly at SPÖ’s expense, that could tighten the race further.\n- Why not lower: The status quo favors SPÖ; they start from a lead in most polls, have a durable urban base, and Vienna’s electorate skews center-left. Even with national headwinds, overtaking SPÖ in Vienna requires a sizable shift.\n- What would move me up: Multiple independent Vienna polls consistently showing a double-digit SPÖ lead; confirmation of a popular SPÖ top candidate and a disciplined campaign; signs the FPÖ is stalling in Vienna.\n- What would move me down: Poll averages showing FPÖ tied or ahead; a major SPÖ Vienna scandal or unpopular candidate change; KPÖ+ clearly above threshold drawing disproportionately from SPÖ; issue salience breaking toward FPÖ late.\n- Research assistant: No additional information provided; forecast relies on the public polling reference and structural/historical context.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill the Social Democratic Party of Austria win the most seats in the 2025 Viennese state election?\n\nQuestion background:\nSee for example election polls at [Vienna: Poll by IFDD from 24.03.2025](https://politpro.eu/en/austria/polls/63413/ifdd/2025-03-24)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if the Social Democratic Party of Austria wins a plurality of seats in the [2025 Viennese state election](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2025_Viennese_state_election).\n\n\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nNo additional information available.\n\nToday is 2025-04-21.\n\nBefore answering you think:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n(e) You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
