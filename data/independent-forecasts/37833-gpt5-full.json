  "information": "The relationship between Elon Musk and Donald Trump has recently shown signs of strain. After investing heavily in Trump's 2024 campaign, Musk was appointed co-director of the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE). However, disagreements arose over Musk's proposals for drastic government spending cuts and his support for policies like H-1B visas, which conflicted with Trump's agenda. In May 2025, Musk announced he would reduce his political involvement and spending to focus on his businesses, leading to a mutually agreed-upon withdrawal from his role in DOGE. Correspondingly, analyses show that Trump has not mentioned Musk on his Truth Social account in over a month, a significant decrease from his previous frequency.\n\nThe Trump administration's current immigration policy focus is on a new 'Gold Card' visa plan designed to attract foreign investors with at least $5 million in funds. The plan, which is not yet passed by Congress, would grant permanent residence and work rights. Elon Musk confirmed on the social media platform X that the government is conducting a 'silent test' of the application website. The proposal has sparked debate on whether it will replace or supplement the existing EB-5 investment visa program. Separately, the administration opened the registration period for the H-1B visa program, which both Trump and Musk have supported, for the 2026 fiscal year in March 2025.\n\nRecent activity shows a shift in the priorities and communication styles of both Elon Musk and Donald Trump. An analysis of Musk's posts on X revealed that his content has shifted away from U.S. government and politics, with only 19% of his posts in May being on these topics compared to 51% in February. He is now posting more about his business ventures, including space travel, electric vehicles, and AI. Meanwhile, Donald Trump primarily uses Truth Social for his communications, with reports noting that posts from his account on X are rare.",

    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "≈40 days (until Metaculus checks on/after 2025-07-01)",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Trump continues posting almost exclusively on Truth Social and not X; Musk keeps his posting focus on business/tech with limited politics. Immigration may be discussed in general terms (e.g., “visa lottery”) but neither uses the exact phrase “diversity visa” on X before July 1, 2025.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "A fresh immigration push or media cycle leads Trump to attack the Diversity Visa program by name while touting a merit-based or “Gold Card” reform, and he posts this on X; or Musk replies/quote-posts a viral DV-related tweet (possibly the one from an account he follows) and uses the exact phrase “diversity visa.”",
    "rationale": "Note: The question prompt says “before April 1, 2025,” but the stated resolution criteria use July 1, 2025. I’m forecasting to the July 1 criterion.\n\nBaseline: The world changes slowly and the behavior of both principals matters. Trump’s use of X is rare; he primarily posts on Truth Social. Musk’s May posting mix reportedly shifted away from government/politics (from ~51% in February to ~19% in May), focusing more on SpaceX/Tesla/AI. Both factors push toward a No by default. The criterion is also strict: the exact phrase “diversity visa” must appear on X.\n\nSignals for Yes: There are plausible catalysts in the remaining ~40 days. May is when DV results typically become a talking point, occasionally spawning stories about winners or backlogs. The administration is reportedly pushing a “Gold Card” visa; that could prompt contrasts with the Diversity Visa program. Trump previously used the phrase “Diversity Visa (Lottery)” in 2017–2018, so the phrase is in his lexicon. Musk sometimes engages impulsively with trending topics and follows at least one account posting about DV; a quote-post or reply using the exact phrase is not impossible.\n\nSignals for No: Trump’s limited X activity is the strongest headwind; even if he criticizes the program, it may happen on Truth Social (which would not count). Musk’s lower politics share reduces the posting ‘surface area’ for this niche phrase, and he more often uses broader immigration framing (border security, H‑1B, merit-based) than the specific “diversity visa” term. The exact-phrase requirement makes near-misses (e.g., “visa lottery,” “DV lottery”) resolve to No.\n\nWhy not higher: Narrow window (~40 days), exact-phrase filter, Trump’s platform preference, and Musk’s reduced political posting lower the base rate. Why not lower: Immigration is a persistent theme; DV results and any legal-immigration reform push could spark explicit comparisons where “diversity visa” is named. The involvement of an account Musk follows slightly raises the tail risk of a qualifying reply.\n\nWhat would move me up: Evidence Trump plans to post on X again; White House or Congressional activity directly targeting the Diversity Visa program; a major news cycle on DV (court ruling, policy proposal, scandal); Musk engaging in back-and-forths about legal immigration terminology. What would move me down: Continued Trump silence on X; Musk publicly eschewing political content; no DV-related news cycle through mid‑June; signs that the administration’s legal-immigration messaging avoids mentioning DV by name.\n\nNet: With limited time remaining, platform behavior patterns, and the exact-phrase constraint, I weight the status quo heavily toward No, with a modest tail for a Yes via a specific immigration push or a Musk engagement spike.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill Donald Trump or Elon Musk tweet (X post) about the Diversity Visa before April 1, 2025\n\nQuestion background:\n[Federal judge’s order leaves many visa lottery winners out of luck](https://www.siliconvalley.com/2020/10/01/judges-order-leaves-many-visa-lottery-winners-out-of-luck/) | Recent tweet [here](https://x.com/fentasyl/status/1894451029934039492) from a Twitter/X account followed by Elon Musk.\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if, before July 1, 2025 either Donald Trump or Elon Musk tweet using the exact words \"diversity visa\" as shown through [this search](https://x.com/search?f=top&q=%22diversity%20visa%22%20(from%3Arealdonaldtrump%20OR%20from%3Aelonmusk)&src=typed_query) on Twitter/X, which will be checked by Metaculus on or after July 1, 2025. If a tweet (now renamed to X post) containing the phrase is seen by a Metaculus Admin at that time, this question resolves as **Yes**. If not, it resolves as **No**.\n\n\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nThe relationship between Elon Musk and Donald Trump has recently shown signs of strain.

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
