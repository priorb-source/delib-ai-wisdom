    "rationale": "- Base rates and inertia: Major geographic names on established reference sites rarely change, especially to nonstandard alternatives, within short windows. “Gulf of Mexico” is the globally standard term; “Gulf of America” is an uncommon alternative. The default expectation is no change over the next ~8 weeks. \n- Site-specific considerations: While WorldAtlas has an article titled “Gulf Of Mexico (Gulf of America),” the resolution hinges on the separate North America page map label. Cross-page consistency updates do happen, but are infrequent and usually tied to larger redesigns or editorial policy shifts. There’s no evidence of an impending redesign or renaming push. \n- Timing: Only ~54 days remain. Implementing, QA’ing, and deploying a naming change on a key map element within that time—without a strong external driver—is unlikely. \n- Verification context: Resolution is based on the US view, reducing the chance that a geolocated/locale-specific variant would show “Gulf of America” only outside the US. \n- Research assistant input: No additional information available, which implies no known catalysts (e.g., announced rebrand, public campaign, or recent WorldAtlas labeling changes). \nWhy not higher: The alternative name appears in at least one article, but there’s no sign this will propagate to the North America page. The short horizon and the nonstandard term argue for a very low probability. \nWhy not lower: A nonzero chance remains that WorldAtlas standardizes on including alternative names in labels (e.g., “X (Y)”), or performs a site update that incidentally adds the alt name—especially given they already acknowledge it on an article page. \nWhat would move me up: Evidence of an upcoming site redesign; recent instances where WorldAtlas added alternative names to map labels; an editorial policy note or social media post foreshadowing label updates; broader media uptake of “Gulf of America.” \nWhat would move me down: Confirmation that the North America page is static/legacy and unlikely to be touched before July; evidence that WorldAtlas explicitly avoids alternative names on map labels; or a lack of any site updates through mid-June.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill WorldAtlas.com display the body of water northwest of the Caribbean Sea as the Gulf of America before July 1, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nWorld Atlas article: [Gulf Of Mexico (Gulf of America)](https://www.worldatlas.com/gulfs/gulf-of-mexico.html)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if, before July 1, 2025, the World Atlas website at its [North America](https://www.worldatlas.com/webimage/countrys/na.htm) page displays the body of water west of Florida, south of Louisiana and north of the Yucatán Peninsula as the Gulf of America. (At the time of this question, the name displayed is the Gulf of Mexico.)\n\nIn case both names are used, for example \"Gulf of America formerly known as Gulf of Mexico,\" this question resolves as Yes. Note that verification will be from Metaculus admins accessing the webpage from the United States and that therefore resolution will be based on how the page appears when accessed from that location.\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nNo additional information available.\n\nToday is 2025-05-08.\n\nBefore answering you think:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n(e) You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
