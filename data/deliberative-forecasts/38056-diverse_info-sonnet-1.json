    "review": "Forecaster 2's analysis aligns completely with mine and reinforces my reasoning. They correctly identified Walker's withdrawal, the replacement fighter, and the extreme rarity of such decisions being reversed. Their 1% forecast appropriately reflects near-certainty while acknowledging theoretical edge cases.\n\nForecaster 3's analysis appears to have fundamentally misread the situation. They provide detailed stylistic analysis of Walker vs Murzakanov matchup, discuss P(fight occurs) at 85-90%, and estimate Walker's win probability at 33-37%. However, the research assistant explicitly states: 'Following Johnny Walker's withdrawal...Brendson Ribeiro was signed as the replacement fighter' and 'The updated UFC 316 bout sheet officially listed...Azamat Murzakanov vs. Brendson Ribeiro.' Forecaster 3 seems to be analyzing the original matchup as if the withdrawal never occurred, which contradicts the clear evidence that Walker withdrew approximately three weeks ago, contracts were signed with a replacement, and official bout sheets were updated. Their fighting analysis, while potentially insightful for a hypothetical Walker-Murzakanov bout, is irrelevant to the actual question given the confirmed withdrawal and replacement.",
    "rationale": "After reviewing both forecasters' analyses, I am more convinced of my original reasoning. Forecaster 2 independently arrived at nearly identical conclusions, reinforcing that:\n\n1. Walker's withdrawal was reported by multiple credible MMA sources (MMA Fighting, Championat.com) around May 7-9, 2025\n2. A replacement fighter (Brendson Ribeiro) has been officially signed and contracted\n3. The updated UFC 316 bout sheet officially lists Murzakanov vs. Ribeiro\n4. UFC protocol virtually never involves reversing a withdrawal after a replacement has been signed and promoted\n\nForecaster 3's higher forecast stems from apparently not incorporating the withdrawal information, rendering their otherwise detailed analysis inapplicable to the current situation.\n\nThe resolution criteria are unambiguous: 'If Walker does not fight anyone at UFC 316 or fights someone else, this resolves as No.' Walker is confirmed to not be fighting Murzakanov.\n\nI should actually increase my confidence slightly. My original 2% was perhaps too generous. The only scenarios supporting even 1-2% probability are:\n- Reporting error by multiple independent sources (extremely unlikely)\n- Unprecedented administrative reversal after replacement signing (no historical precedent)\n- Some unknown factor we're completely unaware of\n\nGiven the timeline (withdrawal announced ~3 weeks ago), multiple source confirmation, and official bout sheet updates, Forecaster 2's 1% better captures the near-certainty of this outcome. I'm updating from 2% to 1%.",
