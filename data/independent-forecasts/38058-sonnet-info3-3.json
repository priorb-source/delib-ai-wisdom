  "information": "The discussions around U.S. tariff policy have had observable economic effects. President Trump's announcement to delay the EU tariffs led to a positive shift in market sentiment and a surge in U.S. stock futures. In early April 2025, after the signing of an executive order for a 10% 'minimum benchmark tariff', there were reports of U.S. consumers stockpiling goods in anticipation of price increases. According to an estimate by the Tax Foundation, the proposed tariffs could cost U.S. households an additional $830 in 2025, reduce the nation's GDP by 0.4%, and result in the loss of 350,000 jobs.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Approximately 35 days remaining (May 26 to June 30, 2025)",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No - tariffs remain prominent front-page news on at least one of the two papers every single day through June 30, 2025",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Tariffs continue to dominate economic and political news due to their massive ongoing impact ($830 per household cost, GDP contraction, job losses). Both The New York Times and Wall Street Journal maintain at least some front-page mention of tariffs every day through June 30, with at least one paper covering tariff-related developments, economic fallout, or political debates on each day. Given Trump's focus on this policy and the scale of economic disruption, the story remains too significant for both papers to completely omit from their front pages simultaneously.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "A major competing news event occurs that completely dominates both newspapers' front pages for at least one day - such as a significant international crisis, major domestic terrorism event, natural disaster, Supreme Court ruling, or other breaking news of sufficient magnitude. On that day, both papers lead exclusively with this other story and all tariff-related coverage shifts to inside pages. This only needs to happen once in the 35-day window.",
    "rationale": "The research assistant's report confirms tariffs are currently a massive economic story with substantial documented impacts. However, several factors work against this remaining front-page news every single day across both papers: First, the question only requires ONE day where both papers omit tariffs - a relatively low bar over 35 days. Second, summer can produce slower news cycles where coverage patterns shift. Third, major breaking news events do occur and can completely dominate front pages. However, strong countervailing factors suggest a No outcome is more likely: The economic impact is enormous and ongoing (job losses, price increases affecting millions). Wall Street Journal especially focuses heavily on business/economic news, making it very unlikely to omit such a major economic policy story. The broadly-defined 'front page' includes multiple sections beyond just the lead story, increasing the chance of at least a mention. Trump's continued focus on tariffs suggests new developments will keep emerging. Most critically, BOTH papers must omit tariffs on the SAME day - if either paper mentions it, the question resolves No. Given we're already 7 days into the window with presumably continuous coverage, and the magnitude of the story, the status quo strongly favors continued front-page presence. My forecast would be higher if we only needed one paper to omit tariffs, or if the front page was more narrowly defined. It would be lower if the time window were shorter or if there were signs tariff coverage was already declining. A major unexpected news event could shift my forecast upward; continued tariff policy developments would shift it downward.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill the word \"tariff\" disappear from the front pages of The New York Times and Wall Street Journal before July 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nWhether reading the newspaper or social media or watching the news, it is highly likely you are going to see something about tariffs - mainly due to US President Donald Trump's [renewed love](https://www.france24.com/en/live-news/20250401-tariff-man-trump-s-long-history-with-trade-wars) for this somewhat antiquated form of taxation.\r\n\r\nThe New York Times and the Wall Street Journal are two of the largest print newspapers in the US. Before July, will we see tariffs wiped from the front pages of both papers?\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question will resolve as **Yes** if, on any single day after May 19, 2025 and before July 1, 2025, the words \"tariff\" or \"tariffs\" appear on neither the digital version of the front page of The New York Times nor the Wall Street Journal.

Format is: yyyy-mm-dd.</sup>\n\n* Grammar or spelling will not prevent a **No** resolution.\r\n* \"Tariff(s)\" must be omitted from both papers' front pages on the same day.\r\n* \"Tariff(s)\" can appear anywhere on the page, including \"Pages A2-A3 and Corrections\", \"What's News: Business & Finance\" not just the initial section at the top. The only sections that do not qualify are those that do not change between different front pages such as the \"Most Popular News\" or \"Recommended Videos\" sections on WSJ.\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nThe discussions around U.S. tariff policy have had observable economic effects.

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
