    "review": "The other two forecasters and I are in strong agreement on the fundamental drivers of this question: the policy is recent, has high-level political backing, and is part of a broader trade strategy, making a substantive policy reversal before the July resolution date extremely unlikely. However, Forecaster 3 introduced a critical point I had completely overlooked: the resolution hinges on the specific wording on a webpage, not the policy itself. Forecaster 3's scenario, where the policy remains in effect but BC Hydro updates the webpage to use brand-neutral language (e.g., 'certain U.S.-made products are ineligible') for legal or communication reasons, presents a highly plausible path to a 'No' resolution. This is a much more probable event than a full policy reversal. Forecaster 2 also arrived at a similar probability, citing general uncertainty and the possibility of rapid changes in trade negotiations, but Forecaster 3's explicit mechanism for a 'No' outcome is far more convincing and actionable.",
    "rationale": "My initial forecast of 98% was based almost exclusively on the low probability of a full policy reversal in such a short timeframe. Forecaster 3's analysis convincingly demonstrated a significant blind spot in my reasoning. The resolution criteria are brittle; they depend on the explicit mention of 'Tesla' on a specific webpage. I now recognize there are two distinct paths to a 'No' outcome: a policy reversal (which I still estimate has a very low probability, ~2%) and a 'wording change' where the policy remains but the explicit brand name is removed from the webpage for legal, diplomatic, or communications reasons.\n\nThis 'wording change' scenario is far more plausible than a policy reversal. It is standard practice for government agencies to shift from specific, targeted language to more generic, criteria-based language over time. This insight requires a significant downward adjustment to my forecast. I am moving my forecast from 98% to 90%. The 8-point drop is my new estimated probability of a wording change causing a 'No' resolution. I remain slightly more confident than the other forecasters (who are at 83-85%) because I believe the recency and high-profile nature of the policy change make it slightly more likely that BC Hydro will retain the explicit, clarifying language for consumers past the July 1st deadline to avoid confusion. However, the risk of a wording change is substantial and warrants this major revision.",
