    "review": "My initial forecast was 95%. My peers forecasted 85% and 90%. The core reasoning across all forecasts was similar, focusing on the high frequency of recent large protests and the ongoing political instability surrounding the upcoming June 3rd presidential election. However, both other forecasters introduced a critical point I had not sufficiently weighted: the uncertainty inherent in the resolution source, the Global Protest Tracker. They argued that the tracker might have reporting lags or use conservative crowd size estimates, potentially causing a qualifying event to be missed or undercounted. The May 1st protest, with estimates ranging from 8,000 to 13,000, was cited as a compelling example of this risk. Forecaster 2 also articulated the possibility of the election acting as a 'release valve' for political tension, which could dampen protest activity in late June.",
    "rationale": "I found the arguments regarding the resolution source risk to be highly convincing and the primary reason for updating my forecast. My initial 95% probability focused almost entirely on the likelihood of a protest with 10,000+ people *occurring*, but it failed to adequately account for the specific risk that the single official source might not report it as such. The other forecasters correctly identified this measurement uncertainty as a key variable. A protest could easily happen, but if the tracker uses a low-end or official police estimate, it might fall just below the 10,000-participant threshold for resolution. While I also considered the 'release valve' argument, I believe the deep political polarization in South Korea makes a sudden and complete halt to protests unlikely, regardless of the election outcome. However, the reporting risk is a direct and undeniable uncertainty. Therefore, I am lowering my forecast by 5 percentage points to incorporate this source-specific risk. My updated forecast reflects an extremely high confidence that a qualifying event will happen, tempered by a realistic uncertainty about its official capture by the Global Protest Tracker.",
