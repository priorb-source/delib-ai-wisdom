    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "14 days - the Democratic primary is scheduled for June 17, 2025",
    "status_quo_outcome": "Uncertain - insufficient information about current race dynamics, polling, or the field of candidates",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Jones loses the Democratic primary to another candidate who receives more votes, potentially someone with stronger name recognition, better fundraising, more endorsements, or a more compelling campaign message to Democratic primary voters in Virginia",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Jones wins the Democratic primary by receiving the most votes, leveraging his experience as a former delegate, his Norfolk base, effective campaign strategy, and appealing to Democratic primary voters' priorities on issues important to the Attorney General race",
    "rationale": "This forecast is severely constrained by a complete lack of specific information about the race dynamics. My research assistant provided no details about: (1) who else is running in the primary, (2) current polling data, (3) Jones's standing relative to opponents, (4) fundraising figures, (5) key endorsements, or (6) recent developments in the race. What I do know: Jones is a former Democratic delegate from Norfolk, giving him past electoral experience and some baseline credibility. The Washington Post coverage of him 'ramping up' his campaign suggests he's a serious candidate actively competing. The proximity to the election date (14 days out) without information suggesting the race is decided implies competitive uncertainty remains. My forecast reflects substantial epistemic uncertainty. I cannot justify going higher than 50% without evidence he's the frontrunner, such as polling leads, major endorsements, or news indicating momentum. I cannot go lower than 30% given he's a credible former elected official actively campaigning this close to election day. To update upward, I would need: evidence of polling leads, major party endorsements, favorable news coverage, or information that he faces weak opposition. To update downward, I would need: polls showing him trailing significantly, information about strong opponents, negative news, or evidence the race is effectively over. At 40%, I'm acknowledging he has a realistic chance while respecting the significant uncertainty inherent in forecasting without race-specific information.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill Jerrauld \"Jay\" Jones win the Democratic primary for attorney general of Virginia in the 2025 election?\n\nQuestion background:\nWashington Post: [Former Del. Jay Jones (D) of Norfolk ramps up bid for Virginia AG](https://www.washingtonpost.com/dc-md-va/2024/11/12/virginia-jones-miyares-ag-election/)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if [Jerrauld \"Jay\" Jones](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jay_Jones_(politician)) wins the 2025 Democratic primary for Attorney General of Virginia, according to [credible sources](https://www.metaculus.com/faq/#definitions).\n\nThe Democratic primary election is currently scheduled for June 17, 2025.

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
