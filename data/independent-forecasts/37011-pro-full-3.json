  "information": "The 2025 Derbyshire County Council election is scheduled for May 1, 2025. This election will use new divisional boundaries, increasing the total number of seats from 61 to 64. Elections for the council operate under a First-Past-The-Post system. According to an assessment, the Conservative Party holds 57 of the 64 seats under the new boundaries. Reform UK currently holds zero seats on the council.\n\nAs a newer political party, Reform UK does not have the established local infrastructure and grassroots organization of the main parties active in Derbyshire. The party has encountered issues with candidate vetting, including a controversy involving their candidate for Bakewell, Max Bethell, who reportedly made racial slurs on social media. Historically, predecessor parties like UKIP and the Brexit Party did not succeed in translating national support into control of county councils.\n\nNational polling data shows support for Reform UK at approximately 23-25%. A March MRP poll by The Telegraph provided data for the region. The party has confirmed it is running a full slate of candidates across Derbyshire. Political scientist Professor John Curtice has noted that Reform UK's voter support may be more geographically concentrated than widely distributed.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Approximately 10 days.",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No. The Conservative Party holds a significant notional majority (57 of 64 seats) under the new boundaries, while Reform UK holds zero. The status quo would see the Conservatives win the most seats.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "The Conservative Party wins the most seats, though likely with a reduced majority. Labour and the Liberal Democrats may also pick up seats. Reform UK's national polling support fails to translate effectively into seat wins under the First-Past-The-Post system due to their vote being too widely distributed, resulting in them winning very few or no seats.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "There is an unprecedented collapse in the Conservative vote across Derbyshire, with the vast majority of those voters switching directly to Reform UK. This support proves to be extremely geographically concentrated, allowing Reform to win a plurality of the 64 individual divisions. This occurs despite their lack of established local party infrastructure and the structural disadvantages of the electoral system for new parties.",
    "rationale": "My forecast is based on several key factors. Firstly, the status quo is overwhelmingly against a Reform UK victory. The Conservative Party has a massive incumbent advantage, notionally holding 57 of the 64 seats under the new boundaries, while Reform holds none. Overcoming this is a monumental task. Secondly, the First-Past-The-Post electoral system is a major barrier for new parties whose support is not geographically concentrated. While Reform UK has high national polling figures (23-25%), this is unlikely to be efficient enough to win a plurality of individual council divisions. Historically, predecessor parties like UKIP failed to translate national support into control of county councils for this exact reason. Thirdly, local elections are heavily influenced by local factors, such as candidate recognition and party infrastructure, where established parties have a significant advantage over a newer party like Reform UK. Candidate vetting issues, as reported in Bakewell, also suggest potential organizational weaknesses that could hinder their campaign.\n\nMy probability is not lower than 2% because there is a non-zero chance of a political earthquake. The national political environment is volatile, Conservative support is low, and Reform is running a full slate of candidates. If the Conservative vote collapses entirely and transfers directly and efficiently to Reform, an upset is theoretically possible. \n\nMy probability is not higher because the structural barriers—incumbency, the electoral system, and lack of local machinery—are immense. A 'Yes' outcome would require a political event far outside the bounds of normal local election results. For me to increase my forecast, I would need to see credible, division-level polling showing Reform with a commanding lead in a plurality of Derbyshire's seats.",

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower.
