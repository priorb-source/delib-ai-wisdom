    "review": "The other two forecasters provided critical new information that was absent from my initial analysis. Specifically, they noted that the police investigation has progressed to a formal terrorism-related charge against one band member, and they identified a specific court date for a bail hearing on June 18, just a week before the festival. Most importantly, they provided evidence that the band has continued to perform at other UK venues even after the charge was announced. This directly and convincingly counters my initial assumption that the severity of the allegations and investigation would lead to a pre-emptive, risk-averse cancellation by any major event organizer. Their reasoning that Glastonbury has a particular ethos of resisting political pressure and that the resolution criteria are flexible (allowing for a partial performance) are also very strong points I had underweight.",
    "rationale": "My initial forecast of 35% was based on the premise that the severe political, security, and reputational risks associated with a counter-terrorism investigation would make Kneecap's performance untenable for a mainstream festival like Glastonbury. However, the new information presented by the other forecasters has led me to significantly re-evaluate my position. The fact that the band has successfully performed at other UK venues since one member was formally charged demonstrates that a blanket cancellation is not the default outcome. This suggests that organizers are making individual risk assessments, and as the other forecasters argued, Glastonbury is uniquely likely to resist external political pressure and support a booked act until legally or logistically compelled not to. The specific court date of June 18 now becomes the pivotal event. The festival organizers have a strong incentive to maintain the status quo until that date, when the legal parameters (i.e., bail conditions) will become clear. The flexible resolution criteria, where a performance by only part of the band would count as a 'Yes', further strengthens the case for them performing in some capacity. While I still believe the situation carries immense risk — a terrorism charge is an unprecedented complication, and pressure from police, local councils, or insurers could still force a cancellation — the evidence suggests the 'Yes' outcome is now more likely than 'No'. I am therefore making a substantial update to my forecast, moving from 35% to 55%, reflecting this new understanding while still pricing in the very real possibility of a last-minute cancellation due to legal or security factors.",
