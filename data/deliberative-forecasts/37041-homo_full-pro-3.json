    "review": "Both other forecasters arrived at a slightly higher probability (8%) than my initial forecast (5%), though our core reasoning was very similar. Their analyses introduced two key points I had not explicitly weighed. First, they both emphasized that due to the high-consequence nature of yellow fever, the CDC would likely act very quickly and issue an advisory in response to even a single confirmed case of local transmission. This is a highly convincing argument that I may have underestimated. Second, Forecaster 3 noted the Darién Gap as a significant geographic barrier, which strengthens the case for the 'No' outcome. Their consensus at a slightly higher level of risk, combined with the strong point about the CDC's likely reactivity, persuades me that I was slightly underestimating the tail risk, despite the strong mitigating factors in place.",
    "rationale": "I am updating my forecast from 5% to 7%. The core of my reasoning remains unchanged: the most likely outcome is 'No' given the very short five-week timeline and the robust preventative measures in the most at-risk North American country, Panama. These measures include high vaccination coverage in border regions, activated health protocols, and a 50-year history without a reported human case. However, the other forecasters' arguments have convinced me to slightly increase the probability of a 'Yes' outcome. The key reason for this increase is the point that the CDC would likely react very swiftly to even a single confirmed local transmission, given the severity of yellow fever. I had perhaps assumed a slightly higher threshold or slower process for an advisory to be issued. The ongoing outbreak in South America is exceptionally severe, creating a high 'viral pressure' on neighboring countries. This combination of high pressure and a low threshold for a CDC response makes the tail risk of a spillover event leading to an advisory more significant than I first calculated. I am not moving my forecast to the consensus of 8% because I still place very heavy weight on the effectiveness of Panama's long-standing public health infrastructure and the formidable geographic barrier of the Darién Gap, which severely restricts land-based movement from the outbreak zone. These factors keep my forecast in the low single digits, but I now believe 7% better reflects the heightened regional risk.",
