    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Approximately 25 days until July 1, 2025",
    "status_quo_outcome": "NO - Sudan has not ratified AfCFTA and remains in a non-ratified state",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Sudan's ongoing civil war (which began in April 2023 between the Sudanese Armed Forces and Rapid Support Forces) continues to severely disrupt government functions. The country remains unable to complete the bureaucratic and legislative processes necessary for ratifying international agreements. With only 25 days remaining, the ratification process is not prioritized or completed.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Despite the ongoing conflict, Sudan's government expedites the ratification process through emergency procedures or executive action. A potential ceasefire or temporary stabilization allows critical government functions to resume, and AfCFTA ratification is fast-tracked as a diplomatic priority, with all necessary approvals completed within the 25-day window.",
    "rationale": "Sudan is currently experiencing a devastating civil war that has severely disrupted governmental capacity since April 2023. While the background information indicates that stakeholders reviewed and validated a draft AfCFTA implementation strategy, this preparatory work does not constitute ratification, which requires formal governmental/legislative action. The status quo heavily favors NO for several critical reasons: (1) only 25 days remain until the deadline, (2) Sudan's government functions are severely compromised by active conflict, (3) there is no recent reporting suggesting imminent ratification, and (4) even in stable conditions, international treaty ratification typically requires more than 25 days to complete. My forecast is not lower (near zero) because: ratification might be possible through expedited executive action, Sudan has demonstrated prior interest through the implementation strategy work, and unexpected diplomatic breakthroughs occasionally occur. My forecast is not higher because the confluence of factors required (conflict resolution/stabilization + prioritization + completion of all procedures in under 25 days) is extremely unlikely. I would update upward with news of a ceasefire, government announcements of imminent ratification, or evidence of fast-tracked procedures. I would update downward with conflict escalation or confirmation that lengthy legislative processes are required.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill Sudan ratify AfCFTA (the pan-African free trade agreement) before July 1, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\n[Draft National AfCFTA Implementation Strategy for Sudan Reviewed and Validated by Stakeholders](https://igad.int/draft-national-afcfta-implementation-strategy-for-sudan-reviewed-and-validated-by-stakeholders/)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if Sudan ratifies the African Continental Free Trade Area (AfCFTA) Agreement before July 1, 2025.\n\n\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nNo additional information available.\n\nToday is 2025-06-06.\n\nBefore answering you think:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n(e) You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
