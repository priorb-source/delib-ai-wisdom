    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "About 24 days (until June 30, 2025, end of day local/UTC depending on resolver)",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Sudan’s de facto authorities remain focused on the civil war and humanitarian crisis; no functioning legislature or unified executive completes the domestic legal steps, and no instrument of ratification is deposited with the AU Commission before June 30.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "The Sovereign Council (or equivalent authority) fast-tracks ratification by decree, the Foreign Ministry prepares and transmits the instrument of ratification to the AU Commission, and the AU publicly acknowledges receipt before July 1, 2025.",
    "rationale": "- Time constraint: Only ~24 days remain. International treaty ratifications typically require domestic authorization plus preparation and deposit of instruments with the AU Commission. Compressing these steps amid conflict is difficult.\n- Status quo: Sudan has signed but not ratified AfCFTA. The country has been in intense conflict since April 2023, with fragmented governance and no regular parliament. Routine policy moves not tied to immediate wartime needs have moved slowly or stalled. Weighting the status quo heavily implies “No” is most likely by the deadline.\n- Institutional capacity and priorities: Even if the Sovereign Council can legally authorize ratification by decree, operational bandwidth (drafting the instrument, legal clearances, diplomatic transmission, coordination with AU) during active conflict and humanitarian crisis is limited. AfCFTA implementation benefits are medium- to long-term and likely deprioritized versus urgent security/diplomatic concerns.\n- Base rates: Among the small set of remaining non-ratifiers, new ratifications have occurred infrequently. With less than a month left, the base rate of a sudden ratification by Sudan is low absent prior signaling.\n- Information available: The assistant provided no new leads. The cited IGAD note about a draft implementation strategy shows policy interest but does not indicate imminent ratification, and appears earlier-stage.\nWhy not higher: No public signals of imminent ratification, severe domestic constraints, and very short timeline.\nWhy not lower: It is procedurally possible for the de facto authorities to ratify by decree and deposit quickly, and governments sometimes time such acts around AU meetings or for diplomatic signaling.\nWhat would move me upward: Credible reports that the Sovereign Council has approved ratification; an agenda or communique indicating Sudan will deposit during an AU meeting in June; statements from the Sudanese MFA or AU Commission acknowledging preparation/receipt of the instrument.\nWhat would move me downward: Continued silence through mid-June; reports of deteriorating conflict conditions or diplomatic isolation that crowd out such policy actions.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill Sudan ratify AfCFTA (the pan-African free trade agreement) before July 1, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\n[Draft National AfCFTA Implementation Strategy for Sudan Reviewed and Validated by Stakeholders](https://igad.int/draft-national-afcfta-implementation-strategy-for-sudan-reviewed-and-validated-by-stakeholders/)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if Sudan ratifies the African Continental Free Trade Area (AfCFTA) Agreement before July 1, 2025.\n\n\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nNo additional information available.\n\nToday is 2025-06-06.\n\nBefore answering you think:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n(e) You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
