    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Less than two months, as a definitive outcome is expected by July 1, 2025.",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No. Muqtada al-Sadr's movement is currently boycotting the political process and has repeatedly affirmed its intention not to participate in the upcoming elections.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Muqtada al-Sadr maintains his boycott of the political process, continuing to criticize the government and the electoral system from the outside. He makes no announcement of participation before the July 1, 2025 deadline, viewing the conditions for a fair election and meaningful reform as unmet.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Fearing the consolidation of power by his rivals in the Shia Coordination Framework and the long-term marginalization of his movement, Sadr executes a characteristic political reversal. Citing a need to 'save the country' or having secured last-minute concessions, he announces his party will contest the elections.",
    "rationale": "My forecast is based primarily on the strong status quo. Muqtada al-Sadr's withdrawal from parliament in 2022 was a significant political act, and he has since repeatedly re-affirmed his boycott of the formal political process, as noted in the provided background information. As of today, and with my research assistant confirming no new conflicting information, there are no public signals that he is reconsidering this stance. Boycotts are a key tool in Sadr's political playbook, used to exert pressure and mobilize his base outside of institutional politics. A reversal without significant concessions or a fundamental shift in the political landscape could damage his credibility. The less than two-month timeframe until the deadline also makes a reversal less likely, as electoral preparations would need to begin soon.\n\nHowever, my forecast is not lower than 15% because Sadr is notoriously unpredictable and has a history of abrupt changes in strategy. The primary driver for a 'Yes' outcome would be the strategic imperative to prevent his rivals from cementing their control over the state for another full term, a reality that will become more acute as the election nears. The possibility of back-channel deals or a sudden political crisis could precipitate an announcement.\n\nMy forecast is not higher than 15% because the fundamental reasons for his withdrawal—the political stalemate, corruption, and the power of rival factions—remain largely unaddressed. The burden of evidence rests on a change from the current, firmly-stated position of boycotting.\n\nI would increase my probability forecast for 'Yes' upon receiving credible reports of negotiations between the Sadrists and other major political blocs, or if Sadr's public rhetoric begins to soften and outline conditions for a return. Conversely, another strong, public reaffirmation of the boycott closer to the deadline would lower my forecast further.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nBefore July 1, 2025, will Muqtada al-Sadr's Alliance Towards Reforms party announce that it will participate in the 2025 Iraqi parliamentary election?\n\nQuestion background:\nbasnews: [Sadr Rejects Iraqi President’s Plea, Reaffirms Election Boycott](https://www.basnews.com/en/babat/881132)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if, before July 1, 2025, the Alliance Towards Reforms announces that it will field candidates in Iraq's [2025 parliamentary elections](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2025_Iraqi_parliamentary_election).\n\n\"Alliance Towards Reforms\" refers to the \"**تحالف سائرون للإصلا**ح\" or \"سائرون\" coalition, party or movement headed by Muqtada al-Sadr, as decribed at [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alliance_Towards_Reforms). Name changes will not affect resolution.\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nNo additional information available.\n\nToday is 2025-05-03.\n\nBefore answering you think:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n(e) You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
