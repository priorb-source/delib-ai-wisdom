  "information": "The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) announced it will decommission its 'Billion-Dollar Weather and Climate Disasters' database. The database, created in 1980 to track the financial costs of major climate events, will not be updated beyond 2024 and its existing information will be archived. According to AM Best, a credit rating agency, the removal of this centralized data source could hinder insurance companies' ability to model, price, and manage risks associated with climate-related disasters. NOAA communications chief Kim Doster stated the change is 'in alignment with evolving priorities, statutory mandates, and staffing changes'.\n\nThe Trump administration has implemented significant budget and staff cuts at NOAA. According to reports, hundreds of scientists and climate experts have been laid off, sparking concern over the future of climate research and environmental policy. These actions are seen by some as aligning with the 'Project 2025' plan promoted by the Heritage Foundation, which proposes dismantling the agency. Additionally, some of NOAA's regional climate centers have been shut down, and all contributors to the National Climate Assessment have been fired.\n\nOn April 4, 2025, a NOAA spokesperson stated that the agency's websites will remain online. Following an internal memo that had warned of potential data loss if sites went down, the spokesperson confirmed, 'There will be no interruption in service. All NOAA Research sites will remain online.' The statement specifically referred to websites connected to NOAA's Office of Oceanic and Atmospheric Research, which focus on climate change, extreme weather research, and drought monitoring.",

    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Approximately 6 weeks.",
    "status_quo_outcome": "As of today, May 21, 2025, Climate.gov is online and functional. The status quo outcome is that it remains online through the resolution date.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "The Trump administration, acting on the policies outlined in 'Project 2025', issues a swift directive to take down websites deemed non-essential or contrary to its policy aims. Despite a previous statement, NOAA complies and takes Climate.gov offline before July 1, 2025.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Bureaucratic and technical inertia prevent the website from being taken down on such a short timeline. The April 4th statement by the NOAA spokesperson holds true, and while some datasets or programs are cut, the main public-facing website remains operational past July 1, 2025.",
    "rationale": "My forecast is heavily influenced by the very short time remaining until the resolution date. The world, especially large government bureaucracies, changes slowly. The status quo is that Climate.gov is online, and overcoming the inertia to take a major federal website offline in just over a month is a significant undertaking.\n\nThe most compelling piece of evidence supporting a 'Yes' outcome is the direct statement from a NOAA spokesperson on April 4, 2025, explicitly stating that 'All NOAA Research sites will remain online.' This is a specific, recent, and public commitment directly addressing the core of the question.\n\nConversely, the evidence suggesting a 'No' outcome, such as staff cuts, the decommissioning of the 'Billion-Dollar Disasters' database, and the general political alignment with 'Project 2025', points to a clear long-term trend and intent. However, these are general actions, not a specific order to shutter Climate.gov. While the intent may be to dismantle such resources, the execution takes time.\n\nMy probability is not higher than 95% because the political environment is volatile. A sudden executive order could override previous assurances and bureaucratic hurdles, making a 'No' outcome possible, albeit unlikely in this short timeframe.\n\nMy probability is not lower because the combination of the short deadline, institutional inertia, and a direct public promise from the agency creates a very high likelihood that the site will still be online on July 1. For me to lower my forecast, I would need to see a specific directive or official announcement reversing the April 4th statement and ordering the site to be taken down.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill NOAA's Climate.gov still be online on July 1, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nNational Security Archive: [Disappearing Data: Trump Administration Removing Climate Information from Government Websites](https://nsarchive.gwu.edu/briefing-book/climate-change-transparency-project-foia/2025-02-06/disappearing-data-trump)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below.

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
