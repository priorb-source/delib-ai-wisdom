  "information": "Historically, in the last two open Florida gubernatorial cycles (2018 and 2022), major candidates typically announced their campaigns 12 to 18 months before the primary election. For the 2026 cycle, some contenders, such as Republican Byron Donalds and Democrat David Jolly, had already announced their candidacies by early June 2025. Reports note that as of early June, there have been no leaks of a launch date, no exploratory committee paperwork filed by Suarez, and no scheduled kickoff events for a gubernatorial campaign.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "26 days",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No. Francis Suarez has not announced his candidacy for governor and takes no action to do so, therefore he will not have announced by the deadline.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Francis Suarez continues to gauge interest and build his political network but concludes that the timing is not right or that his path to the nomination is too narrow. The July 1, 2025 deadline passes without any formal announcement or paperwork filing.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Capitalizing on recent media attention, Francis Suarez makes a surprise announcement in late June to get ahead of other potential Republican rivals and begin fundraising in earnest. This could take the form of a press conference in Miami or the official filing of candidacy paperwork.",
    "rationale": "My forecast is based primarily on the lack of preparatory activity for a gubernatorial campaign launch. As the research assistant's report highlights, as of June 5, 2025, there have been no leaks of a launch date, no exploratory committee paperwork filed, and no scheduled events. Major political campaign announcements are logistically complex and are typically preceded by such signals. With only 26 days remaining until the deadline, the absence of this groundwork is the single strongest piece of evidence that an announcement is not imminent. The status quo is that Suarez is not a declared candidate, and this is the most likely outcome to persist in the short term. While his previous presidential bid shows he has higher ambitions, its brevity may also suggest a more cautious approach this time, which would likely involve a longer-than-three-week planning window for a major campaign launch. My probability is not lower than 15% because an announcement can be made quickly in the modern media environment (e.g., a social media declaration or a simple paperwork filing). Suarez may see a strategic advantage in a surprise launch to capture the news cycle. My probability is not higher because the overwhelming evidence points to inaction. A serious gubernatorial run requires months of planning, and with other candidates already in the race, the lack of visible activity from Suarez's camp is highly indicative of a 'No' outcome for this specific timeframe. I would increase my forecast significantly upon credible reports of staff hires for a statewide campaign, a leaked announcement date, or the filing of an exploratory committee. Conversely, each passing day without such news will cause my confidence in a 'No' outcome to increase.",

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any).
