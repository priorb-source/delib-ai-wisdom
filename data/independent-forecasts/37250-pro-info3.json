  "information": "Kilmar Abrego Garcia was deported to El Salvador around March 15, 2025, and is being held in a maximum-security prison. The President of El Salvador, Nayib Bukele, has publicly labeled Garcia a 'terrorist' and has stated that he will not be released or returned to the United States. U.S. Senator Chris Van Hollen traveled to El Salvador to demand Garcia's release from prison, but reported that the U.S. embassy in El Salvador had not received instructions to assist in the matter.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "2 months",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "The Salvadoran government, led by President Nayib Bukele, maintains its publicly stated position. Despite some diplomatic pressure from the U.S., it is insufficient to secure Kilmar Abrego Garcia's release and return before the July 1, 2025 deadline. He remains imprisoned in El Salvador.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "The U.S. government, possibly at the level of the White House or State Department, applies intense and successful diplomatic pressure, such as the threat of sanctions, forcing President Bukele to reverse his decision and release Garcia. Garcia is then transported to and enters U.S. territory before July 1, 2025.",
    "rationale": "My forecast is based heavily on the strong status quo. Kilmar Abrego Garcia is currently in a maximum-security prison in El Salvador. The President of El Salvador, Nayib Bukele, has a powerful political incentive to maintain his hardline stance, having publicly labeled Garcia a 'terrorist' and vowed he will not be released. The timeline for a reversal is extremely short—just two months. Diplomatic and legal processes required to overturn such a firm, public position of a head of state are typically lengthy and complex. Furthermore, the information that the U.S. embassy has not received instructions to assist indicates this case is not currently a top diplomatic priority for the U.S. administration, reducing the likelihood of the extraordinary pressure needed to secure a quick release. My probability is not lower than 2% because international relations are fluid, and a non-zero chance exists that the political calculus could change rapidly due to unforeseen events or a sudden escalation of U.S. pressure. My forecast is not higher because of Bukele's strong domestic political incentives, his direct control over the state apparatus, and the very tight deadline. I would increase my forecast upon seeing evidence of high-level White House intervention or a public softening of Bukele's stance. I would decrease it as time passes without any such developments.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill Kilmar Abrego Garcia return to the United States before July 1, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nWikipedia: [Deportation of Kilmar Abrego Garcia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deportation_of_Kilmar_Abrego_Garcia)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if Kilmar Abrego Garcia after the launch of this question and before July 1, 2025 enters territory of the United States according to [credible sources](https://www.metaculus.com/help/faq/#definitions).\n\nSubsequently leaving the United States, such as a deportation, will not cause this question to re-resolve.\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nKilmar Abrego Garcia was deported to El Salvador around March 15, 2025, and is being held in a maximum-security prison. The President of El Salvador, Nayib Bukele, has publicly labeled Garcia a 'terrorist' and has stated that he will not be released or returned to the United States. U.S. Senator Chris Van Hollen traveled to El Salvador to demand Garcia's release from prison, but reported that the U.S. embassy in El Salvador had not received instructions to assist in the matter.\n\nToday is 2025-05-01.\n\nBefore answering you think:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n(e) You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
