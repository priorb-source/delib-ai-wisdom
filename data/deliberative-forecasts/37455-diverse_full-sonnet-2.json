    "review": "Forecaster 2 at 85% appears overly optimistic given the 23-day silence since licensing, relying heavily on a single DRC precedent without accounting for country-specific factors. However, their point about inter-satellite links reducing ground station dependence is valid and somewhat mitigates South Africa logistics concerns.\n\nForecaster 3 at 65% provides the most balanced analysis. They appropriately weigh the DRC precedent against status quo inertia and raise important administrative hurdles I underweighted: equipment type approval, tax registration, payment systems, and authorized distribution channels. Their observation that 'world changes slowly' and that some countries lag between license and map availability is empirically sound.\n\nThe key tension is between Starlink's demonstrated technical capability (DRC shows they can move in days when motivated) versus the concerning 23-day lag suggesting administrative friction or lower prioritization. Forecaster 3's identification of multiple gating items beyond just licensing is persuasive - these take time even for a fast-moving company.",
    "rationale": "Upon reflection, I was slightly too pessimistic at 55%. While the 23-day lag without any announcement is concerning and contrasts with DRC's immediate action, 54 days remaining is still substantial time for resolving administrative items like equipment type approval, tax registration, and distribution setup. The technical barriers are low - geofencing is straightforward and inter-satellite links reduce ground infrastructure needs.\n\nHowever, I'm not moving as high as 85% because: (1) we have only one ultra-fast deployment precedent (DRC), insufficient to establish a reliable pattern; (2) the 23-day lag suggests this won't be immediate; (3) Lesotho's small market may mean lower priority; (4) multiple administrative/logistical hurdles remain.\n\nThe most likely scenario is that Starlink will launch, but not as quickly as DRC. 54 days should be sufficient time even accounting for administrative friction, but there's meaningful risk of delays. I'm updating to 60%, acknowledging that technical feasibility and adequate time favor Yes, while administrative uncertainties and current lack of progress warrant substantial probability on No.",
