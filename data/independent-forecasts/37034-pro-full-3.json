  "information": "According to Baker Hughes data from mid-April 2025, the total number of active drilling rigs in the U.S. rose by 2 to 585. This followed a 7-rig dip in the prior week. The count of oil rigs rose by 1 to 481, and gas rigs also increased by 1 to 98. The total rig count is down by 34 compared to the same period in the previous year. Drilling activity in the Permian basin was steady at 289 rigs, which is 29 fewer than the previous year. The Frac Spread Count, which estimates the number of crews completing wells, fell by 10 to 195.\n\nAs of late April 2025, West Texas Intermediate (WTI) oil prices were around $64-$65 per barrel, after the American Petroleum Institute reported a decrease of 4.565 million barrels in U.S. crude oil inventories for the week ending April 18. This price is near the breakeven point for many drilling operations, which is estimated to be around $65 per barrel. A Dallas Fed survey of 130 energy firms in Texas, New Mexico, and Louisiana indicated that firms are dealing with increased costs, reduced rig counts, and layoffs. The survey's company outlook index decreased by 12 points, while the outlook uncertainty index increased by 21 points, with executives citing tariffs on steel (25%) as increasing costs for casing and tubing.\n\nSeveral major energy and service companies reported on their performance in Q1 2025. Halliburton reported declining profits in North America due to decreased drilling activity. Baker Hughes' oilfield services division saw a 10% sequential drop in revenue. In contrast, Occidental Petroleum announced a capital expenditures plan of $7 billion to $7.2 billion for 2025, with $3.7 billion allocated to the Permian Basin. The company plans to operate 24 gross drilling rigs and bring 500 to 550 new wells online in the Permian during the year.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Approximately 5 weeks. The question resolves based on the report for the week ending May 30, 2025, and today's date is April 23, 2025.",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No. The most recent rig count is 585. If this number remains stable or increases, the outcome will be 'No' as it would not be less than 583.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "The number of active rigs remains at or above 583. This could occur if a modest rise in oil prices above the breakeven point encourages producers to maintain or slightly increase activity. Alternatively, the planned drilling by major operators like Occidental could be sufficient to offset any declines from smaller players, leading the rig count to stabilize around its current level of 585.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "The number of active rigs drops to 582 or fewer. This scenario is driven by current economic pressures, with WTI oil prices hovering near the ~$65 per barrel breakeven point and input costs (like steel) rising. These factors force less efficient operators to halt drilling, leading to a net decrease of at least 3 rigs over the next five weeks.",
    "rationale": "My forecast is based on the significant economic headwinds facing US drillers, which I believe makes a small net decline in the rig count more likely than not over the next five weeks. The current rig count is 585, meaning only a net decrease of 3 rigs is needed for a 'Yes' outcome.\n\nThe key factor supporting this forecast is the price of WTI crude, which at $64-$65 per barrel is at or near the breakeven point for many producers. This disincentivizes new drilling. This pressure is corroborated by a Dallas Fed survey indicating rising costs and uncertainty, as well as disappointing Q1 reports from oilfield service giants Halliburton and Baker Hughes, who both cited declining North American activity. The year-over-year trend is also strongly negative, with 34 fewer rigs than a year ago.\n\nMy probability is not higher because rig counts have inertia and short-term volatility. The count did recently increase by 2 rigs, showing it does not move down in a straight line. Furthermore, substantial capital expenditure plans from major, efficient producers like Occidental Petroleum will provide a floor and prevent a sharp drop in the count, potentially offsetting declines elsewhere and keeping the total number close to the current level.\n\nMy probability is not lower because the fundamental economic signals point clearly towards a slowdown. Ignoring the combination of breakeven oil prices, rising costs, and negative industry sentiment would be imprudent. A net decline of just 3 rigs over 5 weeks is a small change that is highly plausible under these conditions.\n\nI would increase my forecast's probability if WTI prices were to fall further below $64. Conversely, I would decrease my forecast if WTI prices rose sustainedly above $66 or if the next one to two weekly rig count reports showed a clear upward trend.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill the number of active US drilling rigs be less than 583 for the week ending May 30, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nSeekingAlpha: [U.S. rig count falls for third straight week, Baker Hughes says](https://seekingalpha.com/news/4430543-u-s-rig-count-falls-for-third-straight-week-baker-hughes-says)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if the last count of active US drilling rigs for the week ending May 30, 2025, according to the [Baker Hughes North America Rig Count](https://rigcount.bakerhughes.com/na-rig-count), is less than 583. Specifically, it will resolve based on the number listed as the United States Total for the most recent week in the May 30, 2025 North America Rig Count Report. This is the number of active drilling rigs and includes the total of those classified as gas, oil and miscellaneous, in every US location including inland waters, land and offshore.\n\nIf no report dated May 30, 2025, is released before June 1, 2025, Eastern Time, Metaculus may resolve this question using the most recent report available dated between May 23, 2025, and June 1, 2025, inclusive.
