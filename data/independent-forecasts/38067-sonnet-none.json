    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "The 2025 James Beard Awards ceremony is typically held in early June. Given today is May 27, 2025, the outcome should be known within approximately 1-2 weeks.",
    "status_quo_outcome": "Historically, the Outstanding Chef award has been male-dominated, with men winning more frequently than women. The status quo suggests a man is more likely to win this category.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "A man wins the 2025 James Beard Award for Outstanding Chef. This could occur if either (1) no women are among the finalists, or (2) a male finalist is selected as the winner by the judges over any female finalists.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "A woman among the finalists for Outstanding Chef is selected by the James Beard Foundation judges as the winner, recognizing her exceptional culinary achievements and contributions to the industry. This would continue the trend of increasing recognition of female chefs in top industry honors.",
    "rationale": "The finalists for the 2025 Outstanding Chef award have already been announced according to the Eater article from the question background. Without access to the specific finalist list, I must work with uncertainty about the composition. Historically, the Outstanding Chef category has been male-dominated, though women have won in recent years (including Mashama Bailey in 2022). The typical finalist pool consists of 5 nominees. If there is at least one woman finalist, her baseline probability would depend on the total composition - if 1 of 5, approximately 20%; if 2 of 5, approximately 40%. However, historical patterns suggest women win less frequently than a pure random selection would predict. Recent industry trends show increasing recognition of female chefs, which provides some upward adjustment. The key uncertainty is the actual composition of finalists. If no women were nominated as finalists, the probability would be 0%. Given the increasing but still limited representation of women in this category, and assuming at least one woman finalist, I estimate the probability at 30%. This could be updated higher if: (1) the finalist list shows strong female representation, (2) there are reports of a female frontrunner, or (3) we learn more about judging preferences. It could be updated lower if: (1) no women are finalists, or (2) reporting suggests strong momentum for a male candidate.",
