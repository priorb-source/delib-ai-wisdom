    "review": "Forecaster 2 adds the explicit precedent of Samoa extending SOEs (e.g., during COVID), which I hadn’t foregrounded; that modestly increases the chance of a short continuation if conditions persist. Forecaster 3 introduces the expectation of temporary generators coming online by end-April, a credible off-ramp that would reduce the need to extend—this is a new concrete counterweight. Both emphasize the scheduled April 29 expiry and the need for affirmative government action to get to Yes, which aligns with my baseline. Overall, their arguments are balanced: extension precedent/severity vs. an imminent interim fix. I find both analyses reasonable; they largely offset each other.",
    "rationale": "Baseline remains No absent action. The severity of the energy crisis and the administrative ease/precedent for extensions create a meaningful chance of renewal that would cover April 30. However, the reported plan for temporary generators by end-April provides a plausible reason to let the SOE lapse on schedule. Given no public hints of extension as of April 21 but recognizing that extensions can be decided late, I keep a mid-30s probability. The new information (temporary generation timeline) pulls down slightly, while the extension precedent pulls up, leaving my prior essentially unchanged.",
