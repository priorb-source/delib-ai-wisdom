  "information": "In the first five months of 2025, three countries signed the Artemis Accords: Finland (January 23), Bangladesh (April 8), and Norway (May 15), bringing the total number of signatories to 55. This follows the signings of Panama and Austria in December 2024. In a statement on May 22, 2025, acting NASA Administrator Janet Petro said that NASA anticipates additional countries will sign the accords in the coming weeks and months.\n\nThe United Arab Emirates hosted an international Artemis Accords workshop in Abu Dhabi on May 21-22, 2025. Representatives from over 30 of the 55 signatory countries attended to discuss the implementation of the Accords' principles, including transparency, data sharing, and sustainability in space. In addition, the 2025 Humans to the Moon & Mars Summit (H2M2) was held in Washington, D.C., on May 28-29, bringing together leaders from government, industry, and international space agencies to discuss the future of human space exploration.\n\nAs of late May 2025, there have been no public announcements of a specific country planning to sign the Artemis Accords during the month of June. In a parallel development in international space exploration, China and Russia have announced a joint plan to build a nuclear reactor on the Moon by 2035 to power their International Lunar Research Station (ILRS). The ILRS project is positioned as a rival to the US-led Artemis program and has secured partnerships with 17 countries.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Approximately one month. The resolution period is from May 31, 2025, to July 1, 2025.",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No country signs the Artemis Accords in June 2025, and the number of signatories remains at 55.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "June 2025 passes without any official signing ceremonies. Any countries currently in discussions with the United States to join the Accords may have their internal review processes or diplomatic scheduling extend into July or later.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "At least one country's government completes its internal deliberations and formally signs the Artemis Accords at a ceremony or diplomatic event between June 1 and June 30, 2025, becoming the 56th (or higher) signatory.",
    "rationale": "My forecast is based on the recent and historical frequency of signings, combined with specific forward-looking statements from NASA leadership. \n\nThe historical signing rate since October 2020 has been approximately one country per month. The more recent rate in 2025 has been three countries in five months (Finland, Bangladesh, Norway), which supports a continued, steady pace of expansion. This base rate alone suggests a significant probability of a signing occurring in any given month.\n\nThe most influential piece of evidence is the May 22, 2025, statement from acting NASA Administrator Janet Petro, who stated that NASA anticipates more signatories in the 'coming weeks and months.' The specific mention of 'weeks' suggests imminent activity, making a signing in June highly plausible. This statement, coming just before the forecast period, carries significant weight. Recent diplomatic events, such as the Artemis Accords workshop in Abu Dhabi and the H2M2 Summit in Washington D.C., create momentum and provide venues for finalizing such agreements.\n\nMy forecast is not higher than 70% because there has been no public announcement or official confirmation of a specific country intending to sign in June. Diplomatic signings are subject to scheduling changes and unforeseen delays in internal governmental processes. The administrator's 'coming weeks' statement is encouraging but lacks the certainty of a scheduled event.\n\nMy forecast is not lower than 70% because the combination of a consistent historical signing rate and a direct, positive, and recent statement from the head of NASA creates a strong expectation of a near-term signing. Dismissing this evidence would be overly conservative. The momentum is clearly in favor of expansion.\n\nI would increase my forecast if a credible news report or a government source names a specific country planning a June signing. I would decrease it if the end of June approaches with no announcements, or if a U.S. official revises the timeline to 'later this summer' or 'in the coming months'.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill a country sign the Artemis Accords in June 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nThe most recent signatory was Bangladesh, on April 8, 2025 and [Norway](https://www.state.gov/united-states-welcomes-norways-signing-of-the-artemis-accords/) on May 15, 2025.

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
