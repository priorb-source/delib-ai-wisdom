    "review": "Both forecasters raise compelling points I had underweighted. Forecaster 3 correctly emphasizes that EUR/USD hasn't traded above 1.25 since 2018—a historical barrier I overlooked. Forecaster 2's anchor to Bank of America's year-end forecast of 1.05 EUR/USD is particularly sobering: if institutional forecasters see only 1.05 by December, they certainly aren't pricing >1.25 by July. Both note the ECB is potentially more dovish than the Fed, limiting EUR upside—a policy dynamic I insufficiently considered. Forecaster 3's point about seasonal May EUR/USD weakness (-0.62% average) directly works against the required move in the immediate weeks. Their framing of this as a 'multi-sigma move' in FX volatility terms is more precise than my general 'historically rare' characterization. However, both may be slightly underweighting the acute nature of current risks: the tariff uncertainty is immediate and specific rather than abstract, the USD is already at a 3-year low with momentum established, and Q1 GDP actually contracted—not just slowed. The real question is whether their greater anchoring on historical norms and institutional forecasts better captures the true probability than my focus on current acute risks.",
    "rationale": "I'm updating my forecast downward significantly. The historical evidence is compelling: EUR/USD hasn't breached 1.25 since 2018, suggesting this is a major technical and psychological barrier. The Bank of America year-end forecast of 1.05 provides a strong institutional anchor—if professionals project only 1.05 by December, the market isn't pricing a rapid move to 1.25 by July. The ECB's potential dovish bias relative to the Fed limits EUR strength, and seasonal May patterns work against the required appreciation. My original 22% overweighted current momentum without properly accounting for how rare such moves are in major currency pairs over 7-week windows. That said, I don't go as low as 7% because: (1) the USD is already at a 3-year low showing genuine weakness, (2) tariff risks are immediate and specific, not hypothetical, (3) Q1 GDP contracted, and (4) volatility is elevated. The current environment has more acute risks than typical periods. A probability around 13% better balances the strong historical/institutional arguments for this being a tail event against the real and present risks that distinguish this from business-as-usual. I would move higher on evidence of Fed emergency dovishness or severe US data deterioration; lower on trade de-escalation or EUR weakness.",
