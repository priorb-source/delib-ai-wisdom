    "review": "Both forecasters strengthen the case against a near-term announcement by highlighting the lack of visible campaign infrastructure and the political headwinds from Trump’s endorsement of Byron Donalds. The most material new point is Forecaster 2’s reference to a House probe into Hope Florida; if accurate, that timing would further discourage launching in June to avoid a scandal-dominated rollout. I agree with their emphasis on the status quo and the short runway (26 days). I’m less persuaded that the Q2 deadline alone justifies a 20% floor (as Forecaster 2 suggests); while a June filing could yield a strong Q2 report, the risks of launching into a negative news cycle and against a Trump-backed opponent may outweigh that incentive. Forecaster 3’s point about the absence of pre-launch signals is compelling, though I’d temper the “months of prep” argument because Casey DeSantis could leverage the existing DeSantis network to compress timelines quickly. Net, their arguments nudge me slightly downward, mainly due to the probe consideration, but not dramatically since a late-June surprise remains plausible.",
    "rationale": "Time remaining: 26 days. Baseline is No absent new signals. Factors reducing odds: (1) Trump’s endorsement of Byron Donalds and polling showing him ahead increase the cost of entry and make a quick launch less attractive. (2) No credible signs of imminent announcement (staffing, filings, scheduled events, media positioning). (3) If there is an active House probe into Hope Florida, that is a strong deterrent to a June launch given narrative risk. Factors preserving a non-trivial chance: (1) A pre–June 30 announcement could secure a Q2 fundraising splash and test viability; (2) Casey DeSantis’s name recognition and access to the DeSantis donor/staff network could allow for rapid mobilization; (3) Ron DeSantis has not endorsed, leaving some strategic room for a late pivot. Weighing these, I slightly reduce my estimate: the downside of launching this month appears to outweigh the benefits, and the absence of telltale pre-announcement signals late in the month would quickly push odds toward zero. I would update up on credible leaks of an imminent launch (venue hold, domain, staffing), formal committee activity, or strong donor signaling for June. I would update down on confirmation of the probe’s salience/timing, explicit discouraging signals from the DeSantis camp, or continued silence into late June.",
