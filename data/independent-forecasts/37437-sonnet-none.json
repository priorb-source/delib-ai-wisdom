    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Approximately 57 days remain until July 1, 2025",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No - China has not invaded Taiwan and the US has not made such an accusation",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "China does not launch a military invasion of Taiwan in the next 57 days. Tensions may continue in the Taiwan Strait through military exercises, air incursions, and diplomatic pressure, but no ground forces are sent to Taiwan without consent, and therefore no US accusation of invasion occurs.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "China launches a surprise military invasion of Taiwan, sending ground forces to the island without the consent of the Taiwanese government. The US government quickly and publicly accuses China of invasion, triggering a major international crisis.",
    "rationale": "This forecast requires an extremely low-probability, high-impact event to occur within a very compressed timeframe. A Chinese invasion of Taiwan involving ground forces would be one of the most consequential military actions in modern history, with massive global economic, political, and security implications. The research assistant provided no additional information suggesting any imminent invasion or unusual military activity. Several factors support a very low probability: (1) Historical base rate - despite decades of tension, China has not invaded Taiwan; (2) Short timeframe - only 57 days for such a momentous event to unfold; (3) Military logistics - a ground invasion would require significant, observable military buildup that would likely be detected by intelligence services; (4) Deterrence factors - high costs to China including potential US intervention, economic sanctions, and international isolation; (5) World changes slowly principle - dramatic shifts from status quo are rare. However, I cannot assign near-zero probability because: (1) Geopolitical situations can deteriorate rapidly; (2) Miscalculations or accidents could trigger unforeseen escalation; (3) There may be classified intelligence I'm unaware of; (4) Small but non-zero tail risks exist for major events. For me to update higher, I would need evidence of: significant Chinese military mobilization near Taiwan, intelligence reports of imminent action, or dramatic escalation in cross-strait incidents. For me to update lower, I would need clear diplomatic de-escalation or credible commitments against military action. Given the extremely short timeframe and lack of any current indicators of imminent invasion, my probability remains very low.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill the United States accuse the People's Republic of China of invading Taiwan before July 1, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nCFR: [Why China-Taiwan Relations Are So Tense](https://www.cfr.org/backgrounder/china-taiwan-relations-tension-us-policy-trump)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if, before July 1, 2025, the US government publicly accuses the People's Republic of China of invading Taiwan by sending its ground military forces into Taiwan without consent from the Taiwanese government in Taipei.\n\n\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nNo additional information available.\n\nToday is 2025-05-05.\n\nBefore answering you think:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n(e) You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
