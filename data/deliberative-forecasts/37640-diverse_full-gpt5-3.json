    "review": "Both forecasters emphasize the same core drivers I used: short timeline, bureaucratic/process frictions (GSA, FOIA/NARA), and historical precedent (2017 EPA climate pages redirected/archived rather than removed). I found their framing of the path-of-least-resistance argument and the explicit separation between ending the program vs. decommissioning the domain convincing. Neither introduced concrete evidence of an expedited takedown pathway. One thing not explicitly addressed is the resolution-source nuance: IsItDownRightNow typically considers a domain “up” if it can connect and load a page, so redirects or static placeholders likely still resolve as UP. Conversely, an atypical 403/410 or misconfiguration could cause a false “down” reading at the moment Metaculus checks, which is a small tail risk. Overall, their analyses reinforce a high-Yes baseline.",
    "rationale": "Key points remain: (1) ~6–7 weeks is very short for a compliant .gov domain decommission with archiving and GSA coordination; (2) legal and records obligations make a static archive or redirect the most probable near-term outcome; (3) precedent from 2017 suggests content can change quickly, but full domain shutdowns are rare and slow; (4) the resolution will count a redirect/placeholder as UP. The main risk to a Yes is an unusual, high-priority political directive that forces a DNS or hosting shutdown before archival is ready, or a transient outage or configuration that makes the site appear down when checked. Given no evidence of such an expedited plan and strong inertia to keep at least a placeholder online, I slightly nudge my forecast up to reflect the convergence with other forecasters and the tight timeline. Up from 89% to 90%.",
