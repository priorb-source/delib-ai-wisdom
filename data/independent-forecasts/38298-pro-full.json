  "information": "According to NOAA data cited in reports, the warmest May on record was in 2020 with a temperature anomaly of +0.95°C versus the 1901-2000 mean, followed by 2016 at +0.93°C. For the current year, preliminary data showed January 2025 was the hottest January on record, March 2025 ranked first or tied for first, and April 2025 ranked as the second warmest. The first three months of 2025 were the second-warmest first quarter recorded. The strong El Niño event that persisted from May 2023 to April 2024 has transitioned to a neutral ENSO (El Niño–Southern Oscillation) state.\n\nSeveral regional weather events were reported globally during May 2025. In Ahmedabad, India, the month was one of the coolest in recent years, with an average maximum temperature 3.3 degrees Celsius below normal due to record rainfall. In contrast, Europe experienced several heat events. On May 1, the UK recorded its warmest start to May on record with temperatures reaching 28°C. Scotland saw its hottest day of the year so far on May 13, reaching 25.4°C. On May 30, a heatwave in Brittany, France broke local heat records for May, reaching 31.1°C in La Noë-Blanche. In the United States, International Falls, Minnesota, recorded temperatures around +32°C in early May.\n\nThe U.S. National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's (NOAA) Climate Prediction Center released an outlook stating that the summer of 2025 was expected to be 'overwhelmingly above normal' across the United States. The forecast indicated that nearly all states were favored to see a warmer-than-average summer, with the highest probabilities for extreme heat in the West and Southwest. The outlook also noted an increased risk of drought and wildfires. Separately, Roman Vilfand, the scientific director of the Russian Hydrometeorological Center, stated that preliminary forecasts suggested 2025 could rank among the top three or five hottest years on record.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Approximately 2 weeks. NOAA typically releases its monthly global climate report around the middle of the following month, so the report for May 2025 should be available in mid-June 2025.",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No. The baseline expectation is for any given month to be among the top 5 warmest due to the powerful long-term warming trend. However, breaking the absolute record (status quo: May 2020) requires an exceptional confluence of warming factors, which is not a guaranteed outcome without the peak influence of a strong El Niño event.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "The global average temperature for May 2025 is exceptionally high, likely ranking in the top 3, but it falls just short of the +0.95°C anomaly record set in May 2020. Cooler-than-average conditions in a few significant regions, such as parts of the Southern Ocean or Asia (as hinted by the report from India), are enough to offset the regional heatwaves in Europe and North America, preventing a new record.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "The powerful underlying warming trend, combined with record-high ocean heat content, continues the momentum from early 2025. The widespread heat, evidenced by heatwaves in Europe and North America, proves to be a globally dominant pattern. This pushes the global land and ocean temperature anomaly just above the +0.95°C mark set in May 2020, establishing a new record.",
    "rationale": "My forecast is based on the strong evidence of an ongoing, record-setting temperature trend in early 2025, balanced against the waning influence of the recent El Niño. \n\nThe primary factor supporting a 'Yes' outcome is the powerful momentum of record heat. The research indicates January 2025 was the hottest on record, March 2025 was number one or tied, and April 2025 was the second warmest. This demonstrates that the climate system is operating at or near record levels, making a record May entirely plausible. The long-term warming trend provides a constantly rising baseline, and forecasts for a very hot summer in the US and a top-5 year globally support this continued warmth. \n\nHowever, there are compelling reasons for caution, which is why my forecast is not higher. The strong El Niño, a key driver of recent global heat records, ended in April 2024. While its effects lag, its peak warming influence on the atmosphere would likely have been in late 2024 or early 2025. By May 2025, this additional boost may have faded. The fact that April 2025 was 'only' the second warmest could indicate this transition. Furthermore, the record from May 2020 is a high benchmark to surpass. The report of regional cooling in India demonstrates that heat is not globally uniform, and such areas can pull the global average down just enough to miss a record.\n\nMy probability is not lower because the momentum from a record-hot start to the year is a very strong signal. The fundamental driver - anthropogenic warming and record ocean heat content - remains, making another record month more likely than not. \n\nI would increase my forecast if preliminary data from other global agencies (like Copernicus) pointed towards a record May. I would decrease my forecast if there were official reports of a rapidly developing La Niña event in the Pacific, which would exert a global cooling effect.",
