    "review": "Both forecasters make strong points about structural advantages for the Bloc and the steep 22-seat gap from 2021. They rightly emphasize the Bloc’s vote efficiency in francophone ridings and the CPC’s concentration around Quebec City. They also note organizational hiccups for the CPC locally. However, their confidence (82–85%) may overstate how “historic” a CPC performance would need to be, because a Bloc decline—possibly due to a Liberal resurgence—could let the CPC surpass the Bloc with only a modest seat gain if the Bloc’s seat count falls into the low teens. They didn’t bring new hard data (province-specific polling, francophone splits, credible riding models) beyond what I had considered, but they did sharpen the structural argument for the Bloc’s advantage.",
    "rationale": "Baseline and structure still favor the Bloc finishing ahead: their support remains efficiently distributed in francophone regions, and CPC breakthroughs beyond the Quebec City/Chaudière-Appalaches corridor remain challenging under FPTP without a clear, sustained francophone swing. The risk to this view is not primarily a CPC sweep but a Bloc slump if a Liberal leadership change catalyzes a federalist consolidation and peels away Bloc seats in suburban/exurban areas—creating a path where CPC > Bloc even with CPC only in the mid-teens. I don’t see enough evidence to price that scenario as likely, but it keeps me from the 80%+ range. Given the peers’ emphasis on the structural barriers and the still-large starting gap, I’m nudging up modestly from my prior to reflect that the Bloc’s edge is probably a bit more robust than I had marked, absent clear francophone polling showing a CPC lead or a visible Bloc collapse.",
