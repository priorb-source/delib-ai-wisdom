    "rationale": "- Baseline and timing: The publication window is narrow (June 10–30, 2025). With no prior NYT usage evident and only ~3 weeks for it to appear, the status quo strongly favors No.\n- Term specificity: While Chinese media are promoting the concept, NYT often chooses its own translations (e.g., “lying flat,” “involution” caught on because they were widely used). “Reverse purchasing” is not yet a widely established English term; NYT could instead write “reverse consumption,” which would not count per the resolution criteria.\n- Alternative domains: The fallback chance that “reverse purchase” appears in a finance/legal context is low. Finance coverage uses “reverse repurchase (repo),” not “reverse purchase,” and other domains rarely use the exact phrase.\n- Catalysts: The 6/18 (618) shopping festival could spur coverage of Chinese consumption trends, marginally raising the chance NYT cites or quotes the exact term. Still, absent a strong hook or widespread English usage, probability remains low.\n- Assistant report: No additional information available; thus no evidence of brewing NYT usage.\n- Why not higher: The rarity of the exact phrasing and short window. Why not lower: Some non-zero chance via a trend piece quoting Chinese state media or a newsletter/blog entry using the phrase in quotation marks during 6/18-related coverage.\n- What would move me upward: Pre-window sightings of the phrase in Western outlets; Chinese trend pieces in NYT previewing 6/18 that already use or allude to this specific English phrasing; AP/Reuters using the term and being picked up by NYT. What would move me downward: Evidence that NYT has standardized on “reverse consumption” or related alternatives; lack of any China retail/consumer trend coverage in mid-June.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill the New York Times mention \"reverse purchasing\" before July 1, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nPeople's Daily: [“Reverse purchasing” reflects the vitality of the Chinese market](http://finance.people.com.cn/n1/2025/0430/c1004-40471159.html)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if the NY Times mentions \"reverse purchasing\" in any of its content items as found through [this search](https://www.nytimes.com/search?dropmab=false&lang=en&query=%22reverse%20purchasing%22&sort=best), dated after June 9, 2025 and before July 1, 2025. This question will also count \"reverse purchase,\" which can be found through [this link](https://www.nytimes.com/search?dropmab=false&lang=en&query=%22reverse%20purchase%22&sort=best).\n\n\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nNo additional information available.\n\nToday is 2025-06-05.\n\nBefore answering you think:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n(e) You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
