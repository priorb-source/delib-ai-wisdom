    "review": "Both forecasters sharpened the downside case by emphasizing April’s timing (tariffs on Apr 2), PMI contraction, and retaliation. They also argue March strength may reflect front-loading. The most compelling new point is the possibility of an unusually large, rapid goods-export drop driven by policy shock. However, parts of their case seem overstated or misapplied: (1) “China–US bookings down 45% YoY” likely refers to China-to-US container flows (imports), not US exports to China; even for exports, much of the US-to-Asia flow in key categories (energy, ag, bulk) isn’t captured by container bookings. (2) March’s “front-loading” primarily explains imports, and March goods exports only rose $2.2B—hardly evidence of a one-off surge to unwind. (3) Tariffs were on US imports; retaliation on US exports may roll out unevenly and with lags. Both analyses reasonably note that services are steadier and more tariff-resistant, but they don’t fully grapple with the size of the drop required to miss the threshold given typical services stability. I agree with their general caution but find their use of shipping data and the import front-loading narrative less convincing as direct predictors of April exports.",
    "rationale": "Threshold: $262.578B (April 2024). Recent levels imply a cushion. February 2025 total exports were $278.5B. March 2025 goods exports were $180.8B; with services typically near $95–100B, March total likely ~275–282B. To fall below the threshold in April, total would need to drop ~6–7% from Feb/March levels. With services relatively stable, that implies goods would need to fall roughly $16–20B from March (to ~160–165B), a ~9–11% MoM drop—large for a single month absent a direct, broad-based hit to exports.\n\nDrivers: (1) Direct US tariffs target imports, so the immediate mechanical effect is not on exports. (2) Retaliation can hit exports but often with lags and uneven coverage; some contracts ship regardless in early weeks. (3) Services exports are comparatively stable and sizable (~$95–100B), supporting the total. (4) Goods-export volatility can come from energy prices/volumes, ag, and lumpy capital goods (e.g., aircraft). A compounded shock across these could create a >$16–20B goods drop, but that’s a high bar in one month. (5) The cited 45% YoY “China–US bookings” likely reflects inbound container traffic and is not a clean read on US export values; many US export categories use bulk/tanker shipping rather than containers.\n\nNet: I still expect April exports to clear the April 2024 level, but I acknowledge higher tail risk than in my initial take: faster-than-typical retaliation on key US exports, a soft patch in capital goods shipments, and unfavorable energy/ag values could combine to produce an unusually large MoM decline. I edge my probability down modestly to reflect that compounded-risk scenario without overweighting indicators that mainly speak to imports.\n",
