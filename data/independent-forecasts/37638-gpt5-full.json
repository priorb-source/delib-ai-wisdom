  "information": "The Texas Senate passed Senate Bill 3 (SB 3), which aims to ban nearly all forms of THC outside the state's limited medical marijuana program. The bill, authored by Senator Charles Perry and supported by Lieutenant Governor Dan Patrick, passed the Senate on May 7, 2025, with a 25-6 vote and was sent to the House State Affairs Committee. Proponents cite concerns over public health and safety regarding unregulated high-THC products. Lt. Gov. Patrick has stated he will push for a special legislative session if a ban is not passed during the regular session. The proposed law would make possession of consumable hemp products punishable by up to one year in jail and a $4,000 fine.\n\nThe Texas House of Representatives has shown resistance to a full THC ban, instead advancing measures to expand medical cannabis access. House Bill 46 (HB 46), which broadens the state's Compassionate Use Program, was approved by the House with a vote of 118-16. This bill expands the list of qualifying medical conditions, increases the number of licensed dispensaries to 11, and gives military veterans special access to low-dose THC treatments. Furthermore, a House committee adopted a substitute version of the Senate's SB 3 that is not a full ban, but would allow certain low-THC beverages and tinctures while prohibiting vapes and synthetics. The Texas hemp industry, estimated to be worth $8 billion, and Agriculture Commissioner Sid Miller have expressed concerns that a total ban would shutter thousands of businesses.\n\nThe Texas Legislature's regular session is scheduled to end on May 26, 2025, leaving a narrow window for new legislation to pass through all required procedural steps in both chambers and be signed by the governor. While Lieutenant Governor Dan Patrick has threatened to force a special session, only Governor Greg Abbott can officially call one and set its agenda. As of mid-May, Governor Abbott's stated public priorities for the session did not include a THC ban. Public opinion appears to favor more access; a University of Houston survey found that 62% of Texans support marijuana legalization and 79% support a comprehensive medical marijuana program. Veterans' groups have also testified in opposition to a ban, citing THC products as an alternative to opioids.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "About 48 days (until July 1, 2025)",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "SB 3 stalls or is watered down in the Texas House (e.g., allowing some low-THC products) and no full ban passes before sine die; or Abbott does not call a special session on THC before July 1; or a bill passes but either is not a full ban (e.g., exempts the medical program) or is not signed by the governor before July 1.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Against current trends, the House advances and passes a version that fully prohibits all THC sales in Texas (including eliminating sales under the medical program), the Senate concurs, and Governor Abbott signs it before July 1; alternatively, Abbott calls an immediate special session narrowly focused on a total THC sales ban, both chambers pass it, and Abbott signs before July 1.",
    "rationale": "- Time and process: The regular session ends May 26, leaving very little time for the House to move SB 3 through committee, Calendars, two floor readings, conference or concurrence, and then obtain the governor’s signature by June 16 (post-adjournment signing deadline). A special session before July 1 is possible but requires Governor Abbott to call it and include a full THC ban on the call.\n- Chamber positions: The Senate passed SB 3 (25–6) with support from Lt. Gov. Dan Patrick. The House has been notably more permissive, passing HB 46 (118–16) to expand the Compassionate Use Program and adopting a substitute to SB 3 that is not a full ban (it would allow some low-THC beverages/tinctures while prohibiting vapes/synthetics). This signals strong, bipartisan House resistance to a total ban.\n- Definition threshold: The resolution requires a law that fully prohibits the sale of THC within Texas. The Senate’s approach targets intoxicating hemp/THC products outside the medical program; that would not satisfy a “full ban” if any THC sales (e.g., under the medical program) remain legal. This makes the bar significantly higher than current Senate goals.\n- Executive dynamics: Lt. Gov. Patrick has threatened to push for a special session, but only Governor Abbott can call one and set the agenda. Abbott’s stated priorities so far have not included a THC ban, and Agriculture Commissioner Sid Miller and a sizable hemp industry oppose a total ban. Abbott would also need to sign the bill for this question to resolve Yes (per the rule that it resolves upon signing), further narrowing the path.\n- Public and stakeholder pressure: Polling shows broad support for legalization/expanded medical access, and veterans’ groups testified against bans. The Texas hemp sector (estimated at $8B) and GOP Agriculture Commissioner oppose a total ban, increasing House resistance.\nWhy not higher: Tight calendar, House opposition, strong pro-medical votes, economic and political blowback, and the requirement of a truly total ban plus a gubernatorial signature make the path very unlikely.\nWhy not lower: The Senate has already passed a crackdown bill; Lt. Gov. Patrick is invested; end-of-session horse-trading can move fast; Abbott could, in principle, call a rapid special session and sign a bill before July 1 if political conditions change (e.g., a salient public-safety incident tied to THC products).\nWhat would move me up: Abbott publicly adding a full THC sales ban to a special session call; House leadership signaling support for a total ban; SB 3 (or equivalent) placed on a House Major State calendar without carve-outs; indications that the medical program would be curtailed or eliminated; Abbott explicitly committing to sign a total ban.\nWhat would move me down: House State Affairs or Calendars fails to advance SB 3; House passes only a partial ban; Abbott rules out a special session on THC or signals opposition to a total ban; the session ends with no movement and no immediate special session call.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill the state of Texas ban THC before July 1, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nBeaumont Enterprise: [Will THC see its final death blow in Texas this session?](https://www.beaumontenterprise.com/news/article/texas-senate-bill-aims-ban-thc-activists-call-20279801.php)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if before July 1, 2025, Texas enacts a law prohibiting the sale of THC. If no new prohibitions on the sale of THC become law in Texas before that date, this question resolves as No.\n\nFor it to count, a law must fully prohibit the sale of THC within the state. This question resolves upon a ban being signed into law, rather than when it is implemented. An enacted law being later overturned will not cause the question to re-resolve. Partial bans (for example laws prohibiting the sale of THC to persons under 21 years of age) will not count. This question pertains to the sale of THC within the state, not to the purchase of it by individuals.\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nThe Texas Senate passed Senate Bill 3 (SB 3), which aims to ban nearly all forms of THC outside the state's limited medical marijuana program.
