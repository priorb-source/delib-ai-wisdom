  "information": "As of mid-May 2025, New York Yankees player Aaron Judge's batting average was reported at various points between .402 and .423. On May 17, after a 2-for-4 game, his average reached .414, though a subsequent 0-for-5 game lowered it. By May 18, Judge had accumulated 15 home runs and 41 RBI for the season, leading the league in several offensive categories. An analysis by MLB.com noted that achieving a .414 batting average with over 15 home runs within a team's first 44 games is a rare historical feat, with parallels to seasons by Mickey Mantle in 1956 and Manny Ramirez in 2001.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "13 days",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Aaron Judge, the primary candidate, experiences a natural regression to the mean. A few average or poor games over the final 13 days of May cause his batting average to dip below the .400 mark by the resolution date, and no other player gets hot enough to reach that threshold.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Aaron Judge continues his historically exceptional performance for another two weeks. He avoids any major slumps and strings together enough multi-hit games to maintain a batting average at or above .400 on the morning of June 1, 2025.",
    "rationale": "My forecast is primarily based on the strong statistical principle of regression to the mean. The research shows that as of mid-May 2025, Aaron Judge has a batting average over .400 (e.g., .414 on May 17), a rare accomplishment for this point in the season. While this makes a 'Yes' outcome plausible, maintaining such a high average is historically difficult. The 'tyranny of the denominator' in batting averages means that as the season progresses, it becomes harder to maintain an outlier figure. Even over a short 13-day period, a few hitless games can significantly lower an average, as evidenced by a recent 0-for-5 performance mentioned in the report.\n\nMy probability is not higher than 35% because historical precedent and statistical likelihood weigh heavily against any player maintaining a .400 average. Judge is performing far above his career norms, and it is statistically more likely that his performance will cool down and regress toward his baseline, even if that baseline remains exceptional. Pitchers will also continue to adjust their strategies against him.\n\nHowever, the probability is not lower because Judge is currently exceeding the .400 threshold, giving him a small cushion. The remaining timeframe is short—roughly 12-13 games—which increases the chance that a hot streak can be sustained compared to a longer period. He doesn't need to get hot to reach .400; he just needs to stay hot to maintain it.\n\nI would increase my forecast if Judge posts several multi-hit games in the coming week, expanding his cushion above .400. Conversely, I would decrease my forecast significantly if he has another 0-for-4 or 0-for-5 game in the near future or sustains any minor injury.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill any major league baseball player have a .400 batting average on June 1, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\ntheScore: [How long can Judge's .400 batting average last?](https://www.thescore.com/mlb/news/3284701/how-long-can-judges-400-batting-average-last)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below.

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
