    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "About 1–3 weeks (the G7 leaders’ summit is mid-to-late June 2025)",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No — Modi does not attend in person.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Canada does not extend an outreach invitation to India (or does so too late), given strained Canada–India relations; alternatively, India declines or participates only virtually/sends a representative, which would not count as in-person attendance.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Canada issues a late outreach invitation and India accepts; a rapid logistical turnaround allows Modi to travel to Canada and join at least the outreach segment of the summit in person.",
    "rationale": "- Evidence and base rates: India has often been invited to recent G7 summits as an outreach partner and Modi has attended several. However, invitations are at the host’s discretion, and Canada–India relations have been notably strained since 2023. \n- Current signal: As of June 3, reporting indicates Canada has already invited some non-G7 participants (e.g., Australia, Ukraine) but there was “no call for India yet.” With the summit only weeks away, the lack of a public invite is a strong negative indicator given security/logistics lead times usually required for a PM-level visit. \n- Status quo weighting: The world changes slowly; the status quo is that India has not been invited. Barring new information, the most likely outcome is that Modi does not attend. \n- Why not higher: Time is very short, logistics are complex, and bilateral tensions make an invitation less likely than in other G7 host years. \n- Why not lower: Great-power stakeholders (e.g., the U.S., Japan) could lobby for India’s inclusion; a last-minute political decision or a modest thaw could still produce an outreach invite that India would likely accept given its strategic interest in G7 engagement. \n- What would change my view: (1) An official Canadian announcement listing invitees (especially including India) or credible leaks to that effect — would raise the probability sharply. (2) Indian MEA travel advisories or media reports on Modi’s prospective travel — would raise it. (3) Conversely, a finalized agenda without India in the outreach list or explicit statements that India was not invited — would drive the probability toward zero. \n- Research assistant summary: No additional information was provided, so the forecast leans on public patterns, host discretion, and timing/logistical considerations.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill India's PM Narendra Modi attend the G7 Summit in June 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nTimes of India: [Canada invites Australia, Ukraine for G7 meet but no call for India yet](https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/canada-invites-australia-ukraine-for-g7-meet-but-no-call-for-india-yet/articleshow/121398906.cms)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi attends in person a G7 summit held in June 2025.\n\n\"In person\" is defined as occupying the same physical space closely enough at the G7 Summit that he can see and hear other heads of state through direct un-intermediated exchange of photons and sound waves.\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nNo additional information available.\n\nToday is 2025-06-03.\n\nBefore answering you think:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n(e) You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
