    "review": "Forecaster 2/3 strengthened the short-horizon continuity case. New to me were (a) the DV-2026 status-check window running into 2026, implying ongoing program operations and routine updates right now, and (b) the emphasis on travel.state.gov URL stability absent a planned redesign. Both sharpen the argument that policy or site upheaval by July 1 is unlikely. I also agree with their focus on the strict URL criterion as the main non-policy risk (unannounced slug change without a working redirect) and the small chance of a timely outage. I’m slightly less concerned than Forecaster 2 about a one-off outage because resolution allows “on or after July 1,” but we can’t assume multiple attempts. Overall, their reasoning is convincing and nudges me upward.",
    "rationale": "- Status quo inertia: The DV program remains statutory and mid-cycle; State typically keeps the “Submit an Entry” instruction page live year-round with an “entry closed” notice outside Oct–Nov. Short runway (~6 weeks) favors continuity. \n- Policy pathway: Even with an administration hostile to DV and a House bill introduced in April to end it, clearing both chambers, enacting, and operationalizing changes that would justify removing this specific page by July 1 is unlikely. Historically, even hostile periods kept DV pages accessible. The DEI-related web EOs are orthogonal to DV. \n- Primary risks: (1) Technical/IA change that alters or retires this exact URL without a functioning redirect; (2) transient outage at the moment Metaculus attempts access; (3) an unusually rapid legislative/administrative move directing immediate removal of DV entry instructions. \n- Why not higher: The resolution requires the page “at this location.” A quiet CMS migration or consolidation could break the slug. We also can’t rule out a one-time access failure on or just after July 1. \n- Net effect of peer input: Their points about ongoing DV-2026 operations and typical URL stability over short periods reduce my earlier policy-risk weight. I’m raising my probability modestly to reflect stronger near-term continuity and low odds of disruptive change before July 1.",
