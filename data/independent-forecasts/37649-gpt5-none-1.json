    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "About 46 days (until July 1, 2025)",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Starlink’s map keeps Chad as “Coming Soon” through June due to administrative delays (type approval/import rules), distribution not yet in place, or a slow map-update cadence. Political or regulatory caution in Chad leads to slippage despite the November 2024 license.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "SpaceX flips service on in Chad and updates the availability map in late May or June, even if only for part of the country via inter-satellite backhaul, with or without a fully built local reseller network.",
    "rationale": "- Recap and timing: Chad reportedly granted Starlink a license in Nov 2024. We’re now ~6.5 weeks from the July 1, 2025 cutoff. In many markets, Starlink turns “Available” within months of licensing, especially since laser inter-satellite links reduce dependence on local ground stations. That supports a non-trivial chance of a swift activation.\n- Base rates and momentum: Over 2023–2025 Starlink has expanded aggressively across Africa once licensed. Several countries moved from license to availability within 3–9 months. Seven-plus months from license (Nov 2024 → late June 2025) is consistent with that pattern.\n- Frictions specific to Chad: Chad is a lower-income, tightly regulated market that has imposed internet restrictions historically. Even with a license, terminal approvals, customs, and distribution can lag. SpaceX sometimes shows “Coming Soon (Year)” for months after regulatory clearance. Map updates may also occur in batches, which could push past June.\n- Status quo weighting: With only ~46 days left, and absent concrete evidence of activation, the conservative default is that the map remains unchanged through June. This pulls the forecast down from a higher base-rate estimate.\n- Why not higher: Uncertainties around local approvals/logistics, potential political/regulatory caution, and the short remaining window for a map update.\n- Why not lower: A license already exists; Starlink can activate without local ground stations; the company’s recent pace of African activations is strong, and flipping even one area of Chad to “Available” would satisfy the criterion.\n- What would move me up: Any official Starlink update listing Chad as available/accepting orders, local reseller announcements, or credible reports of successful activations/terminal shipments. Evidence that the map has been updating weekly would also raise odds.\n- What would move me down: Reports of regulatory reversals, import holds on terminals, official statements delaying rollout to late 2025, or sustained lack of Africa-related map changes through early/mid-June.\n- Research assistant info: None beyond the licensing article; no contradictory signals identified.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill Starlink's website show Chad as a country with Starlink availability before July 1, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\n[SpaceX’s Starlink Secures License to Operate in Chad](https://spaceinafrica.com/2024/11/12/spacexs-starlink-secures-license-to-operate-in-chad/)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if, before July 1, 2025, the [Starlink Availability Map](https://www.starlink.com/us/map) has anywhere in Chad listed as \"Available.\"\n\n\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nNo additional information available.\n\nToday is 2025-05-15.\n\nBefore answering you think:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n(e) You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
