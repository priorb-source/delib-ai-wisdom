    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Approximately 46 days until July 1, 2025",
    "status_quo_outcome": "The tracker will likely show fewer than 120 objectives marked as Done, as comprehensive policy implementation typically requires more time than the roughly 5.5 months since the administration began",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "The Trump administration faces legal challenges, Congressional opposition, or bureaucratic delays in implementing Project 2025's agenda. The tracker maintains strict criteria for marking objectives as Done, requiring full implementation rather than just initial executive actions. By July 1, only 80-115 objectives are classified as Done, reflecting the realistic pace of policy change even under an aggressive administration",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "The administration moves extremely aggressively using executive orders and regulatory changes. The tracker counts objectives as Done even when only partially implemented or when executive actions are signed (even if not yet effective). Many objectives involve simple reversals of previous policies that can be accomplished quickly. By July 1, the rapid pace of executive actions and a generous interpretation of Done status results in 120+ objectives being classified",
    "rationale": "This forecast faces significant uncertainty due to lack of current data on the tracker's status. Key considerations: (1) Project 2025 contains hundreds of policy recommendations across government; (2) The Trump administration began January 20, 2025, giving only ~5.5 months by July 1; (3) Achieving 120 Done objectives would require roughly 22 completions per month; (4) Policy implementation typically involves procedural requirements, potential legal challenges, and bureaucratic processes that take time; (5) The criteria for Done status is unknown - strict criteria would make 120 harder to achieve. The Trump administration has shown willingness to act quickly via executive orders, which could accelerate completion rates. However, many meaningful policy changes require months or years to fully implement. Without current baseline data, I'm assigning moderate-low probability, assuming status quo forecasting principles where dramatic change in short periods is less likely. My forecast would increase if: current Done count is already 80+, the tracker uses loose Done criteria, or evidence emerges of exceptionally rapid implementation. It would decrease if: current count is low (<50), legal challenges are mounting, or the tracker shows evidence of strict completion criteria",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill the Project 2025 Tracker classify at least 120 objectives as \"Done\" on July 1, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nThe 2025 Tracker is a project of the Keep_Track subreddit and is explained [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/Keep_Track/comments/1ii7tbr/project_2025_tracker_is_now_live/).\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if the [Project 2025 Tracker](https://www.project2025.observer/) has ≥120 Objectives classified as Done when accessed by Metaculus on or after July 1, 2025. If it is less than 120, this resolves as **No**.\n\n\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nNo additional information available.\n\nToday is 2025-05-16.\n\nBefore answering you think:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n(e) You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
