  "information": "The environment for technology IPOs in 2025 is described with mixed signals. Some reports mention a favorable IPO window, noting that other tech firms like CoreWeave, Klarna, and Figma have recently filed to go public. Other reports highlight market volatility, pointing to a recent 7-8.7% drop in the tech-heavy Nasdaq index and uncertainty surrounding Fed rate and trade policies as potential headwinds for companies considering a public launch.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "About 39 days (deadline: July 1, 2025)",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No — unless Discord publicly files an S-1 or posts a specific IPO-plan announcement on its news page before the deadline, the question resolves No.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Discord continues IPO prep privately (potentially via a confidential S-1) but holds off on a public filing or specific news-post announcement until later in Q3/Q4 due to market volatility and timing considerations; thus no qualifying announcement by June 30.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Discord makes the plan explicit before July 1 by either publicly filing an S-1 in June or posting on its news page that it intends to go public in 2025 (including an announcement of a confidential S-1 submission).",
    "rationale": "Status quo favors No: as of now, the criteria have not been met, and with only ~5.5 weeks left, the default is that nothing changes. That said, credible reports (e.g., bank mandates with J.P. Morgan and Goldman Sachs) suggest Discord is actively preparing for a 2025 IPO. The research assistant notes a mixed 2025 IPO environment: some peers reportedly filing or advancing (CoreWeave, Klarna, Figma), implying a viable window, but also recent Nasdaq weakness and policy uncertainty, which can push companies to delay public filings. Mechanically, many companies aiming for a fall listing publicly file S-1s in late summer; a late-June public S-1 to target an early fall IPO is plausible but not necessary, and firms often keep optionality via confidential submissions without a public reveal. Because the resolution requires either a public S-1 or a specific news-post announcement, mere media reports or bank mandates won’t count. Why not higher: short runway, market chop, and typical timing patterns make a late-June public S-1 less likely than not. Why not lower: concrete signs of 2025 intent and a warming (if uneven) tech IPO pipeline create a real chance of a June move or a “we’ve confidentially submitted” news post that would satisfy the criteria. Upward updates: credible reports of an imminent S-1, observed hiring/IR moves, banker roadshow chatter, or a sharp tech-market rebound. Downward updates: further market selloff, negative company-specific news, or signals of a delay to 2026.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nBefore July 1, 2025, will Discord announce that it is planning an IPO?\n\nQuestion background:\nArs Technica: [Discord is planning an IPO this year, and big changes could be on the horizon](https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2025/03/report-discord-partners-with-jp-morgan-chase-goldman-sachs-for-a-2025-ipo/)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question will resolve as **Yes** if Discord, Inc., announces before July 1, 2025, that it is planning an initial public offering. In order to streamline the resolution of this question, there are two resolution sources for the IPO announcement: 1) The company filing an [SEC Form S-1](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/sec-form-s-1.asp) or 2) An announcement at the [news](https://discord.com/blog) section of its website. If there is no such announcement before that date, this question resolves as **No**.\n\nPlease note that for an announcement on the news section of the company's website to resolve the question as Yes, the announcement must be specific. Vague statements such as \"someday becoming a public company\" will not count. If there is any doubt, then greater weight will be placed on whether an S-1 has been filed.\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nThe environment for technology IPOs in 2025 is described with mixed signals. Some reports mention a favorable IPO window, noting that other tech firms like CoreWeave, Klarna, and Figma have recently filed to go public.

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
