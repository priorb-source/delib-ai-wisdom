  "information": "According to multiple polls from early 2025, Reform UK's support has grown significantly. A YouGov poll in early February showed Reform UK taking the lead over Labour for the first time, with 25% of the vote compared to Labour's 24% and the Conservatives' 21%. It found that one in four Conservative voters from the July 2024 election would now vote for Reform. Later polls from late April by sources like YouGov and More in Common showed Reform UK and Labour tied at 25%, or Reform slightly ahead at 26%. Polling expert Sir John Curtice noted the unprecedented unpopularity of both Labour (24% average rating) and the Conservatives (22%), with Reform narrowly ahead at 25%. A poll by Find Out Now in late January also placed Reform UK in the lead with 26% of the vote, ahead of the Conservatives at 23% and Labour at 22%. By contrast, the Politico poll-of-polls, the resolution source for the question, was reported in one analysis as showing Reform UK at 14.1%, significantly behind Labour (33.7%) and the Conservatives (23.7%).\n\nOn May 1, 2025, local elections are scheduled to take place in England, representing the first major electoral test since the Labour party's landslide victory in the July 2024 general election. Voters will elect over 1,600 councillors and mayors across 23 local authorities. In conjunction with these elections, a UK parliamentary by-election is being held in Runcorn and Helsby. Opinion polls for the by-election in early April indicated a lead for Reform UK, with 28% support, putting them 6 points ahead of Labour (22%) and 8 points ahead of the Conservatives (20%). It was also reported that up to 60 council candidates had defected from the Conservative party to run for Reform UK in the May elections.\n\nRecent reports indicate a significant shift in the British political landscape. Patrick English, director of political analytics at YouGov, described the emergence of 'five party politics,' observing that both Labour and Conservative support levels are declining while support for Reform UK, the Liberal Democrats, and the Green Party is rising. A poll by More In Common found that 41% of voters lack faith in any of the main party leaders, and an Ipsos poll from March 2025 found that 36% of British adults were considering voting for Reform UK. Public sentiment is reportedly characterized by disillusionment with the traditional parties, with key voter issues including immigration, local infrastructure like potholes, and economic concerns. Polling data shows only 60% of those who voted for Labour in the July 2024 election would do so again.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "2 months",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No. Based on the provided data for the Politico poll-of-polls, Reform UK is in third place at 14.1%, significantly behind Labour at 33.7%. If this trend continues without a major disruption, they will not achieve a 4-point lead over the first-place party.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Reform UK performs well in the May 1st local elections, causing their polling numbers to rise in the Politico aggregate. However, the surge is not dramatic enough to close the nearly 20-point gap with Labour and build an additional 4-point lead on top of that. The inertia of the poll-of-polls, which averages multiple sources over time, prevents such a rapid shift, and by July 1, Reform remains in second or third place.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Reform UK achieves a landmark victory in the May 1st local elections and wins the Runcorn and Helsby by-election. This creates a political earthquake, triggering a collapse in support for the unpopular Labour government. A series of subsequent polls throughout May and June show a massive and sustained surge for Reform, which is quickly reflected in the Politico poll-of-polls, pushing them above 30% while Labour falls to the mid-20s, thus meeting the resolution criteria.",
    "rationale": "My forecast is based on the significant discrepancy between individual polls and the specific resolution source, the Politico poll-of-polls. While numerous individual polls show Reform UK with strong momentum, even leading Labour and the Conservatives, the Politico aggregate shows them far behind in third place (14.1% vs Labour's 33.7%). Poll aggregates are designed to be less volatile and slower to react than individual surveys. For this question to resolve 'Yes,' a monumental and rapid shift of over 20 percentage points in this aggregate must occur within the next two months. The primary catalyst for such a shift would be a spectacular, narrative-defining performance in today's local elections. A decisive victory could create a feedback loop, driving more voters to Reform and forcing the poll-of-polls to rapidly catch up. However, the high bar is not just catching up, but establishing a 4-point lead. The status quo, where the polling gap is immense, is the most powerful piece of evidence suggesting a 'No' outcome. While Reform's momentum is undeniable, overcoming the structural inertia of a poll aggregate to this degree in such a short timeframe is historically very rare. Therefore, my forecast is low. It is not lower because the political environment is clearly volatile, both major parties are deeply unpopular, and a significant electoral event is occurring today that could genuinely reshape the landscape. I would increase my forecast significantly if early election results show a landslide for Reform. I would decrease it if their performance is merely good but not groundbreaking, suggesting their support is nearing a ceiling.",
