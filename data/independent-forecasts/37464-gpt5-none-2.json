    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "About 23 days (until June 1, 2025)",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No — the FSIS recall page remains Active on June 1, 2025.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "FSIS has not completed/verified recall effectiveness checks or paperwork by late May, or the recall scope is adjusted/expanded, keeping the status Active past June 1.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "LPK1 quickly provides all documentation showing product accounted for and removed from commerce (limited distribution via vending machines, short shelf life), FSIS completes checks, and the status flips to Closed in mid-to-late May.",
    "rationale": "- Baseline: FSIS recall closures often take several months. Undeclared allergen/misbranding recalls typically close faster than contamination-driven recalls, but many still run 3–6 months. This recall (posted Feb 24) must close within ~97 days to count; as of May 8, we’re ~74 days in with ~23 days left.\n- Case specifics: The product appears perishable and locally distributed (vending machines in Washington), which simplifies effectiveness checks and favors a faster closure. That raises the chance relative to a large multi-state distribution.\n- Status quo weight: The current status is Active. In many FSIS cases, even straightforward recalls remain Active well past 90 days due to verification and administrative lag. With less than a month remaining, inertia slightly favors No.\n- Why not higher: It’s already early May without closure; FSIS closures commonly occur closer to 90–120+ days. Administrative timing (e.g., late-May holiday) can further delay postings.\n- Why not lower: The localized, short-shelf-life nature of a vending-machine wrap makes it plausible FSIS could complete checks and close in May.\n- What would move me up: Evidence of very small lot size and single consignee network; FSIS updating several contemporaneous small recalls to Closed around the 80–95 day mark; an FSIS update noting effectiveness checks completed.\n- What would move me down: Any expansion of the recall, additional findings, or indications of multi-state distribution/complex consignee lists; lack of FSIS page updates on similar recalls until well past 100 days.\n- Research assistant: No additional information available; forecast leans on general FSIS timelines and the product’s limited distribution/perishability profile.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill the USDA-posted recall by LPK1 of its ready-to-eat chicken caesar wrap for misbranding and an undeclared allergen issued February 24, 2025 be closed before June 1, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nFood Safety News: [Chicken Caesar wraps sold in vending machines in Washington recalled over undeclared fish](https://www.foodsafetynews.com/2025/02/chicken-caesar-wraps-sold-in-veding-machines-in-washington-recalled-over-undeclared-fish/)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if the status of the recall posted by the U.S. Department of Agriculture’s Food Safety and Inspection Service (FSIS) is changed from Active to Closed on [this page](https://www.fsis.usda.gov/recalls-alerts/lpk1-recalls-ready-eat-chicken-caesar-wrap-products-due-misbranding-and-undeclared) before June 1, 2025. If the recall is still shown as Active when the link is accessed by Metaculus on or after that date, this question resolves as **No**.\n\n\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nNo additional information available.\n\nToday is 2025-05-08.\n\nBefore answering you think:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n(e) You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
