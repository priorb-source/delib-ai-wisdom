    "review": "Forecaster 2’s structural prior (UK leaders typically poll higher than Japanese leaders in Morning Consult) is a valid baseline and was part of my initial view. However, it underweights the most recent cross-sectional evidence that Ishiba may currently be ahead, and it assumes a fairly stable premium for the UK that leadership changes can disrupt. Forecaster 3 brings new, concrete-seeming information: an apparent late-May MC snapshot with Ishiba ~32% vs Starmer ~28%, and notes that the spread swung about 11 points over a month. If accurate, that directly challenges the assumption that Starmer has a clear cushion, and it highlights how quickly the ordering can flip within the 7-day SMA window.\n\nI find F3’s emphasis on recent data and volatility persuasive in shifting the near-term baseline slightly against a Yes outcome, especially with a tie counting as No. That said, I think F3 may slightly overstate the degree of volatility typical for MC’s 7-day moving average and underweight the historical tendency for Japan PMs to revert to the high-20s/low-30s while UK PMs often sit around the low-30s. F2’s 65% feels a bit high if Ishiba is indeed currently ahead; still, their argument for a modest UK edge remains relevant.\n\nNet: I update down from my prior, giving more weight to the current Ishiba lead and tie risk, while retaining some UK-over-Japan structural tilt and the possibility of June UK macro/policy news marginally helping Starmer.",
    "rationale": "- Time left: About 32 days until the July 1 check, and MC uses a 7-day moving average, limiting but not eliminating short-term swings.\n- Status quo: If Forecaster 3’s late-May read is right (Ishiba ~32, Starmer ~28), the status quo favors No.\n- Why adjust downward: The latest reported ordering (Ishiba ahead) and the small margins make a Yes outcome fragile; a tie resolves No. Even modest negative UK reactions to June fiscal announcements could keep Starmer in the high-20s, while Ishiba hovering around 30% would suffice for No.\n- Why not lower: Historical MC patterns still slightly favor UK leaders over Japanese leaders, and there are plausible June catalysts (e.g., improving inflation sentiment, a central bank move, or a neutral/positive read on UK fiscal plans) that could nudge Starmer back into the low-30s. Japan’s approval often struggles to sustain mid-30s; a drift back toward ~28–30 for Ishiba is plausible.\n- Bottom line: With the most recent read likely showing Ishiba narrowly ahead and only a month left, I now see the race as close with a slight tilt against Yes due to tie risk and the current ordering, but I keep it near coin-flip given the historical baseline and potential for small shifts to flip the outcome.",
