  "information": "The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) announced it will decommission its 'Billion-Dollar Weather and Climate Disasters' database. The database, created in 1980 to track the financial costs of major climate events, will not be updated beyond 2024 and its existing information will be archived. According to AM Best, a credit rating agency, the removal of this centralized data source could hinder insurance companies' ability to model, price, and manage risks associated with climate-related disasters. NOAA communications chief Kim Doster stated the change is 'in alignment with evolving priorities, statutory mandates, and staffing changes'.\n\nThe Trump administration has implemented significant budget and staff cuts at NOAA. According to reports, hundreds of scientists and climate experts have been laid off, sparking concern over the future of climate research and environmental policy. These actions are seen by some as aligning with the 'Project 2025' plan promoted by the Heritage Foundation, which proposes dismantling the agency. Additionally, some of NOAA's regional climate centers have been shut down, and all contributors to the National Climate Assessment have been fired.\n\nOn April 4, 2025, a NOAA spokesperson stated that the agency's websites will remain online. Following an internal memo that had warned of potential data loss if sites went down, the spokesperson confirmed, 'There will be no interruption in service. All NOAA Research sites will remain online.' The statement specifically referred to websites connected to NOAA's Office of Oceanic and Atmospheric Research, which focus on climate change, extreme weather research, and drought monitoring.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Approximately 1 month and 1 week.",
    "status_quo_outcome": "The website remains online. Major government websites have high uptime and institutional inertia generally ensures their continued operation.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Following a direct order from the administration as part of its stated goal of dismantling climate research programs, NOAA is forced to take Climate.gov offline. This action overrides previous public assurances from agency spokespeople.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Despite budget cuts and the decommissioning of specific databases, NOAA's core public-facing websites like Climate.gov remain online due to institutional inertia and the fulfillment of the agency's April 2025 public commitment to maintain service.",
    "rationale": "My forecast is heavily weighted by two factors: the high degree of institutional inertia required to keep a major government website online, and the explicit statement from a NOAA spokesperson on April 4, 2025, confirming that 'All NOAA Research sites will remain online.' This statement directly addresses the core of the question and provides a strong, recent piece of evidence in favor of a 'Yes' outcome. The world changes slowly, and taking a well-established website offline requires a specific, deliberate action that often moves slower than the 40-day timeframe to resolution.\n\nHowever, the probability is not higher because the risk of a politically motivated takedown is non-trivial. The research provided indicates the administration has already taken concrete steps to curtail climate information, such as decommissioning the 'Billion-Dollar Weather and Climate Disasters' database and firing National Climate Assessment contributors. These actions demonstrate a willingness to act on the anti-climate-science rhetoric associated with 'Project 2025'. A sudden executive order or a directive from a political appointee could force a takedown, overriding the spokesperson's assurance. \n\nConversely, the probability is not lower because the actions taken to date, while significant, are less drastic than scrubbing a primary domain like Climate.gov entirely. Decommissioning a database is a step below a full takedown in terms of public visibility and represents a different kind of information removal. The direct public promise from NOAA creates a political cost to reversal, and in the absence of a specific order, the technical and bureaucratic default is to maintain the status quo.\n\nI would increase my forecast closer to 100% if a cabinet-level official reiterated the commitment to keep the site online. I would decrease my forecast significantly if there were credible reports of a specific plan or directive to take Climate.gov offline before July 1.",

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
