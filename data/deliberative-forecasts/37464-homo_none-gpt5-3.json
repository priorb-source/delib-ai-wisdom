    "review": "Both forecasters emphasize the same core factors I used: short shelf-life, localized vending-machine distribution (faster/easier effectiveness checks), and the countervailing status quo inertia with only ~3.5 weeks left. New/useful angle: Forecaster 2 notes the late-May holiday potentially slowing postings, which marginally lowers the chance of a timely “Closed” update. I find Forecaster 2’s reasoning solid but their 58% a bit optimistic given they also stress inertia and possible delays. Forecaster 3’s 3–6 month closure window and emphasis on administrative lag align more closely with my prior; their 44% is consistent with the current Active status and limited time remaining. No hard new data were introduced; arguments mainly refine timing considerations and agency cadence.\n",
    "rationale": "Given: (1) localized scope and perishability push toward earlier closure; (2) allergen recalls can entail thorough verification; (3) it remains Active ~10.5 weeks in with ~3.5 weeks left; and (4) potential late-May posting delays, I modestly increase weight on the No outcome via administrative timing. While a closure in May is plausible, the remaining window is tight and FSIS closures often slip past arbitrary cutoffs. Net effect: slight downward adjustment from my prior 45% to reflect holiday/cadence risk and the current lack of any indication of imminent closure.\n",
