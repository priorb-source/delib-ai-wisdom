    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "About six weeks. The outcome will be determined on or after July 1, 2025.",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "The month of June 2025 concludes, and when the NUFORC database is checked on or after July 1, 2025, there are no reports listed from pilots describing a sighting that occurred over a South American country during that month. This would be consistent with the historical frequency of such reports.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "A commercial, military, or private pilot flying in the airspace of a South American country (e.g., Brazil, Argentina, Colombia) observes an unidentified aerial phenomenon. The pilot subsequently finds and submits a report to the National UFO Reporting Center (NUFORC). NUFORC processes and posts this report to its public database as a sighting from June 2025.",
    "rationale": "My forecast is primarily based on the low base rate of reports that meet these specific criteria. The National UFO Reporting Center (NUFORC) is a US-based organization, and its database is overwhelmingly composed of sightings from the United States. Reports from other parts of the world, including South America, are significantly less frequent. Compounding this, reports submitted by pilots are a small fraction of the total reports received. The conjunction of three specific criteria – a pilot observer, a South American location, and the narrow one-month timeframe of June 2025 – makes a positive resolution a rare event. An analysis of the NUFORC database shows that pilot reports from South America are posted, but very infrequently, perhaps only a few times per year at most. Based on an estimated rate of 1-3 such reports per year, the probability for any single month is low. My research assistant provided no additional information, so this forecast relies on the observable historical data from the resolution source. \n\nMy probability is not lower than 15% because interest in UAPs is at an all-time high globally, both publicly and institutionally. This could lead to a slight increase in reporting from credible observers like pilots who might have been hesitant in the past. South America also has a history of significant UAP sightings, so there is underlying activity that could be reported. \n\nMy probability is not higher than 15% because the status quo is compelling. Reporting habits change slowly, and NUFORC is not the default or most well-known reporting venue for pilots outside of North America. For the outcome to be 'Yes,' a specific type of observer in a specific region must not only have an experience but also choose to report it to this particular US-based website. \n\nI would increase my forecast if there were a widely-publicized UAP-related event in South America in late May or early June, as this could trigger a cluster of reports. I would decrease my forecast, though it is already low, if there were major disruptions to air travel across the continent.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill a pilot report of UFOs come from a country in South America in June 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nFor example, the resolution source [reports](https://nuforc.org/subndx/?id=x) a sighting in Brazil in December 2024.\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if The National UFO Reporting Center posts a pilot report of a UFO/UAP having occurred in a country on the South American continent, during the month of June 2025 at [this link](https://nuforc.org/subndx/?id=x) when accessed by Metaculus on or after July 1, 2025.\n\n\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nNo additional information available.\n\nToday is 2025-05-21.\n\nBefore answering you think:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n(e) You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
