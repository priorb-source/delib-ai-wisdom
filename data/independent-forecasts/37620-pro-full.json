  "information": "On May 6, 2025, Ramzan Kadyrov publicly stated that he was asking to be relieved of his duties, expressing a hope that his request would be supported to allow for new leadership in the region. He subsequently clarified on his Telegram channel that the final decision rests solely with Russian President Vladimir Putin, stating, \"I do not decide whether I will remain as the head of the Chechen Republic or not.\" By May 12, Kadyrov again addressed the rumors, attributing his recent serious demeanor not to a potential resignation, but to the ongoing special military operation in Ukraine, in which he said 11,000 Chechen troops were involved.\n\nMultiple media outlets, including Novaya Gazeta Europe, The Insider, and the Kyiv Independent, have reported on Kadyrov's deteriorating health, with some specifying conditions such as pancreatic necrosis and kidney problems. In parallel, reports indicate Kadyrov is engaged in succession planning. He has promoted his 17-year-old son, Adam Kadyrov, to several high-ranking positions, including secretary of the republic's security council and head of his own security department. Kadyrov's 26-year-old daughter, Aishat, also holds the position of vice-president of the Chechen government.\n\nRamzan Kadyrov met with Russian President Vladimir Putin on May 7, 2025. Following the meeting, Kadyrov stated he received \"full understanding and support,\" and Russian state media reported that Putin praised the Chechen Republic's achievements. This is not the first time Kadyrov has publicly discussed stepping down; similar statements were made in 2016, 2020, and 2022, none of which resulted in his departure. The authority to appoint or dismiss the Head of the Chechen Republic rests exclusively with the President of Russia. Kadyrov has held the position since April 2007.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Approximately 20 days.",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No. Ramzan Kadyrov will remain the head of the Chechen Republic on June 1, 2025.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Ramzan Kadyrov's statements about stepping down prove to be a political maneuver, similar to his previous statements in 2016, 2020, and 2022. Despite rumors about his health, he does not suffer a fatal or incapacitating medical event, and President Putin does not remove him from his post before the deadline.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "The reports of Kadyrov's severe health issues, such as pancreatic necrosis, are accurate, and his condition deteriorates rapidly, leading to his death or complete incapacitation before June 1, 2025. This forces President Putin to formally appoint a replacement to avoid a power vacuum in the region.",
    "rationale": "My forecast is anchored on the strong tendency of the status quo to persist, especially in entrenched autocratic systems. Ramzan Kadyrov has been in power since 2007, and his position is entirely dependent on Vladimir Putin's will. The recent meeting on May 7, where Putin reportedly expressed 'full understanding and support,' is a powerful signal that the Kremlin is not seeking a change in leadership at this moment. Furthermore, Kadyrov has a well-established history of publicly musing about resignation, only to remain in power; this suggests his latest statements are more likely political theater than a genuine request to step down.\n\nThe primary factor that elevates the probability above a baseline of near-zero is the significant volume of reports concerning his seriously deteriorating health. If reports of a condition like pancreatic necrosis are true, a sudden medical event leading to death or incapacitation is a real possibility, even within a short timeframe. His recent focus on promoting his children to high-level positions also lends credibility to the idea that he is actively planning for a future where he is no longer in charge, likely due to these health concerns.\n\nHowever, for this question to resolve 'Yes,' such an event must occur and be officially recognized within the next 20 days. This is a very high bar. Therefore, while the health risks are significant and prevent me from giving a lower forecast, they are not sufficient to overcome the strong evidence for the status quo: Putin's support, Kadyrov's history of performative resignation talks, and the inherent inertia of the political structure. I would increase the probability with credible, near-real-time evidence of his hospitalization or a verifiable disappearance from public view. I would decrease it if he appears in public looking demonstrably healthy or if official Kremlin sources explicitly reaffirm his long-term position.",
