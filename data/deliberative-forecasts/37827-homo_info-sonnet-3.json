    "review": "Forecaster 2 provides the most compelling analysis by citing specific historical data: 4-6 pilot reports from Africa over 10 years (2015-2024). This data point, which I didn't have access to in my initial analysis, is crucial for establishing a base rate. Their calculation of 0.4-0.6 reports per year, translating to roughly 4% monthly probability, is methodologically sound and well-justified.\n\nForecaster 3's estimate of 3-6 reports annually from Africa seems significantly inflated compared to Forecaster 2's historical data. If reports were that common (averaging one every 2-4 months), we would expect much more frequent occurrences than the sparse historical record suggests. Forecaster 3 appears to over-weight the single Rwanda January 2025 example without considering long-term base rates.\n\nBoth forecasters correctly identify that the Rwanda example proves these reports can occur, but Forecaster 2 more appropriately applies this within a statistical framework rather than treating it as evidence of frequent occurrence. The key insight is that one recent report doesn't establish a new trend - it's consistent with the low historical base rate where occasional reports do occur.\n\nMy initial forecast of 12% now appears too high given Forecaster 2's historical data. I was too optimistic about the frequency of such reports without concrete data backing.",
    "rationale": "Upon reflection, I should significantly update downward based on Forecaster 2's historical data analysis. If there were only 4-6 pilot reports from Africa to NUFORC over the entire 10-year period of 2015-2024, this establishes a clear base rate of approximately 0.4-0.6 reports per year, or 0.033-0.05 per month.\n\nThe January 2025 Rwanda report, while confirming these events can occur, doesn't indicate increased frequency - it's simply one data point consistent with the historical rate. With such sparse data, we should expect high variance, but the central tendency should anchor to the historical base rate.\n\nApplying appropriate status quo bias and the principle that the world changes slowly, June 2025 should not be expected to differ materially from historical patterns absent specific evidence. The 30-day window covering all 54 African countries is the only factor working in favor of a Yes outcome, but this is already reflected in the base rate calculation.\n\nI'm updating from 12% to approximately 6% - slightly higher than Forecaster 2's 5% to account for some uncertainty in the historical data precision, but firmly anchored to the empirical base rate they identified rather than my initial more speculative reasoning.",
