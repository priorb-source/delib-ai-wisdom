    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "The outcome will be determined by July 1, 2025, which is 25 days from today's date of June 5, 2025.",
    "status_quo_outcome": "As of today, no official announcement has been made by the Uruguayan government confirming President Orsi's attendance. If no such announcement is made by the deadline, the question will resolve as No.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "The Uruguayan government under President Orsi decides that the diplomatic risks of appearing to align with the BRICS bloc outweigh the benefits. Concerned about potential friction with key partners like the United States and the European Union, the government either formally declines the invitation or simply allows the July 1 deadline to pass without making an affirmative announcement.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "The government of Uruguay, viewing the invitation as a significant opportunity for economic and diplomatic engagement, formally accepts. A spokesperson for the President's office or the Minister of Foreign Affairs issues a press release or makes a public statement confirming that President Yamandú Orsi will travel to Rio de Janeiro to attend the BRICS summit in July.",
    "rationale": "My forecast is based on several converging factors that strongly suggest Uruguay will announce its attendance. The status quo is that no announcement has been made, which must be a key consideration. However, the political context points overwhelmingly towards a 'Yes' outcome. \n\nFirstly, the invitation comes from President Lula of Brazil, Uruguay's most important neighbor, Mercosur partner, and a key ideological ally to President Orsi's historically left-leaning Frente Amplio party. Refusing a personal invitation from Lula would be a significant diplomatic snub with potential negative repercussions for bilateral relations. \n\nSecondly, attending the summit aligns perfectly with Uruguay's long-standing foreign policy objective of diversifying its economic and political partnerships beyond traditional spheres. This is evident in its past pursuit of a free trade agreement with China, a leading BRICS member. The summit provides a high-profile platform for Uruguay to advance these interests.\n\nMy probability is not higher than 80% because President Orsi's government must still weigh the reaction from Western partners, particularly the United States, which may view this as a move away from its traditional alignment. There could also be unforeseen domestic political complexities that delay or prevent a decision. The fact that an announcement hasn't been made yet with less than a month to go introduces some uncertainty.\n\nMy probability is not lower than 80% because the arguments for attending are compelling. The diplomatic cost of declining an invitation from Brazil is high, and the economic and political upside of engagement is substantial. Attending as an invited guest is a relatively low-commitment action that does not equate to seeking membership, thus mitigating some of the geopolitical risks. I would increase my forecast if there were positive preliminary statements from Uruguayan officials. I would decrease it if influential figures within the Uruguayan government or key trading partners voiced strong opposition to the attendance.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill the government of Uruguay announce that its president, Yamandú Orsi, will attend the BRICS summit in July 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\n[Lula invites Mexico, Colombia, and Uruguay to BRICS Summit](https://en.mercopress.com/2025/03/04/lula-invites-mexico-colombia-and-uruguay-to-brics-summit#google_vignette) | [Uruguay’s participation at the BRICS summit still up in the air](https://www.plenglish.com/news/2025/03/02/uruguays-participation-at-the-brics-summit-still-up-in-the-air/)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if before July 1, 2025 the government of Uruguay, or anyone speaking on its behalf, issues any sort of public communication (written or oral) confirming its acceptance of the invitation for President Yamandú Orsi to attend in person the BRICS Summit scheduled to take place in Rio de Janeiro in July 2025.\n\nSince the summit will be held after this question resolves, actual attendance is not required, merely the announcement of plans to attend.\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nNo additional information available.\n\nToday is 2025-06-05.\n\nBefore answering you think:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n(e) You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
