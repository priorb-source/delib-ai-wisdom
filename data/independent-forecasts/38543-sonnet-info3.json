  "information": "Donald Trump's confirmed upcoming international travel includes the G7 Summit in Canada from June 16-18, 2025, and the NATO Summit in the Netherlands from June 24-25, 2025. Chinese President Xi Jinping is scheduled to be in Central Asia for a summit in Kazakhstan from June 16-18, 2025. Historically, US presidential visits to China involve extensive logistical and security preparations, typically beginning weeks or months in advance. As of mid-June 2025, there have been no public reports of advance teams being dispatched or security preparations being made for a potential visit by Trump to China.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "16 days (from June 15, 2025 to July 1, 2025)",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No - Trump does not visit China before July 1, 2025",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Trump attends his scheduled G7 Summit in Canada (June 16-18) and NATO Summit in the Netherlands (June 24-25) as planned, with no additional trip to China materialized in the remaining days before the July 1 deadline. US-China diplomatic engagement continues through normal channels without requiring a presidential visit.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "An unexpected diplomatic breakthrough or urgent bilateral issue necessitates an emergency summit, leading to a rapidly arranged visit by Trump to China. This could potentially occur as a brief stopover between his scheduled commitments or immediately after the NATO Summit on June 25, though this would require abandoning normal security protocols and advance preparation requirements.",
    "rationale": "With only 16 days remaining until the resolution date, the probability of this outcome is extremely low. The research assistant's report highlights several critical factors: (1) Trump has confirmed attendance at the G7 Summit (June 16-18) and NATO Summit (June 24-25), accounting for 9 of the remaining 16 days; (2) Xi Jinping will be in Kazakhstan during the G7 dates, reducing overlap opportunities; (3) No advance teams or security preparations have been reported; (4) Historical precedent shows US presidential visits to China require extensive advance logistical and security preparations, typically beginning weeks or months beforehand. The status quo strongly favors a No outcome because organizing a presidential visit to China in under 16 days would be unprecedented without any visible preparation. While the Fox News report mentions 'very positive breakthrough with Xi,' positive diplomatic communications do not necessitate an immediate in-person visit. My forecast is not lower (e.g., 0-1%) because emergency diplomacy, though rare, is not impossible - urgent geopolitical crises have occasionally required rapid summit arrangements. However, even emergency visits typically have some advance notice for security. My forecast is not higher because there is literally zero evidence of preparation, and Trump's schedule is already committed through most of the remaining period. For me to update upward, I would need to see: announcements of trip planning, reports of advance security teams deploying, or cancellation/rescheduling of existing commitments. For me to update downward further, we simply need more days to pass without any such announcements.",

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
