    "review": "The other two forecasters and I have reached a strong consensus, with initial forecasts clustered between 18% and 20%. We all agree on the core conflict: extreme financial and political pressure on Bulgaria to cancel the deal versus the immense legal, diplomatic, and practical inertia that protects such agreements, especially within a very short timeframe of less than one month. Forecaster 2's reasoning closely mirrored my own, reinforcing the key constraints of time and complexity. Forecaster 3, however, introduced several highly convincing arguments that I had not fully weighted. The most compelling new points were: 1) The analysis of a caretaker or transitional government's probable behavior, noting they are far less likely to take such a significant and legally fraught action compared to a fully empowered government. 2) A game-theory perspective on BOTAŞ's incentives, correctly pointing out that the Turkish company is more likely to use Bulgargaz's debt as leverage for payment rather than cancelling the contract and losing all future revenue. 3) The explicit emphasis on renegotiation as the standard and far more probable path than abrupt cancellation. These arguments significantly strengthen the case for a 'No' outcome.",
    "rationale": "After reviewing my peers' analyses, I am revising my forecast downwards. My initial 20% probability was based on the significant headline risks of Bulgargaz's potential bankruptcy and the strong political statements from Bulgarian leadership. While these pressures are real, the other forecasters have convinced me that I under-weighted the powerful structural barriers to a swift cancellation. Forecaster 3's points about the likely inaction of a caretaker government and BOTAŞ's own disincentive to cancel are particularly impactful. These factors make a unilateral Bulgarian announcement—the most plausible path to a 'Yes' resolution—significantly less likely in the next 24 days. The situation is more likely to result in protracted negotiations, arbitration, or a political 'kicking of the can' past the July 1st deadline, rather than a sudden, decisive announcement of termination. Therefore, I am decreasing my forecast from 20% to 15%. This revised probability still acknowledges the non-zero chance of a radical, politically-motivated decision driven by the acute financial crisis, but it better reflects the formidable institutional and diplomatic inertia that makes such an outcome highly improbable in the immediate term.",
