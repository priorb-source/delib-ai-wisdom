  "information": "Sheikh Hasina has been in exile in India since being ousted from power in August 2024. In statements made in February 2025, she vowed to return to Bangladesh, accusing the interim government of unleashing terrorists and promising to seek justice. Legally, she faces multiple challenges. Bangladesh's International Crimes Tribunal (ICT) has issued her a show-cause notice in a contempt of court case, with a response required by May 15, 2025. Additionally, a separate ICT investigation into alleged crimes against humanity committed during the July 2024 uprising is reportedly in its final stages, with a probe report expected to be submitted within May 2025.\n\nThe political landscape in Bangladesh is currently shaped by an interim government led by Chief Advisor Muhammad Yunus. This government has stated its priority is a reform agenda and has indicated that national elections might be delayed until June 2026. On May 6, 2025, former Prime Minister Khaleda Zia, Sheikh Hasina's long-time political rival, returned to Bangladesh after receiving four months of medical treatment in London. Following her return, her party, the Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP), has increased pressure on the interim government to hold elections sooner, with some leaders demanding polls be held by December 2025.\n\nThe Bangladeshi interim government has publicly stated that securing Sheikh Hasina's extradition from India is a 'top priority.' A formal request for her extradition, along with supporting documents, was submitted to India in December 2024. As of February 2025, India had not officially responded to the request. A spokesperson for Bangladesh's foreign ministry indicated that a formal reminder would be sent to India regarding the extradition at an 'appropriate time' to be determined by the country's political leadership.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Less than two months, until July 1, 2025.",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No. Sheikh Hasina remains in exile in India as the extradition process either stalls or proceeds too slowly to conclude before the deadline.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "The Indian government, weighing its long-standing relationship with Sheikh Hasina against its need for good relations with the new Bangladeshi government, opts for inaction or a lengthy legal review of the extradition request. Facing serious charges at home, Sheikh Hasina remains in India past the July 1, 2025 deadline.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "In a surprise diplomatic maneuver following the conclusion of the ICT's probe, India agrees to the extradition to curry favor with the new Bangladeshi regime. Sheikh Hasina is handed over to Bangladeshi authorities in late June. Alternatively, feeling politically marginalized by her rival's return, Hasina makes a high-risk voluntary return to face trial and rally her supporters.",
    "rationale": "The forecast is heavily weighted towards the status quo, which is Sheikh Hasina remaining in exile in India. The primary driver for this assessment is the typically slow and complex nature of international extradition, especially concerning a former head of government. The resolution window of less than two months is extremely short for such a legal and diplomatic process to conclude, particularly given that India has not officially responded to the extradition request submitted in December 2024. Furthermore, the severe nature of the charges against Sheikh Hasina (crimes against humanity) makes a voluntary return highly improbable, as it would almost certainly lead to her immediate arrest. While the Bangladeshi interim government has labelled her extradition a 'top priority' and she has publicly vowed to return, these factors are likely outweighed by the significant legal, diplomatic, and personal risks involved. The probability is not lower because the political situation in Bangladesh is volatile, and the imminent submission of the probe report against her creates a non-trivial chance of a sudden political development or a high-risk gambit. I would increase this forecast if there were official statements from India indicating progress on the extradition. I would decrease it if India formally stated the process would be lengthy or rejected the request.",
