    "review": "Forecaster 2 usefully emphasizes the potential weight of a Franco‑British initiative and the permissive environment created by recent European recognitions. However, their argument seems to overinterpret “joining an initiative” as implying near‑term execution. It also omits a key constraint: the UK is in a pre‑election caretaker period, which makes a June recognition by London unlikely. France has historically preferred coordinated timing and has been cautious about unilateral recognition, which tempers the inference that P5 coordination implies a June move. Forecaster 3’s points about the narrow 30‑day window, the distinction between an initiative and an imminent decision, and the coordination time needed for joint recognitions are persuasive and align with my baseline. Their emphasis on process timelines and lack of specific June signaling is a solid reason not to push probabilities higher.",
    "rationale": "June is a very tight window, and the principal candidate among the big movers (UK) faces caretaker constraints before the July 4 election. France’s involvement raises the medium‑term odds but, absent concrete June timing signals, Paris is more likely to seek coordination than to move immediately. Other plausible EU holdouts (e.g., Belgium, Luxembourg, Portugal, Netherlands, Denmark, Germany, Italy) have not telegraphed imminent action; coordinated mini‑group moves typically require more lead time. A single small state (e.g., a Caribbean or Pacific holdout) could flip without much warning, keeping a non‑trivial tail for a June “Yes,” but the base rate for such flips in any given month remains modest. The Franco‑British initiative increases the background probability, yet without specific indications of a June announcement, and given UK purdah plus France’s coordination habit, I don’t see enough to move higher. I therefore keep my estimate where it is, while watching for early‑to‑mid‑June signals from Paris or smaller states that could quickly change the outlook.",
