  "information": "Competition from AI tools like ChatGPT has negatively impacted Chegg's core business model. In response, Chegg is introducing its own AI-powered features, such as 'Create' and 'Solution Scout'. In February 2025, the company filed a lawsuit against Google for unfair competition. Management is also undertaking a comprehensive strategic review, which includes considering privatization or acquisition as potential options. Furthermore, Chegg has initiated cost-cutting measures with the goal of achieving a 30% EBITDA margin and generating over $100 million in free cash flow by 2025.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Less than 2 months (approximately 57 days until July 1, 2025)",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No - Chegg continues operating without filing for bankruptcy",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Chegg continues operations through July 1, 2025. Despite facing significant challenges from AI competition, the company maintains sufficient liquidity to meet near-term obligations. Their cost-cutting measures targeting 30% EBITDA margins and $100M+ in free cash flow provide breathing room. The strategic review process potentially yields acquisition interest or privatization options, giving stakeholders reason to avoid bankruptcy. Even if business continues declining, they have enough runway to extend beyond July 1.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Chegg faces an unexpected severe liquidity crisis within the next 57 days. A combination of accelerating subscriber losses, debt covenant violations, or creditor pressure forces immediate action. Strategic alternatives fail to materialize quickly enough, and the company cannot access additional financing. Management concludes bankruptcy protection is the only option to restructure obligations and preserve value, filing under Chapter 11 before July 1.",
    "rationale": "The extremely short timeframe (less than 2 months) heavily favors a No outcome. Corporate bankruptcies typically follow extended periods of financial deterioration, not sudden collapses within weeks. Base rates suggest that even severely distressed public companies rarely file for bankruptcy within such a compressed window.\n\nKey evidence supporting low probability: (1) Chegg is actively pursuing strategic alternatives including potential privatization or acquisition, suggesting stakeholders believe the company has viable paths forward; (2) The company recently filed litigation against Google, indicating they have resources and legal counsel engaged; (3) Management has implemented cost-cutting measures with specific financial targets, showing proactive operational management; (4) No reports of immediate liquidity crisis, covenant violations, or creditor demands.\n\nThe research assistant's information confirms Chegg faces serious structural challenges from AI competition, but also shows active management response rather than capitulation. Companies exploring strategic alternatives typically have months, not weeks, of runway.\n\nWhy not lower (toward 0%): Chegg's business model faces existential disruption from AI. The WSJ article title suggests significant distress. Unknown factors like debt structure, covenant requirements, or hidden liquidity issues could potentially force a faster timeline than typical.\n\nWhy not higher: No evidence of imminent crisis. Strategic options being explored. Recent proactive legal action. Base rate for bankruptcy within 57-day window is extremely low. Even distressed companies typically have quarterly runway minimum.\n\nTo move probability higher, I would need: Evidence of immediate liquidity crisis, failed debt negotiations, covenant violations, or creditor demands. To move lower: Confirmation of adequate cash reserves, successful strategic alternative progress, or improved business metrics.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill Chegg file for bankruptcy before July 1, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nWall Street Journal: [How ChatGPT Brought Down an Online Education Giant](https://www.wsj.com/tech/ai/how-chatgpt-brought-down-an-online-education-giant-200b4ff2)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question will resolve as **Yes** if Chegg, Inc., files any petition for bankruptcy protection in the United States, under any chapter of the United States Bankruptcy Code, before July 1, 2025. The question will resolves on the filing of such a petition, not on whether any bankruptcy protection is granted by a court. If no such petition is filed by that date, this question will resolve as **No**.\n\n\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nCompetition from AI tools like ChatGPT has negatively impacted Chegg's core business model.

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
