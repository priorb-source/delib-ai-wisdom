    "review": "- New arguments I hadn’t fully weighted: both forecasters emphasize the technical risk from the exact subheading/percentage requirement, and the possibility that even if a Switzerland tariff is adopted, it could appear under a different Chapter 99 number or a slightly different percentage. That is a meaningful tail risk.\n- Points I find less convincing: both lean on a tight “implementation by June 1” timeline; however, resolution is triggered if the HTS displays the 31% at 9903.01.60 any time on or after June 1, and suspension status doesn’t matter. That weakens legal/implementation-timing as a core downside driver.\n- Net: Their caution on subheading/percentage specificity nudges me down modestly; their timing concerns don’t move me much given the wording of the resolution.",
    "rationale": "My prior (78%) leaned on policy inertia once USITC posts a Chapter 99 entry and the short horizon. I still think: (a) if the administration intends a 31% Switzerland rate, USITC can post relatively quickly; (b) even if enforcement is stayed or staged, listing can persist; (c) “on or after June 1” reduces deadline pressure.\n\nHowever, I’m updating slightly downward due to:\n- Specificity risk: the exact 9903.01.60 anchor and the exact 31% could change during drafting—e.g., a nearby 9903 code is used instead, or the rate shifts (30%, 35%). This is the main path to No.\n- Uncertainty about current codification status: without Federal Register/USITC confirmation that 9903.01.60 already shows 31% for Switzerland, there’s real risk of renumbering or late-cycle editing before June.\n\nI’m not reducing more because the article’s specificity suggests prepped language, and once posted, Chapter 99 entries rarely get renumbered within weeks. Legal or diplomatic developments that suspend or phase-in the measure are largely irrelevant to resolution.\n\nUp triggers: FR/USITC evidence that 9903.01.60 carries 31% for Switzerland or a proclamation assigning that exact pairing. Down triggers: indications the measure is being recast under a different 9903 subheading or with a different rate, or USITC draft revisions pointing to alternative numbering.\n",
