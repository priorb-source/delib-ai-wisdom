  "information": "United Airlines has announced a new year-round, twice-weekly direct flight from Narita, Japan, to Koror, Palau, which will commence on October 29, 2025. The route will be operated by a Boeing 737-800 aircraft, and tickets are already available for purchase. Separately, in February 2025, Qantas launched a new direct route from Brisbane to Koror, named the 'Palau Paradise Express.' This service is supported by the Australian Government.\n\nAs of early 2024, there were four to five regularly scheduled direct flight destinations from Koror, including Guam (operated by United Airlines), Manila (United Airlines), Taipei (China Airlines), and Brisbane (Qantas). In addition to scheduled services, Japan Airlines (JAL) resumed direct charter flights from Narita to Palau in March 2025 after a five-year suspension.\n\nTourism in Palau is in a recovery phase. Visitor numbers from Europe reached 3,442 by December 2024, approaching pre-pandemic levels. The Palau Visitors Authority is promoting the destination by leveraging increased flight frequency with partners like China Airlines. Hong Kong Airlines also lists Koror as a destination within its network. Prior to the pandemic, several South Korean airlines, including Air Seoul and T'way, operated services to Palau. A previous service between Narita and Koror operated by Delta Air Lines was suspended in May 2018.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "About 6 weeks (until July 1, 2025; resolution can occur on/after that date)",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No (5 or fewer direct destinations listed on flightsfrom.com/ROR)",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "By July 1, 2025, ROR shows Guam (United) and Taipei (China Airlines) as core routes, with at most a few others (e.g., Manila, Yap, possibly Brisbane) but the total remains 5 or fewer. Korean and Hong Kong services do not resume as scheduled routes in time; Japan service remains charter-only until United’s Narita flight begins in late October (too late).",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "At least six destinations are listed on flightsfrom.com: the existing core (Guam, Taipei) plus enough additional scheduled routes before or during summer 2025—e.g., Manila and Yap active, Brisbane operating as a scheduled service, and at least one more such as a resumed Korean (ICN) or Hong Kong route—pushing the total to 6+.",
    "rationale": "- Threshold: The bar is >5 (i.e., 6+ scheduled destinations on flightsfrom.com). That is high for a small market still recovering.\n- Status quo and pace of change: Palau’s air connectivity has been slow to rebound. The Marketplace piece (Apr 2024) notes flights haven’t restarted in high volume, particularly from Korea. Changes in route networks typically occur gradually.\n- Research assistant’s inputs and implications:\n  • United’s Narita–Koror starts Oct 29, 2025—after the July 1 cutoff, so it doesn’t help.\n  • JAL’s Narita–Koror is charter, which generally won’t appear as a scheduled route on flightsfrom.com.\n  • China Airlines Taipei–Koror is plausibly active and material.\n  • United’s Guam–Koror is the core link; Manila and Yap may or may not be active on the schedule (historically variable). If both are active, that helps, but still likely leaves the total at 4–5.\n  • A claimed Qantas Brisbane–Koror launch (Feb 2025) would add one if it is indeed scheduled and recognized by flightsfrom.com. However, this claim is unusual for Qantas and should be treated cautiously until independently corroborated.\n  • Mentions of Hong Kong Airlines and past Korean carriers (Air Seoul, T’way) are historical or network-listing references and don’t guarantee current scheduled service.\n- Why my forecast leans No: To reach 6+, multiple things must align by early July: Manila and/or Yap must be on-schedule, the Brisbane service must truly be scheduled and recognized, and at least one more market (likely Korea or Hong Kong) must resume as a scheduled service. With tourism still in recovery and a major new Japan route only beginning in October, that stack of requirements seems unlikely in the next six weeks.\n- Why not lower: There is some upside risk. Seasonal summer capacity from Korea could be scheduled in late June/July and would likely appear on flightsfrom.com once loaded, and the Brisbane service—if indeed operating as scheduled—could be counted. If, in addition, both Manila and Yap are active on United’s timetable, hitting 6 is conceivable.\n- What would move me up: Verified scheduled listings (for July 2025) on flightsfrom.com of any two among: ICN, HKG, NRT (as scheduled before October), or confirmation that both Manila and Yap are active plus Brisbane is listed.\n- What would move me down: Confirmation that one or more of Manila/Yap/Brisbane are not scheduled services (or are suspended) in July 2025, and no Korean/Hong Kong resumption appears in GDS/flight listings for the summer season.",
