  "information": "Several market-moving events are scheduled for late April and early May 2025. Major technology companies, including Microsoft, Meta, Apple, and Amazon, are set to release their first-quarter earnings reports. In total, over 180 S&P 500 companies are expected to report. Key economic data releases are also imminent, including the report on first-quarter GDP growth, the Personal Consumer Expenditures (PCE) inflation gauge for March, the ISM Manufacturing Index for April, and the April employment report. The Federal Reserve's next policy meeting is scheduled for May 7.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Approximately one month. The outcome will be determined based on the closing price on the final trading day of May 2025.",
    "status_quo_outcome": "The S&P 500 has a historical upward drift over time. Absent significant new information or shocks, the baseline expectation is for the index to be slightly higher over a one-month period.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Worse-than-expected earnings from key technology companies, coupled with high inflation data (PCE) and a weak jobs report, lead the Federal Reserve to adopt a more hawkish tone in its May meeting, causing a market sell-off.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Strong corporate earnings, particularly in the tech sector, combined with economic data indicating cooling inflation and resilient growth, give the Federal Reserve reason to signal a more dovish policy stance, boosting investor confidence and pushing the index higher.",
    "rationale": "My forecast is based on the slight historical upward bias of the equity market, balanced against significant near-term event risk. The market's direction in May 2025 will be heavily influenced by a confluence of catalysts. As noted, earnings from over 180 S&P 500 companies, including tech giants, and key economic indicators such as Q1 GDP and PCE inflation, will be released. The most pivotal event will be the Federal Reserve's policy meeting on May 7. The market's performance for the month likely hinges on the Fed's interpretation of this data and its resulting forward guidance. The status quo, a slow upward grind, favors a 'Yes' outcome. My forecast is not higher than 55% because the risk of a hawkish Fed response to a hot inflation print is substantial and could easily push the market down. My forecast is not lower than 50% because the underlying momentum of the market is positive, and corporate and economic resilience could outweigh policy concerns. I would increase my forecast to over 65% if the PCE inflation data comes in below expectations and the Fed signals a dovish stance. Conversely, I would decrease my forecast to below 40% if inflation is surprisingly high and the Fed explicitly entertains further rate hikes.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill the S&P 500 index go up in May 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nNY Times: [What Is a Bear Market? Are We in One?](https://www.nytimes.com/article/bear-market-stocks-tariffs.html)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question will resolve as Yes if the closing value of the S&P 500 Index on the final trading day of May 2025 is higher than that of the final trading day of April 2025.\n\nThe \"close\" values shown on the [history page of Yahoo finance](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/%5EGSPC/history?p=%5EGSPC) will be used.\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nSeveral market-moving events are scheduled for late April and early May 2025.

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
