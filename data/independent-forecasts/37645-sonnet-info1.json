  "information": "Student-led protests demanding the immediate dissolution of parliament and early elections have been ongoing in Serbia for over six months, originating from a tragic canopy collapse in Novi Sad in November 2024. Protestors threatened to escalate their actions if their demands were not met by mid-May. A survey conducted by the CRTA research center indicated that 59% of Serbian citizens support the students' actions. However, reports also suggest that the momentum of the protests has been waning and the political opposition remains fragmented.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Approximately 47 days (until July 1, 2025)",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No announcement of a general election date",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "The Serbian government weathers the current political crisis following the PM's resignation. Despite ongoing protests and public pressure, the protest momentum continues to wane as reported. The fragmented political opposition fails to unite or capitalize on the situation. The government appoints a new PM and continues governing without calling snap elections, making no announcement of an election date by July 1, 2025.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "The PM's resignation triggers a deeper political crisis. The student protests escalate as threatened now that their mid-May deadline has passed, drawing larger crowds and more public support. The government, facing mounting pressure from both street protests and potential political instability, decides that early elections are necessary to restore legitimacy. An official announcement of a specific election date is made before July 1, 2025, though the election itself may be scheduled for later.",
    "rationale": "This forecast must weigh several competing factors within a tight 47-day window. The status quo strongly favors no announcement, as governments typically resist calling snap elections unless absolutely forced. Key factors supporting a lower probability include: (1) reports that protest momentum is waning despite six months of demonstrations, (2) the political opposition remains fragmented and unable to present a unified alternative, and (3) the short timeframe means rapid political developments would be required. However, several factors prevent this from being a very low probability: (1) the PM's resignation is confirmed, creating genuine political instability, (2) 59% public support for the protests is substantial, (3) we are exactly at the protestors' mid-May escalation deadline, creating a critical juncture, and (4) the question only requires an announcement, not the actual election, which lowers the bar. The fragmented opposition is particularly important - without a credible alternative, the government has less incentive to call elections they might lose control over. For my forecast to move higher, I would need evidence of: protests actually intensifying post-deadline, opposition parties unifying, or major coalition partners demanding elections. For it to move lower, I would need: protest collapse, successful government stabilization, or clear signals they will ride out the crisis. Given strong status quo bias but real political instability, I estimate a 30% probability.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill Serbia announce a general election before July 1, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\n[Serbia could face snap elections as PM’s resignation confirmed](https://tvpworld.com/85681783/serbia-could-face-snap-elections-as-pms-resignation-confirmed-)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if, before July 1, 2025, a specific date on which a general election will be held is officially announced by the government of Serbia or any of its agencies that have the authority to do so. If no such announcement occurs before July 1, 2025, this question resolves as **No**.\n\nThe election does not have to be held before July 1, 2025; this question resolves based on an announcement.\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nStudent-led protests demanding the immediate dissolution of parliament and early elections have been ongoing in Serbia for over six months, originating from a tragic canopy collapse in Novi Sad in November 2024. Protestors threatened to escalate their actions if their demands were not met by mid-May.

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
