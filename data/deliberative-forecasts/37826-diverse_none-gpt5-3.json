    "review": "Forecaster 2’s reasoning closely matches my own: base rates are low, the June-only window is tight, and a major trigger would be needed. They add no new evidence but frame the trigger-dependency well. I find their 5% reasonable.\n\nForecaster 3 places substantial weight on the existence of a Wikipedia page implying an ongoing conflict. That’s a weak signal without corroboration and can reflect low-level incidents or incomplete/contested edits. More importantly, they misstate the 2019 Balakot precedent; Balakot is in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa (Pakistan proper), which actually supports the idea that such strikes are possible but still rare and trigger-dependent. Given the lack of concrete indicators (e.g., a mass-casualty attack in India, mobilization, NOTAMs, escalatory rhetoric), 18% appears too high for a 30-day window.\n\nNet: No compelling new argument to materially change my prior; if anything, Forecaster 3’s factual slip reduces confidence in their higher estimate.",
    "rationale": "As of May 22, there are nine days until the window opens and thirty days in the window. A cross-border kinetic strike into Pakistan proper (Sindh, Baluchistan, Punjab, or Khyber Pakhtunkhwa) is historically rare and typically contingent on a severe, proximate trigger (e.g., Pulwama 2019). Nuclear deterrence, escalation risks, and expected international pressure constrain Indian options absent such a trigger. Many ongoing India–Pakistan frictions manifest along the LoC and would not satisfy the geography in this question.\n\nThe inclusion of a Wikipedia page titled “2025 India–Pakistan conflict” is too weak on its own to infer elevated odds of a June strike into Pakistan proper; even if there is some ongoing tension, it does not by itself imply a decision to cross the international border in June. With no evidence of a fresh mass-casualty attack in India tied to Pakistan-based groups, unusual Indian military preparations, or escalatory official rhetoric, the base rate for a kinetic strike in that specific month remains low.\n\nI would update sharply upward upon credible reports of a major terrorist attack in India linked to Pakistan-based groups, visible IAF/Army mobilization (e.g., forward deployments, NOTAMs, airspace changes), or explicit retaliatory signaling by senior leadership. I would update downward if the border remains quiet into mid-June and/or if de-escalatory diplomacy is evident. Lacking such signals, I maintain a low—but non-zero—probability driven by the 2019 precedent and the possibility of a sudden trigger.",
