  "information": "In March 2025, news outlets including The Wall Street Journal reported that the US and China were in the early stages of discussing a potential 'birthday summit' for June, as Trump's birthday is on June 14 and Xi's is on June 15. The status of these discussions is uncertain. In early May 2025, Chinese President Xi Jinping is on a state visit to Russia from May 7 to 10 to meet with President Vladimir Putin and attend Victory Day celebrations. Topics for their discussion include strategic relations and the US tariff war.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "39 days. The outcome will be known on June 15, 2025.",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No. High-level diplomatic calls between rival powers like the US and China do not happen spontaneously. They are typically the result of extensive negotiations and planning. The current tense diplomatic environment over tariffs suggests that without a significant new development, such a call is unlikely to be arranged and executed within the short time frame.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "The preliminary discussions for a 'birthday summit' reported in March fail to gain traction. Following President Xi's state visit to Russia, China's stance on the US tariff war hardens, and Beijing sees no advantage in a high-level call with President Trump. No pressing crisis emerges that would necessitate bypassing normal diplomatic channels, and the June 15 deadline passes without an acknowledged phone call.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "The 'birthday summit' discussions mature into a concrete plan for de-escalation. Both sides agree that a direct phone call between the leaders is a necessary next step to prepare for a future meeting or to signal a thaw in relations. The call is scheduled to coincide with their birthdays in mid-June, providing a convenient and positive pretext. Both the White House and the Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs subsequently confirm the call took place.",
    "rationale": "My forecast is based on a balance between the strong inertia of the status quo and a specific piece of intelligence suggesting a potential change. The status quo, characterized by US-China tensions over tariffs, heavily favors a 'No' outcome. Such high-level calls are rare, formally arranged, and require a compelling reason. However, the report of discussions around a 'birthday summit' is a significant factor pointing towards 'Yes'. This provides a specific, plausible mechanism and timeline that aligns perfectly with the question's resolution window. The proximity of Trump's birthday (June 14) and Xi's (June 15) offers a convenient diplomatic opening. The strict resolution criteria, requiring acknowledgment from both sides, increases the barrier for a 'Yes' outcome and reinforces the baseline assumption of no call. The uncertainty around the status of the summit talks and the potential impact of Xi's current meeting with Putin are key variables. My probability of 40% reflects that while a call is less likely than not, the existence of the summit discussions creates a substantial and non-trivial possibility of it occurring. The forecast is not lower because the 'birthday summit' reporting is a specific and highly relevant piece of information. It is not higher because the talks were described as being in their 'early stages' back in March, with their current status unknown, and diplomatic inertia is a powerful force. I would increase my forecast upon receiving credible reports that the summit talks are progressing, and I would decrease it if the US-China rhetoric sharpens significantly following the Xi-Putin meeting.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill Donald Trump and Xi Jinping speak on the phone with each other before June 15, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nCBS News: [Trump says he's talked with Xi about tariffs. China has denied talks are taking place](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/trump-xi-china-tariffs/)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if, after May 12, 2025 and before June 15, 2025, Donald Trump and Xi Jinping speak on the phone with each other, according to [credible sources](https://www.metaculus.com/faq/#definitions).\n\nBoth sides must acknowledge the phone call took place for it to count. \"Speak on the phone with each other\" is defined as both individuals, from different physical spaces, orally uttering words intended for the other individual into a telephone or equivalent device, those words being converted into electrical or digital signals in real time, and then transferred to the other individual via telecommunications links, where they are reconverted into sound waves at the other individual's listening device.\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nIn March 2025, news outlets including The Wall Street Journal reported that the US and China were in the early stages of discussing a potential 'birthday summit' for June, as Trump's birthday is on June 14 and Xi's is on June 15.

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
