  "information": "On April 4, 2025, a NOAA spokesperson stated that the agency's websites will remain online. Following an internal memo that had warned of potential data loss if sites went down, the spokesperson confirmed, 'There will be no interruption in service. All NOAA Research sites will remain online.' The statement specifically referred to websites connected to NOAA's Office of Oceanic and Atmospheric Research, which focus on climate change, extreme weather research, and drought monitoring.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "1 month and 10 days",
    "status_quo_outcome": "Yes. The website is currently online and the operating agency, NOAA, has publicly stated its intention to keep it online.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "A sudden, high-level policy directive is issued to remove climate-related information from government websites, or a severe, unresolved technical event (like a targeted cyberattack or major infrastructure failure) takes the site offline through the resolution date.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "NOAA continues its standard operations, maintaining the website as part of its public information mission. The agency's recent public commitment to service continuity is upheld, and no significant technical or political disruptions occur.",
    "rationale": "My forecast is heavily based on the status quo and strong, recent evidence supporting its continuation. The website is currently online. Crucially, a NOAA spokesperson provided a direct and unequivocal statement on April 4, 2025, asserting, 'There will be no interruption in service. All NOAA Research sites will remain online.' This statement directly addresses the potential risks of data being taken offline and provides a high degree of confidence, especially given the very short time frame of approximately 40 days until the resolution date. The inertia of a large government agency makes an abrupt reversal on such a public commitment unlikely in this time period.\n\nMy forecast is not higher because of the non-zero probability of unforeseen 'black swan' events. This includes a major technical failure, a significant and successful cyberattack against government infrastructure, or a sudden, drastic political reversal from a level above NOAA that overrides the agency's stated intentions. The historical precedent of administrations removing data, as mentioned in the background, confirms that such actions are within the realm of possibility, even if highly improbable in the current context and short timeframe.\n\nMy forecast is not lower because the official, specific, and recent statement from NOAA constitutes very strong evidence that outweighs the historical concerns. To justify a lower probability, I would need to see new information that directly contradicts or undermines the spokesperson's statement, such as news of an impending government shutdown, a new executive order targeting climate science websites, or internal reports of severe technical vulnerabilities.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill NOAA's Climate.gov still be online on July 1, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nNational Security Archive: [Disappearing Data: Trump Administration Removing Climate Information from Government Websites](https://nsarchive.gwu.edu/briefing-book/climate-change-transparency-project-foia/2025-02-06/disappearing-data-trump)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if Climate.gov is online according to [Is It Down Right Now?](https://www.isitdownrightnow.com/climate.gov.html) when accessed by Metaculus on or after July 1, 2025.\n\nAs of May 7, 2025, the resolution source returns the message, \"Climate.gov is UP and reachable by us.\"\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nOn April 4, 2025, a NOAA spokesperson stated that the agency's websites will remain online. Following an internal memo that had warned of potential data loss if sites went down, the spokesperson confirmed, 'There will be no interruption in service. All NOAA Research sites will remain online.' The statement specifically referred to websites connected to NOAA's Office of Oceanic and Atmospheric Research, which focus on climate change, extreme weather research, and drought monitoring.\n\nToday is 2025-05-21.\n\nBefore answering you think:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n(e) You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
