  "information": "Direct air travel between Iraqi Kurdistan and Europe has expanded in 2025. In February, Aegean Airlines launched a direct route between Athens and Erbil, initially operating two flights per week. The new route brought the total number of countries with direct air links to Iraqi Kurdistan to 21. Following this, Athens International Airport's summer 2025 expansion plan includes new flights to Erbil operated by easyJet. Separately, German airline Eurowings has added Erbil to its summer flight plan from Cologne/Bonn airport, along with other new destinations such as Funchal and Bastia.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Approximately 5-6 weeks until July 1, 2025",
    "status_quo_outcome": "If the current situation maintains, Erbil likely has between 28-34 direct flight destinations, with summer 2025 routes beginning to be activated. The status quo suggests the threshold of 31 destinations is close to current levels or may already be exceeded.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "The current number of destinations is in the high 20s (27-30), and planned summer 2025 route expansions fail to materialize due to economic pressures, security concerns, or airline operational decisions. Some existing routes may be suspended or consolidated, preventing growth above 31 destinations.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Erbil currently has around 30 destinations, and the announced summer 2025 expansions (Athens via easyJet, Cologne/Bonn via Eurowings, and potentially other unannounced routes) successfully launch as scheduled. The optimistic tourism outlook materializes with additional carriers adding service for the summer season, pushing the total to 32+ destinations.",
    "rationale": "The research assistant's report provides several positive indicators: direct European connectivity is expanding with new routes from Athens (Aegean, easyJet) and Cologne/Bonn (Eurowings) specifically for summer 2025. By February 2025, 21 countries had direct links to Iraqi Kurdistan. Critically, 'countries' and 'destinations' differ - major regional hubs likely have multiple cities with Erbil service (e.g., multiple Turkish, Iranian, or Gulf cities). With only 5-6 weeks remaining, airline summer schedules are essentially finalized and these announced routes should be operational by July 1. The 'promising season' headline suggests confidence in summer 2025 demand. However, I lack the exact current destination count. If Erbil currently has 28-30 destinations, summer additions likely push it over 31. If it's already at 32+, the status quo maintains a Yes. The main downside risk is if current levels are 25-27 and summer growth is more modest than suggested. The threshold of 31 is quite specific, and we're in a period of expansion rather than contraction. I'm not higher (75-80%) because I don't have confirmation of the exact current count and can't verify all summer routes will definitely operate. I'm not lower (50-55%) because multiple independent sources confirm summer expansion, and the fundamentals (Kurdistan tourism push, European connectivity growth) support growth.",
