  "information": "An internal poll conducted for the Levar Stoney campaign in March 2025 showed Stoney leading the primary field with 16% support, followed by Aaron Rouse at 10%, and Ghazala Hashmi at 8%; 63% of voters were undecided. Geographically, Rouse's political base is in the Hampton Roads area (Virginia Beach/Norfolk), while Stoney's is in the Richmond metro area. Northern Virginia represents the largest voting bloc in the primary but does not have a candidate from the region.",

    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "21 days",
    "status_quo_outcome": "Levar Stoney wins the primary, as he currently leads in the available polling.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Levar Stoney leverages his early polling lead and higher name recognition from serving as mayor of Richmond to consolidate a plurality of the large undecided voter bloc, securing the nomination. Ghazala Hashmi could also emerge as a strong contender, splitting the vote in a way that prevents a Rouse victory.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Aaron Rouse sparks high turnout from his political base in the populous Hampton Roads area and successfully persuades a significant portion of the undecided voters, especially in the crucial Northern Virginia region, to overcome his current polling deficit and win the primary.",
    "rationale": "My forecast is based primarily on the March 2025 internal poll for the Stoney campaign, which represents the most current, albeit potentially biased, data point. This poll places Levar Stoney at 16%, Aaron Rouse at 10%, and Ghazala Hashmi at 8%. The most critical factor is the 63% of voters who remain undecided. This indicates a highly fluid race where the outcome is far from certain. The status quo suggests Stoney, as the current frontrunner, is the most likely winner. His 6-point lead, while not insurmountable, gives him a tangible advantage. Rouse's path to victory is clear but challenging: he must consolidate his base in Hampton Roads and significantly outperform his rivals among the undecideds, particularly in Northern Virginia, which lacks a hometown candidate. My forecast is not lower than 35% because a 6-point gap is well within the margin of error, and with a majority of the electorate still undecided, the race is wide open. Rouse has a solid base of support to build upon. My forecast is not higher than 35% because Rouse is not the frontrunner. He is starting from behind and needs to actively win over a larger share of undecided voters than the current leader. To increase my forecast, I would need to see new, independent polling showing Rouse closing the gap or taking the lead, or evidence of significant momentum such as major endorsements from Northern Virginia. Conversely, I would lower my forecast if Stoney's lead solidifies in future polls or if campaign finance reports show a significant fundraising disadvantage for Rouse.",
