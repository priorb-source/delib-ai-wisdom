  "information": "Incumbent Republican Senator Lindsey Graham, in office since 2003, has commenced his 2026 re-election campaign. He has secured endorsements from prominent party figures, including former President Donald Trump, Governor Henry McMaster, and Senator Tim Scott. On the Democratic side, Dr. Annie Andrews, a pediatrician who ran for a House seat in 2022, announced on May 29, 2025, that she would be a candidate in the 2026 Senate race.\n\nAccording to news reports from February and March 2025, U.S. Representative Ralph Norman is \"seriously considering\" a run for Governor of South Carolina in 2026, when the incumbent will be term-limited. Several outlets, including The State, Roll Call, and Politico, have noted that Norman's office has denied any plans for a Senate run. Norman has officially filed for his own House re-election.\n\nAs of late May 2025, there was no publicly available evidence of preparatory activities for a Senate campaign by Ralph Norman. Reports indicated an absence of actions typically preceding a major campaign launch, such as filings with the Federal Election Commission (FEC) for a statement of candidacy, the formation of an exploratory committee, significant staff hires, or major donor activity. The official filing period for the 2026 South Carolina primary does not open until the spring of 2026.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Approximately one month. The deadline is July 1, 2025, and today is May 30, 2025.",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No. The current trajectory indicates that Ralph Norman will not declare his candidacy for the US Senate before the deadline.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Ralph Norman continues to focus on his potential 2026 gubernatorial run and his current House duties. The deadline of July 1, 2025, passes without any announcement from him regarding a Senate candidacy, consistent with his office's prior statements and the lack of preparatory campaign activities.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "A sudden and dramatic shift in the political landscape occurs in June 2025. For instance, Senator Graham faces a significant scandal, or former President Trump unexpectedly withdraws his endorsement of Graham and publicly encourages Norman to run. In response, Norman quickly pivots from his gubernatorial considerations and makes a surprise declaration of his Senate candidacy before the July 1 deadline.",
    "rationale": "The forecast is based on overwhelming evidence that currently points away from a Senate run for Ralph Norman. Firstly, the deadline is only a month away, which is an exceptionally short timeframe to launch a credible primary challenge against a well-established incumbent like Lindsey Graham. Secondly, multiple reports indicate Norman's focus is on a potential 2026 run for Governor, not the Senate. His office has explicitly denied plans for a Senate run. Thirdly, and most critically, there is a complete absence of the logistical groundwork necessary for a major campaign. My research assistant's report confirms no FEC filings, no exploratory committee, no major staff hires, and no significant fundraising efforts for a Senate bid. Campaigns of this scale are not launched overnight in secret; their preparation is almost always visible. Finally, Senator Graham has secured key endorsements, including from Donald Trump, which creates a formidable barrier to any primary challenge. My forecast is not lower than 5% because unforeseen events can rapidly alter political calculations, and a surprise announcement, while highly improbable, cannot be entirely ruled out. My forecast is not higher because doing so would ignore the substantial and consistent evidence against such a run, including direct denials and a lack of any preparatory action. I would need to see credible evidence of campaign infrastructure being built—such as FEC filings or key staff hires—to increase this forecast.",
