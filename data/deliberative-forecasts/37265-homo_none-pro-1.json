    "review": "The other two forecasters provided reasoning that was highly aligned with my own, emphasizing bureaucratic inertia and the short timeframe as the primary drivers favoring the status quo. I found their analyses very convincing. Forecaster 3, in particular, raised an excellent point that I had not sufficiently weighed: the existence of a specific Level 4 'Do Not Travel' advisory for the high-risk region bordering Mozambique. This detail significantly strengthens the case for a 'No' outcome, as it shows the State Department is already using a more targeted tool to address the most acute threat, making a broad, country-wide escalation less likely unless the threat becomes much more widespread.",
    "rationale": "My initial forecast of 15% was based on the strong tendency for the status quo to hold over a short timeframe, balanced against the real, albeit low-probability, risk of a triggering event like a major terrorist attack. After reviewing my peers' analyses, I am updating my forecast. The key insight, raised by Forecaster 3, is that the US State Department already has a specific Level 4 advisory for the Mtwara region bordering Mozambique. This demonstrates that the most severe and geographically concentrated risk is already accounted for with a targeted warning. For the entire country's advisory to be elevated to Level 3, there would need to be a significant and widespread deterioration of security in other parts of the country, such as major cities or tourist areas. The existence of the Level 4 sub-advisory raises the bar for a country-wide change, as it provides a mechanism for warning against localized threats without altering the overall country assessment. This nuance makes a change within the next two months even less likely than I had initially estimated. Therefore, I am lowering my forecast from 15% to 10%, aligning with the other forecasters and reflecting a higher confidence in the stability of the current Level 2 advisory.",
