  "information": "Ethiopia's travel advisory from the US State Department is currently 'Level 3 – Reconsider Travel'. This was confirmed by multiple news reports from early May 2025 and a review on April 30, 2025, which did not place Ethiopia on the list of 21 countries with a 'Level 4' advisory. The State Department last downgraded Ethiopia from Level 4 to Level 3 in early 2023. While the nationwide advisory is Level 3, specific regions within Ethiopia, including Tigray and parts of Amhara, Oromia, Gambella, and Benishangul-Gumuz, carry a Level 4 warning due to localized conflicts.\n\nThe US State Department advisory system has four tiers: Level 1 (Exercise Normal Precautions), Level 2 (Exercise Increased Caution), Level 3 (Reconsider Travel), and Level 4 (Do Not Travel). As of early May 2025, 21 countries were under a Level 4 advisory for reasons including terrorism, civil unrest, war, and health emergencies. Historically, out of the 25–35 countries typically at Level 3, only 2–4 are upgraded to Level 4 in a given year. Upgrades from Level 3 to Level 4 often follow clear catalysts such as coups, invasions, airport closures, hostage incidents involving foreigners, or the ordered departure of non-essential U.S. embassy staff.\n\nOn May 1, 2025, the U.S. announced sanctions related to renewed violence in the Tigray and Amhara regions. Ethiopia has neighboring countries, specifically Sudan and South Sudan, that are already under a Level 4 advisory. As of early May 2025, there have been no reports of a new nationwide offensive, a coup attempt, or a mass-casualty event involving foreigners since the sanctions were announced.",

    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Approximately 2 months (60 days) until July 1, 2025",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No - Ethiopia maintains its current Level 3 advisory and does not get upgraded to Level 4",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Ethiopia maintains its Level 3 advisory through July 1, 2025. Regional conflicts in Tigray and Amhara remain contained and do not escalate into nationwide crisis. No major incidents involving US citizens occur, no embassy evacuations are ordered, and airports remain operational. The security situation either remains stable or gradually improves as it did leading to the 2023 downgrade from Level 4.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "A major security crisis unfolds in Ethiopia before July 1, 2025. This could include: a military coup or attempted coup; large-scale civil conflict spreading beyond regional boundaries into nationwide violence; a major terrorist attack or hostage situation involving foreigners; closure of airports preventing evacuation; or ordered departure of non-essential US embassy staff. The violence in Tigray and Amhara escalates dramatically and spreads to previously stable regions, making the entire country unsafe for travel.",
    "rationale": "The status quo strongly favors a No outcome. Ethiopia currently holds a Level 3 advisory and was actually downgraded FROM Level 4 in early 2023, indicating an improving trend. The conflicts remain regionalized rather than nationwide - only specific areas like Tigray and parts of Amhara have Level 4 warnings, not the entire country. Historical base rates suggest only 2-4 countries out of 25-35 at Level 3 get upgraded to Level 4 per year (roughly 6-16% annually, or about 1-2.7% over a 2-month period). Importantly, upgrades to Level 4 typically require clear catalysts: coups, invasions, airport closures, hostage incidents, or ordered embassy evacuations. As of May 2, 2025, none of these catalysts have occurred. The May 1 sanctions announcement indicates US concern about renewed violence but represents a measured response rather than suggesting imminent nationwide crisis. However, there are non-trivial risk factors: active renewed violence in Tigray and Amhara that prompted sanctions, multiple regions already at Level 4, neighboring countries (Sudan, South Sudan) at Level 4 showing regional instability, and Ethiopia's history of Level 4 status until recently. The 2-month timeframe is relatively short for such a significant policy change absent a major catalyst. For me to update higher, I would need to see: major escalation spreading beyond current conflict zones, incidents involving US citizens or embassy, airport closures, or ordered embassy departures. For me to update lower, I would need evidence of de-escalation, peace agreements, or improved security conditions.",
