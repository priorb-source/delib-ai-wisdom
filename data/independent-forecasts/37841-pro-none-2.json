    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Approximately one month. The festival is scheduled for June 25 to June 29, 2025.",

    "no_outcome_scenario": "Following sustained political and media pressure, and potentially due to security concerns or developments in the police investigation into the band's comments, the Glastonbury organisers announce Kneecap has been removed from the lineup.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "The Glastonbury organisers withstand the political pressure, reaffirming their commitment to artistic freedom. The controversy subsides, and Kneecap successfully performs their scheduled set at the festival.",
    "rationale": "My forecast is based on the strong influence of the status quo. Kneecap is currently on the official Glastonbury 2025 lineup, and cancelling a booked act, especially this close to the festival, is a significant step that organizers are typically reluctant to take. Glastonbury has a long-standing reputation for championing artistic freedom and weathering political controversy, suggesting a higher-than-normal tolerance for pressure. The media storm surrounding the band's controversial statements appears to have peaked in late April/early May. The fact that the organizers did not drop them then, at the height of the outrage, indicates they likely intend to stand by the booking.\n\nHowever, the probability is not higher than 75% due to the severity of the allegations. The two police reports, one concerning alleged support for proscribed terrorist groups (Hamas, Hezbollah) and another about inciting violence against politicians, represent a significant risk. If the police investigation progresses or new, damaging information comes to light, the pressure on Glastonbury could become untenable, forcing a cancellation on legal or security grounds. The risk of a renewed, successful pressure campaign from political figures or media outlets also remains a non-trivial factor.\n\nMy forecast is not lower than 75% because the primary arguments for cancellation have already been made public, and thus far, the booking has held. For the outcome to change, there would need to be a new development. Without such a catalyst, the inertia of the current lineup is the most powerful factor. I would lower my forecast if police announced formal charges or if a major festival sponsor or partner publicly called for the band's removal. I would raise it if the festival organizers or the police issued statements dismissing the complaints.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill Kneecap perform at Glastonbury 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\n[Kneecap](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kneecap_\\(band\\)) are an Irish band who have significantly risen in popularity since their formation in 2017.&#x20;\n\nThe band is a trio consisting of: \"Mo Chara\" (Liam Óg Ó hAnnaidh), \"Móglaí Bap\" (Naoise Ó Caireallain), and \"DJ Próvaí\" (J. J. Ó Dochartaigh) whose songs consist of rap in a mixture of Irish Gaelic and English giving them a unique style.\n\nNamed after a [torture technique](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kneecapping) made infamous by the Irish Republican Army, the group are no stranger to controversies. Whilst most have been minor - complaints about profanity, drug use, violence in their songs, music videos and concerts, and promotion of Irish Republicanism - the band have come under a large amount of controversy resulting in cancelled performances which initially stemmed from a Coachcella performance where the band, \"described Israel's military action in Gaza as a US-funded genocide\".&#x20;\n\nOn top of this, [two reports were made](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/cly5r4gg7l6o) to the UK Metropolitan police:\n\n> \\[...] the band allegedly call for the death of Conservative MPs. Another seems to show a band member shouting \"up Hamas, up Hezbollah\". Both groups are banned in the UK and it is a crime to express support for them.\n\n> \\[...]\n\n> They claimed that footage where they appeared to say \"the only good Tory is a dead Tory\" had been \"taken out of all context\", and apologised for the hurt caused to the families of murdered MPs Jo Cox and Sir David Amess.\n\nThe band are [due](https://www.glastonburyfestivals.co.uk/line-up/) to play at Glastonbury 2025 - the UK's largest and most prestigious music festival - however there have been [calls](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/politics/2025/04/30/kneecap-should-be-banned-full-stop-after-dead-tories-video/) for the band to be removed from the lineup.\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question will resolve as **Yes** if Kneecap officially performs at Glastonbury 2025, scheduled for June 25 to June 29, 2025.\n\n* If Glastonbury 2025 does not take place before September 1, 2025 this question will be **annulled**.\n* Officially perform is defined as a planned performance as allowed by the festival organisers.\n* Any official performance is considered sufficient for this question. If, for example, one band member is banned from the festival, the question will still resolve as **Yes** if the other member(s) perform under the name Kneecap.\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nNo additional information available.\n\nToday is 2025-05-23.\n\nBefore answering you think:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n(e) You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
