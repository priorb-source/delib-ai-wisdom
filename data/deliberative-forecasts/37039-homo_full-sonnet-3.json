    "review": "All three forecasters converged remarkably on 85-87%, focusing on the same critical insight: the resolution criteria explicitly states suspension status doesn't matter - only whether the 31% rate is LISTED in the HTS. This convergence suggests we've correctly identified the key factors. Forecaster 3 raised an excellent procedural point I should have emphasized more: governments typically modify suspension status rather than underlying HTS entries during negotiation periods. This is administratively much simpler and allows flexibility. Forecaster 2's observation that only 2 weeks have passed since the suspension announcement (April 10 to April 24) is also compelling - this reinforces how unlikely major policy changes are in such a short timeframe. The distinction between managing suspension status versus actually modifying the HTS listing is important: the former is routine administrative action, the latter requires formal regulatory changes. During a 90-day negotiation window, the path of least resistance is clearly to leave the HTS listing unchanged and only adjust suspension timing if needed.",
    "rationale": "After reviewing the other analyses, I'm strengthening my confidence slightly. The procedural argument about suspension management versus HTS modification is more powerful than I initially weighted. The administration designed the 90-day suspension specifically to maintain the tariff listing while negotiating - removing or modifying the actual HTS entry before negotiations conclude would defeat this purpose. With only 38 days until June 1 and typical trade negotiations taking months, the probability of formal HTS changes is very low. The status quo strongly favors YES: the 31% rate is already listed, suspension status is explicitly irrelevant per the resolution criteria, and there's no indication of plans to modify the listing itself rather than just manage suspension timing. The main risk remains unexpectedly rapid negotiations or unpredictable administrative action, but the procedural norms and bureaucratic inertia make this unlikely. I'm updating slightly upward to 88% to reflect the stronger procedural arguments while maintaining appropriate uncertainty about the small but real possibility of unexpected developments.",
