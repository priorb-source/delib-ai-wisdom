    "review": "The other forecasters provided critical context that I had underweighted. Forecaster 2's focus on Zimbabwe's high execution risk, evidenced by administrative churn in the first payment and the complexities of issuing 10-year treasury bonds, is a powerful argument for why a second payment might be delayed. Their framing of the first payment as potentially a 'symbolic step' after which momentum might slow is a plausible alternative to my 'start of a pattern' thesis. Forecaster 3's emphasis on the severe domestic economic crisis—drought, food insecurity—highlights urgent, competing priorities for government funds and attention that could easily sideline this issue in the short term. Both arguments compellingly challenge my initial optimism, which was based primarily on the government's international re-engagement strategy.",
    "rationale": "After reviewing my peers' analyses, I am lowering my forecast. My initial 65% probability was too heavily weighted on the clear political incentive for the Zimbabwean government to demonstrate progress to international creditors. I underestimated the practical implementation challenges. The arguments from the other forecasters regarding high execution risk, bureaucratic friction, and severe domestic economic pressures are very convincing.\n\nThe short five-week timeframe is critical. Forecaster 2 rightly pointed out that the complex process of creating and allocating the treasury bonds, which constitute 99% of the compensation, could easily slip past the June 1 deadline. Forecaster 3's point about the dire domestic situation (drought, food insecurity) adds another layer of risk, as it creates immediate and severe competition for state resources and focus. The first payment may well have been a symbolic gesture sufficient to generate goodwill for the short term, lessening the urgency for an immediate follow-up payment.\n\nI am therefore revising my forecast down by 20 percentage points, from 65% to 45%. I am not going as low as the other forecasters because I still place significant weight on the international imperative. The Mnangagwa government has staked considerable political capital on its re-engagement drive, and demonstrating a consistent pattern of payments would be a powerful signal to the IMF, World Bank, and other partners. However, the combination of logistical hurdles and competing domestic crises makes a delay the more likely outcome in this narrow window.",
