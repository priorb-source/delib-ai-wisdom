    "review": "Both forecasters emphasize the same core issues I raised: extreme phrasing risk with NYT style (they prefer “reverse repurchase,” “buyback,” “repurchase,” etc.), and the very narrow June 10–30 window. They also note two plausible hooks (China shopping trend; Russia asset policy) and that a single quoted usage anywhere in NYT would resolve Yes. I didn’t see materially new evidence, but I agree with their emphasis that NYT finance coverage nearly always uses “reverse repurchase,” which further weakens the “reverse purchase” path. Their suggested update triggers (uptake by major outlets, or NYT previewing a piece) are reasonable.",
    "rationale": "My prior was 9%. Deliberation reinforced that the primary bottleneck is exact-phrase adoption rather than newsworthiness. The China consumer-angle could yield a quote of “reverse purchasing,” but translation variance (“reverse shopping,” “daigou,” “buying trips”) is more likely. The Russia policy angle is even less likely to use “reverse purchase” given NYT’s strong preference for “buyback/reacquisition.” With no fresh signals of the exact phrasing gaining traction and a tight 21-day window, I make a small downward adjustment to reflect the stylistic headwinds while keeping a non-trivial tail for a one-off quoted usage.",
