    "review": "Forecasters 2 and 3 raised critical evidence I hadn't fully considered. Most importantly, Forecaster 2 identified that an executive order was signed 14 days ago (May 2) yet the tracker remains 'in progress' - this is highly informative about the maintainers' completion criteria. Their revealed preference strongly suggests they require more than just policy declarations. Forecaster 3's research on the Congressional appropriation through September 2027 and CPB's lawsuit is crucial structural information. If CPB has legally appropriated funds extending beyond the resolution date, then 'stopping funding' in any meaningful implementation sense becomes legally/structurally difficult within 6 weeks, regardless of executive actions. The combination of (1) maintainers' revealed higher bar for 'complete,' (2) multi-year Congressional appropriations creating legal barriers, (3) active litigation, and (4) only 6 weeks remaining creates a much more pessimistic picture than my initial assessment captured.",
    "rationale": "I'm updating significantly downward from 40% to 22%. The key factors driving this update are: (1) The maintainers have NOT marked the objective complete despite an executive order being in place for two weeks - this reveals they require actual implementation rather than policy declarations; (2) Congressional appropriations extending through September 2027 create a high legal barrier to actually stopping funds in 6 weeks; (3) The active CPB lawsuit adds further delay and complexity. My initial forecast overweighted the 'in progress' status as a positive signal and underweighted the structural barriers to rapid implementation. However, I'm not going as low as Forecaster 3's 18% because there remains some uncertainty about: (a) whether maintainers might interpret partial implementation or significant steps as 'complete,' (b) possibility of unexpected rapid administrative actions that maintainers deem sufficient, and (c) small tail risk of maintainer criteria being more flexible than the 14-day lag suggests. The 22% reflects genuine uncertainty while accounting for the strong evidence that actual funding cessation within 6 weeks faces substantial obstacles.",
