    "review": "The deliberation reveals a strong consensus among all three forecasters. We have independently arrived at the same 2% probability based on the same core reasoning: Libya's profound political fragmentation and institutional paralysis make ratification of a major treaty within the next two months exceptionally unlikely. The other forecasters' arguments regarding the persistence of the status quo, the short timeline, and the focus of Libyan leaders on domestic power struggles align perfectly with my own assessment. Forecaster 2 raised a useful, specific scenario I hadn't explicitly considered: a unilateral ratification attempt by one faction to gain legitimacy. While this doesn't change the overall probability, it adds a valuable nuance to the rationale for why the forecast is not absolute zero. Their analyses provide no new evidence or counterarguments that would warrant a change in my forecast; instead, they strongly reinforce its foundation.",
    "rationale": "After reviewing the analyses of the other forecasters, my confidence in my initial assessment is reinforced. There is a clear and unanimous consensus that Libya's long-standing political division between rival governments creates an environment of legislative deadlock where ratifying a complex international treaty is not a priority and is practically impossible on the given timeline. The deadline of July 1, 2025, is now less than two months away, a period insufficient for such a political process even in a stable country. The other experts and I agree that the focus of Libyan political actors remains on immediate issues of security, domestic power, and control over resources. The deliberation solidified the reasoning for maintaining a low, but non-zero, probability. The 2% chance accounts for highly improbable 'black swan' events, such as a sudden unification deal where ratification is used as a symbolic gesture, or the scenario raised by Forecaster 2 where one faction might attempt a unilateral ratification to bolster its international standing. As there is no evidence to counter this overwhelming consensus, I am maintaining my forecast.",
