    "review": "Both forecasters make compelling arguments about the power of regression to the mean with larger sample sizes. They correctly emphasize that by July 1, players will have 300-400 at-bats, which is a substantial sample where true talent levels emerge more clearly. Forecaster 2's point about elite modern hitters stabilizing around .300-.340 is particularly salient. Forecaster 3's framing of July 1 as 'roughly half a season' (80-90 games) helps contextualize just how long a period we're discussing, which I perhaps understated. Their more conservative forecasts of 10-15% versus my 25% reflect a more rigorous application of base rate reasoning given the historical rarity of sustained .400 averages even at mid-season checkpoints.",
    "rationale": "Upon reflection, I believe I was too optimistic in my initial forecast. While I correctly identified that July 1 is earlier than season-end (increasing plausibility versus finishing at .400), both forecasters make valid points that I weighted insufficiently: (1) By July 1, the sample size of 300-400 at-bats is substantial enough that regression to the mean becomes highly powerful - this isn't just a hot April anymore; (2) Historical precedent suggests that even mid-season .400 averages are exceptionally rare, not just end-of-season ones; (3) Elite modern hitters rarely sustain above .350 even temporarily. However, I maintain some optimism above their forecasts because: (1) The article reference suggests someone is currently at or near .400 in late May, meaning they've already shown some sustainability beyond tiny samples; (2) We're only 6 weeks from the evaluation date; (3) It only requires ONE player on ONE specific date across 30 teams, not sustained performance beyond that. I should update downward but not to the most pessimistic estimate.",
