  "information": "A series of polls conducted between March and June 2025 show Andrew Cuomo as the frontrunner in the Democratic primary. A SurveyUSA poll in May showed Cuomo as the first choice for 43% of likely Democratic voters, with Zohran Mamdani at 11%. A Marist poll from early May placed Cuomo at 37% and Mamdani at 18%, and a simulation showed Cuomo surpassing the 50% threshold to win in the fifth round of ranked-choice voting. An Emerson College/PIX11/The Hill poll from late May placed Cuomo at 39% to Mamdani's 23%. Earlier polls from March by Honan Strategy Group and Data for Progress also showed Cuomo leading Mamdani with 41% to 18% and 39% to 15%, respectively.\n\nAndrew Cuomo has secured endorsements from several key groups and individuals. These include Luis Dávila Pernas, the chairman of the Democratic Party of Puerto Rico; Latin music star Marc Anthony; and several Orthodox Jewish communities, including the Bobov Hasidic movement, the Crown Heights community, and the Far Rockaway Jewish Alliance. In contrast, Cuomo's primary opponent, Zohran Mamdani, has received the endorsement of Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez.\n\nFinancially, Cuomo's campaign is supported by the New York Apartment Association, which plans to spend $2.5 million on his behalf. His campaign has also run ads targeting Hispanic voters, including a $100,000 ad buy related to the Puerto Rican Day Parade. In a recent debate, all nine Democratic candidates, including Cuomo and Mamdani, were united in their pledge to protect immigrants and maintain New York's status as a sanctuary city. In a separate strategic move, Cuomo announced the founding of his own independent party, 'Fight and Deliver', while remaining in the Democratic primary race.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Approximately 15 days, with the primary scheduled for June 24, 2025.",
    "status_quo_outcome": "Based on current polling, endorsements, and financial advantages, Andrew Cuomo wins the Democratic primary and becomes the presumptive nominee.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Zohran Mamdani's momentum accelerates in the final two weeks, fueled by strong progressive turnout and a get-out-the-vote operation boosted by Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez. In the ranked-choice system, voters for other candidates list Mamdani as their second choice overwhelmingly, allowing him to surpass a sub-50% Cuomo in later rounds and pull off an upset victory.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Andrew Cuomo's consistent, double-digit polling lead holds steady through Election Day. His broad coalition of moderate Democrats, Hispanic voters, and Orthodox Jewish communities turns out reliably. His financial advantage allows for a dominant final campaign push, and he secures the nomination either with an outright majority or by picking up sufficient second-choice votes in the ranked-choice tabulation.",
    "rationale": "My forecast is based on Andrew Cuomo's commanding and consistent lead across multiple independent polls conducted over the past three months. The most recent Emerson College poll places him 16 points ahead of his nearest rival, Zohran Mamdani (39% to 23%). This polling advantage is buttressed by a broad coalition of endorsements, including key Hispanic leaders and several Orthodox Jewish communities, and is supported by a significant financial advantage, exemplified by a $2.5 million expenditure from the New York Apartment Association. Furthermore, a Marist poll simulation of the ranked-choice voting system showed Cuomo winning, which mitigates some of the uncertainty inherent in that system. \n\nMy forecast is not higher because of Mamdani's clear momentum; the polling gap has narrowed in the most recent survey, and the endorsement from Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez could energize a significant progressive turnout. Ranked-choice voting always introduces a level of unpredictability, and Cuomo's polarizing history could lead voters for other candidates to rank Mamdani ahead of him, creating a path, albeit a narrow one, for an upset. \n\nConversely, my forecast is not lower because overcoming a consistent 16-point deficit in just two weeks is a monumental task. Cuomo's near-universal name recognition and well-funded campaign provide a very high floor of support that will be difficult for a challenger to overcome in such a short timeframe. For me to lower this forecast, I would need to see new polls showing the gap in single digits or a major campaign-altering scandal affecting Cuomo directly. For me to raise it, I would need to see polls showing his lead re-widening to over 20 points.",
