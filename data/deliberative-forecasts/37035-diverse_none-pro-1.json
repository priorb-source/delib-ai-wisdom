    "review": "The other forecasters provided several compelling arguments for a lower probability. I found Forecaster 2's emphasis on the short 5-6 week timeframe and the low base rate of Level 3+ designations to be a crucial refinement. However, the most persuasive point came from Forecaster 3: the specific historical precedent of the Brazil 2017–2018 yellow fever outbreak, which remained at Level 2 despite being sizable. This is a powerful piece of evidence suggesting the CDC's threshold for escalating a notice for a vaccine-preventable disease is extremely high. Their framing of the CDC's logic—prioritizing vaccination guidance (mitigation) over travel avoidance for such diseases—clarifies why the bar for escalation is so high. Both forecasters correctly highlighted that the current situation would need to deteriorate dramatically and rapidly to trigger a change within the short resolution window.",
    "rationale": "I am updating my forecast downward significantly based on the deliberation. My initial 15% probability did not adequately account for the specific historical behavior of the CDC regarding yellow fever outbreaks. The Brazil 2017-2018 precedent, raised by Forecaster 3, is a very strong anchor suggesting that even a major outbreak of this vaccine-preventable disease is unlikely to trigger an elevation to Level 3. The CDC's established practice is to recommend mitigation (vaccination) rather than avoidance. This, combined with the strong arguments from both other forecasters about the institutional inertia and the very short timeframe (~5 weeks) for both the outbreak to worsen and the CDC to react, makes the status quo (no change) overwhelmingly the most probable outcome. My initial forecast was too sensitive to the alarming headline and did not sufficiently weigh this specific institutional history. I am therefore reducing my forecast from 15% to 7%, aligning with the view that only an unprecedented and explosive urban outbreak—a significant tail risk—would lead to a 'Yes' resolution.",
