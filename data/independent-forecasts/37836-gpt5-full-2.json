  "information": "Direct air travel between Iraqi Kurdistan and Europe has expanded in 2025. In February, Aegean Airlines launched a direct route between Athens and Erbil, initially operating two flights per week. The new route brought the total number of countries with direct air links to Iraqi Kurdistan to 21. Following this, Athens International Airport's summer 2025 expansion plan includes new flights to Erbil operated by easyJet. Separately, German airline Eurowings has added Erbil to its summer flight plan from Cologne/Bonn airport, along with other new destinations such as Funchal and Bastia.\n\nErbil International Airport has undertaken developments to enhance its operational capabilities. The airport has commenced preliminary tests for night flights after receiving clearance for night landings, as part of a strategic plan to improve air communication systems and safety. In January 2025, a committee from the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) visited the airport to conduct an inspection for its inclusion in the official list of international airports. This inclusion is expected to facilitate an increase in the number of international flights. The airport's operational capacity was also demonstrated during the Hajj season, with the Iraqi Ministry of Transportation successfully operating numerous pilgrim flights from Erbil and other Iraqi airports.\n\nBroader regional aviation activity and international interest in the area have seen recent developments. Dubai-based carrier flydubai announced the resumption of direct daily flights to Damascus, Syria, starting from June 1, 2025, after a 12-year suspension. This move is part of a wider effort to enhance regional connectivity. In a different development indicating tourism interest, British travel company Wild Frontiers is offering a 15-day tour of Iraq, which includes visits to historical sites such as the citadel of Erbil, despite official UK government warnings against travel to the country.",

    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "About 39 days (until July 1, 2025)",
    "status_quo_outcome": "Borderline but slightly below the threshold; absent further seasonal adds or announced launches materializing on FlightsFrom, the listing would likely show around the high-20s to low-30s destinations, implying No if it stays as-is.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Several planned/announced summer routes (e.g., Turkish leisure or new European links) slip or are canceled, and/or security or regulatory events prompt temporary suspensions (e.g., to KSA, Lebanon, or Turkey), keeping the FlightsFrom listing at 31 or fewer on/after July 1.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Seasonal summer routes to Turkish coastal and secondary cities come online; recent additions such as Aegean’s Athens–Erbil and Eurowings’ Cologne/Bonn–Erbil are reflected; a few Gulf/Levant routes persist into July. FlightsFrom’s summer schedule view shows 32+ destinations on/after July 1.",
    "rationale": "Key driver is how many destinations FlightsFrom lists for the S25 season when checked on/after July 1. Seasonal summer services tend to lift Erbil’s count, especially to multiple Turkish airports (IST, SAW, Antalya, Izmir, Trabzon, possibly Adana/Gaziantep/Ankara), plus robust Gulf connectivity (DXB, SHJ, DOH, KWI, potentially AUH/RUH/JED) and core regional links (AMM, CAI). The research assistant reports a new Aegean Athens–Erbil route (launched Feb 2025) and Eurowings adding Erbil from Cologne/Bonn for summer 2025; both, if reflected on FlightsFrom, push the count upward. I discount the claim about easyJet operating ATH–EBL as relatively unlikely, but even without it, summer-season Turkish leisure routes and the Aegean/Eurowings adds make >31 plausible. Airport operational improvements (night operations testing, ICAO inspection visit) are supportive but likely marginal for July 1 listings. Hajj flights to JED/MED may be tapering after mid-June; however, FlightsFrom’s seasonal listing often includes routes operating at any point in the current season, not just on a specific date, which slightly boosts odds. Why not higher: several risks could keep the count ≤31—late-start routes beginning after July, carriers removing thin routes, or temporary suspensions due to security/airspace issues (a non-trivial recurring risk for Erbil). Why not lower: the baseline already features many Gulf/Turkey links, and summer usually adds Turkish leisure/secondary cities; two European adds (ATH, CGN) materially help. Upward update triggers: confirmation on FlightsFrom of multiple Turkish seasonal additions and the Eurowings/Aegean entries, or additional Gulf/Saudi routes listed. Downward update triggers: indications on FlightsFrom of cancellations/suspensions (e.g., Beirut, parts of KSA or Turkey), or if some announced routes do not appear in S25 listings by late June.",
