  "information": "On January 20, 2025, U.S. President Donald Trump signed Executive Order 14172, ordering the renaming of the U.S. continental shelf off the coasts of Texas, Louisiana, Mississippi, Alabama, and Florida to the 'Gulf of America'. Subsequently, he declared February 9 as the 'Day of the Gulf of America'. In response, several U.S. federal agencies have begun using the new name. The National Hurricane Center (NHC) updated its website graphics and tropical weather bulletins to use 'Gulf of America', and the U.S. Coast Guard has used the term in an official press release.\n\nThe adoption of the name 'Gulf of America' has varied among non-governmental entities. Google updated its Maps service to display 'Gulf of America' for users in the United States, while in other regions, both names are sometimes used. As of late January 2025, other major map publishers like National Geographic and Apple had not made the change. The renaming has generated international controversy, with Mexican officials, including President Claudia Sheinbaum, protesting the unilateral change. The International Hydrographic Organization, which works to standardize the names of bodies of water, has not officially recognized the new name.\n\nThe name 'Gulf of Mexico' has been established for centuries, dating back to the 16th century. The body of water is bordered by the United States, Mexico, and Cuba and is considered international waters under the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea. A previous proposal to rename it the 'Gulf of America' in 2012 was not approved. The website in question, WorldAtlas.com, is a Canadian-based company. While its main North America map currently displays 'Gulf of Mexico', the title of its specific article on the gulf reads: 'Gulf Of Mexico (Gulf of America)'.",

    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "54 days until July 1, 2025",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No - WorldAtlas.com's North America page currently displays 'Gulf of Mexico' not 'Gulf of America'",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "WorldAtlas.com maintains its current North America map showing 'Gulf of Mexico', choosing not to adopt the controversial U.S. naming convention as a Canadian company following international standards, especially given that the International Hydrographic Organization has not recognized the change and Mexico strongly disputes it.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "WorldAtlas.com updates its North America page map to show 'Gulf of America' or both names, following the lead of U.S. federal agencies and Google Maps, particularly since their article title already acknowledges both names as 'Gulf Of Mexico (Gulf of America)', suggesting editorial awareness of the change.",
    "rationale": "The status quo strongly favors No. While Trump's Executive Order was signed on January 20, 2025, and U.S. federal agencies have adopted the new name, over 3.5 months have passed without WorldAtlas updating their North America map. Key considerations: (1) WorldAtlas is Canadian-based and not bound by U.S. executive orders; (2) The International Hydrographic Organization has not recognized the change; (3) Mexico strongly opposes it and this affects international waters; (4) Major competitors like National Geographic and Apple have not changed as of late January; (5) Most tellingly, WorldAtlas's article title already includes both names, yet they haven't updated the map itself, suggesting deliberate editorial caution. The fact that only Google (which customizes by location) has changed among major map publishers, combined with the 3+ month delay despite article-level acknowledgment, indicates WorldAtlas is likely waiting for broader international consensus. For my forecast to increase, I'd need evidence of: other major non-U.S. map publishers making the change, International Hydrographic Organization movement toward recognition, or specific signals that WorldAtlas plans to update. For it to decrease further: explicit statements they won't change, or reaching late June without any movement. The long delay after demonstrable awareness (article title change) is the strongest signal they're unlikely to update the map in the remaining 54 days.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill WorldAtlas.com display the body of water northwest of the Caribbean Sea as the Gulf of America before July 1, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nWorld Atlas article: [Gulf Of Mexico (Gulf of America)](https://www.worldatlas.com/gulfs/gulf-of-mexico.html)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if, before July 1, 2025, the World Atlas website at its [North America](https://www.worldatlas.com/webimage/countrys/na.htm) page displays the body of water west of Florida, south of Louisiana and north of the Yucatán Peninsula as the Gulf of America. (At the time of this question, the name displayed is the Gulf of Mexico.)\n\nIn case both names are used, for example \"Gulf of America formerly known as Gulf of Mexico,\" this question resolves as Yes. Note that verification will be from Metaculus admins accessing the webpage from the United States and that therefore resolution will be based on how the page appears when accessed from that location.\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nOn January 20, 2025, U.S. President Donald Trump signed Executive Order 14172, ordering the renaming of the U.S. continental shelf off the coasts of Texas, Louisiana, Mississippi, Alabama, and Florida to the 'Gulf of America'.

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
