  "information": "South Sudan signed the African Continental Free Trade Area (AfCFTA) agreement in 2019 but, as of early May 2025, is one of the few states that have not deposited their instruments of ratification with the African Union. The ratification process requires a bill to pass the Transitional National Legislative Assembly, be signed by the President, and have the formal instrument lodged with the AU Commission. Historically, South Sudan's legislative processes can be lengthy; for example, the country took six years to ratify the Maputo Protocol.\n\nThe government of South Sudan is currently focused on several pressing domestic issues, including a delayed peace roadmap and preparations for national elections scheduled for December 2025. The country is also facing a fiscal crisis following a collapse in oil revenue due to a shutdown of a Red Sea pipeline. Further complicating the political landscape, the Vice-President and other senior officials were arrested in late April 2025. The national legislature has been meeting infrequently, sitting for only 32 days in the second half of 2024, and its published calendar for May-June 2025 includes no trade-related bills. Additionally, the Finance Ministry has not budgeted for the obligations associated with AfCFTA ratification, such as tariff reductions.\n\nOn the continental level, the AfCFTA has achieved 92% consensus on trade rules, with 49 of 54 African countries having joined the agreement. To support implementation, initiatives such as the Pan-African Payment and Settlement System (PAPSS) have been introduced. Within South Sudan, both the Chamber of Commerce and the Ministry of Trade have publicly advocated for ratification, with the Trade Minister reaffirming the government's commitment at an April 2025 summit. In February 2025, the East African Community (EAC) launched a new trade committee in South Sudan to help harmonize standards with the AfCFTA framework.",

    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "About 60 days (until July 1, 2025)",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "The Transitional National Legislative Assembly does not table or pass the AfCFTA ratification bill before mid-June, or passes it late but the executive fails to prepare and deposit the instrument of ratification with the AU Commission by July 1 due to competing priorities (election prep, peace roadmap, fiscal crisis) and limited parliamentary sittings.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "The cabinet fast-tracks AfCFTA ratification as an urgent item; TNLA passes the bill in May/June, the President promptly signs, and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs deposits the instrument of ratification with the AU in Addis Ababa before July 1—possibly timed with regional/AU engagements and backed by EAC/Chamber of Commerce advocacy.",
    "rationale": "I put extra weight on the status quo: South Sudan signed AfCFTA in 2019 but still hasn’t ratified. Legislative processes are often slow (e.g., six years to ratify the Maputo Protocol). As of early May 2025, instruments have not been deposited with the AU, and TNLA has met infrequently (only 32 sitting days in H2 2024) with no trade bills on the current May–June calendar. The government is burdened by a delayed peace roadmap, preparations for December 2025 elections, and a severe fiscal shock from disrupted oil revenue. These factors make near‑term legislative focus on a trade treaty less likely. Even if TNLA passes a bill, timely preparation and deposit of the instrument is a further step that can slip.\n\nAgainst that, there are modest tailwinds: AfCFTA momentum continent‑wide (49/54 in), an EAC committee launched in South Sudan to harmonize standards, and public pro‑ratification signals from the Trade Ministry and Chamber of Commerce. Politically, ratification is a relatively low‑cost signal that could be fast‑tracked if the presidency prioritizes it; implementation costs can be phased later.\n\nWhy not higher: short time window (~60 days), sparse parliamentary sittings, crowded political agenda, fiscal constraints, and no visible placement of an AfCFTA bill on the order paper. Why not lower: explicit government and business advocacy, regional support infrastructure (EAC, PAPSS), and the possibility of executive fast‑tracking plus rapid deposit.\n\nUpdates that would move me up: cabinet approval and gazetting of an AfCFTA ratification bill; TNLA scheduling/first reading; public statements committing to deposit by a specific date; reports of the instrument being prepared by Foreign Affairs/Justice; AU acknowledgment of receipt. Updates that would move me down: TNLA adjourns without tabling; further political/security shocks; Finance/Trade ministries signaling deferral to post‑election; continued absence of the bill on the legislative calendar into mid‑June.",

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower.
