    "review": "All three forecasters converge on the 80-87% range, indicating strong agreement on the core logic: bureaucratic inertia and the short timeline (6 weeks) favor the status quo. However, Forecaster 3 raises a critical point I underweighted: the resolution hinges on the EXACT phrase 'snack foods,' not on actual policy. This creates vulnerability to simple editorial/messaging changes that don't require formal rulemaking. Given political rhetoric about restricting 'bad food,' there could be pressure to remove or soften language appearing to endorse junk food purchases - achievable through a straightforward website update rather than policy change. Forecaster 3's distinction between policy changes (months/years) and communications changes (potentially faster) is important. Forecaster 2's analysis closely parallels mine but doesn't emphasize this editorial risk. The narrow resolution criterion means even rephrasing to 'snacks' or 'snack items' would resolve as No. However, I find Forecaster 3's 80% slightly too low because even minor web updates typically require internal approvals, and there's no concrete evidence of imminent changes to this specific page. The phrase has been standard USDA language for years, and 6 weeks remains very short even for messaging adjustments in a large bureaucracy.",
    "rationale": "I'm adjusting my forecast downward from 87% to 84% based on Forecaster 3's compelling argument about the exact phrase requirement and communications vs policy distinction. The key insight is that a No outcome doesn't require policy change - just a website editorial decision to remove or rephrase 'snack foods.' Given recent political rhetoric, this messaging shift is more plausible than I initially weighted. However, I'm not going as low as 80% because bureaucratic inertia applies even to minor website updates, typically requiring multiple approvals. The USDA FNS website is a canonical reference document that agencies tend to modify cautiously. With no concrete evidence of imminent changes and only 6 weeks remaining, the status quo remains heavily favored. The base rate for government website stability over short periods is high, and the specific phrase has been stable for years across USDA materials.",
