    "review": "Both forecasters present compelling evidence that I completely missed - two major coordinated protest waves have already occurred in 2025: the April 5 'Hands Off!' protests (~600,000 participants across 1,200-1,400 events) and the May 1 '50501' protests (over 1,100 events with union backing). This is critical new information that fundamentally changes my analysis. Forecaster 3's mathematical reasoning is sound - while the average was 428-500 per event for April 5, large coordinated US protests typically concentrate participants in major metropolitan areas, making 10,000+ at flagship locations (DC, NYC, LA, Chicago) highly plausible. Forecaster 2's point about union involvement in May Day protests is also compelling - union-backed protests historically achieve strong turnout. However, I notice both forecasters may be somewhat optimistic. The central question is not just whether these protests occurred or whether any reached 10,000+, but whether the Global Protest Tracker HAS REPORTED or WILL REPORT them. We have no confirmation that the tracker has documented these events yet, and we don't know their selection criteria or reporting delays. The tracker may focus on international protests or have different methodology. Additionally, while the math suggests large concentration is likely, we lack concrete evidence that any single location actually exceeded 10,000.",
    "rationale": "I must significantly update upward from my initial 30% forecast based on the two major coordinated protest waves already documented in 2025. The April 5 and May 1 protests represent substantial mobilization with sophisticated organizing infrastructure. Basic probability suggests that across 2,300-2,500 total protest events with hundreds of thousands of participants, at least one flagship event in a major city likely exceeded 10,000. However, several uncertainties prevent me from updating as high as 87%: (1) We lack confirmation that the Global Protest Tracker has documented either wave; (2) The tracker's methodology and selection criteria remain unclear - it may focus primarily on international protests or have specific requirements; (3) While concentration in major cities is typical, we have no verified attendance figures confirming any location reached 10,000; (4) Reporting delays could mean events won't appear before July 1 even if they qualify. These uncertainties are substantial enough to warrant caution. My updated forecast balances the strong evidence of major protest activity against the critical dependency on what this specific tracker reports. I weight toward Yes because two major waves plus two months remaining creates multiple opportunities for the resolution criteria to be met, but maintain meaningful probability for No due to tracker-specific uncertainties.",
