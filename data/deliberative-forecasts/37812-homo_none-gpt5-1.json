    "review": "Both forecasters emphasize schedule inertia with ~6 weeks to go and the fragility of European/leisure adds under current security and insurance conditions. They also highlight that frequency increases won’t raise the destination count, so clearing >51 likely hinges on a handful of marginal seasonal routes (Turkish coastal, Greek, Egyptian resorts) and any West Africa resumptions. I hadn’t explicitly weighed West Africa as an upside path, nor emphasized as strongly the timing constraint (late May) limiting new resumptions. Their framing that Metaculus will check on/after July 1 also raises the risk that any late‑June flare‑ups could temporarily depress the listing at the exact check time. Overall, their arguments are convincing and support leaning more heavily on the status quo and downside tail risk.",
    "rationale": "I still see two plausible paths: (1) No — if the current network sits in the mid‑40s to high‑40s and only limited seasonal adds appear, or if late‑June security disruptions trigger temporary suspensions; (2) Yes — if MEA plus regional carriers sustain a broad Gulf/Iraq/Egypt/Turkey web and multiple seasonal Europe/leisure points (and possibly a West Africa point) are active in early July. However, the balance of evidence favors the status quo being below the threshold and the short runway to July reduces odds of multiple new destinations coming online in time. The “summer canceled” narrative and risk‑averse European leisure carriers further dampen the upside. I’m trimming my forecast downward to reflect higher weight on current schedules and check‑date fragility. Change: 46% -> 41% (-5pp).",
