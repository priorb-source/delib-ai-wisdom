    "review": "Forecaster 2 correctly notes that a +0.3 pp revision from the second estimate (-0.2%) is needed to clear the >0.0% bar and that imports are a volatile revision channel. However, they lean heavily on the 35–40% advance-to-third base rate, which isn’t the right frame at this stage; from second to third, typical revisions are only ~0.1–0.2 pp, making a +0.3 pp move atypical. Their claim that trade could “easily” swing the final number seems overstated given second-to-third historical magnitudes.\n\nForecaster 3’s analysis overweights “positive momentum” from advance to second (which has weak predictive power for second-to-third) and cites the average advance-to-third revision (~0.5 pp) rather than the relevant second-to-third revision size. They also imply +0.2 pp could be sufficient, but the criterion requires >0.0%, so a +0.3 pp revision is needed. Their use of the 35–40% base rate is again misapplied to the wrong revision window.\n\nNet: Both analyses reaffirm the plausible revision channels (imports/net trade, inventories) but do not introduce new concrete data indicating a large second-to-third upward revision. Their probabilities seem a bit high given the required +0.3 pp move and the historical distribution of second-to-third changes.",
    "rationale": "My prior (30%) already balanced: (1) the import-driven drag offers an upside-revision channel, (2) we’re close to zero, and (3) third estimates incorporate fuller March trade/services and inventory data—against (4) the need for an unusually large second-to-third revision and (5) low base rates for sign flips at this stage. The other forecasters did not provide new empirical evidence about March trade/services or inventories that would materially raise the likelihood of a ≥+0.3 pp move. Given that, and correcting for their reliance on advance-to-third statistics and the threshold misinterpretation, I see no reason to move off 30%.\n\nI would revise up if there were credible indications that the ITA annual updates or finalized March trade/services data substantially reduce imports or raise services exports (or if inventory/comprehensive revisions imply a ≥+0.3 pp boost). Absent that, the modal second-to-third revision is too small to flip the sign.",
