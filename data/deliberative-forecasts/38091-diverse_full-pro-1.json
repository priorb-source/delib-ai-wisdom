    "review": "My initial forecast was 55%. I found the deliberation with the other forecasters highly valuable, particularly the analysis from Forecaster 3. Forecaster 2 provided a useful quantitative baseline using a Poisson model (yielding 45%), appropriately emphasizing the strength of the status quo and the lack of a specific, public announcement for June. This provided a solid note of caution. However, Forecaster 3's analysis was more compelling and introduced crucial new evidence I had not considered. Their identification of specific international forums occurring in June—such as the UN Committee on the Peaceful Uses of Outer Space (COPUOS) session—that have historically served as venues for such announcements is a very strong argument. This provides a concrete mechanism and opportunity for a signing to occur within the resolution window. Furthermore, Forecaster 3's point that signings are often announced with little advance notice effectively counters one of the main arguments for a 'No' outcome, which I and Forecaster 2 had relied upon.",
    "rationale": "I am updating my forecast upward from 55% to 63%. The primary driver for this change is the new evidence and reasoning presented by Forecaster 3. My initial forecast was based on the general positive momentum from recent signings and the forward-looking statement from NASA's acting administrator. While I correctly identified these as positive signals, my analysis lacked a specific reason to believe a signing would occur in *June* specifically. Forecaster 3's identification of the UN COPUOS meeting and other potential June venues provides that specific, time-bound catalyst. These events lower the logistical barrier for a signing ceremony and provide a natural stage for such an announcement. This new evidence substantially increases the probability of a 'Yes' outcome. The argument that major announcements are often made at the last minute also forces me to discount the 'lack of public statements' as a negative indicator. While Forecaster 2's caution about the status quo remains valid and prevents a much higher forecast, the combination of the high recent signing rate (nearly one per month since late 2024), explicit near-term expectations from NASA leadership, and now concrete, plausible venues in June makes a signing more likely than not.",
