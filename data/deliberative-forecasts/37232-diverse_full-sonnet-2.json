    "review": "All three forecasters converge on similar reasoning and a tight forecast range (68-75%), which increases my confidence in the analytical framework. Forecaster 2 emphasizes the reliability of established patterns and weights the 'siloing' of financial news more heavily, reaching 75%. Forecaster 3 mirrors my analysis almost exactly at 68%, explicitly noting that roughly half of recent months had posts, which moderates confidence in a quiet May. No forecaster raised evidence I hadn't considered - we're all working from the same key facts: the three-month gap, the 50% base rate over 10 months, the Q4 earnings precedent not appearing on News, and the flight hiatus context. The main disagreement is whether to weight the recent pattern (favoring no posts) versus the base rate (suggesting posts are still plausible).",
    "rationale": "After reviewing the other forecasts, I'm considering whether to move slightly higher toward Forecaster 2's 75%. The strongest argument for this is that the pattern of irregular posting combined with the specific precedent of earnings not appearing on the News page creates a more reliable prediction than the raw 50% base rate suggests. However, I remain concerned that 75% may be overconfident. The key counterpoint is that 5 out of 10 months DID have posts, and we're at the very beginning of May with a full month ahead. Corporate communications can be unpredictable, and the Delta SpaceShip assembly represents a legitimate potential catalyst even without specific signals. The flight hiatus reduces but doesn't eliminate newsworthy content. A minor partnership announcement, leadership update, or manufacturing milestone could still warrant a News post. I'll move slightly upward to 70% to acknowledge the strength of recent patterns while maintaining appropriate uncertainty given the month-long window and the fact that the page hasn't been completely abandoned.",
