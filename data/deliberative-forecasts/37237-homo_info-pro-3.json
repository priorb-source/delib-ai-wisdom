    "review": "The other forecasters introduced two powerful and complementary arguments that I had not fully appreciated. Forecaster 2's point about the record-high March imports being driven by businesses front-running the tariffs is a crucial piece of the narrative. This 'pull-forward' effect provides a strong causal reason for an subsequent drop in April as companies digest their bloated inventories. Forecaster 3 provided specific, high-frequency data points for April that quantified the severity of the expected drop, citing a 30-40% decline in overall import activity and a 64% collapse in new orders. This is far more severe than the data in my initial report. Both lines of reasoning are highly convincing and, when combined, create a much stronger case for a 'No' outcome than I had originally forecast.",
    "rationale": "I am significantly lowering my forecast from 20% to 5%. My initial analysis correctly identified the negative pressure from the new tariffs but underestimated the magnitude of the impact. The other forecasters' analyses provided critical new information that paints a much clearer picture. The front-running of imports in March, as highlighted by Forecaster 2, created a predictable 'hangover' effect, setting April up for a weak performance. Forecaster 3's compelling high-frequency data—indicating a 30-40% collapse in import activity in April—confirms this anecdotally and provides a quantitative shock that is too large to ignore. It is highly improbable that growth from smaller partners like Mexico or price inflation could offset such a precipitous decline in volume from a major partner like China, especially when coupled with a pre-existing inventory glut. The combined weight of the 'pull-forward' mechanism and the severe real-time data on the subsequent collapse necessitates this downward revision. The remaining 5% probability accounts for residual uncertainty, such as the possibility that the high-frequency trackers are inaccurate or a sudden, dramatic spike in the value of a key commodity.",
