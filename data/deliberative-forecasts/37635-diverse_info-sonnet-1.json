    "review": "Forecaster 3 has made a critical data error - they claim Sheinbaum is at 76% approval, but the research assistant's report clearly states the most recent April 30, 2025 data shows Sheinbaum at 60% and Milei at 61%. Forecaster 3 appears to have confused Sheinbaum's January rating (66%) or Modi's rating (75%) with her current approval. Their entire 3% forecast is based on this faulty premise and should be disregarded. Forecaster 2's analysis is more sound - they correctly identify the razor-thin 1-point margin and raise an important point I hadn't fully weighted: the D'Alessio IROL/Berensztein survey showing Milei with net -8 approval (44% positive, 52% negative) in Argentina. This domestic polling suggests downward pressure on Milei that could erode his slim Morning Consult lead. Forecaster 2 also correctly emphasizes that the tie-as-No resolution rule creates a structural bias against Yes outcomes in what is essentially a statistical tie. Their 35% forecast may be slightly pessimistic given Milei's current lead and status quo bias, but it properly accounts for the fragility of a 1-point advantage and the negative trend indicators for Milei.",
    "rationale": "After reviewing the other forecasts, I'm updating downward from 56% to 45%. The key factors driving this revision are: (1) Forecaster 2's emphasis on the tie-as-No rule, which I underweighted - when the margin is only 1 point (well within polling noise), even a true 50-50 situation favors No; (2) The Argentine domestic polling showing net negative sentiment for Milei (-8 points) suggests continued erosion risk that could eliminate his slim advantage over 45 days; (3) While I correctly identified status quo bias, the margin is so thin that normal volatility could easily flip the outcome. I'm not going as low as Forecaster 2's 35% because: Milei does currently hold the lead; 45 days is relatively short; and both leaders have shown approval volatility, meaning Sheinbaum could also decline further. However, I'm moving significantly from my original 56% because I underestimated how the combination of (a) a 1-point margin, (b) ties counting as No, and (c) negative momentum indicators for Milei creates a situation closer to a coin flip than a modest favorite.",
