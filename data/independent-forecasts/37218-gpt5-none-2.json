    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Approximately 4–6 months (UFC PPVs are monthly; UFC 315 is likely scheduled for late summer/early fall 2025).",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "UFC 315 is held in a location Trump is less likely to visit (e.g., Canada/Europe/West Coast market he rarely attends), or his schedule/security/health/legal constraints preclude travel that weekend, so he skips it.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "UFC 315 is in Las Vegas, Miami, or the NYC/NJ area; Dana White signals he’ll be there; Trump’s public schedule or sightings confirm he arrives at the venue and appears cageside or otherwise within the grounds.",
    "rationale": "Baseline: Even for a frequent attendee like Trump, the per-event attendance rate is well below 50%. In 2023–2024 he appeared at multiple UFC PPVs (e.g., Miami, Las Vegas, NYC/NJ), suggesting a higher-than-typical propensity to attend compared to other political figures, but still only a minority of events in a given year. With roughly 12 PPVs per year and Trump showing up to a few, a base rate near 15–30% per specific PPV is reasonable.\nKey uncertainties now: (1) Venue for UFC 315 (unknown here). Trump’s attendance likelihood rises significantly if the card is in Las Vegas, South Florida, or the NYC/NJ corridor—places he’s repeatedly attended and has logistics/friendships (Dana White) to facilitate. If it’s abroad or in a less-aligned market, odds fall. (2) Trump’s 2025 obligations. If serving as President, attendance might be less frequent due to security/logistics/optics, but not impossible. If not, he may have more flexibility but also fewer reasons to appear at a specific PPV unless it’s geographically convenient or politically useful. (3) Signaling. Public hints from Dana White or Trump’s team typically precede his appearances by days to weeks and would sharply raise odds.\nWhy not higher: Unknown venue and date-specific constraints; per-event base rate is low; potential security/logistical hurdles in 2025. Why not lower: Trump’s unusually strong relationship with UFC and his recent pattern of attending multiple PPVs per year—especially in Vegas/Miami/NJ—make a random PPV more likely for him than for most public figures.\nWhat would move me up: Confirmation that UFC 315 is in Las Vegas, Miami, or the NYC/NJ area; credible reports or statements from Dana White/Trump indicating planned attendance; Trump’s travel schedule aligning with the event city. What would move me down: Announcement of a foreign or low-likelihood location; conflicting commitments; indications of reduced public event appearances around that time.\nResearch assistant summary: No additional information provided; forecast based on historical attendance patterns and typical UFC PPV cadence/locations.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill Donald Trump attend UFC 315?\n\nQuestion background:\nAP [Trump sits cageside at Miami UFC event in his latest appearance at a sports event](https://apnews.com/article/trump-ufc-miami-fight-sports-6461901bb3d5f2eec477674d02333a7f)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if President Donald Trump is anywhere within the grounds of the venue where [UFC 315](https://www.ufc.com/event/ufc-315) takes place. Otherwise this resolves as **No**.\n\n\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nNo additional information available.\n\nToday is 2025-04-28.\n\nBefore answering you think:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n(e) You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
