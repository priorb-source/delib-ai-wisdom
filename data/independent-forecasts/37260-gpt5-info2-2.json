  "information": "According to polling in late April 2025, the Alternative for Germany (AfD) party had support from 25-26% of voters, making it one of the strongest parties in Germany. Internally, the AfD leadership delayed the release of its new foundational program from 2025 to 2027, with party insiders stating the reason was to avoid public debate on contentious issues and internal party conflict ahead of state elections in 2026. In the public sphere, demonstrations protesting the AfD and right-wing extremism were held across multiple German cities on May 1, 2025. Earlier, in February 2025, a rally in Hachenburg demanding a ban on the AfD drew approximately 1,200 participants.",

    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "About 60 days (until 2025-07-01)",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Debate continues; no qualified application to the Federal Constitutional Court is filed, or even if filed, the Court does not decide before July 1. Administrative scrutiny or funding restrictions may occur, but no official ban announcement is made.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "A shock event prompts the federal government, Bundestag, or Bundesrat to file a ban application and the Federal Constitutional Court takes an extraordinarily expedited path and announces a party ban within weeks—an unprecedented timeline.",
    "rationale": "- Legal process: In Germany, only the Federal Constitutional Court can ban a political party (Basic Law Art. 21(2)). Even after a valid application by the Bundestag, Bundesrat, or Federal Government, proceedings are evidence-heavy and historically take many months to years. The 2017 NPD decision illustrates the Court’s caution and lengthy timelines. There is no realistic fast-track precedent that would deliver a final ban within ~60 days. Administrative bodies cannot ban a political party under the Associations Act.\n- Current status: A cross-party group of 124 MPs has pushed to put a motion on the agenda to initiate proceedings, but that is far from a Bundestag majority decision to file, and no filing has been reported. Without a filing, there cannot be a decision; with a filing, a decision by July 1 would still be extraordinarily unlikely.\n- Politics/public opinion: The research assistant reports AfD polling at 25–26% in late April 2025, among the strongest parties nationally. AfD delayed its foundational program, likely to avoid controversy ahead of 2026 state elections. Protests against right-wing extremism (e.g., May 1 demonstrations, earlier rallies calling for a ban) show political salience but do not shorten the legal path. High AfD support also raises the political risk of a failed or rushed ban attempt.\n- Why not higher: The decisive factor is procedural/temporal. Even if the Bundestag/Government decided to file tomorrow, the Court’s process would almost certainly extend well beyond July 1, 2025. The Court is historically reluctant to ban parties (see NPD 2017) and would demand robust evidence of both anti-constitutional aims and the party’s capacity to realize them. \n- Why not lower than this tiny probability: I leave a minimal tail risk for an extreme, unforeseen event (e.g., incontrovertible evidence of imminent violent subversion by core party leadership) prompting an emergency filing and unprecedented Court action. This is highly speculative and historically unsupported, hence very small weight.\n- What would move me upward: (1) A formal, majority-backed filing by the Bundestag, Bundesrat, or Federal Government, plus (2) the Court publicly announcing an expedited schedule specific to a potential interim or final decision before July 1 (still unlikely). (3) Major, verified security revelations tying AfD leadership to imminent violent or seditious acts that the Court deems to warrant extraordinary measures.\n- What would move me downward: Continued absence of a formal filing into June; clear statements from the federal government or Court rejecting the viability of a ban in the near term.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill Germany ban the AfD before July 1, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nLe Monde: [Germany's Bundestag debates banning far-right AfD party](https://www.lemonde.fr/en/international/article/2025/01/31/germany-s-bundestag-debates-banning-far-right-afd-party_6737637_4.html) \"A cross-party group of 124 MPs put a motion on the agenda to bring proceedings before the Federal Constitutional Court to ban the party, whose unprecedented alliance with the CDU caused a shock.\"\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if there is an official announcement of a ban on the Alternative for Germany (AfD) by a German government entity with the authority to make such an announcement (e.g., the Federal Constitutional Court).\n\n\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nAccording to polling in late April 2025, the Alternative for Germany (AfD) party had support from 25-26% of voters, making it one of the strongest parties in Germany.

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
