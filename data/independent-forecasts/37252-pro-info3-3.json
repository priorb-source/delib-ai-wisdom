  "information": "Multiple civic and political groups have been actively organizing demonstrations. The Korean Confederation of Trade Unions (KCTU) and the Democratic Labor Union held rallies for Labor Day on May 1. The KCTU has also announced its intention to organize a general strike in July. Groups such as 'Free Korea' and 'Candlelight Action' have consistently held rallies and counter-rallies in response to political developments. Conservative groups have also planned a rally for May 18th in Gwangju.",

    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "2 months",
    "status_quo_outcome": "Yes",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Political tensions in South Korea de-escalate unexpectedly following a breakthrough in negotiations concerning the presidential impeachment. As a result, planned rallies are called off or fail to attract more than 10,000 participants. Alternatively, a protest of the required size occurs but is not captured by the specific source, the Global Protest Tracker, before the deadline.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "A major protest, organized by groups like the KCTU or Candlelight Action, surpasses 10,000 participants in response to ongoing political developments related to the aftermath of the December 2024 martial law declaration. The May 1st Labor Day rally, or a subsequent weekend protest in Seoul, easily meets the threshold and is documented by the Global Protest Tracker.",
    "rationale": "My forecast is based on the extremely high political volatility in South Korea. The context of a presidential impeachment following a rejected martial law declaration has created a fertile ground for mass mobilization, as noted by the ACLED report on protest surges late last year. The status quo is one of sustained, large-scale civic action.\n\nThe research assistant's report confirms that key actors with a proven history of organizing massive demonstrations, such as the Korean Confederation of Trade Unions (KCTU) and 'Candlelight Action', are highly active. The KCTU's Labor Day rally on May 1st itself had a strong chance of exceeding the 10,000-participant threshold, a common occurrence for this annual event in Seoul. Furthermore, the ongoing political crisis provides a persistent catalyst for both pro- and anti-government factions to rally supporters, making it highly probable that at least one such event will meet the size criteria within the next two months.\n\nMy probability is not higher than 85% to account for the short two-month timeframe and the small possibility of a sudden political resolution that lowers the temperature, or a potential lag or omission in reporting by the specific resolving source, the Global Protest Tracker.\n\nMy probability is not lower because the 10,000-participant threshold is relatively modest given the South Korean context and the gravity of the current political crisis. The combination of a deeply polarized society, organized and active protest movements, and multiple potential flashpoints in the near future makes the absence of any large protest unlikely.\n\nI would increase my forecast if initial media reports confirm the May 1st rally significantly exceeded 10,000 people. I would decrease it if several consecutive weekend rallies fail to mobilize significant numbers and there are signs of successful de-escalation from political leaders.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill the Global Protest Tracker report any protests in South Korea with 10,000+ participants, before July 1, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nACLED December 2024: [South Korea: Anti-government protests surge following martial law declaration](https://acleddata.com/2025/01/15/asia-pacific-overview-january-2025/#keytrends6)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if the [Global Protest Tracker](https://carnegieendowment.org/features/global-protest-tracker?lang=en) reports a protest in South Korea with 10,000 or more participants with a start date after the launch of this question and before July 1, 2025.\n\n\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nMultiple civic and political groups have been actively organizing demonstrations. The Korean Confederation of Trade Unions (KCTU) and the Democratic Labor Union held rallies for Labor Day on May 1. The KCTU has also announced its intention to organize a general strike in July. Groups such as 'Free Korea' and 'Candlelight Action' have consistently held rallies and counter-rallies in response to political developments. Conservative groups have also planned a rally for May 18th in Gwangju.\n\nToday is 2025-05-01.\n\nBefore answering you think:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n(e) You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
