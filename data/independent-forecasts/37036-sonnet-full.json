  "information": "Dan Osborn, an independent from Nebraska, is exploring a potential run for the U.S. Senate in 2026 against incumbent Republican Pete Ricketts. In early April 2025, Osborn formed an exploratory committee. He previously ran for the Senate in 2024 against Deb Fischer, losing by approximately six percentage points in a race that attracted $14 million in fundraising. Osborn has also launched a political action committee, the Working Class Heroes Fund, aimed at training and supporting working-class candidates for office. In public statements regarding a potential 2026 run, Osborn has framed the race as a choice to \"replace a billionaire with a mechanic.\"\n\nThe incumbent Senator, Pete Ricketts, is expected to seek re-election in 2026. Former President Donald Trump endorsed Ricketts for his reelection bid on April 11, 2025, calling Osborn a \"Radical Left Open Border Extremist\" while praising Ricketts. Ricketts is the seventh richest member of Congress and has a significant political and financial operation in Nebraska. Osborn runs as an independent but received support from the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee during his 2024 campaign.\n\nHistorical data shows that Senate exploratory committees often last three to six months before a formal campaign launch. Many candidates for the 2026 cycle in other states, such as Andy Barr in Kentucky and Haley Stevens in Michigan, announced their candidacies in April 2025. In his previous 2024 Senate run, Osborn formally announced his candidacy in July 2023, approximately 16 months before the election. A similar timeline for the 2026 race would place his announcement in June or July of 2025. Osborn himself has publicly stated that he will \"decide by early summer.\"",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "38 days until the June 1, 2025 deadline",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No - Osborn has formed an exploratory committee but has not yet formally announced his candidacy",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Osborn continues his exploratory phase beyond June 1, ultimately announcing in mid-to-late June or July 2025, consistent with his stated timeline of deciding by 'early summer' and the typical 3-6 month exploratory committee period",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Osborn accelerates his decision-making process, possibly spurred by Trump's endorsement of Ricketts on April 11, and formally announces his candidacy in mid-to-late May 2025, viewing Memorial Day weekend as an opportune moment to launch before the traditional summer political season",
    "rationale": "The status quo strongly favors a No outcome since Osborn only formed his exploratory committee in early April 2025, approximately three weeks ago. His public statement that he will 'decide by early summer' suggests a timeline more likely pointing to mid-June or July rather than before June 1. Historical patterns support this: exploratory committees typically last 3-6 months before formal announcements, which would place his announcement between July and October 2025. Additionally, in his 2024 Senate race, Osborn announced in July 2023, roughly 16 months before the election, suggesting a similar timeline would place a 2026 announcement in June or July 2025. However, several factors prevent this from being an extremely low probability. Some 2026 Senate candidates like Andy Barr and Haley Stevens announced in April 2025, demonstrating that earlier announcements are occurring in this cycle. Trump's April 11 endorsement of Ricketts and harsh rhetoric against Osborn could accelerate his timeline by creating urgency to respond with a formal campaign structure. The term 'early summer' is ambiguous - meteorological summer begins June 1, so a late May announcement would technically qualify. With 38 days remaining, there is sufficient time for Osborn to conclude his exploratory phase and announce if he decides to move quickly. I'm not forecasting higher (above 35%) because the preponderance of evidence suggests a post-June 1 announcement is more likely: his own words point to 'early summer' (likely meaning after June 1), the typical exploratory timeline hasn't elapsed, and his past behavior indicates July announcements. I'm not forecasting lower (below 15%) because there are plausible scenarios for acceleration, particularly given the competitive political environment and the fact that some candidates are announcing earlier this cycle. I would update upward if Osborn begins scheduling major campaign events, releases polling data, or makes public statements suggesting imminent announcement. I would update downward if he explicitly states he needs more time or if reporting suggests a June-July timeline.",
