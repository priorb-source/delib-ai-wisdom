    "review": "I have reviewed the analyses from two other forecasters. Forecaster 2's analysis introduces a crucial piece of new information: that a federal judge extended a temporary restraining order (TRO) on May 11, finding the petitioner's claims 'plausible.' This is a specific and powerful piece of evidence that directly supports a low-probability forecast, as it creates a concrete legal barrier to deportation. Forecaster 3 presents a compelling counterargument centered on the intense political will from the Trump administration to deport Khalil, citing high-level political statements and a track record of swift action. This is a valid point, as it suggests the government will not let the case proceed at a normal pace and will instead seek to expedite it through all available means. However, I find Forecaster 2's reasoning more convincing for this specific timeframe. While political will can accelerate executive branch actions, a TRO from the judicial branch acts as a direct and powerful brake. The core challenge for the government is not administrative, but legal: it must convince a court to dissolve an active order. This process is rarely completed in under seven weeks, especially when the judge has already signaled the case has merit.",
    "rationale": "I am maintaining my original forecast of 5%. The new information about the active temporary restraining order (TRO), as highlighted by Forecaster 2, is the single most important factor in this forecast. A TRO is a direct judicial prohibition on deportation. For a 'Yes' resolution, the government would need to not only convince the federal court to dissolve the TRO and deny a preliminary injunction, but also receive a final ruling from the BIA and then execute the removal—all before July 1. This sequence of events is highly improbable within the standard operating procedures of the U.S. judicial and immigration systems. The judge's finding that Khalil's First Amendment claims are 'plausible' further suggests that the court will engage in a deliberate, rather than rushed, review.\n\nForecaster 3's points about high-level political will are well-taken and prevent me from lowering my forecast to near-zero. This pressure ensures the government's lawyers will be aggressive in seeking to lift the TRO. There is a small but non-trivial chance that they could succeed on an emergency basis, or that the judge could rule unexpectedly quickly in their favor. However, the institutional inertia of the courts and the specific legal protection of the TRO are formidable obstacles. The political pressure explains the *attempt* to deport Khalil quickly, but the TRO explains why that attempt is very likely to fail within the resolution window.",
