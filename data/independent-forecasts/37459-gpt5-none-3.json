    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Berkshire (more likely Todd Combs or Ted Weschler) initiated and held through 2025-03-31 a stake in Alphabet or Meta that appears in the Q1 2025 13F; less likely, a new position in Microsoft, Nvidia, or Tesla is reported.",
    "rationale": "Time horizon is short and the default (status quo) is that Berkshire does not add new Magnificent 7 names. Over the past decade Berkshire has rarely initiated new mega-cap tech positions; exceptions (Apple earlier, Amazon via a lieutenant, Snowflake, a brief TSM stake) are infrequent. They have never disclosed holdings in Google/Alphabet, Meta, Microsoft, Nvidia, or Tesla. Buffett has repeatedly expressed reluctance on Microsoft (appearance-of-conflict concerns with Gates historically), skepticism on autos/Tesla’s industry economics, and caution on AI chip leaders like Nvidia (he has praised the company but questioned durability/pricing power and previously exited TSM quickly). Those points all reduce the odds for MSFT/NVDA/TSLA. Alphabet and Meta are the more plausible outsized-tech candidates for a lieutenant-scale initiation if valuations became compelling, but Berkshire passed on buying them even when they were notably cheaper in 2022–2023, which lowers today’s odds. Liquidity in these names means Berkshire would have little need for confidential treatment to accumulate, so the absence of prior disclosure modestly signals non-ownership going into Q1. The 13F deadline is imminent; most quarters bring no major surprises, so I overweight the status quo. Research assistant provided no new info, so there’s no specific catalyst pushing toward Yes. Why not higher? Because base rates for Berkshire initiating brand-new MAG7 positions in any given quarter are very low, managerial commentary and past behavior argue against several names, and there’s no leak or hint from the recent annual meeting. Why not lower? Todd/Ted have autonomy and have bought large-cap tech before (Amazon, Snowflake). If any, Alphabet or Meta could fit Buffett’s admitted past regret on Google and strong buybacks/cash generation. What would move me up: credible reporting or hints from the annual meeting transcript indicating interest in Alphabet/Meta; unusual trading patterns plus a later 13F confirming activity; or evidence they obtained confidential treatment previously and plan to reveal now. What would move me down: early filing showing no such holdings, or on-the-record comments reiterating they own none of these and are unlikely to in the near term.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill Berkshire Hathaway reveal a purchase of any Magnificent 7 stock other than Amazon and Apple in its Q1 2025 13F filing?\n\nQuestion background:\nInvestopedia: [Berkshire Hathaway Doesn't Hold Nvidia Stock—Will Warren Buffett Come to Regret it?](https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/warren-buffetts-secret-portfolio-dumping-shares-3-supercharged-artificial-intelligence-ai)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if the 13F filing for Berkshire Hathaway, Inc., filed for the period ending 2025-03-31, reports the company holding shares of Alphabet, Meta Platforms, Microsoft, Nvidia, or Tesla.\n\n\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nNo additional information available.\n\nToday is 2025-05-07.\n\nBefore answering you think:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n(e) You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
