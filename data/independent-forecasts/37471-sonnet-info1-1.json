  "information": "According to data from the Federal Reserve Economic Data (FRED), the inventory of new single-family homes for sale in the United States stood at 503,000 units in March 2025, an increase from 500,000 in February 2025. This level represents a multi-year high since November 2007. Historically, the number of new one-family homes for sale has only exceeded 550,000 during the 2006-2007 housing market peak, when levels reached between 570,000 and 580,000 units.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Approximately 6-7 weeks. May 2025 data will be released by FRED in late June 2025.",
    "status_quo_outcome": "NO - inventory remains below 550,000",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Inventory continues growing at the current modest pace of approximately 3,000 units per month, reaching around 509,000-515,000 by May 2025, well below the 550,000 threshold.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "A dramatic acceleration in new home listings occurs due to builders rushing completions to market or a sharp demand collapse, causing inventory to surge by approximately 47,000 units in just two months - nearly 8 times the current growth rate.",
    "rationale": "The research assistant reports show inventory at 503,000 in March 2025, up from 500,000 in February 2025. This represents a modest increase of 3,000 units per month (0.6% monthly growth). To exceed 550,000 by May requires gaining 47,000+ units in two months, or approximately 23,500 per month - a 4.7% monthly growth rate that is nearly 8 times the current pace. Historical context is important: inventory has only exceeded 550,000 during the 2006-2007 housing bubble peak. While current levels are already at multi-year highs, the trajectory shows gradual rather than explosive growth. The status quo strongly suggests NO because housing inventory typically changes gradually. Two months is an extremely short timeframe for such a dramatic acceleration. My forecast is not higher because there's no evidence of accelerating growth in the available data, and housing markets change slowly. My forecast is not lower because: (1) there is an upward trend, even if modest; (2) we're already at historically elevated levels; (3) April data is still unknown and could show acceleration; (4) builders may have significant inventory in the pipeline. I would update upward if April 2025 data shows inventory jumping above 530,000, or if there are signs of a housing market shock. I would update downward if April data shows flat or declining inventory, or if demand indicators strengthen.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill the number of new single family homes for sale in the US exceed 550 thousand in May 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\n[The Kobeissi Letter](https://x.com/KobeissiLetter/status/1912142359577403619): \"BREAKING: The number of new single-family homes for sale has surged to 500,000 in February, the highest since November 2007.\n\nThe number of new homes on the market has more than TRIPLED over the last 13 years, from a low of 142,000.\n\nExcluding the 2006 housing bubble this is, by far, the largest supply of new homes in history.\"\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if the number of New One Family Homes for Sale in the United States reported for May 2025 is greater than 550 thousand, according to what is presented by [FRED](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/HNFSEPUSSA).\n\nEnsure units is set to \"Thousands of Units, Seasonally Adjusted\" and frequency is set to \"Monthly, End of Month\". Question resolves based on the number presented by FRED, and no other resolution source will be considered.\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nAccording to data from the Federal Reserve Economic Data (FRED), the inventory of new single-family homes for sale in the United States stood at 503,000 units in March 2025, an increase from 500,000 in February 2025.

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
