    "review": "The other forecasters present analyses that align closely with mine on the fundamental factors: Jones's significant fundraising advantage, high-profile endorsements, campaign experience, and Taylor's prosecutorial credentials. The narrow forecast range (73-82%) indicates strong consensus on the underlying dynamics. Forecaster 2's emphasis on primary volatility and lower turnout is a valid caution that fundraising doesn't always translate perfectly to votes. Forecaster 3's stronger confidence (82%) appropriately highlights the mobilization networks that come with establishment endorsements. However, neither forecaster introduced truly new information that I hadn't already considered. The key uncertainty - absence of polling data - remains acknowledged by all three of us. Their analyses reinforce rather than challenge my assessment that Jones has substantial but not overwhelming advantages.",
    "rationale": "After reviewing both forecasters' reasoning, I find strong agreement on the core fundamentals with only minor differences in how we weight uncertainty versus structural advantages. All three of us identify the same key factors favoring Jones (2-to-1 fundraising, establishment endorsements, prior campaign experience) and the same limiting factors (no polling data, Taylor's credible prosecutorial background, inherent primary volatility). The 73-82% range indicates we're all capturing the same reality with slightly different calibrations. Forecaster 2's 73% may be overly cautious given how strong Jones's combined advantages are, while Forecaster 3's 82% may be slightly overconfident given the absence of direct voter preference data. My original 75% represents an appropriate middle position that acknowledges Jones as the clear favorite while maintaining prudent uncertainty. The deliberation confirms rather than challenges this assessment - no forecaster raised evidence suggesting my weighting was substantially off. The structural advantages strongly favor Jones, but 14 days with no polling warrants staying in the 73-77% range rather than moving to 80%+.",
