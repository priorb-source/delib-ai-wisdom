    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "About 9 days (until April 30, 2025, local time in Samoa)",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No — the current emergency was announced March 31 and, as scheduled, runs through April 29, 2025; if nothing changes, it will not be in effect on April 30.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "The Proclamation of Emergency (Energy Crisis) expires at the end of April 29 and is not renewed; no new emergency (energy or otherwise) is declared before or on April 30.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "The government extends the current energy state of emergency past April 29 (e.g., for another 14–30 days), or declares a new state of emergency (energy-related or due to another hazard) that covers April 30.",
    "rationale": "The baseline is that the currently announced emergency period ends April 29, which would yield a No on April 30 absent further action. However, the underlying issue—nationwide power cuts—typically takes longer than four weeks to resolve given generator repairs, parts procurement, and possible interim generation or fuel logistics. Samoa has precedent for rolling extensions of states of emergency (e.g., during COVID-19). Maintaining emergency powers can facilitate expedited procurement and coordination while the grid stabilizes, creating an incentive to extend if outages persist. Countervailing considerations: political costs to prolonged emergency powers and the possibility that short-term fixes (rental generators, fuel arrangements) reduce the need for extraordinary measures, allowing the government to let the proclamation lapse to signal normalization. I have no fresh reporting beyond the initial scheduling through April 29 (research assistant had no additional info), so I weight the status quo but still lean toward an extension given the typical timelines for infrastructure stabilization and the recency/severity of the crisis. The forecast is not higher because the stated end date is imminent and governments sometimes allow short, targeted emergencies to expire once immediate bottlenecks are addressed. It is not lower because the practical constraints suggest a material chance of extension. I would update up if EPC/government statements indicate repairs will take weeks more, if load shedding continues severely into late April, or if cabinet signals intent to extend. I would update down if the government announces power supply normalization, ends load shedding, or explicitly states the emergency will lapse without renewal.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill a state of emergency be in effect in Samoa on April 30, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\n[Samoan Prime Minister declares state of emergency over power cuts](https://www.stuff.co.nz/nz-news/360634988/samoan-prime-minister-declares-state-emergency-over-power-cuts)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if, according to [credible sources](https://www.metaculus.com/faq/#definitions) Samoa is in a state of emergency that has been declared by a governmental entity with the authority to make such a declaration.\n\nFor example, the state of emergency declaration [posted](https://www.facebook.com/samoagovt/posts/hon-prime-minister-of-samoa-press-statement-proclamation-of-emergency-energy-cri/1059050259591457/) by the government of Samoa on Facebook on March 31, 2025 would count. (Note that when it was declared, it was scheduled to be in effect through April 29, 2025.)\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nNo additional information available.\n\nToday is 2025-04-21.\n\nBefore answering you think:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n(e) You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
