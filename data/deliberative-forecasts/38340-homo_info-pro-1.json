    "review": "There is a strong and well-justified consensus among all three forecasters. We have all independently arrived at a 1% probability, driven by the same core reasoning: the ongoing civil war in Sudan has paralyzed the necessary state functions, there is no functioning legislature to perform ratification, and the timeline of less than one month is prohibitive. Forecaster 2's point about the slow pace of AfCFTA implementation even in politically stable nations is a valuable piece of supporting context that I had not explicitly considered, and it further strengthens the argument against a hasty, last-minute ratification by a country in a state of collapse. The reasoning from both other forecasters is highly convincing and aligns perfectly with my own initial analysis. There are no significant dissenting opinions or overlooked pieces of evidence that would warrant a change in my forecast.",
    "rationale": "After reviewing the analyses from the other forecasters, my forecast remains unchanged at 1%. The deliberation process has reinforced my initial assessment. The core arguments are unanimous: the civil war has rendered the Sudanese state incapable of performing basic legislative functions like treaty ratification. The government is fragmented, there is no functioning parliament, and the country remains suspended from the African Union. With less than a month until the July 1, 2025 deadline, there is no conceivable, plausible scenario in which a peace deal is reached, a new government is formed, and the entire ratification process is completed. The consensus among forecasters confirms that the situation's gravity leaves little room for alternative interpretations. The 1% forecast is retained not because there is a tangible path to a 'Yes' outcome, but as a standard practice to account for highly improbable 'black swan' events, which the other forecasters also correctly noted in their rationale.",
