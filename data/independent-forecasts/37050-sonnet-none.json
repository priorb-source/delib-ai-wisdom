    "status_quo_outcome": "No companies are removed from the Dow Jones Industrial Average before July 1, 2025. All 30 listed companies remain components of the DJIA.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "S&P Dow Jones Indices makes no announcements about removing any of the 30 listed companies from the DJIA before July 1, 2025. The index composition remains stable through the resolution date, with all companies maintaining their positions despite normal business fluctuations.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "S&P Dow Jones Indices announces before July 1, 2025 that one or more of the listed companies will be removed from the DJIA. This could be triggered by a major corporate event (merger, acquisition, bankruptcy), severe business deterioration, or a strategic decision to rebalance the index to better reflect the U.S. economy. For example, a company facing severe financial distress like Boeing (with ongoing safety issues) could be replaced.",
    "rationale": "The status quo strongly favors no change occurring in the next 67 days. DJIA composition changes are relatively rare, typically occurring 0-2 times per year. Importantly, the background information indicates Intel was recently replaced by Nvidia, suggesting a change has already occurred in 2025. This recent change makes another change in the near term less likely, as the index committee typically doesn't make frequent adjustments. However, several factors prevent this from being an extremely low probability: (1) We're monitoring 30 companies, not just one, increasing the surface area for potential changes; (2) Some companies face known challenges (Boeing's safety issues, 3M's legal problems); (3) Unexpected corporate events (mergers, acquisitions, major business shifts) can occur; (4) While rare, multiple changes in a single year do happen historically. The base rate of changes suggests perhaps 0.15-0.2 probability in any given 2-month period, but the recent Intel/Nvidia swap reduces this. Conversely, covering all 30 components slightly increases the odds. For this probability to be higher, I would need evidence of imminent corporate actions, severe financial distress at a specific company, or signals from S&P Dow Jones Indices about planned changes. For it to be lower, I would need confirmation that no changes are being considered and all companies are performing stably.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill any of these companies get dropped from the Dow Jones Industrial Average before July 1, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nOregon Business: [Intel Ousted From Dow Jones By Rival Nvidia](https://oregonbusiness.com/intel-ousted-from-dow-jones-by-rival-nvidia/)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if before July 1, 2025, there is any official announcement or confirmation (or credible source reporting) that any of the following companies will no longer be a component of the Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA) either on the official announcement or that the company has been or will be removed from the index: Amazon.com Inc, American Express Co, Amgen Inc, Apple Inc, Boeing Co, Caterpillar Inc, Cisco Systems Inc, Chevron Corp, Goldman Sachs Group Inc, Home Depot Inc, Honeywell International Inc, International Business Machines Corp, Johnson & Johnson, Coca-Cola Co, JPMorgan Chase & Co, McDonald’s Corp, 3M Co, Merck & Co Inc, Microsoft Corp, Nike Inc, Procter & Gamble Co, Sherwin-Williams Co, Travelers Companies Inc, Unitedhealth Group Inc, Salesforce Inc, NVIDIA Corp, Verizon Communications Inc, Visa Inc, Walmart Inc, Walt Disney Co.\n\nAlthough removals from the index are generally effective immediately in order to forestall frontrunning, this is not a requirement for this question. All that is required is for there to be an announcement or confirmation before the resolution date about the removal from the DJIA at any point in time. Therefore this question will resolve based on the announcement or confirmation, not on the actual removal date.\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nNo additional information available.\n\nToday is 2025-04-25.\n\nBefore answering you think:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n(e) You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
