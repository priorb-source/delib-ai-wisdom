    "review": "All three forecasts cluster tightly between 38-45%, indicating strong agreement on the fundamental factors. The other forecasters raise several compelling points I should weigh more heavily:\n\n1. **The 40-day timing signal**: Forecaster 3 makes an excellent point that if this recall were tracking toward fast resolution (30-45 days), we'd likely see movement by now. The fact that 40 days have elapsed without closure is meaningful evidence this is tracking toward the longer end of the distribution, not the shorter end.\n\n2. **Multi-state foodservice recalls historically exceed median**: Forecaster 2 emphasizes that recalls with these specific characteristics (multi-state, foodservice, large volume) \"historically exceed the 90-day median.\" This is a direct empirical claim that deserves more weight.\n\n3. **Remaining timeframe calculation**: With 55 days remaining out of 94 total, we're asking whether this closes in roughly the 42nd-94th day window, when the median is 90 days. Given complicating factors suggesting this isn't in the fast-resolution category, the 38-40% range may be more appropriate than 45%.\n\nHowever, I maintain some disagreement on the weight given to Class III classification. The lowest-risk designation meaningfully reduces verification requirements compared to Class I/II recalls, and this could enable faster processing than the other forecasters account for. Additionally, Cargill's proactive cooperation and clear product identification (establishment number G1804) facilitate tracking.\n\nThe tight clustering of forecasts (38-45%) suggests we've identified the correct factors but weight them slightly differently. The timing signal is the strongest new evidence that should push my forecast downward.",
    "rationale": "I'm updating my forecast downward from 45% to 42% based on the timing signal and historical patterns raised by the other forecasters. The fact that we're 40 days into the recall without signs of closure is meaningful evidence this is tracking toward longer resolution times, not shorter ones. If this were resolving quickly, we'd likely see movement by now.\n\nThe other forecasters correctly emphasize that multi-state foodservice recalls with large volumes historically exceed the 90-day median. Combined with the extended shelf life (some products until March 2026), this suggests closure is more likely to occur after the July 1 deadline than before it.\n\nHowever, I'm not moving all the way down to 38% because: (1) the Class III classification does reduce verification requirements meaningfully, (2) we're only slightly past the median timeframe at 94 days versus 90 days, and (3) no adverse events and clear product identification could still enable relatively efficient processing. There remains a reasonable probability that efficient execution closes this recall in the next 55 days, even if it's below 50%.\n\nMy updated forecast of 42% reflects a slight downward adjustment while maintaining that the Class III status and proximity to median timeframe provide non-trivial probability of closure before July 1.",
