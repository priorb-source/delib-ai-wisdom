    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Approximately 33 days, from May 13, 2025 to June 15, 2025",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No - as of today (May 13, 2025), no phone call has been reported since the resolution period began on May 12, 2025",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Trump and Zelenskyy do not have a phone conversation during this period. This could occur if: they meet in person instead, communicate only through intermediaries or other officials, relations are strained enough to avoid direct contact, or Trump focuses on other foreign policy priorities. Alternatively, a call might occur but one or both sides don't publicly acknowledge it.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Trump and Zelenskyy have at least one phone conversation during the 33-day window, and both the White House and Ukrainian presidency publicly acknowledge the call occurred. This would likely happen in the context of ongoing Ukraine war developments, negotiations, aid discussions, or a significant battlefield or diplomatic event requiring direct leader-to-leader communication.",
    "rationale": "With 33 days remaining in the resolution period, I'm assessing the likelihood of a phone call between the sitting US President and Ukrainian President during an active war. Factors supporting a Yes outcome: (1) Phone calls between US Presidents and foreign leaders are routine, especially with countries receiving significant US support; (2) Ukraine remains a major foreign policy priority with ongoing war requiring diplomatic coordination; (3) One month is a substantial timeframe for such contact; (4) Historical precedent shows Trump and Zelenskyy have communicated before. Factors supporting No: (1) The relationship has been complex and occasionally tense; (2) Trump might prefer alternative communication methods (in-person meetings, video calls, or intermediaries); (3) The requirement that BOTH sides acknowledge the call raises the bar; (4) Trump has expressed frustration with Ukraine aid levels. My research assistant provided no additional context, so I'm relying on general knowledge of US-Ukraine relations and typical diplomatic practices. I'm not forecasting higher (75-80%) because: there's genuine uncertainty about Trump's approach to Ukraine, alternative communication methods exist, and the mutual acknowledgment requirement adds friction. I'm not forecasting lower (40-50%) because: the active war situation makes regular communication likely, 33 days is long enough that avoiding all phone contact seems unlikely, and presidential phone calls are standard diplomatic practice. I would revise upward if: reports emerged of planned calls, tensions escalated requiring immediate coordination, or major aid packages were being negotiated. I would revise downward if: reports indicated strained relations, Trump demonstrated preference for avoiding direct contact, or an in-person meeting was scheduled instead.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill Donald Trump and Volodymyr Zelenskyy speak on the phone with each other before June 15, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nSky News: [Key moments that have shaped Trump and Zelenskyy's relationship](https://news.sky.com/story/trump-and-zelenskyys-relationship-from-perfect-phone-call-to-oval-office-clash-13331892)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if, after May 12, 2025 and before June 15, 2025, Donald Trump and Volodymyr Zelenskyy speak on the phone with each other, according to [credible sources](https://www.metaculus.com/faq/#definitions).\n\nBoth sides must acknowledge the phone call took place for it to count. \"Speak on the phone with each other\" is defined as both individuals, from different physical spaces, orally uttering words intended for the other individual into a telephone or equivalent device, those words being converted into electrical or digital signals in real time, and then transferred to the other individual via telecommunications links, where they are reconverted into sound waves at the other individual's listening device.\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nNo additional information available.\n\nToday is 2025-05-13.\n\nBefore answering you think:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n(e) You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
