    "review": "Both forecasters make strong arguments that illuminate different aspects of this problem. Forecaster 2 emphasizes the positive signals - the 30% early capture rate demonstrating law enforcement capability and the substantial 32-day remaining timeframe. This optimism is reasonable but may underweight the tail risk. Forecaster 3 makes a compelling case about declining capture hazards and the 'last holdout' problem, noting that the final fugitive often extends timelines beyond what seems reasonable. This is the crux issue: we don't need 'most' recaptured, we need 'all' - a much higher bar. The key insight I'm taking from this deliberation is Forecaster 3's point about the declining hazard rate. Those still at large after two weeks have survived the initial dragnet and are likely more resourceful or fortunate. Historical precedent strongly suggests that in multi-person escapes, achieving 100% recapture within 6 weeks is difficult, even with intensive manhunts. Forecaster 2's optimism about the timeframe is valid but doesn't fully account for how the last 1-2 escapees often prove disproportionately difficult to locate.",
    "rationale": "After reviewing both analyses, I find Forecaster 3's reasoning about tail risk more persuasive than Forecaster 2's optimism about capabilities and timeframe. The fundamental challenge is the conjunction problem: P(all 10 caught) = P(escapee 1 caught) × P(escapee 2 caught) × ... × P(escapee 10 caught). Even if each individual has a 85% chance of being caught in the next 32 days, the probability of catching all 10 is only 0.85^10 = 20%. While the initial 30% capture rate is encouraging, it also reveals that 70% evaded the immediate response. We're now 14 days post-escape with at least 7 still at large (possibly fewer, but we lack updated data). The longer fugitives remain free, the harder they become to find - trails go cold, they establish hiding spots, they leave the immediate area. The 'all 10' requirement creates significant negative tail risk where even one determined or lucky individual can cause resolution to No. While 32 days allows for continued progress, it's not an overwhelming timeframe for clearing the last holdouts. I'm adjusting slightly downward from my initial 43% to better reflect the declining capture probability over time and the multiplication of individual failure risks.",
