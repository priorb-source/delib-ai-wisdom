    "review": "Both forecasters are aligned with my initial view: extremely tight window, absence of credible signaling or leaks, and severe political/alliancemanagement costs make a June visit to Russia highly unlikely. They add a few useful operational cues (airspace/NOTAMs, advance team sightings) and emphasize that breakthrough diplomacy would more likely occur in a third country. None of this contradicts my reasoning; it slightly strengthens the case against a surprise Moscow visit. Their Trump-specific tail-risk arguments (optics, unpredictability, potential ceasefire/prisoner-swap optics) mirror my own and justify keeping the probability above zero.",
    "rationale": "Only June remains for resolution. High-sensitivity presidential travel to an adversary is typically telegraphed; there are no credible public signals. Given the Ukraine war and sanctions, a Moscow visit would be unusually costly domestically and with allies, and breakthroughs would more plausibly be hosted in neutral venues. While Trump has a record of unexpected, optics-heavy diplomacy, a clandestine or last-minute Russia visit still seems implausible: Russia would likely seek to publicize it, and the US side would face substantial security and political hurdles. The additional operational indicators raised by the other forecasters marginally reinforce the low odds. My prior 2% sits within their 1–3% range; I see no new information that warrants a change.",
