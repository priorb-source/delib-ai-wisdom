  "information": "A historical analysis of the National UFO Reporting Center (NUFORC) database from 2015 to 2024 identified between four and six pilot reports originating from Africa over the ten-year period. The specific countries mentioned for these past reports include South Africa, Egypt, Nigeria, Kenya, and Rwanda. Globally, pilot reports typically account for approximately 1% of the 5,000 to 6,000 total UFO sightings logged by NUFORC annually.\n\nOn January 1, 2025, a pilot report was logged in the NUFORC database describing a sighting of a four-craft inline formation of UFOs in Rwanda. Additionally, a separate, non-pilot sighting of a glowing sphere was reported over Cape Town, South Africa, on January 22, 2025.\n\nAccording to U.S. government data, 757 Unidentified Aerial Phenomena (UAP) incidents were reported between May 2023 and June 2024, with 708 of these occurring in the air. One notable incident from January 2023 involved a U.S. Air Force F-16 fighter jet colliding with an unidentified object over Arizona, resulting in damage to the aircraft's canopy.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "About 40 days until the first check on/after July 1, 2025.",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No — most months have zero NUFORC pilot reports from Africa.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "June 2025 passes with no Africa-based pilot report logged at NUFORC, or any June African sighting is not tagged as a Pilot report on the NUFORC pilot index.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "A professional or private pilot in an African country (e.g., South Africa, Egypt, Nigeria, Kenya, Rwanda) submits a June 2025 sighting to NUFORC and it appears under the NUFORC Pilot Reports index when checked on/after July 1, 2025.",
    "rationale": "Base rate: The research assistant found 4–6 NUFORC pilot reports from Africa over 2015–2024, i.e., roughly 0.4–0.6 per year. Treating arrivals as Poisson, the monthly probability is 1−exp(−λ/12) ≈ 3–5%. NUFORC globally logs ~5,000–6,000 reports/year with ≈1% tagged as pilot reports (~50–60/yr), and only about 0.8–1.2% of those appear to come from Africa historically, reinforcing a very low monthly chance. Recent signal: A Rwanda pilot report on Jan 1, 2025 confirms nonzero African reporting this year but is only a single data point. It slightly raises the chance that awareness or reporting pipelines are active in 2025, but not enough to overcome the low base rate for a single-month window. Constraints: The event must be both (a) a June 2025 occurrence in Africa and (b) tagged as a Pilot report on NUFORC’s pilot index when checked on/after July 1. Misclassification or delayed tagging could reduce odds; the open-ended “on or after” timing somewhat offsets posting lag risk. Why not higher: Africa’s share of NUFORC pilot reports is tiny; most months historically have none. Why not lower: Documented African pilot reports exist (including one in 2025), so zero is too pessimistic. What would change my forecast: Upward — evidence of multiple recent Africa pilot-tagged reports at NUFORC, media reports of a June Africa pilot UAP, or known outreach driving pilot reporting to NUFORC. Downward — confirmation that NUFORC has reduced pilot tagging, or data showing the RA’s count was an overestimate and African pilot reports are rarer than stated.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill a pilot report of UFOs come from a country in Africa in June 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nFor example, the resolution source [reports](https://nuforc.org/sighting/?id=186297) a 4 craft inline formation of UFOs having been sighted on January 1, 2025 in Rwanda.\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if The National UFO Reporting Center posts a pilot report of a UFO/UAP having occurred in a country on the African continent, during the month of June 2025 at [this link](https://nuforc.org/subndx/?id=x) when accessed by Metaculus on or after July 1, 2025.\n\n\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nA historical analysis of the National UFO Reporting Center (NUFORC) database from 2015 to 2024 identified between four and six pilot reports originating from Africa over the ten-year period.

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
