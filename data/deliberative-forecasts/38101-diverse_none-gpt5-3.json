    "review": "Forecaster 2 adds a concrete claim I hadn’t used explicitly: a current double‑digit gap (Starmer mid‑30s vs. Ishiba low‑20s). If that’s accurate, it dominates the short horizon and makes a flip unlikely. Their structural points (LDP funding scandal drag; Japanese PMs’ low approvals) are consistent with base rates. However, they don’t mention the tie-as-No rule or the monthly update cadence, and they don’t cite the specific Morning Consult figures. Forecaster 3’s 50% centers on data uncertainty, but underweights base rates and the typical dynamics for Japanese PM approvals. Given known tendencies (Japan PMs often in the 20s after honeymoon; Starmer’s approvals in the mid-30s), a symmetric 50% seems too conservative. Overall, F2 is more persuasive, contingent on the gap being real; F3 underscores data gaps but overcorrects to agnosticism.",
    "rationale": "I initially leaned slightly Yes (56%) on slow-moving approvals, tie-as-No, and base rates suggesting Starmer modestly ahead. F2’s argument that the current gap is double-digit (mid‑30s vs. low‑20s) is plausible given recent patterns and, if true, materially increases the chance that the ordering holds through a 7‑day trailing average at the turn of July. Over ~32 days, it’s rare for one leader to drop ~10 points or the other to rise ~10 without a major shock. The tie-as-No rule trims some probability, but it matters mainly when the gap is small; a double-digit lead would dominate that risk. Key downside risks to a Yes: a UK-specific scandal or economic/service crisis that dents Starmer several points quickly, or a Japan-specific positive shock (e.g., policy win or political consolidation) that lifts Ishiba meaningfully. Those scenarios are possible but not my base case over one month. Given this, I’m updating upward to reflect the likely gap while still discounting for unforeseen shocks and the tie-as-No rule.",
