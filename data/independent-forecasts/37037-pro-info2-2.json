  "information": "The U.S. imposed a 50% tariff on Lesotho due to a significant trade imbalance; in 2024, Lesotho exported approximately $237-240 million worth of goods to the U.S., while importing only about $2.8-3 million from the U.S. The tariff is expected to severely impact Lesotho's economy, particularly its textile and apparel industry, which employs around 40,000 workers and constitutes about 90% of the country's manufacturing employment and exports. In response to the tariff, the Lesotho government announced on April 3, 2025, that it was forming a high-level delegation to travel to Washington to negotiate with U.S. authorities and seek clarification on the tariff's rationale.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Approximately six weeks, as the resolution date is June 1, 2025.",
    "status_quo_outcome": "Yes. The 50% tariff is currently in effect, and without a specific policy change by the US government, it will remain listed in the harmonized tariff schedule on the resolution date.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "The diplomatic delegation from Lesotho successfully persuades US authorities to reverse the policy. The US government then acts with unusual speed to process this change and update the official online tariff schedule before June 1, 2025.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Negotiations between Lesotho's delegation and US authorities do not result in an agreement to lift the tariff, or an agreement is reached but bureaucratic processes prevent the official tariff schedule from being updated by the June 1, 2025 resolution date.",
    "rationale": "My forecast is based primarily on the high degree of institutional inertia within the US government and the very short timeframe for any policy change to be enacted. The status quo is that the 50% tariff is in place. Reversing such a measure requires successful diplomatic negotiation followed by a bureaucratic process to formally update the Harmonized Tariff Schedule (HTS). The research report indicates Lesotho only announced its intention to send a delegation on April 3, 2025, leaving less than two months for this entire sequence of events to unfold. This is an exceptionally tight deadline for international diplomacy and government administration. Bureaucratic processes, even for seemingly minor changes, often take months. The massive power asymmetry between the US and Lesotho means this issue is of critical importance to Lesotho but of negligible significance to the US, making it a low priority for US officials. Therefore, the most probable outcome is that the tariff remains unchanged on the resolution date. My forecast is not higher than 85% because there is a small but real chance that the tariff was an administrative error or an unintended consequence that can be corrected quickly once brought to the attention of the right officials. Reversing it would cost the US nothing and could generate goodwill. My forecast is not lower because the timeline is the single most significant constraint, and betting against bureaucratic inertia on such a short deadline is typically unwise. I would increase the probability of a 'Yes' outcome with each passing week that brings no news of successful negotiations. I would decrease it upon seeing credible reports of a successful meeting between Lesotho's delegation and high-level US trade officials, or an official US statement indicating a policy review.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill the US government's harmonized tarifff schedule list the tariff on Lesotho as 50% on June 1, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nAP: [How tiny Lesotho ended up with the highest US tariffs in the world](https://apnews.com/article/lesotho-us-trump-tariffs-b337efa47290e889aa076cc9ede7bc9d)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if the duty provided in the applicable subheading is + 50% for Lesotho at the American government's [harmonized tariff schedule](https://hts.usitc.gov/search?query=lesotho) when accessed by Metaculus on or after June 1, 2025.\n\nWhether the provision is listed as suspended will not affect resolution.\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nThe U.S. imposed a 50% tariff on Lesotho due to a significant trade imbalance; in 2024, Lesotho exported approximately $237-240 million worth of goods to the U.S., while importing only about $2.8-3 million from the U.S. The tariff is expected to severely impact Lesotho's economy, particularly its textile and apparel industry, which employs around 40,000 workers and constitutes about 90% of the country's manufacturing employment and exports.

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
