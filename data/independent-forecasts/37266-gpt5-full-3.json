  "information": "The U.S. State Department's travel advisory for Mozambique is currently 'Level 3: Reconsider Travel,' as of the last update on December 19, 2023. Specific northern regions of the country are under higher-level warnings. Recent security developments include suspected jihadist attacks in late April and early May 2025 in Niassa province, an area previously less impacted by the insurgency centered in Cabo Delgado. In response, the U.S. Embassy in Maputo issued specific warnings. The UK and Canada have also warned against travel to parts of Niassa and Cabo Delgado. Concurrently, ongoing post-election protests have led the African Travel & Tourism Association (ATTA) to issue its own travel advisory.\n\nThe U.S. State Department uses a four-level travel advisory system. Level 1 is 'Exercise Normal Precautions.' Level 2 is 'Exercise Increased Caution,' for heightened safety and security risks. Level 3, 'Reconsider Travel,' signifies serious risks. Level 4, 'Do Not Travel,' is the highest level, typically applied in cases of widespread violent conflict, civil war, uncontrolled crime, risk of wrongful detention, or severe breakdowns in national infrastructure. The advisories are determined based on factors including crime, terrorism, civil unrest, and health concerns. The State Department reviews advisories for Level 3 and 4 countries at least every six months.\n\nAs of early May 2025, the U.S. State Department has 'Level 4: Do Not Travel' advisories in effect for 21 countries. Reasons for these advisories include active conflicts, terrorism, civil unrest, kidnapping, and health emergencies. The list of countries includes Afghanistan, Belarus, Burkina Faso, Haiti, Iran, Iraq, North Korea, Russia, Somalia, South Sudan, Sudan, Syria, Ukraine, and Yemen. Some advisories have been updated recently; the advisory for South Sudan was elevated to Level 4 on March 8, 2025. In other instances, advisories are applied regionally, such as in Bangladesh, which has a country-wide Level 3 advisory but a Level 4 warning for the Chittagong Hill Tracts region.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "About 60 days (until June 30, 2025)",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No — Mozambique remains at Level 3: Reconsider Travel, with possible regional Level 4 warnings in the north.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Violence remains largely localized to Cabo Delgado/Niassa with intermittent incidents; protests ebb without nationwide paralysis; the State Department updates Mozambique’s page but keeps the overall advisory at Level 3 while potentially expanding/clarifying “Do Not Travel” language for specific northern provinces.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "A sharp, nationwide deterioration: a sustained insurgent expansion beyond the far north, mass-casualty attacks or kidnappings affecting foreigners, major urban unrest or security-force crackdowns in Maputo/Beira, evacuation advisories, or a broad security/infrastructure breakdown that prompts the State Department to elevate Mozambique’s countrywide level to 4.",
    "rationale": "- Status quo: The U.S. advisory is Level 3 (last noted Dec 19, 2023). The State Department generally reserves Level 4 for widespread conflict, systemic collapse, or very high risk of kidnapping/terrorism affecting much of the country. Mozambique’s serious risks have been concentrated in the north, historically managed via regional “Do Not Travel” guidance while keeping the country overall at Level 3.\n- Recent developments: Suspected jihadist attacks in late April/early May 2025 in Niassa indicate geographic spillover from Cabo Delgado, and the U.S. Embassy issued warnings. UK/Canada also warned about parts of Niassa and Cabo Delgado. ATTA highlighted protest-related risks. These raise risk, but they do not yet imply countrywide collapse or nationwide targeting of foreigners.\n- Base rates and timing: As of early May 2025, only ~21 countries are at Level 4—typically places with active wars or profound instability (Afghanistan, Sudan, Yemen, etc.). Upgrading a Level 3 country to Level 4 within a two‑month window is uncommon absent a clear inflection (e.g., major offensive, widespread unrest, evacuations). The State Department often handles Mozambique-like risk profiles by maintaining Level 3 and specifying Level 4 regionally (as it does in other countries such as Bangladesh’s Chittagong Hill Tracts).\n- Why not higher: The insurgency’s most intense impacts remain in the far north; Niassa incidents are worrying but do not by themselves necessitate a nationwide Level 4. Protests add friction but have not produced systemic, nationwide paralysis comparable to recent Level 4 cases.\n- Why not lower: Evidence of geographic spread (into Niassa), fresh embassy warnings, and political tensions mean an adverse surprise is plausible over the next ~60 days. A significant escalation or urban incidents could trigger a swift Level 4.\n- What would move me up: A major, sustained escalation (e.g., high‑profile attacks or kidnappings in or near major cities, broad disruption to transport/infrastructure, evacuation orders for U.S. personnel, Rwandan/SADC drawdown leading to loss of control in multiple provinces, or explicit State Dept regional Level 4 expansions accompanied by strong language foreshadowing a countrywide upgrade).\n- What would move me down: Several quiet weeks with no further spread beyond the north; protests wane; State Dept issues an update reaffirming Level 3 with only regional “Do Not Travel” restrictions.\nOn balance, the status quo and U.S. advisory practices imply a low but non‑negligible chance of a countrywide Level 4 by July 1, 2025.",
