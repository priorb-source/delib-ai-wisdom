    "review": "The other forecasters and I share a consensus that the status quo strongly favors a 'No' outcome, but that Muqtada al-Sadr's history of unpredictability keeps a 'Yes' outcome on the table. Forecaster 2 added useful detail by framing the Iraqi President's plea as a sign of active negotiations and highlighting potential grassroots pressure as a driver for Sadr's return, justifying a non-zero probability. Forecaster 3 provided the most decisive argument, which I had not sufficiently weighted: Sadr's historical pattern of behavior, specifically his 2021 reversal, where he announced his re-entry into the election just two months before the vote. This precedent creates a strong distinction between the question of *if* he will participate and the question of *when* he would announce it.",
    "rationale": "I am updating my forecast downwards from 15% to 10%. While my initial analysis correctly identified Sadr's stated boycott as the primary evidence for a 'No' outcome, I was swayed by Forecaster 3's compelling point about the timing of any potential reversal. Sadr's 2021 decision to re-enter the race came very late in the electoral cycle. This historical precedent suggests that even if he does intend to participate in the 2025 election, his tactical preference is to wait until the last possible moment to maximize leverage and maintain ambiguity. Announcing before July 1, 2025, seems unnecessarily early and out of character, unless forced by an unforeseen political catalyst. This insight fundamentally changes the calculation; the probability of a 'Yes' is not just the probability of him changing his mind, but the probability of him changing his mind *and* announcing it unusually early. This combination of factors is highly unlikely. Therefore, I am lowering my forecast to 10% to reflect the low probability of a strategic reversal being announced within this specific, short timeframe.",
