    "review": "Forecaster 2 reinforces several base-rate and procedural points I agree with: mid-year passage of complex tax bills is less common than year-end Finance Acts, the window is tight, and an Eid al-Adha recess could compress June sitting days. They also correctly stress that only enacted legislation counts (not FIRS circulars), which is important to the resolution. Forecaster 3 introduces the biggest new claim: that the House has already passed the Tax Reform Bill and the Senate is next, with an explicit July 1 implementation target. If true (final passage in the House rather than just a second reading), that meaningfully raises the odds because only Senate passage, potential harmonization, and presidential assent would remain. However, Nigerian reportage often headlines “passage” at second reading, so I’m cautious without corroboration. I find F3’s directionally optimistic stance plausible if the House truly passed on third reading and leadership is prioritizing a July 1 start, but 61% feels high given slippage risk, potential amendments, revenue concerns from states over VAT, and the possibility that contentious items elsewhere in the package delay the overall bill. Overall, F2’s caution on timing and legislative practice is convincing; F3’s update on House status, if accurate, merits a moderate upward adjustment.",
    "rationale": "Time is short (~8 weeks), and the measure sits within a broader, potentially contentious package facing labor opposition and fiscal scrutiny. That keeps the baseline below even. Still, executive backing, public framing around housing affordability, and APC control of the National Assembly give a plausible path to a quick finish if leadership prioritizes it. The key new piece is the claim that the House has already passed the bill; even if that was only a second/committee stage, it suggests momentum. I therefore move up from 34% to reflect increased plausibility of late-June enactment, but I stay under 50% because: (1) uncertainty over the true stage of House action; (2) Senate timing risks, including possible committee bottlenecks and a June recess; (3) risk that the VAT exemption is amended or the bill slips into a later Finance/Appropriation cycle. A clean, narrow VAT amendment moving separately would raise odds further, but there’s no firm evidence of that yet.",
