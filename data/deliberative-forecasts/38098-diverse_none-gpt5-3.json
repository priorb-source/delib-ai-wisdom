    "review": "Both forecasters emphasize the short fuse to July 1 and the absence of pre-launch signals (staff hires, exploratory/FEC moves, scheduled events, donor signaling). They also note the arbitrariness of the July 1 cutoff versus the typical window for a 2026 primary and argue that if a June launch were imminent, we’d likely see leaks. I find this reasoning sound and aligned with my own; the stress on signal absence as strong negative evidence over a 32-day window is persuasive. The only countervailing factor remains the Q2 fundraising deadline, which could motivate a late-June rollout, but that alone doesn’t overcome the lack of visible preparation.",
    "rationale": "I previously set 14% largely to account for a potential late-June announcement to capture Q2 fundraising and deter rivals. After weighing the others’ points—especially the expectation of observable groundwork before a statewide launch—I see modestly stronger reasons to shade down. The July 1 date is arbitrary for Norman; he can still announce later in 2025 with ample runway. Without credible reports of staffing, FEC activity, or a scheduled event, the base rate for a surprise launch in the next month remains low. I’m lowering from 14% to 12%. I would move up on any reputable report of an announcement event, Senate committee formation/switch, or senior staff hires; I would move down on statements recommitting to the House or reporting that any decision is deferred until after July 1.",
