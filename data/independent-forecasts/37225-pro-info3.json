  "information": "The general election is scheduled for May 25, 2025. A significant change in the electoral process is the shift to a National Proportional Representation system, which replaces the previous district-based system and will be used for the first time. The opposition is described as fragmented. The NDP is facing challenges after the death of former leader Desi Bouterse. Some smaller parties, including the Sociaal Democratische Unie (SDU), Permanente Voorspoed Republiek Suriname (PVRS), and De Nieuwe Wind (DNW), have formed an alliance to run together under the SDU banner.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "About one month, with the election scheduled for May 25, 2025.",
    "status_quo_outcome": "The Progressive Reform Party (VHP) wins the most seats, as they did in the 2020 election, making them the largest party in the National Assembly.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Anti-incumbency sentiment against President Santokhi's government consolidates behind a revitalized National Democratic Party (NDP) or another opposition coalition. The new national proportional representation system allows this challenger to narrowly win a plurality of seats, even with a fragmented opposition field.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "The VHP leverages its incumbency, and the opposition remains fractured. The NDP, weakened by the death of its leader Desi Bouterse, fails to mount a strong campaign. No other single party or coalition gathers enough support to challenge the VHP, which secures a plurality of seats, similar to the 2020 outcome.",
    "rationale": "My forecast is based on the current political landscape, where the incumbent Progressive Reform Party (VHP) holds a significant advantage. The status quo is that the VHP is the largest party, having won a plurality of 20 out of 51 seats in 2020. The primary opposition, the National Democratic Party (NDP), is facing a severe leadership crisis following the death of its long-time leader, Desi Bouterse. This is likely to hamper their campaign organization and voter mobilization. The research notes that the broader opposition is fragmented, with new, smaller alliances like the SDU-led coalition emerging. This fragmentation will likely split the anti-incumbency vote, making it difficult for any single party to surpass the VHP's seat count. \n\nMy probability is not higher because of two main uncertainties. First, incumbent governments often face public dissatisfaction, and the VHP is not immune to criticism over its performance. Second, and more importantly, this will be the first election conducted under a new national proportional representation system. This change introduces significant unpredictability, as its effects on voter behavior and seat allocation are untested in Suriname. It could potentially benefit smaller parties or a consolidated opposition bloc in unexpected ways.\n\nMy probability is not lower because the disarray in the main opposition NDP is a profound structural weakness for them. It is difficult to envision another single party having the national infrastructure and support base to overtake the VHP in such a short time. For a 'No' outcome to occur, the disparate opposition would either need to coalesce rapidly or the NDP would need to demonstrate a surprising resilience and unity post-Bouterse. \n\nI would increase my forecast if polling data shows a strong lead for the VHP, or if the NDP shows further signs of public infighting. I would decrease my forecast if a major opposition coalition forms, a charismatic new leader emerges for the NDP, or reliable polls indicate a tight race.",
