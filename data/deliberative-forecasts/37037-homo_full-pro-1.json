    "review": "The other two forecasters and I are in strong agreement on the fundamental drivers of this question. We all recognize that the status quo is overwhelmingly powerful, given the tariff is already enacted, the resolution date is imminent, and the U.S. explicitly excluded Lesotho from a 90-day tariff pause offered to others. This alignment gives me confidence in a high-probability forecast. Forecaster 3 introduced a particularly insightful argument for a 'No' outcome that I hadn't fully articulated: that the U.S. might reverse the tariff on Lesotho as a low-cost 'strategic concession' to appear more reasonable in its larger, more consequential trade disputes with the EU and China. This provides a more plausible mechanism for a reversal than simple pressure from Lesotho alone. While I find this reasoning compelling, I do not believe it warrants a change in my forecast, as it runs counter to the strongest piece of evidence: the U.S. already passed on the opportunity for a low-cost concession by excluding Lesotho from the pause.",
    "rationale": "My initial forecast of 90% remains unchanged after deliberation. The core reasoning is robust and was shared by the other experts: the 50% tariff is an enacted policy, the timeline to the June 1 resolution date is extremely short for a bureaucratic reversal, and the U.S. administration has already demonstrated a firm stance by specifically excluding Lesotho from a 90-day pause granted to some other nations. This last point remains the most powerful piece of evidence suggesting the administration's intent to maintain this specific tariff. \n\nThe deliberation introduced a valuable nuance to the minority 'No' scenario. Forecaster 3's point that reversing the tariff could serve as a low-cost strategic gambit for the U.S. to soften its image amidst larger trade wars is a valid and plausible mechanism for a reversal. However, this possibility is counteracted by the administration's prior action. They had a perfect opportunity to make this very concession when implementing the 90-day pause and explicitly chose not to. This suggests that maintaining the integrity of their new formulaic policy, or some other strategic consideration, outweighs the potential PR benefits of a reversal for Lesotho. Therefore, my 90% forecast continues to accurately represent the overwhelming inertia of the current situation while still accounting for the small (approximately 10%) chance of a rapid, unexpected diplomatic or strategic reversal.",
