  "information": "The latest published value for Ukraine's government debt for February 2025 was 1.869 trillion UAH. The threshold for the question to resolve as 'Yes' is 1.900 trillion UAH, necessitating a month-on-month increase of at least 30.5 billion UAH. Historical data from 2024-2025 shows that the typical monthly net change in debt ranged from a decrease of 10 billion UAH to an increase of 110 billion UAH. The median monthly increase during this period was approximately 25 billion UAH, and the increase from January to February 2025 was 18.5 billion UAH. In seven of the twelve months preceding March 2025, the monthly increase was 30 billion UAH or greater.\n\nIn mid-March 2025, Ukraine received a disbursement from an IMF Extended Fund Facility (EFF) tranche amounting to $400 million, which is equivalent to approximately 16 billion UAH. Furthermore, the first tranche of EU ERA loans, valued at €1 billion, was expected in late March. Domestic bond auctions have continued to raise approximately 26 billion UAH per month. Debt servicing costs for March were reported to be modest.\n\nBy the end of 2024, Ukraine's total state debt had reached approximately 7 trillion UAH, equivalent to about 92% of the country's GDP. The state budget for 2024 operated with a significant deficit, and the Accounting Chamber of Ukraine reported a 29% increase in tax debt during that year. During March 2025, the Ukrainian hryvnia weakened from 41.1 to 41.4 UAH/USD. This 0.7% depreciation increased the UAH valuation of Ukraine's foreign-currency denominated debt by an estimated 9-11 billion UAH.",

    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "About 1 week (Trading Economics typically posts the prior month’s figure in the second half of the following month; March 2025 should post by late April/early May).",
    "status_quo_outcome": "Slightly below 1.90 trillion UAH (continuation of the median ~25B UAH monthly increase from the February base of 1.869T would reach ~1.894T).",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "The EU ERA €1B loan posts in early April (not March); domestic net issuance is small or offset by redemptions; only the IMF $400M disbursement and a modest FX valuation effect hit in March, yielding a net increase under ~30.5B UAH, keeping the total around 1.885–1.895T UAH.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "The EU €1B loan is booked in late March, on top of the IMF $400M tranche, ongoing domestic net issuance, and a small UAH depreciation that boosts the UAH value of FX debt, pushing the monthly increase well above ~30.5B UAH and lifting the stock to ≥1.90T UAH.",
    "rationale": "Starting point: February 2025 stood at ~1.869T UAH on Trading Economics. The threshold for a Yes is ≥1.900T, requiring a ≥30.5B UAH net monthly increase. Recent history (2024–early 2025) shows monthly net changes ranging from about −10B to +110B, with a median around +25B; 7 of the prior 12 months exceeded +30B, implying a baseline probability near the high 50s before considering month-specific information. March specifics tilt positive: (1) IMF EFF disbursement of ~$400M (~16B UAH) landed in mid-March; (2) the hryvnia’s ~0.7% depreciation in March adds an estimated 9–11B UAH via FX valuation; (3) domestic bond auctions have been raising on the order of ~26B UAH per month, with net effects often positive; and (4) debt service in March appears modest, reducing the risk of large amortizations pulling the net down. The main uncertainty is timing of the EU ERA loan: if €1B was booked in late March, that single item likely ensures a Yes; if it slipped to April, the remaining components (IMF + FX valuation + typical net domestic issuance) still plausibly total around or slightly above the needed ~30.5B UAH, but it becomes a closer call. I place extra weight on the status quo (world changes slowly): absent the EU tranche in March, the typical month would land just below the threshold. However, the combination of a known IMF inflow plus FX valuation, alongside the decent frequency of prior months exceeding +30B, nudges the probability above even odds. Why not higher: uncertainty over whether the EU €1B was booked in March vs early April; potential for larger-than-usual redemptions reducing domestic net; Trading Economics’ series definitions/timing conventions. Why not lower: even without the EU tranche, IMF + FX valuation and typical domestic net issuance make ≥30.5B UAH plausible; historical frequency of ≥30B months is substantial. What would move me up: confirmation the EU €1B posted on or before March 31 and/or evidence of strong positive net domestic issuance in March. What would move me down: confirmation the EU funds posted in April, evidence of sizable March redemptions reducing net issuance, or a revision showing a smaller FX-debt share dampening the valuation effect.",

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any).
