  "information": "Following Johnny Walker's withdrawal, it was announced that Azamat Murzakanov would remain on the UFC 316 card against a new opponent. As reported by MMA Fighting and Championat.com around May 7-9, 2025, Brendson Ribeiro was signed as the replacement fighter. Ribeiro entered the fight with a professional record of 15-7. The updated UFC 316 bout sheet officially listed the light heavyweight clash as Azamat Murzakanov vs. Brendson Ribeiro.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "UFC 316 is scheduled to take place soon (likely within days or weeks from May 26, 2025), though the practical outcome is already determined since the fight card has been finalized.",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No - Johnny Walker has withdrawn from UFC 316 and will not face Azamat Murzakanov",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Johnny Walker remains withdrawn from UFC 316. Azamat Murzakanov fights Brendson Ribeiro as scheduled on the updated bout sheet. Walker either does not fight at the event or fights a different opponent (both scenarios resolve as No per the criteria).",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "An extremely unlikely scenario where Walker's withdrawal is reversed, Brendson Ribeiro is removed from the bout, and Walker is reinstated to fight Murzakanov at UFC 316, followed by Walker winning that fight.",
    "rationale": "The research assistant confirms that Johnny Walker withdrew from his scheduled bout with Azamat Murzakanov at UFC 316. This withdrawal was announced around May 7-9, 2025, nearly three weeks ago. A replacement fighter, Brendson Ribeiro, has been officially signed and the updated UFC 316 bout sheet lists Murzakanov vs. Ribeiro. Once a fighter withdraws and a replacement is contracted and publicly announced by major MMA outlets, it is extraordinarily rare for the original fighter to be re-added to the card. The UFC would have already signed contracts with Ribeiro, promoted the new matchup, and moved forward with planning. The status quo is firmly established: Walker is not fighting Murzakanov at UFC 316. For this forecast to move higher, we would need evidence that Walker is being re-added to the card to face Murzakanov (which currently doesn't exist and would be unprecedented). For it to be lower, we would need absolute confirmation that UFC 316 has already occurred or that there is zero possibility of card changes (though we're already at near-certainty). The tiny probability I assign (2%) accounts only for the theoretical possibility of some highly unusual administrative reversal or error, not because there's any actual evidence this could happen.",

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any).
