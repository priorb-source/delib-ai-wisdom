  "information": "As of mid-May 2025, flight tracking websites indicate that Saipan International Airport (SPN) has three to four non-stop flight destinations. These are Guam (GUM), served by United Airlines; Seoul-Incheon (ICN), served by Jeju Air, T’way Air, and Jin Air; Busan (PUS), served by Jeju Air; and an intermittently listed service to Tokyo-Narita (NRT), operated by United Airlines. A report by the Mastercard Economics Institute notes a general surge in travel within the Asia-Pacific region. Saipan's tourism appeal is supported by sightseeing opportunities related to its history, nature, and culture, including tours of WWII battlefields and natural sites like Managaha Island and The Grotto.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "About six weeks, with the outcome determined on or after July 1, 2025.",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No. The current number of direct flight destinations is three to four, which is not greater than four.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "The current flight schedule remains largely unchanged through July 1, 2025. Airlines maintain their existing routes to Guam, Seoul, and Busan, and the Tokyo-Narita service remains intermittent or does not operate consistently. Economic conditions or sluggish tourism demand prevent any new carriers from launching services to Saipan within this short timeframe.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "A new direct route is launched before July 1, 2025, bringing the total number of destinations to five or more. This could be driven by a last-minute charter agreement to capture peak summer travel demand, for example from a Chinese city like Shanghai, or the reinstatement of a route from the Philippines (e.g., Manila). This scenario would require the four current destinations to remain active.",
    "rationale": "My forecast is anchored to the status quo. As of late May 2025, Saipan has three to four direct flight destinations (Guam, Seoul, Busan, and an intermittent Tokyo service). The question requires a strict 'greater than 4', meaning a minimum of five distinct destinations. The timeline for this to occur is very short—approximately six weeks. Launching new international airline routes typically involves months of planning, regulatory approval, and marketing, making the addition of a new, stable route by July 1 highly improbable.\n\nThe research indicates that while the broader Asia-Pacific region is seeing a travel surge, the provided background context specifically highlights that the Northern Marianas 'struggles to revive tourism amid flight suspensions.' This suggests that Saipan is facing specific headwinds that counteract the general positive trend, making it an unlikely candidate for rapid air service expansion.\n\nMy probability is not lower than 15% because there is a small but non-zero chance of a charter service being added on short notice to meet summer holiday demand, particularly from a resurgent market like China or Japan. Such an addition, if it materializes and the existing routes are maintained, could push the number to five.\n\nMy probability is not higher because this would require a significant and rapid change from the current situation. It would mean that in just over a month, Saipan's aviation landscape would need to improve contrary to the reported struggles. The inertia of airline scheduling and the specific challenges facing the destination are strong drivers for a 'No' outcome.\n\nI would increase my forecast upon an official announcement of a new direct route from an airline scheduled to start before July 1, 2025. I would decrease it if the intermittent Tokyo-Narita route is officially discontinued for the summer season.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill there be greater than 4 direct flight destinations from Saipan, Northern Mariana Islands on July 1, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nTravel and Tour World: [Northern Marianas struggles to revive tourism amid flight suspensions and travel restrictions: What you need to know?](https://www.travelandtourworld.com/news/article/northern-marianas-struggles-to-revive-tourism-amid-flight-suspensions-and-travel-restrictions-what-you-need-to-know/)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below.

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
