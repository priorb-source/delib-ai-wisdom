  "information": "Legal experts and former IRS officials state that the revocation process normally involves a multi-step, years-long procedure including an audit, formal notice, appeals, and litigation. Statutory safeguards, such as IRC § 7217 and a 1998 anti-targeting law, are intended to prevent direct presidential direction or politically motivated targeting. The IRS is also reportedly experiencing significant internal challenges, including leadership turnover with three acting directors in one week and workforce reductions. Despite these procedural hurdles, multiple news outlets have reported the Trump administration has formally asked the IRS to begin revocation proceedings and that the agency is 'making plans' to rescind Harvard’s exemption.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Slightly over two months, as the date is April 25, 2025, and the resolution date is July 1, 2025.",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No. Harvard University maintains its tax-exempt status.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "The Internal Revenue Service, bound by established legal and administrative procedures, does not complete a revocation of Harvard's 501(c)(3) status by the deadline. Despite political pressure, the multi-year process involving audits, appeals, and potential litigation, along with statutory safeguards against political targeting, proceeds at its normal pace, extending well beyond July 1, 2025.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Under immense pressure from the executive branch, a compliant IRS leadership drastically expedites the revocation process, bypassing or compressing normal procedures and legal safeguards. A final determination letter revoking Harvard's 501(c)(3) status is issued just before the July 1, 2025 deadline, triggering a 'Yes' resolution, even if the decision is immediately challenged in court.",
    "rationale": "My forecast is heavily weighted towards the 'No' outcome, primarily due to the significant institutional and legal inertia that protects an organization's tax-exempt status. As my research assistant noted, the process for revoking a 501(c)(3) status is deliberately long and complex, typically spanning several years and involving multiple stages of review and appeal. The timeline of just over two months is exceptionally short for such a procedure to be concluded. Furthermore, there are specific statutory safeguards, like IRC § 7217 and anti-targeting laws, designed to prevent exactly this kind of politically motivated action. The reported internal challenges at the IRS, including leadership turmoil and reduced staffing, further reduce the agency's capacity to execute such a controversial and legally fraught order on an accelerated timeline. The strong base rate is that major universities do not lose their tax status this way.\n\nMy forecast is not lower than 8% because there is credible reporting of an explicit directive from the Trump administration to the IRS, and, crucially, that the agency is 'making plans' to act. This is not just rhetoric; it is a reported administrative action. This introduces a non-trivial risk of norm-breaking, where a compliant acting director could attempt to bypass standard procedures to satisfy the executive branch's demand. The possibility of an unprecedented, politically-driven administrative action, even one that is legally dubious, prevents me from setting the probability near zero.\n\nMy forecast is not higher than 8% because the legal and procedural hurdles are immense. A successful revocation would require a rapid and successful subversion of established administrative law and IRS procedure, likely in the face of internal resistance and immediate external legal challenges. Career staff at the IRS and Treasury are likely to resist such an order, and the statutory protections, while perhaps not insurmountable, present a very high barrier to clear in such a short period.\n\nI would increase my forecast if there were credible reports of a specific, compliant acting commissioner being installed at the IRS who publicly commits to this action, or if a court refuses to grant an injunction to halt an expedited process. I would decrease my forecast if the IRS or Treasury Department publicly stated that normal, multi-year procedures would be followed, or if the administration appeared to de-escalate its public pressure.",

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
