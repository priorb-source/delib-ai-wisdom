  "information": "UFC 316 is scheduled for June 7, 2025, at the Prudential Center in Newark, New Jersey. The event's main fight is a bantamweight title rematch between Sean O'Malley and Merab Dvalishvili. Donald Trump and UFC President Dana White have a long-standing public friendship. In the past, Trump hosted early UFC events at his properties, including the Trump Taj Mahal in Atlantic City. White has publicly supported Trump, including an appearance at the 2024 National Republican Convention.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "About 38 days (event on June 7, 2025)",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No — for any single UFC card, the default is that he does not attend.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "The White House schedules overseas travel or major events around June 6–8 (e.g., D‑Day commemorations or a summit), security/political considerations make Newark impractical, the card weakens, or he opts to spend the weekend at Bedminster without going to the arena.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "He spends the weekend at Bedminster (nearby), Dana White invites him, security is arranged, and he appears cageside or backstage at Prudential Center; media and UFC social accounts highlight his attendance.",
    "rationale": "- What I know: UFC 316 is June 7, 2025 at Prudential Center (Newark, NJ), headlined by O’Malley–Dvalishvili. Trump and Dana White have a long, public friendship; Trump has attended multiple UFC events over the years, including a recent Miami card in April 2025 (NYT). Newark is logistically convenient relative to Trump’s Bedminster, NJ base, suggesting low travel friction.\n- Base rate/status quo: Even with his affinity for UFC, Trump attends only a subset of cards. For any specific PPV, the default outcome is non-attendance. I anchor below 50% accordingly.\n- Factors pushing Yes: (1) Strong personal relationship with Dana White; (2) High‑profile title fight with O’Malley; (3) Proximity to Bedminster and prior precedent of attending big Northeast cards; (4) Demonstrated willingness to attend UFC events as sitting president (per April Miami appearance), implying security/logistics are feasible.\n- Factors pushing No: (1) Presidential schedule uncertainty in early June—possible D‑Day (June 6) observances or other overseas commitments could create conflicts or travel fatigue; (2) Heightened security/political optics in Newark; (3) Card changes could reduce draw; (4) He already attended a UFC event in April 2025, so he may space appearances.\n- Why not higher: Significant scheduling uncertainty around early June for a sitting president, plus the general base rate that he skips most individual events.\n- Why not lower: The location is unusually convenient, relationship with the UFC is strong, and he has very recent precedent of attending as president.\n- What would move me up: Public hints or confirmation from Dana White/UFC or the White House; signs he’ll be at Bedminster that weekend; strengthening of the UFC 316 card or added promotional tie‑ins.\n- What would move me down: Announced overseas travel or major domestic commitments June 6–8; credible reporting of security concerns/protests that complicate Newark logistics; main‑event collapse or venue change that reduces appeal.",
