    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "About 33 days (until July 1, 2025)",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No — Morning Consult has typically shown Erdoğan’s approval a few points higher than Sánchez’s in recent months, and ties resolve as No.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Erdoğan’s approval remains around the low-to-mid 40s while Sánchez’s sits in the high 30s to low 40s; or they tie. No major shocks occur before early July, so the existing gap persists.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "A late-June slide in Erdoğan’s approval (e.g., due to economic pain from inflation/tightening or an unpopular policy move) coincides with a small uptick for Sánchez (e.g., favorable economic news or opposition misstep), leaving Sánchez marginally ahead in the July 1 reading.",
    "rationale": "Evidence and base rates: Morning Consult’s tracker over 2024–early 2025 has generally placed Recep Tayyip Erdoğan’s approval modestly above Pedro Sánchez’s. While exact figures vary week to week, the typical pattern has been Erdoğan in roughly the low-to-mid 40s and Sánchez in the high 30s to low 40s. With only about a month left and the tracker using a trailing 7-day average, large ranking reversals are uncommon without clear shocks.\n\nDrivers by country: \n- Turkey: Inflation remains elevated and fiscal/monetary tightening is ongoing. These could pressure Erdoğan’s approval, but absent a discrete negative event, changes over a few weeks are likely incremental. \n- Spain: Sánchez’s approval has been range-bound, buffeted by domestic political controversies but supported by relatively resilient macro indicators. Small moves are plausible, but large jumps are unlikely on this time horizon.\n\nWhy not higher than my forecast: The status quo has Erdoğan ahead, ties count as No, and the short timeline plus smoothing of the measure lowers the chance of a crossover. \nWhy not lower: Turkey’s economic adjustment could still nick Erdoğan’s rating, and normal week-to-week noise plus any modest positive news for Sánchez could narrow or flip a small gap. Morning Consult data can swing a few points month to month, so a crossover is not out of the question.\n\nWhat would change my view: \n- Upward (toward Yes): New Morning Consult updates showing the gap has already shrunk to ~1–2 points; reports of unpopular Turkish policy changes or economic shocks; Spanish polling momentum for Sánchez. \n- Downward (toward No): Updates showing Erdoğan comfortably ahead (≥5-point lead) near late June; any negative event for Sánchez; or signs of a rally-round-the-flag effect in Turkey.\n\nResearch assistant input: No additional information was available; forecast is based on public pattern recognition of recent Morning Consult trends and country-level fundamentals, with extra weight on the status quo given limited time remaining.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill Spanish Prime Minister Pedro Sánchez have a higher approval rating than Turkey's President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan on July 1, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nResolution source updates monthly. According to Morning Consult for January 2025: \"The latest approval ratings are based on data collected from Jan. 21-27, 2025. Ratings reflect a trailing seven-day simple moving average of views among adults in each country surveyed.\"\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if Pedro Sánchez has a higher approval rating than Recep Tayyip Erdoğan according to [Morning Consult](https://pro.morningconsult.com/trackers/global-leader-approval) when checked by Metaculus on or after July 1, 2025. If this not the case (including due to a tie), this resolves as **No**.\n\n\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nNo additional information available.\n\nToday is 2025-05-29.\n\nBefore answering you think:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n(e) You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
