  "information": "As of late May 2025, the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) publicly claims total estimated savings of approximately $175 billion on its official tracker website. This figure represents a series of increases throughout early 2025. In late February, the claimed savings were $55 billion, which grew to $115 billion by mid-March. The claimed savings have been attributed to the cancellation of over 25,000 federal contracts and grants. According to DOGE, the most significant savings have been achieved at the Department of Health and Human Services, the General Services Administration, and the Education Department.\n\nElon Musk, who led the DOGE initiative, has departed from his public-facing role but will remain an advisor. The project's work is transitioning to the White House Office of Management and Budget (OMB), under the direction of Russell Vought. The US Treasury Secretary has stated that several members of the DOGE team will be integrated into the Treasury to apply its cost-saving principles on a long-term basis. Both Musk and President Trump have publicly expressed confidence that savings will continue to grow, with Musk suggesting a long-term goal of $1 trillion.\n\nMultiple external analyses and news reports have questioned the accuracy of DOGE's savings claims. A report by watchdog group Open The Books found that only 42% of the terminated contracts and 27% of the grants cited by DOGE could be publicly tracked. Media investigations, including one by The New York Times, have alleged numerous errors in DOGE's accounting, such as double-counting, including contracts that had already expired, and taking credit for 'zombie contracts' that never existed. An estimate by The Atlantic suggested actual verified savings may only amount to $2 billion. Furthermore, a CNN analysis projected that the effort could ultimately cost the government $135 billion due to the expense of retraining and rehiring workers who were let go.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "One month.",
    "status_quo_outcome": "The claimed savings figure continues its recent, albeit slowing, growth trend. Adding another $20-25 billion over the month of June would be in line with recent progress, bringing the total to the $195-200 billion range, making a 'Yes' resolution likely.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "The transition of the DOGE project to the Office of Management and Budget introduces bureaucratic friction, halting the rapid announcement of new savings. Scrutiny from media and watchdog groups prompts a more cautious approach, and the 'low-hanging fruit' of easy-to-cut contracts has been exhausted. The claimed savings figure stalls below the $200 billion mark as of July 1, 2025.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "There is a strong political desire to reach the psychologically significant $200 billion milestone. In June, the administration makes a final push, announcing the cancellation of another large set of grants or contracts to ensure the publicly-tracked number surpasses the target by the deadline. This is announced as a major victory for the initiative before its functions are fully integrated into government agencies.",
    "rationale": "My forecast is based primarily on two factors: the proximity to the target and the strong political incentive to reach it. The resolution of this question depends solely on the figure claimed by DOGE on its website, not on externally verified savings. As of late May 2025, the claimed savings are $175 billion, leaving a gap of only $25 billion to be closed in one month. While the growth rate of claimed savings has slowed since the initial surge in early 2025 (from ~$20B/week to ~$6B/week), the current pace is still sufficient to come very close to, or exceed, the target. Given that $200 billion is a significant round number, it is highly probable that the administration will be motivated to find the requisite 'savings' to claim a political victory. The numerous external reports questioning the validity of the claims are unlikely to influence the self-reported number, as the administration can control the metric that resolves this question.\n\nMy probability is not higher because the slowing growth rate is a tangible data point suggesting that identifying new large savings may be getting more difficult. Additionally, the transition to the OMB could introduce unforeseen delays or a more conservative accounting process, which could prevent the number from being updated in time.\n\nMy probability is not lower because the incentive structure overwhelmingly favors a 'Yes' outcome. The administration and its allies have a strong interest in the project being perceived as a massive success. Since they control the reporting, they are very likely to ensure the number crosses the $200 billion threshold by the deadline.\n\nI would increase my forecast if there are new public statements from officials targeting the $200 billion figure or if a significant new saving is announced in early June. I would decrease my forecast if the tracker website is not updated throughout June or if administration officials signal a strategic shift or review of the counting methodology.",
