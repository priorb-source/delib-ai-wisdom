  "information": "Warren Buffett has announced his intention to step down as CEO by the end of 2025, with Greg Abel set to succeed him. Following the announcement, a Stocktwits poll indicated that 46% of retail investors still view Berkshire Hathaway as a long-term 'buy', and retail sentiment on the stock was described as 'extremely bullish'. UBS analysts stated that the company's structural advantages, including its permanent capital and information collection capabilities, are not expected to be significantly reduced by the leadership change.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "About one week. The 13F filing for the quarter ending 2025-03-31 is typically due by mid-May 2025.",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No. Berkshire Hathaway's holding of Amazon has been exactly 10,000,000 shares since early 2019. The status quo is that the holding remains unchanged, which does not meet the 'greater than 10,000,000 shares' threshold.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Berkshire Hathaway's investment managers make no changes to the company's Amazon position during Q1 2025, or they sell some or all of their stake. Their 13F filing consequently shows a holding of 10,000,000 shares or fewer.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Believing Amazon to be attractively priced or seeing a new long-term opportunity during Q1 2025, one of Berkshire's investment managers (likely Todd Combs or Ted Weschler) decides to increase the company's stake. The subsequent 13F filing reports a holding of more than 10,000,000 shares.",
    "rationale": "The primary factor driving this forecast is the historical inertia of the position. Berkshire Hathaway has maintained a holding of exactly 10,000,000 shares of Amazon since the first quarter of 2019. This six-year period with no reported transactions creates a very strong base rate that no changes will be made in any given quarter. The status quo is the most likely outcome. The information regarding Warren Buffett's succession plan and bullish market sentiment is noted, but these long-term factors are unlikely to directly influence a specific portfolio adjustment in Q1 2025 by the investment managers, who operate with significant autonomy and a stable investment process. \n\nMy forecast is not lower than 10% because a purchase is not impossible. The position was likely initiated by Todd Combs or Ted Weschler, who could have seen a buying opportunity if Amazon's stock experienced a significant dip during the first quarter. They have the capital and the mandate to act on high-conviction ideas.\n\nMy forecast is not higher because the six-year history of inaction is extremely compelling evidence against a change. Without a strong, specific catalyst—such as a market crash creating obvious bargains—it is more probable that they remained satisfied with their existing position size. \n\nI would increase my probability of a 'Yes' outcome if there had been a substantial downturn in Amazon's stock price during Q1 2025. Conversely, I would have decreased my probability if Berkshire had announced another major acquisition during the quarter, suggesting capital had been deployed elsewhere.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill Berkshire Hathaway reveal a purchase of more Amazon stock in its Q1 2025 13F filing?\n\nQuestion background:\nStockCircle: [Berkshire Hathaway's Amazon Stake](https://stockcircle.com/portfolio/warren-buffett/amzn/transactions)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if the 13F filing for Berkshire Hathaway, Inc., filed for the period ending 2025-03-31, reports the company holding greater than 10,000,000 shares of Amazon.com, Inc.\n\n\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nWarren Buffett has announced his intention to step down as CEO by the end of 2025, with Greg Abel set to succeed him.

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
