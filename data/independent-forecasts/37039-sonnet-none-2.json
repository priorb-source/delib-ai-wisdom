    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Approximately 5 weeks (from April 24, 2025 to June 1, 2025)",
    "status_quo_outcome": "Unclear from available information, but the existence of a New York Times article from April 4, 2025 suggests a tariff announcement has been made or is under serious consideration. The status quo is likely that either the tariff has been announced but not yet implemented, or is in the process of being codified into the harmonized tariff schedule.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "The 31% tariff on Switzerland is not implemented by June 1, 2025. This could occur if: negotiations between the US and Switzerland result in a delay or modification; the implementation timeline extends beyond June 1; the tariff rate is adjusted to a different percentage; legal challenges delay the tariff; or the Trump administration reverses or modifies its tariff policy toward Switzerland.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "The announced 31% tariff on Swiss products is implemented as planned and appears in subheading 9903.01.60 of the harmonized tariff schedule by June 1, 2025. The Trump administration follows through on its tariff announcement without negotiating a different rate or delaying implementation, and the specific codification occurs as described in the resolution criteria.",
    "rationale": "This forecast involves significant uncertainty due to limited current information. The New York Times article from April 4, 2025 (20 days ago) provides evidence that Switzerland has been targeted for tariffs, but my research assistant reports no additional details about implementation status or timeline. Key considerations: (1) TIMING: Five weeks between now and June 1 is a reasonable but tight timeline for tariff implementation if announced in early April. Tariffs typically require 30-90 days notice, placing June 1 within the plausible range. (2) SPECIFICITY RISK: The question requires multiple specific conditions to align - exactly 31%, exactly June 1, exactly subheading 9903.01.60. Each requirement adds failure modes. (3) TRUMP ADMINISTRATION PATTERN: Historically demonstrated ability to implement tariffs quickly and aggressively, supporting faster implementation. (4) NEGOTIATION POTENTIAL: Switzerland is a small, wealthy trading partner that could negotiate modifications. (5) STATUS QUO BIAS: Without confirmation that the tariff is already codified, I must account for typical delays, modifications, and policy changes that occur between announcement and implementation. My forecast is not higher because: the exact alignment of rate, date, and classification is uncertain; negotiations could alter the outcome; and implementation could be delayed beyond June 1. My forecast is not lower because: there's concrete evidence of policy movement (NYT article); the Trump administration has shown willingness to implement such tariffs; and the timeline is feasible. I would update upward if I learned: the tariff is already codified in the schedule; official implementation date is confirmed as June 1 or earlier; or Swiss negotiations have failed. I would update downward if: negotiations are ongoing; implementation is officially delayed; or the tariff rate is modified.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill the US government's harmonized tariff schedule list the tariff on Switzerland as 31% on June 1, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nNew York Times: [Swiss Indignant to Make the Top 10 of Trump’s Tariffs List](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/04/business/trump-tariffs-switzerland.html)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if the duty provided in the applicable subheading is + 31% for Switzerland at the American government's [harmonized tariff schedule](https://hts.usitc.gov/search?query=switzerland) when accessed by Metaculus on or after June 1, 2025.\n\nWhether the provision is listed as suspended will not affect resolution.\r\n\r\nPlease note that this question is asking whether the cell in the 'RATES OF DUTY' column '1, General' appearing alongside subheading 9903.01.60 on the Harmonized Tariff Schedule indicates an additional ad valorem duty rate of 31% for articles the product of Switzerland, regardless of any specificities noted in the 'Article Description' column.\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nNo additional information available.\n\nToday is 2025-04-24.\n\nBefore answering you think:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n(e) You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
