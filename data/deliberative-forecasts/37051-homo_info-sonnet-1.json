    "review": "Both forecasters provide valuable additional context. Forecaster 2 emphasizes the Bob Jones precedent (7+ years for revocation) which is a concrete historical data point I should have highlighted. Forecaster 3 introduces crucial new information: (1) specific legal safeguards (IRC § 7217 and the 1998 anti-targeting law) that prevent politically motivated revocations, (2) severe IRS capacity constraints with three acting directors in one week and workforce reductions, and (3) evidence that the administration has formally requested revocation and the IRS is 'making plans' - suggesting this goes beyond mere threats. The legal safeguards and IRS dysfunction are significant barriers I underweighted. However, the evidence of formal requests and institutional planning suggests more concrete movement than I initially assessed. Forecaster 2's 1.5% may be slightly too confident given the formal institutional response, while Forecaster 3's 5% appropriately acknowledges the unprecedented political pressure but perhaps underweights the combined effect of legal safeguards, procedural requirements, and IRS capacity constraints in such a compressed timeframe.",
    "rationale": "After reviewing both analyses, I'm adjusting my forecast slightly downward from 4% to 3%. The additional information about specific legal safeguards (IRC § 7217, 1998 anti-targeting law) and IRS capacity constraints (leadership chaos, workforce reductions) strengthens the case for an even lower probability. The Bob Jones precedent showing 7+ years for such processes is particularly compelling evidence of procedural impossibility within 67 days. However, I'm not going as low as 1.5% because Forecaster 3's point about formal requests and the IRS 'making plans' indicates this has progressed beyond threats to some level of institutional action. The combination of: (1) specific statutory protections against political targeting, (2) severe IRS dysfunction that undermines capacity for rapid complex action, (3) the insurmountable 67-day timeline for a multi-year process, and (4) Harvard's active litigation which would trigger injunctions, all point toward an extremely low probability. Yet the formal institutional movement keeps this from being near-zero. 3% reflects high confidence in the status quo while acknowledging the non-trivial political pressure and some concrete institutional response.",
