  "information": "Multiple polls conducted in April 2025 show Han Duck-soo's public support ranging between 2% and 12%. Lee Jae-myung of the opposition Democratic Party leads in polls with approximately 46% support. One poll from April 20 indicated that 66% of respondents found Han's potential candidacy 'unacceptable'. Despite low public support, a faction within the People Power Party, with reports of over 50 lawmakers and a 'National Candidate Support Committee', are actively urging him to run.",

    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "About 13 days (until May 5, 2025)",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Han, citing the need for stable governance as acting president and poor public receptivity (e.g., high “unacceptable” ratings), declines to run; the PPP coalesces around an alternative conservative candidate before early May or keeps options open past May 5.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Mounting pressure from within the PPP (dozens of lawmakers and a formal draft committee) plus the compressed election timetable leads Han to frame a run as a duty to ensure continuity; he announces a bid before May 5 to organize a campaign and meet party/legal timelines for a June election.",
    "rationale": "Time is short and, absent a clear signal, the status quo favors no announcement by May 5. Historically, acting leaders often adopt a caretaker posture to avoid politicizing the role, which points to “No.” The research assistant’s summary indicates: (1) Han’s polling is weak (roughly 2%–12%), while Lee Jae-myung polls near 46%; (2) one April poll shows 66% find Han’s potential candidacy unacceptable; (3) a notable PPP faction (reportedly 50+ lawmakers and a National Candidate Support Committee) is pushing him to run. These facts cut both ways: internal party pressure is real and the June timeline implies announcements would need to come soon; however, unfavorable public sentiment and low support make a run risky, and as acting president he may face normative or legal headwinds (and possibly the need to resign), further disincentivizing an early declaration. I weight the status quo heavily: most plausible paths keep him in caretaker mode through early May, especially if the PPP can pivot to another candidate. I would raise the probability if there are credible reports of Han forming a campaign team, scheduling an announcement, or receiving an explicit PPP draft/endorsement with clear legal/logistical pathways for his candidacy. I would lower it if Han publicly rules out running or if the PPP coalesces around a different nominee.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill Han Duck-soo announce his candidacy for South Korean president before May 5, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nThe Chosun Daily: [Support grows in PPP to draft Acting President Han for June election](https://www.koreaherald.com/article/10464554)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if Han Duck-soo announces his candidacy for president of South Korea before May 5, 2025. If no such announcement has been made before that date, the question resolves as **No**.\n\n\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nMultiple polls conducted in April 2025 show Han Duck-soo's public support ranging between 2% and 12%.

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
