  "information": "A 17% 'reciprocal' tariff on Israeli goods was announced by the US on April 2, 2025, and codified under heading 9903.01.48 of the Harmonized Tariff Schedule (HTS) with an effective date of April 9. Subsequently, the implementation of this tariff was suspended for 90 days, deferring the collection of duties until July 9, 2025. Reports state that the official HTS website has been updated to list a '+17%' duty for Israel, which is currently marked as 'suspended'.\n\nThe US is Israel's largest trading partner, with bilateral trade valued at $34 billion in 2024. The two countries have a 40-year-old free trade agreement. On April 1, 2025, the Israeli government announced the immediate cancellation of all its remaining tariffs on U.S. imports. Following the US tariff announcement, Israeli Economy Minister Nir Barkat stated that officials from both countries are optimistic about reaching a new trade agreement before the suspension period expires on July 9, 2025. Ongoing discussions also aim to address the trade deficit between the nations.\n\nThe United States recently implemented a general 10% tariff on imports from most trading partners. Concurrently, the administration has pursued other trade actions, including imposing a 25% tariff on imported automobiles and certain auto parts, and increasing tariffs on Chinese goods to over 100% in response to retaliatory measures. Additionally, new tariffs ranging from 41% to over 3,500% have been announced on solar imports from several Southeast Asian countries, pending a final decision in June 2025.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Approximately 5 weeks (from April 24, 2025 to June 1, 2025).",
    "status_quo_outcome": "Yes. The Harmonized Tariff Schedule (HTS) currently lists a +17% tariff for Israel. Since the resolution states that a suspension does not affect the outcome, the question resolves Yes if this listing does not change by June 1, 2025.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "The US and Israel reach a new trade agreement with remarkable speed before the end of May 2025. Driven by strong political will, the US administration takes immediate formal action to rescind the tariff, and the HTS is updated to remove or nullify the '+17%' duty entry before June 1, 2025.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Trade negotiations between the US and Israel continue past June 1, 2025, towards the July 9 suspension deadline. As a result, the HTS remains unchanged on the resolution date, still listing the '+17%' tariff for Israel, even though its collection remains suspended.",
    "rationale": "My forecast is based primarily on the high likelihood of the status quo persisting through the short forecast window. The key factors are: 1) The current HTS listing already satisfies the conditions for a 'Yes' resolution. The schedule explicitly lists a '+17%' duty for Israel, and the resolution criteria state that its suspended status is irrelevant. 2) The timeline is very short. The resolution date is June 1, 2025, which is only about five weeks away. While trade negotiations are ongoing, reaching a final agreement and completing the requisite administrative process to formally update the HTS within this period is unlikely. The 90-day suspension until July 9 provides a more realistic timeline for negotiators, reducing the urgency for a pre-June 1 resolution. 3) Bureaucratic inertia means that changing the official HTS requires a specific governmental action, whereas maintaining the current listing requires none. Given the broader context of an administration that uses tariffs as leverage, they are unlikely to remove this leverage before a deal is finalized. My probability is not higher than 85% because the strong political relationship between the US and Israel could lead to an exceptionally fast resolution to remove this point of friction. My probability is not lower because the path to a 'No' outcome requires a rapid and successful conclusion to complex negotiations followed by swift bureaucratic action, which is a much higher barrier than simply letting the current situation persist for five more weeks. I would lower my forecast if a finalized 'agreement in principle' were announced with a commitment to immediate HTS changes.",
