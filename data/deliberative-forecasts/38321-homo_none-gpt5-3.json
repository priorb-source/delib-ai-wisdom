    "review": "Both forecasters largely mirror my base-rate framing: U.S. presidents (including Trump in 2017–2019) almost always attend NATO leader summits, and the incentives for Trump to use the forum to push allies on defense spending are strong. I found Forecaster 3’s ICC/The Hague point useful—it neutralizes a potential, if speculative, concern. Both also emphasize two downside uncertainties I share: Trump’s willingness to break norms (e.g., delegating to VP/State or truncating) and the nontrivial tail risks (health/crisis). They also flag the key meta-risk I noted: if the summit slips out of June, the question resolves No. None of this introduces decisive new evidence, but it does argue for a modest haircut absent official travel guidance this close to the date.",
    "rationale": "I continue to weight the historical and institutional baseline heavily: attendance by the U.S. president is the norm and diplomatically valuable, and Trump has previously attended NATO summits despite frictions—using them to press his agenda. The summit’s visibility and leverage for burden-sharing arguments create strong incentives for at least a fly-in/fly-out appearance, which would satisfy the resolution criteria. Offsetting that, Trump is more willing than most to depart from multilateral norms, and we lack public confirmation of his travel as of June 4. Tail risks (health/security/domestic crisis) remain small but real. A non-negligible structural risk is if the summit timing were outside June; while I tentatively assume June based on the question framing, the absence of explicit date confirmation keeps me from moving higher. Net: I trim slightly from my prior 84% to reflect the lack of official schedule guidance and to align with the shared uncertainty weighting, while acknowledging Forecaster 3’s ICC point slightly reduces one hypothetical downside.",
