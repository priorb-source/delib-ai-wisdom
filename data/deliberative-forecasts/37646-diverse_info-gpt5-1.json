    "review": "Forecaster 2 adds useful, specific claims I hadn’t incorporated: a full operating license cleared in mid‑April and public “nationwide soon” messaging from both Musk and Somali authorities. If accurate, that materially increases the odds because Starlink often flips the map within weeks of final approval, and political signaling reduces the chance of an extended delay. That said, F2’s 85% feels stretched given Somalia’s execution risks (payments, import logistics, security, and potential center–periphery regulatory frictions, e.g., Somaliland). Forecaster 3’s base‑rate framing (4–8 months for African rollouts) is a valuable prior, but I think it’s overweighted and not fully conditioned on two changes since early African launches: widespread ISL backhaul (less need for local gateways) and Starlink’s faster 2024–2025 cadence. Also, the resolution hinges only on the website showing “Available,” which can precede broad in‑country logistics. Bangladesh’s rapid activation shows internal ability to move fast, but the context differs from Somalia, so I wouldn’t move too far on that alone. Overall, F2’s evidence nudges me up; F3’s caution caps the upside.",
    "rationale": "Time remaining is ~6.5 weeks. If the license was finalized in mid‑April, the window from approval to July 1 is ~10–11 weeks—consistent with many recent country flips when regulatory clearance is truly complete. High‑level political signaling lowers the probability of a quiet backtrack. Crucially, the resolution only requires the map to show “Available” somewhere in Somalia, not broad distribution or proven local payments. However, Somalia‑specific risks remain nontrivial: Starlink may defer the availability flag until it can accept orders/ship, payments could lag, and federal–regional dynamics could complicate a clean, country‑level map update. Balancing stronger licensing signals (per F2) against these frictions and F3’s reminder about historic African lead times, I modestly raise my forecast rather than jump to the 80s.",
