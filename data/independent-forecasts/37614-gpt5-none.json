    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "About 8 days (election May 20, 2025; results likely same night or within 1–2 days)",
    "status_quo_outcome": "Metz retains his seat (recall fails)",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Motivated opposition drives turnout in a low-salience, small-electorate special election; voters react negatively to the high-profile allegation (shooting a teen in the face), and the recall succeeds, removing Metz.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Opposition turnout underperforms relative to signatures; Metz’s explanation resonates, there are no criminal charges or new damaging revelations, and incumbency plus mail-ballot inertia help the recall fail, allowing him to retain his seat.",
    "rationale": "Baseline: When a local recall makes the ballot, historical outcomes are close to a coin flip, with many datasets (e.g., Ballotpedia’s past cycles) showing roughly 45–55% success rates depending on office and year. That suggests an uninformative prior near 50% for removal/retention.\n\nKey adjustments:\n- Severity/salience of allegation: Being accused of shooting a teen in the face is unusually serious and likely galvanizes opposition. In very small municipalities, a relatively small, motivated group can swing a special election. This tilts toward removal.\n- Incumbency/status quo: Incumbents generally benefit from status quo bias, name recognition, and low overall engagement. Colorado’s mail-ballot environment can add inertia that helps the status quo. This tilts toward retention.\n- Small-town dynamics: Mountain View is tiny; special elections tend to be decided by activist turnout. The fact a recall qualified implies a motivated opposition base; in such contexts, recalls often succeed slightly more than in larger jurisdictions. Tilt toward removal.\n- Legal posture/coverage: The linked reporting frames the matter as an accusation with Metz publicly addressing it; absent clear criminal charges or new damning facts, some voters may give benefit of the doubt. Tilt toward retention, but weaker than the salience effect.\n\nNetting these, I put modest extra weight on the status quo but still judge removal slightly more likely given the severe allegation and small, mobilizable electorate. With no polling, endorsements, fundraising, or ballot return data, I rely on base rates plus these contextual pushes.\n\nWhy not higher (for Yes/retention)? Because (1) the allegation is exceptionally damaging, (2) recalls that reach the ballot in small towns often succeed on motivated turnout, and (3) the election is a low-turnout special where opponents’ intensity can dominate.\nWhy not lower? Because (1) incumbency and status quo bias in mail-ballot Colorado can be meaningful, (2) we lack evidence of criminal charges or fresh negative revelations, and (3) many recalls still fail even after qualification.\n\nWhat would shift me upward (toward retention): credible signs of strong pro-Metz turnout (ballot return data favoring his base), endorsements from trusted local figures, absence of charges confirmed, or persuasive new information undermining the accusation.\nWhat would shift me downward (toward removal): criminal charges filed or new damaging facts, strong visible anti-Metz mobilization, or early ballot returns indicating unusually high turnout among groups aligned with recall proponents.\n\nResearch assistant summary: No additional information provided beyond the recall date and the news link; therefore, I leaned on base rates, the severity of the allegation, small-town recall dynamics, and incumbency/status quo effects.",
