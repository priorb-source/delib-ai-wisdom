    "review": "Both forecasters largely mirror my priors: Morning Consult’s 7-day SMA dampens late moves; ties resolve to No; and the status quo likely has Ishiba at or above Starmer given a lingering honeymoon effect versus Starmer’s middling-but-stable standing. Neither added new hard data, but they reinforced two points: (1) short runway plus SMA favors persistence in the ordering, and (2) ties-as-No slightly increases the bar for Yes. I agree with their assessment of plausible swing ranges (a few points) and the asymmetry created by the tie rule. I also agree that the main upside risk for Yes is a Japan-specific negative shock (yen/BoJ jitters or LDP-related headlines) or a modest UK uptick; absent that, inertia dominates.",
    "rationale": "I previously forecast 41% based on a likely small Ishiba edge, short time left, and tie-as-No. The other analyses add no new evidence but credibly emphasize the inertia and tie penalty. Given the short horizon and likely current ordering, I’m shading down slightly to reflect the extra headwind for a clean Starmer > Ishiba print on or after July 1. I’m not moving lower because Japanese PM approvals can slip quickly if the yen or policy narrative sours, and a narrow current gap would be flippable. Update: 41% -> 39%.",
