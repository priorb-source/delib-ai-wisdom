  "information": "As of mid-May 2025, the Colorado Rockies held a record of 8-38, equivalent to a .174 winning percentage. Their run differential was -128. The team's pitching staff ranked last in the league with a 5.80 ERA and a 1.599 WHIP. Offensively, they had the league's worst On-base Plus Slugging (OPS), the most strikeouts at 418, a low walk rate of 7.7%, and a low home run rate of 2.3%. The next-worst team in the league at the time, the Chicago White Sox, had a winning percentage approximately 112 points higher at .286.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "~27 days (until June 15, 2025)",
    "status_quo_outcome": "Yes — the Rockies remain last in MLB by winning percentage on June 15.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Another team (e.g., White Sox or a new struggler) goes on a catastrophic skid while the Rockies play closer to .400 over the next ~25 games, shrinking and then flipping the current ~.112 gap; or the Rockies go on a genuine hot streak (.550+ over ~25 games) while a peer plays ~.300, lifting Colorado above at least one team.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "The Rockies continue to play poorly (e.g., ~.250–.350 over the next ~25 games) while every other team stays at or above ~.260 overall, so the current large gap persists; even with mild regression toward .250, Colorado still sits at the bottom. A tie for worst still counts as having the lowest percentage on the standings page.",
    "rationale": "- Where things stand: As of mid-May, Colorado is 8-38 (.174) with a -128 run differential and league-worst pitching (5.80 ERA, 1.60 WHIP) and offense (worst OPS, most Ks, poor BB% and HR%). The next-worst team was about .286 — a massive .112 gap. Over the next ~27 days, each team will add ~25–28 games.\n- Why the status quo points to Yes: A .112 winning-percentage gap is very large to erase in ~25 games. Even if Colorado improves to roughly .300–.350 over that span, their cumulative percentage would likely still trail any team starting from ~.286 unless that other team has an extreme collapse. Given Colorado’s underlying indicators (awful run differential, worst-in-MLB pitching and hitting), they’ve plausibly earned something near a .200–.250 true-talent clip; modest regression upward still leaves them most likely last by mid-June.\n- Back-of-the-envelope: If COL goes 9–16 (0.360) in the next 25, they’d be 17–54 (.239). A .286 team with 42 games played (e.g., 12–30) would need to go roughly 3–22 over the next 25 to finish below that (.224). That kind of collapse is possible but rare. If COL instead goes 6–19, their overall would remain near .190, making it even harder for anyone to fall below them without a near-total freefall.\n- Edge cases: The resolution is the MLB official standings “on or after” June 15; a check a day later adds small timing noise (one game can flip tight races), but the current gap is large enough that this mainly adds a few percentage points of uncertainty. A tie for the lowest percentage should still resolve Yes, since the Rockies would still “have the lowest” value shown.\n- Why not higher than my forecast: Short horizons have variance; a 25-game heater or another team’s 25-game disaster can swing standings by several tenths. Admin check timing adds a sliver of risk. Regression could lift COL while injuries or trades could crater another bottom-tier team.\n- Why not lower: The present gap is unusually large, and COL’s across-the-board worst metrics suggest their early results aren’t pure bad luck. Flipping that gap by mid-June likely requires an outlier run distribution.\n- What I’d watch to update: (1) Rockies’ next 10–12 games; if they play >.500, I’d shade down a bit. (2) Any rival cellar team’s severe injury wave or trades (downward update for COL). (3) Schedule strength clusters (e.g., another bottom team facing Dodgers/Braves/Astros stretches) could push my probability up. (4) Rockies’ roster moves (returns from IL, call-ups, SP stabilization) would push my probability down if meaningful.",

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any).
