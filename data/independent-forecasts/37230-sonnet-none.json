    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Approximately 1 month. Today is April 29, 2025, so we are one day away from the April 2025 closing value (April 30) and approximately one month away from the May 2025 closing value (around May 30, 2025).",
    "status_quo_outcome": "Historically, the S&P 500 has positive monthly returns approximately 60-65% of the time over the long term, suggesting a slight upward bias as the status quo expectation.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "The S&P 500 declines in May 2025 if negative catalysts emerge such as: escalating trade tensions and tariff implementation, disappointing corporate earnings reports, hawkish Federal Reserve policy signals, adverse economic data (inflation, employment, GDP), or increased geopolitical tensions that trigger risk-off sentiment.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "The S&P 500 rises in May 2025 if positive developments occur such as: resolution or de-escalation of tariff concerns, strong corporate earnings, dovish Fed policy signals or rate cut expectations, positive economic data showing resilient growth, or improvement in market sentiment and risk appetite.",
    "rationale": "My forecast weighs several factors. First, the historical base rate: the S&P 500 shows positive monthly returns 60-65% of the time, providing a baseline expectation favoring a modest increase. However, the question background references bear markets and tariffs, suggesting current market stress or uncertainty that could dampen this baseline probability. Without specific information about current market levels, recent trends, or the severity of these concerns, I must rely primarily on historical patterns while acknowledging elevated uncertainty. The 'Sell in May' seasonal pattern is often cited but has weak empirical support and shouldn't heavily influence the forecast. Since we're very close to the end of April (April 29), the April closing value is essentially known, reducing one source of uncertainty. The one-month timeframe means we're essentially forecasting short-term market direction, which is notoriously difficult and approaches a coin flip with slight upward bias. My forecast is not higher because: the reference to bear markets and tariffs suggests meaningful headwinds, and short-term market movements have high randomness. My forecast is not lower because: the historical upward bias is real, and without concrete negative information, I shouldn't deviate too far from base rates. I would update higher if: positive tariff news emerges, strong April earnings suggest momentum, or economic data shows resilience. I would update lower if: tariff situations worsen, we get confirmation of bear market conditions, or April closes with significant weakness.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill the S&P 500 index go up in May 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nNY Times: [What Is a Bear Market? Are We in One?](https://www.nytimes.com/article/bear-market-stocks-tariffs.html)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question will resolve as Yes if the closing value of the S&P 500 Index on the final trading day of May 2025 is higher than that of the final trading day of April 2025.\n\nThe \"close\" values shown on the [history page of Yahoo finance](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/%5EGSPC/history?p=%5EGSPC) will be used.\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nNo additional information available.\n\nToday is 2025-04-29.\n\nBefore answering you think:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n(e) You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
