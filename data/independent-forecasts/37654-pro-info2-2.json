  "information": "On May 8, 2025, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) announced it would no longer be updating its Billion Dollar Weather and Climate Disasters database. The official reason cited was 'in alignment with evolving priorities, statutory mandates, and staffing changes'. The database, active since 1980, had logged 403 events with an estimated cost exceeding $2.9 trillion. The discontinuation has been attributed to agency restructuring, budget cuts, and staff departures, including the lead scientist for the program. The administration also proposed a 25% reduction in NOAA's budget for fiscal year 2026.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Approximately 1.5 months.",
    "status_quo_outcome": "The objective's status in the spreadsheet remains 'in progress' and the question resolves as No.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "The maintainers of the Project 2025 Tracker conclude that the announced budget cuts and program cancellations, while damaging, do not yet constitute a full 'break up' of NOAA. They decide to wait for more definitive legislative or structural changes before marking the objective as complete, leaving the status as 'in progress' past the July 1 deadline.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "The administrators of the tracker interpret the recent actions—specifically the discontinuation of the Billion Dollar Weather and Climate Disasters database, coupled with proposed staff and budget reductions—as the effective fulfillment of the goal to break up NOAA. They update the status to 'complete' before July 1, 2025.",
    "rationale": "The core of this forecast is not whether NOAA will be broken up, but whether the volunteer maintainers of the r/Keep_Track spreadsheet will decide that recent events are sufficient to mark that objective as 'complete' within the next month and a half. The status quo is 'in progress', which would lead to a 'No' resolution. However, the information from my research assistant is highly significant. The discontinuation of a major, 40-year-old climate database, attributed to 'agency restructuring' and accompanied by a proposed 25% budget cut, is a drastic development. This is a very strong signal that the administration is moving aggressively on its stated goals regarding NOAA. For a group dedicated to tracking these actions, such a major event could easily be judged as the objective being fulfilled in substance, even if the agency is not yet legally dissolved. The primary ambiguity rests on the interpretation of the term 'break up.' It is a high bar. The maintainers could reasonably argue that a true break up requires formal legislation that dismantles the agency and reassigns its components. This prevents the probability from being higher. The probability is not lower because the announced actions are not minor; they are a fundamental attack on a core mission of the agency. Given the subjective nature of the tracker's assessment and the severity of these actions, there is a substantial chance the maintainers will decide this is the key moment to mark the objective 'complete.' I would increase my forecast if the tracker's maintainers publicly discuss these events as meeting their criteria, or if more details about the 'agency restructuring' emerge that show a formal partitioning of NOAA's functions. I would decrease my forecast if there is discussion within the tracking community that concludes these steps are insufficient, or if the proposed budget cuts meet significant political resistance.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill the Project 2025 Tracker spreadsheet have the objective of breaking up NOAA marked as complete before July 1, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nAt the time of this question, the objective was marked as \"in progress.\" The 2025 Tracker is a project of the Keep_Track subreddit and is explained [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/Keep_Track/comments/1ii7tbr/project_2025_tracker_is_now_live/).\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if the Project 2025 objective to \"break up the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration\" is marked as complete according to [this spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1QGG6wNHna-1tt91yXNkOauAJJ7snobFjfEnmxlmzhl4/edit?gid=0#gid=0) before July 1, 2025. If it is anything other than complete (such as \"in progress\") when accessed by Metaculus on or after July 1, 2025, then the question resolves as **No**.\n\n\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nOn May 8, 2025, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) announced it would no longer be updating its Billion Dollar Weather and Climate Disasters database. The official reason cited was 'in alignment with evolving priorities, statutory mandates, and staffing changes'.

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
