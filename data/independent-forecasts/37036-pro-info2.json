  "information": "The incumbent Senator, Pete Ricketts, is expected to seek re-election in 2026. Former President Donald Trump endorsed Ricketts for his reelection bid on April 11, 2025, calling Osborn a \"Radical Left Open Border Extremist\" while praising Ricketts. Ricketts is the seventh richest member of Congress and has a significant political and financial operation in Nebraska. Osborn runs as an independent but received support from the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee during his 2024 campaign.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "About 5 weeks",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Dan Osborn continues to evaluate the political landscape but concludes that the combination of Senator Ricketts' vast personal wealth and former President Trump's early, strong endorsement makes the race unviable. He decides to delay a decision or focus on other political opportunities, and therefore does not make a formal announcement before the June 1, 2025 deadline.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "After several weeks of exploring a run, Osborn's internal polling and fundraising tests show a clear path to being competitive. Motivated by the early attacks from the opposition, he decides to capitalize on the media attention and officially launch his campaign in late May to begin building a statewide organization.",
    "rationale": "The current status quo is that Dan Osborn is not a candidate for US Senator. While his public exploration of a bid is a strong signal of intent, it is not a commitment. The political headwinds are significant and have intensified since he began exploring the race. The incumbent, Sen. Pete Ricketts, is one of the wealthiest members of Congress and possesses a formidable political operation. Furthermore, the early and aggressive endorsement of Ricketts by Donald Trump on April 11, 2025, which included a direct attack on Osborn, substantially raises the challenge and cost of a campaign.\n\nForecasting leans on the principle that the status quo is more likely than change, especially when the barriers to change are high. Committing to a Senate campaign against this level of opposition is a monumental decision. It is plausible that Osborn and his team will take longer than the next five weeks to fully assess the financial and political landscape before making a final commitment, pushing any potential announcement beyond the June 1st deadline.\n\nMy forecast is not lower than 40% because publicly 'exploring' a run is a serious step that often precedes an official announcement. Osborn has experience from his 2024 campaign and may feel the timing is right to challenge an incumbent. There is a clear strategic advantage to announcing sooner rather than later to begin fundraising and organizing.\n\nMy forecast is not higher than 40% because the consolidated opposition from both Ricketts' financial power and Trump's political influence creates a very difficult environment. This reality could easily lead Osborn's team to take a more cautious and lengthy approach to their decision-making process, making an announcement before June 1 less likely than not.\n\nI would increase my probability upon seeing reports of Osborn hiring senior campaign staff or securing significant fundraising commitments. I would decrease my probability if there are reports of fundraising difficulties or if Osborn makes public statements indicating he needs more time to decide.",
