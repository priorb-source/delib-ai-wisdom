    "review": "All three analyses converge on the same core factors: Chegg's net-cash position and lack of immediate debt maturities create a strong buffer against bankruptcy in the 57-day window, while the negative Altman Z-score and nine consecutive revenue declines signal genuine distress. Forecaster 2's 8% forecast appears inconsistent with their own reasoning - they acknowledge that companies with substantial cash and no debt crisis rarely file within 2 months, yet their probability is notably higher than both mine (3%) and Forecaster 3's (4%). The covenant breach argument raised by Forecaster 2 is interesting but entirely speculative without evidence. Forecaster 3's emphasis on 'voluntary strategic bankruptcies' as a facilitation mechanism for sale/reorganization is a valid pathway I may have slightly underweighted. However, even voluntary bankruptcies with positive cash positions require extensive board deliberation and are rare on this timeframe. The 'hidden liabilities' argument from both forecasters is theoretically possible but unsupported by available evidence. The base rate for bankruptcy within 57 days for a company with positive FCF, substantial cash, and no near-term debt maturities is likely under 2%. Q1 results on May 12 could reveal deterioration, but would still require rapid board action to file by July 1.",
    "rationale": "After reviewing the other forecasters' analyses, I find most of their reasoning aligns with mine but am updating slightly to better account for the voluntary strategic bankruptcy pathway. While Forecaster 2's 8% seems too high and inadequately justified, Forecaster 3's emphasis on management potentially choosing bankruptcy as optimal for facilitating reorganization or sale is a scenario I may have underweighted. However, the fundamental protective factors remain dominant: several hundred million in net cash, positive free cash flow, no debt maturities before 2026, and only 57 days until resolution. The covenant breach and hidden liabilities arguments are speculative without supporting evidence. The strategic review process suggests management is exploring alternatives to bankruptcy. Even if Q1 results on May 12 show significant deterioration, moving from strategic review to board approval and bankruptcy filing within 50 days would be exceptionally rapid. I'm adjusting upward to 4% to acknowledge the voluntary strategic bankruptcy pathway more explicitly while maintaining that the short timeframe and strong liquidity position make bankruptcy highly unlikely.",
