    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Approximately 2-3 weeks. Inflation data for April 2025 is typically released by the State Statistics Service of Ukraine in the first half of May 2025.",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No. The status quo involves significant inflationary pressures from the ongoing war, but these are being actively managed by the National Bank of Ukraine's (NBU) tight monetary policy. While inflation has likely ticked up from its 2024 lows, the current trajectory does not point to a sudden surge to 15% without a new major shock.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "The National Bank of Ukraine maintains its restrictive monetary stance, and committed international financial aid continues to flow, preventing the need for large-scale monetary financing of the budget deficit. The impact of recent infrastructure damage is contained, allowing the year-on-year inflation rate for April to remain below 15.0%.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "A severe shock materializes in April. This could be a dramatic shortfall in foreign aid forcing the central bank to print Hryvnia to cover the budget deficit, a currency devaluation, or a new wave of devastating attacks on energy infrastructure that cripples supply chains and forces sharp price hikes, pushing the YoY rate to 15.0% or higher.",
    "rationale": "My forecast is based on the balance between severe war-related inflationary pressures and the demonstrated ability of the National Bank of Ukraine (NBU) to manage them. My research assistant provided no additional information.\n\nThe primary argument for a 'No' outcome, which I consider the status quo, is the NBU's credible and orthodox policy response. It has successfully navigated extreme conditions before, bringing inflation down from over 26% in 2022. It is expected to maintain a tight policy stance to anchor inflation expectations. Furthermore, the continued flow of international financial aid is crucial for preventing the highly inflationary monetization of the government's large budget deficit.\n\nHowever, the risk of inflation reaching 15% is substantial, hence a forecast of 35%. As the provided article on stagflation suggests, the economic situation is precarious. A 'Yes' scenario would likely be triggered by a major shock, such as a prolonged and critical delay in foreign aid disbursement or a new, devastating wave of Russian attacks on Ukraine's energy infrastructure. Such an event would create a severe supply-side shock and could force the government's hand on monetary financing.\n\nMy forecast is not higher because a jump to 15% YoY would represent a very sharp acceleration, and I have confidence in the NBU's capacity to act as a powerful counterforce. It is not lower because the war creates an environment of extreme volatility where severe shocks are plausible and their impact on prices can be swift and dramatic.\n\nI would increase my probability for 'Yes' upon news that a critical aid package has been suspended or that a successful large-scale attack on Ukraine's power grid has occurred. Conversely, I would decrease the probability if a new, larger-than-expected financial support package were confirmed and disbursed.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill Ukraine's inflation rate increase to at least 15.0% for April 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\n[Ukraine is one step away from stagflation. And here's why](https://en.iz.ru/en/1868046/2025-04-10/ukraine-one-step-away-stagflation-and-heres-why)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if Ukraine's annualized inflation rate is greater than or equal to 15.0% for the month of April 2025, according to the number presented by [Trading Economics](https://tradingeconomics.com/ukraine/inflation-cpi). Under 15.0% resolves as **No**.\n\n\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nNo additional information available.\n\nToday is 2025-04-22.\n\nBefore answering you think:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n(e) You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
