    "review": "The deliberation reveals a strong consensus among all three forecasters. We all identify the same core drivers pointing towards a 'No' outcome: the extremely short resolution window (less than two months), the high legal and personal safety risks for Sheikh Hasina upon return, the opposition of the current interim government, and the unlikelihood of her host country (India) facilitating a destabilizing return. All three of us correctly interpret her public vow to return as political rhetoric rather than a concrete plan. The forecasts are tightly clustered in a low-probability range of 10-15%, which strengthens my confidence in the overall assessment. Forecaster 2’s emphasis on the historical precedent of long political exiles and Forecaster 3’s framing of “status quo inertia” were particularly effective reinforcements of the baseline case.",
    "rationale": "My initial forecast was 15%, which is identical to Forecaster 3's and very close to Forecaster 2's 10%. The group's analysis confirms my own reasoning that the barriers to Sheikh Hasina's return in the next seven weeks are formidable. The arguments presented, particularly by Forecaster 2, regarding the typical length of political exiles and the slow pace of any formal processes like extradition, have convinced me that my original 15% might have been slightly too high. These points underscore the strength of the status quo. The path to a 'Yes' outcome requires an unforeseen and rapid political shock, whereas the path to 'No' simply requires the current situation to persist. While I maintain that the political situation in Bangladesh is volatile and Sheikh Hasina is a determined actor, the deliberation process has led me to slightly decrease the weight I assign to a low-probability, high-impact event occurring within this specific, narrow timeframe. Therefore, I am lowering my forecast slightly from 15% to 12%, moving closer to the group consensus while still acknowledging a non-trivial chance of an unexpected development.",
