  "information": "Multiple U.S. officials and intelligence reports have pointed to 2027 as a key year for China's military readiness regarding Taiwan. In February 2023, CIA Director Bill Burns stated that Chinese leader Xi Jinping had ordered the military to be prepared for an invasion by 2027. This timeline is consistently referenced by U.S. military leaders as a target for the PLA to complete its preparations. Chinese activities preceding this date include intensified propaganda, such as a March 2025 video showing large-scale landing ships, and the use of 'grey zone' military exercises to test Taiwan's defenses.",

    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "About 8 weeks (until July 1, 2025)",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "PLA continues air/naval pressure, coercive drills, and law-enforcement/CG actions near Taiwan and its outlying islands, but no PLA ground troops land on Taiwan-controlled territory; the U.S. uses terms like “coercion,” “provocation,” or “attack” (if something limited occurs) rather than explicitly accusing China of an “invasion of Taiwan.”",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "PLA ground forces (e.g., marines) land on Taiwan-controlled territory—ranging from a small outlying island (Kinmen/Matsu/Penghu/Pratas) to the main island—and the U.S. government publicly characterizes this as China “invading Taiwan,” explicitly citing PLA ground troops entering without Taipei’s consent.",
    "rationale": "Baseline: The world usually changes slowly; the default is no sudden amphibious landings. The remaining window is short (~8 weeks), and a cross-strait landing is a high-cost, highly visible operation that typically presents substantial warning indicators. The U.S. and many analysts have repeatedly referenced 2027 as a key PLA readiness waypoint, not spring 2025.\n\nEvidence and context: The research assistant notes U.S. officials (e.g., CIA Director Bill Burns) flagging 2027 for PLA preparedness and China’s reliance on grey-zone pressure. A March 2025 propaganda video of landing ships and stepped-up exercises fit coercive signaling, not necessarily imminent invasion. Amphibious invasion would require large-scale mobilization (amphibious ship concentrations, civilian ferry requisitions, logistics staging, cyber/space prep), which would likely be observable and widely reported before any landing.\n\nResolution nuance lowers the odds further: The question requires the U.S. government to publicly accuse China of “invading Taiwan” by sending ground military forces into Taiwan. Limited actions by the PRC Coast Guard or maritime militia, or even seizures framed as law-enforcement, may not meet the “ground military forces” bar, and Washington might avoid the specific “invasion of Taiwan” phrasing for narrowly scoped incidents (especially on very proximate outlying islands), instead using terms like “attack,” “assault,” or “seizure.” That linguistic caution is a material hurdle to a Yes resolution.\n\nWhy not higher: - Very short timeline; - High escalation costs and warning signals likely absent; - 2027 readiness narrative; - Onset of typhoon season complicates amphibious operations; - U.S. phrasing requirement is strict.\n\nWhy not lower: - Non-zero tail risk of sudden limited land grab (e.g., an outlying island) that Washington might choose to label as an invasion to galvanize an international response; - Risk of rapid escalation from an accident or clash that prompts a landing by PLA marines; - Domestic or geopolitical shocks could change Beijing’s calculus.\n\nWhat would move me up: Credible indicators of imminent operations—civilian RO-RO ferry requisitions, sustained amphibious flotilla massing near Fujian, PLA-wide leave cancellations, logistics stockpiling (e.g., blood supplies), joint-fire and cyber preparation cues, widescale air/missile prepositioning, hard evacuation warnings, and/or U.S. public statements warning of an imminent PLA landing. Also, a sharp political trigger (e.g., a major lethal clash near Kinmen/Matsu) with PLA forces forward-deployed.\n\nWhat would move me down: Clear de-escalatory diplomatic breakthroughs, visible drawdown of PLA activity opposite Taiwan, or persistent absence of any invasion indicators as weeks pass. Severe weather forecasts limiting amphibious windows would marginally reduce risk as June progresses.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill the United States accuse the People's Republic of China of invading Taiwan before July 1, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nCFR: [Why China-Taiwan Relations Are So Tense](https://www.cfr.org/backgrounder/china-taiwan-relations-tension-us-policy-trump)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below.

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
