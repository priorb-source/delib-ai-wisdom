    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Approximately 2 months (from May 2, 2025 to July 1, 2025)",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No - Ethiopia maintains its current travel advisory level (likely Level 3 with regional Level 4 designations)",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Ethiopia's security situation remains at current levels or improves slightly. Regional conflicts don't escalate significantly, Addis Ababa and major cities remain relatively stable, and the US State Department doesn't determine that conditions warrant elevating the entire country to Level 4 status.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Major security deterioration occurs across Ethiopia - significant escalation of internal conflicts that spread beyond current affected regions, widespread civil unrest reaching the capital, major terrorist incidents, or a breakdown of governmental control that makes the entire country unsafe for travel, prompting the US State Department to issue a country-wide Level 4 advisory.",
    "rationale": "The baseline probability should be weighted toward 'No' for several reasons. First, Level 4 travel advisories are rare and reserved for extreme situations - countries experiencing widespread warfare, complete governmental collapse, or pervasive danger across all regions. Currently, only a handful of countries (Afghanistan, Syria, Yemen, Libya, etc.) carry this designation. While Ethiopia has experienced regional conflicts including in Tigray and Amhara regions, and the question background references new travel warnings in 2025, moving to a country-wide Level 4 would require dramatic deterioration beyond regional instability. The US State Department typically maintains Level 3 advisories for countries with significant but manageable risks, often with specific Level 4 designations for dangerous regions rather than entire countries. With only 2 months until the deadline, there's limited time for the kind of catastrophic security breakdown that would justify this escalation. Ethiopia's capital Addis Ababa has historically remained relatively stable even during regional conflicts. However, I'm not assigning a very low probability because: (1) the reference to new travel warnings suggests ongoing concerns, (2) Ethiopia does have active security challenges that could escalate, (3) 2 months is sufficient time for a crisis to emerge, and (4) regional conflicts can sometimes spread rapidly. For me to increase this forecast, I would need evidence of major escalation - fighting reaching Addis Ababa, a coup attempt, or multiple simultaneous crises. To decrease it, I'd need signs of peace agreements, de-escalation, or international mediation success.",

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
