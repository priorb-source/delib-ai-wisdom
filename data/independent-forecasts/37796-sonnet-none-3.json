    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "The FATF June 2025 Plenary meeting will occur in approximately 2-4 weeks from today (May 19, 2025), with results typically announced shortly after the meeting concludes in late June 2025.",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No changes are made to the grey list - all 25 current jurisdictions (Algeria, Angola, Bulgaria, Burkina Faso, Cameroon, Côte d'Ivoire, Croatia, DRC, Haiti, Kenya, Laos, Lebanon, Mali, Monaco, Mozambique, Namibia, Nepal, Nigeria, South Africa, South Sudan, Syria, Tanzania, Venezuela, Vietnam, and Yemen) remain on the list, and no new jurisdictions are added.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "At the June 2025 Plenary, FATF reviews all jurisdictions under monitoring but determines that none have made sufficient progress to warrant removal from the grey list. Additionally, no new jurisdictions are identified with strategic AML/CFT deficiencies serious enough to add to the list. The list remains unchanged at 25 jurisdictions.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "At least one jurisdiction demonstrates sufficient progress in addressing its strategic AML/CFT deficiencies and is removed from the grey list (such as Croatia, Monaco, or Bulgaria which are higher-capacity jurisdictions), OR a new jurisdiction is identified with strategic deficiencies and added to the list. The question only requires one jurisdiction to be added or removed to resolve as Yes.",
    "rationale": "FATF holds plenary meetings three times annually (February, June, October), and historically these meetings frequently result in grey list changes. The February 2025 meeting just saw significant changes - the Philippines removed and both Laos and Nepal added - demonstrating active list management. With 25 jurisdictions currently under increased monitoring, the probability that at least one will either make sufficient progress for removal or that a new jurisdiction will be added is substantial. The question sets a relatively low bar for resolution (ANY change), which increases the probability compared to asking about a specific jurisdiction. However, I must respect the status quo - not every plenary results in changes, and the world typically changes slowly. Some factors favoring Yes: (1) the large number of monitored jurisdictions increases odds of at least one change, (2) historical base rates suggest changes occur at most plenaries, (3) jurisdictions like Croatia, Monaco, and Bulgaria have higher institutional capacity and may complete action plans. Factors favoring No: (1) status quo bias should be strong, (2) only 3-4 months since the last update may not be enough time for dramatic progress, (3) some plenaries do result in no changes. For me to update higher (75-85%), I would need evidence that specific jurisdictions are near completion of their action plans or that new jurisdictions are under review for addition. To update lower (55-60%), I would need evidence that the June plenary is expected to be primarily procedural with no anticipated changes.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill any jurisdictions be added to or removed from the FATF \"grey list\" following the FATF Plenary meeting in June 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nAML Intelligence (February 2025) [UPDATE: Philippines removed from FATF ‘grey list’ as Laos, Nepal added to watchlist](https://www.amlintelligence.com/2025/02/breaking-fatf-grey-list-update-laos-and-nepal-added-the-philippines-removed/)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if following its June 2025 plenary, the Financial Action Task Force (FATF) has made any changes to its \"Jurisdictions under Increased Monitoring\" list, which at the time of this question consists of Algeria, Angola, Bulgaria, Burkina Faso, Cameroon, Côte d'Ivoire, Croatia, the Democratic Republic of Congo, Haiti, Kenya, the Lao People's Democratic Republic, Lebanon, Mali, Monaco, Mozambique, Namibia, Nepal, Nigeria, South Africa, South Sudan, Syria, Tanzania, Venezuela, Vietnam, and Yemen. Resolves according to the [official list](https://www.fatf-gafi.org/en/countries/black-and-grey-lists.html).\n\nThe question may resolve according to [credible sources](https://www.metaculus.com/help/faq/#definitions) in case the website is unavailable or not timely updated.\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nNo additional information available.\n\nToday is 2025-05-19.\n\nBefore answering you think:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n(e) You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
