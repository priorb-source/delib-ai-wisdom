    "review": "Both forecasters make compelling arguments I had underweighted. The most important new consideration is the **persistence of downtime** - the site has been down for over 3.5 months (since early February through May 5+). This is much stronger evidence of intentional decommissioning than I initially weighted. If restoration were planned or easy, it likely would have occurred already. Forecaster 3's point about the **resolution mechanism dependency** is also important - the site must be accessible to IsItDownRightNow specifically, which adds failure modes if security is tightened. Forecaster 2's emphasis on **public visibility** making websites prime enforcement targets is well-taken - these are highly visible policy statements, not obscure technical resources. However, I'm not fully convinced by going to 10%. Both forecasters acknowledge DoD's institutional interests in climate resilience and the possibility of redirects/technical fixes. Six weeks, while short, is not trivial for simple web infrastructure changes. We also lack explicit confirmation of permanent decommissioning versus mere deprioritization.",
    "rationale": "I'm updating downward from 25% to 15% based primarily on the strength of the persistence argument. The site remaining down for 3.5+ months is much stronger evidence than I initially weighted - this suggests intentional policy implementation rather than temporary removal. The short 6-week timeframe to resolution further constrains the possibility of reversal. However, I'm not going as low as 10% because: (1) We lack explicit confirmation of permanent decommissioning; (2) Simple technical solutions like redirects remain possible and could happen relatively quickly; (3) DoD's institutional commitment to climate resilience as a national security issue creates ongoing internal tension that could surface; (4) The probability space between 'very unlikely' (10%) and 'extremely unlikely' (5%) should reflect remaining uncertainty about bureaucratic processes we can't directly observe. My 15% forecast reflects high confidence the site stays down while acknowledging meaningful residual uncertainty.",
