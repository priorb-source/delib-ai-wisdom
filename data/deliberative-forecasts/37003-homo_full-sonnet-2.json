    "review": "All three forecasters converge remarkably on 94-96%, which itself is a strong signal that this probability range is well-calibrated. Forecaster 3 raises an important point I hadn't explicitly emphasized: in proportional representation systems like Austria's, vote share translates very directly to seat allocation, making the polling lead even more reliable for predicting a seat plurality. This reduces the risk that SPÖ could win the popular vote but somehow lose the seat count. Forecaster 2's framing of requiring a 'combined swing of 20+ points' usefully quantifies just how unprecedented the required shift would be. Both forecasters reinforce the key pillars of the analysis: historical dominance, overwhelming polling lead, minimal time remaining, and multiple confirming sources. Forecaster 3's characterization of this as 'one of the most predictable electoral outcomes possible' seems justified given the convergence of evidence across multiple dimensions.",
    "rationale": "The deliberation has reinforced rather than challenged my core analysis. The most valuable addition is the explicit recognition that proportional representation systems provide more reliable translation from vote share to seat counts, which further strengthens the case for a high probability. With all three forecasters clustering tightly around 94-96%, and no substantive counterarguments or overlooked risks emerging, I'm updating slightly upward to align with the consensus. The difference between 94% and 95% is marginal but reflects: (1) the PR system point adds incremental confidence, (2) three independent analyses reaching near-identical conclusions suggests good calibration, and (3) the overwhelming nature of the evidence (80-year streak, 16-19 point lead, 6 days remaining, multiple confirming polls) truly does make this an exceptionally predictable outcome. I maintain that forecasting higher than 95-96% would be overconfident given inherent electoral uncertainty, but forecasting lower would underweight the remarkable strength of converging evidence.",
