    "review": "Both forecasters emphasize two points: (1) the eight-year testing hiatus and (2) the absence of recent, OSINT-visible preparations at Punggye-ri. They also note credible assessments that the site remains technically ready, implying short lead time if a political decision is made. I find their reasoning broadly convincing on the status quo and short-window effects. The one nuance I’d add is that the lack of visible prep may be a weaker short-term signal than usual if Tunnel 3 has been kept in a ready state since 2022, making last-minute activity minimal. I also think the international cost calculus has shifted somewhat: with Russia more openly shielding Pyongyang at the UN and China less inclined to cooperate on new penalties, the marginal cost of a test may be somewhat lower than in 2017, slightly raising risk versus a pure status-quo inference.",
    "rationale": "- Timeframe and base rate: About two months remain. The eight-year pause and lack of current public indicators argue for a low base hazard in this window.\n- Technical readiness vs OSINT: Multiple assessments since 2022 have judged Punggye-ri’s Tunnel 3 potentially test-ready. If so, lead time could be days, and pre-test signatures may be sparser than in past cycles. That reduces how much I discount odds purely for lack of fresh imagery.\n- Incentives: DPRK can signal capability via frequent missile and UAV/UUV tests without detonating. But a nuclear test would validate tactical warhead designs and bolster coercive signaling. The international response would be negative, but with Russia’s diplomatic cover and China’s likely calibrated reaction, the penalty may be lower than in 2017—tempering the deterrent effect.\n- Net: Status quo and short horizon keep odds modest; readiness and somewhat lower external costs keep them nontrivial. I slightly raise my estimate to reflect that the absence of visible prep is not as decisive if the tunnel is already prepared and political timing (e.g., late June) could motivate a quick test.\n- Up/down movers: Up with credible satellite indicators at Punggye-ri (vehicle flows, cabling, ventilation, sealing), allied intel warnings, or a rapid crisis spike tied to U.S./ROK strategic deployments. Down if continued quiescence at the site through June, signs of PRC pressure for restraint, or DPRK propaganda focusing on alternate milestones (e.g., conventional naval rollouts) over nuclear validation.\n",
