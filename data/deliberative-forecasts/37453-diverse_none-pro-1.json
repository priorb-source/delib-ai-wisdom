    "review": "The other forecasters and I are in strong agreement, with forecasts clustered tightly between 2-3%. Their analyses reinforced my initial conclusion by adding valuable context. Forecaster 2's use of the Quebec referendums as a historical precedent effectively highlights how unprepared and rushed a current announcement would be. Forecaster 3 provided the most compelling new argument: the upcoming Canadian federal election provides a powerful incentive for the Alberta government to wait for a potentially more sympathetic federal partner, making a drastic move like announcing a referendum in the next eight weeks strategically illogical. Both forecasters correctly identified the complete absence of any preparatory signals (legislation, leaks, consultations) as strong evidence against an imminent announcement.",
    "rationale": "I am maintaining my forecast of 2%. The deliberation with my peers has solidified my conviction in this very low probability. The core reasons remain the same: the extremely short timeframe of less than two months is impractical for such a momentous political decision, and there is a total absence of the necessary political groundwork. Premier Danielle Smith's government has pursued a strategy of maximizing autonomy within Canada, and announcing a referendum would be a radical departure from this, risking significant economic and political instability. The argument raised by Forecaster 3 regarding the upcoming federal election is a crucial addition; it provides a clear strategic rationale for the Alberta government to avoid a constitutional crisis and instead wait for a potentially friendlier government in Ottawa. The combination of these factors—the tight deadline, the current political strategy, the lack of any evidence of preparation, and the strong incentive to wait for the federal election—makes the 'No' outcome almost certain. My 2% forecast reflects the small, residual chance of a 'black swan' event or a deeply miscalculated political gambit, but I see no evidence to suggest this is a likely path.",
