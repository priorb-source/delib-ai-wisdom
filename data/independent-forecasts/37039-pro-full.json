  "information": "On April 2-3, 2025, the U.S. President announced comprehensive tariffs. The policy included a 10% base tariff on goods from almost all countries, effective April 5, and additional country-specific tariffs to take effect on April 9. For Switzerland, the total tariff was set at 31%. The stated justifications included that Switzerland had been 'taking advantage' of the US and as a response to alleged 61% tariffs imposed by Switzerland on American products.\n\nThe Swiss government, including President Karin Keller-Sutter, expressed 'incomprehension' regarding the tariff calculation. Swiss officials stated that the country imposes a 0% tariff on US imports, and that Swiss companies have created 500,000 jobs in the US. Switzerland's trade surplus with the US was $38.5 billion in 2024. The Swiss watch industry was noted as being particularly affected, with share prices for major exporters like Richemont and Swatch falling after the announcement.\n\nThe 31% additional ad valorem duty for Swiss products was officially listed under subheading 9903.01.60 of the U.S. Harmonized Tariff Schedule (HTS). On April 10, 2025, the U.S. administration announced that the country-specific tariffs, including the one for Switzerland, would be suspended for 90 days to allow for negotiations. This suspension period is scheduled to run until July 9, 2025, covering the June 1 resolution date. The HTS listing for Switzerland under subheading 9903.01.60 reflects the 31% rate but is marked as 'suspended'.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Approximately 5 weeks (resolves June 1, 2025).",
    "status_quo_outcome": "Yes. The Harmonized Tariff Schedule (HTS) currently lists the 31% tariff for Switzerland under subheading 9903.01.60, although it is marked as suspended. As the resolution criteria state that suspension does not affect the outcome, if nothing changes, the question resolves as 'Yes'.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "The US and Swiss governments reach a swift agreement before June 1, 2025. The US administration then acts promptly to issue a proclamation or executive order formally rescinding the tariff, and the HTS is updated to remove the 31% duty for Switzerland under the specified subheading before the resolution date.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Negotiations between the US and Switzerland continue past June 1, 2025. As the resolution date falls within the 90-day suspension period (which ends July 9, 2025), the HTS continues to list the 31% tariff as 'suspended'. Since a suspended status counts for resolution, the question resolves 'Yes'.",
    "rationale": "My forecast is heavily based on the specific resolution criteria and bureaucratic inertia. The key facts are: 1) The 31% tariff for Switzerland is currently listed in the HTS under the correct subheading. 2) The resolution date of June 1, 2025, falls squarely within the 90-day suspension period for this tariff, which ends on July 9, 2025. 3) The resolution criteria explicitly state that whether the tariff is 'suspended' is irrelevant to the outcome. The question is simply about what is written in the schedule on that date.\n\nGiven these points, the status quo is a 'Yes' outcome. For the outcome to be 'No', the US administration would need to not only reach a deal with Switzerland but also complete the administrative process of formally revoking the measure and updating the HTS, all within the next five weeks. The very purpose of the 90-day suspension is to provide time for such negotiations without requiring immediate changes to the underlying tariff structure. It is far more likely that the 'suspended' 31% tariff remains on the books on June 1 while talks continue.\n\nMy probability is not higher than 90% because there is a non-trivial chance that a swift diplomatic resolution is reached. The Swiss arguments against the tariff are strong, and the US administration might see a quick deal as a political win, prompting an expedited removal from the HTS. \n\nMy probability is not lower because the timeline is very short for international negotiations to conclude and for subsequent government action to be reflected in an official document like the HTS. Bureaucratic and diplomatic processes are typically slow. I would lower my forecast upon credible reports of a breakthrough agreement between the US and Switzerland. I would raise it if rhetoric from the US administration suggests negotiations are stalling.",

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower.
