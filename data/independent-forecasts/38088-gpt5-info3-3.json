  "information": "In late May 2025, several economic developments were reported. The US Consumer Confidence Index rebounded to a four-year high in May after falling to a five-year low the previous month, an improvement attributed to the temporary suspension of tariffs. US stock indexes, including the S&P 500 and Nasdaq, rose in anticipation of major tech earnings reports. The EU was given until July 9 to reach a trade deal with the US, a delay that experts considered a positive market signal. A prior 90-day delay in raising import tariffs led to a record $304 billion increase in the combined wealth of the world's richest people, according to the Bloomberg Billionaire Index.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "About 33 days (until July 1, 2025)",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No — as of April 30, 2025 the 250th-ranked person was Giancarlo Devasini (Italy).",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Markets move broadly in tandem into early July; the mix of billionaires clustered around rank ~240–260 remains mostly non-U.S., and the person in the 250th slot on July 1 is European or from another non-U.S. country (e.g., Devasini holds near the cutoff or is swapped by another non-U.S. name).",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Relative U.S. outperformance and/or a stronger U.S. dollar nudges a nearby U.S. billionaire into exactly rank 250 on July 1; alternatively, idiosyncratic negative news for a non-U.S. billionaire near the cutoff (e.g., crypto/Tether-related) drops them below the line, allowing a U.S. name to occupy 250th.",
    "rationale": "Baseline odds should be anchored to nationality shares around the middle of the Bloomberg 500. The U.S. typically makes up roughly one-third of the Bloomberg top 500, and that share is fairly broad across ranks, implying a base chance near the mid-30s that any given rank is American. The current occupant at 250 (Devasini, Italy) tilts the status quo toward No and, given daily list inertia, deserves extra weight over a one-month horizon. The research assistant notes improving U.S. sentiment and equities into late May (consumer confidence rebound, S&P/Nasdaq strength) and a tariff delay that buoyed billionaire wealth globally. While these are modestly supportive for U.S. names, gains appear broad-based rather than U.S.-specific, and large-cap U.S. tech outperformance mostly affects the very top of the list, not the middle ranks around 250. Currency effects could matter: a stronger USD would mechanically reduce non-U.S. USD-denominated net worths and marginally raise the chance a U.S. name sits at 250 on the snapshot date; a weaker USD would do the opposite. Idiosyncratic events (e.g., crypto market swings affecting Devasini/Tether, sudden valuation moves from M&A/earnings for mid-cap founders) could reshuffle the cluster around 250 either way, but those are low-visibility and roughly symmetric. Why not higher: The immediate status quo is a non-U.S. holder at 250 and global tailwinds have been broad, not uniquely U.S. Why not lower: The U.S. still comprises the single largest national cohort on the list, so the conditional probability that the July 1 snapshot lands on a U.S. billionaire remains substantial. What would move me up: Clear relative outperformance of U.S. equities vs. Europe/Asia into late June; notable USD strengthening vs. EUR/CNY; news pushing a non-U.S. name near 250 down (especially crypto-related). What would move me down: Broad RoW equity outperformance, USD weakness, or evidence the 240–260 band is currently dominated by non-U.S. names.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill the median person on Bloomberg's Billionaires Index be from the United States on July 1, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nOn April 30, 2025, the 250th-ranked name on the list was Giancarlo Devasini of Italy\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if the person ranked 250th on the Bloomberg Billionaires Index (available at [this link](https://www.bloomberg.com/billionaires/)) is listed as being from the United States, when accessed by Metaculus Admins on or after July 1, 2025. It resolves as **No** if the 250th-ranked person is from any other country.\n\nFor purposes of this question, the \"median\" from the question's title is defined as the 250th ranked person on the Bloomberg Billionaires Index, no matter how many are on the list.\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nIn late May 2025, several economic developments were reported.

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
