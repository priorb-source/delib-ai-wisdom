    "review": "Both forecasters’ arguments closely match my prior reasoning: extremely short window, severe political and security downsides, lack of advance signaling, and rarity of such visits—especially early in a term. The DMZ/“surprise diplomacy” analogy is the main upside they emphasize, but I agree its applicability is limited; meeting an adversary at a border or third country is much easier than flying into Russia. The additional point about early-term Moscow visits being uncommon modestly reinforces the downward pressure. I don’t see materially new evidence or credible signals that would lift the probability.",
    "rationale": "Time remaining is roughly one month (June). A presidential visit to Russia would be extraordinarily costly politically (NATO/Ukraine optics, domestic backlash) and operationally complex, with significant security and diplomatic prep that typically produces detectable signals; none are present. Historical precedent (no Trump Russia visit in his first term; last US presidential Russia visit in a far less adversarial 2009 context) supports a strong No baseline. Tail scenarios (ceasefire framework, major prisoner swap) are conceivable but would likely be preceded by credible reporting or official hints, which we do not have. Given the lack of new information beyond what I’d already considered, I maintain a very low probability.\nNo change to forecast.",
