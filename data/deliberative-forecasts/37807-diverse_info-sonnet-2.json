    "review": "Both forecasters make compelling arguments I should have weighted more heavily. Forecaster 2's point about the state waiver system is particularly strong - if states need waivers to restrict items, this confirms the federal standard (which the webpage documents) remains broad by default. This actually reinforces YES rather than threatening it. Forecaster 3 makes a crucial distinction I underappreciated: the question hinges on the specific phrase 'snack foods' remaining, not whether snacks are actually allowed. This shifts the risk assessment from 'will policy change?' (very unlikely in 6 weeks) to 'will the webpage text be edited?' (still unlikely but slightly more plausible). Both forecasters correctly emphasize bureaucratic inertia more than I did. Even cosmetic webpage changes at federal agencies involve approval processes, legal review, and coordination that typically don't happen on 6-week timelines without extraordinary circumstances. I think I overweighted the political signals (NY Post article, Rollins' reform statements, upcoming announcement) relative to the structural barriers to rapid change.",
    "rationale": "After reviewing both analyses, I'm updating upward significantly. My original 72% underweighted how difficult it is to change even simple government webpage text within 6 weeks. Even if Secretary Rollins announces major SNAP reforms in late May, translating that into updated consumer-facing guidance by July 1 requires multiple bureaucratic steps that typically don't move that fast. The state waiver argument reinforces this - the federal baseline remains broad, which is what the webpage documents. The main risk remains a rapid political directive to make a cosmetic change for optics, but even this faces procedural hurdles. Government content managers don't typically make mid-cycle changes without clear policy drivers, and any substantive policy change would require formal rulemaking that can't conclude by July 1. While I acknowledge some risk of editorial changes or political pressure for quick updates, the combination of bureaucratic inertia, procedural requirements, and the extremely compressed timeline strongly favors the status quo. I'm moving to 85% - higher than my original forecast but slightly more conservative than Forecaster 2's 95%, acknowledging there's still meaningful uncertainty given the administration's clear interest in SNAP reforms.",
