    "review": "The other two forecasters provide excellent, detailed analysis that largely reinforces my initial thinking but adds crucial nuance and specific evidence that tempers my initial forecast. Both correctly emphasize the high degree of inertia in State Department advisories and the short time frame for resolution. Forecaster 2's contribution is particularly impactful, highlighting that a U.S. Embassy coastal security alert was issued as recently as March 2025 without triggering a nationwide level change. This is a key piece of evidence showing the system has recently processed new negative information and deemed it insufficient for a Level 3 upgrade, suggesting a very high threshold for change. Forecaster 2 also rightly points out that the existence of a localized Level 3 for the Mtwara region provides a mechanism to address specific threats without escalating the entire country's status. Forecaster 3 reinforces this by noting the Mozambique spillover threat, while real, has been ongoing for years without prompting an upgrade, meaning it is likely already 'priced in' to the current Level 2 advisory. Their reasoning is highly convincing and leads me to believe my initial forecast was slightly too high.",
    "rationale": "I am lowering my forecast from 20% to 15%. The core of my reasoning remains the same: the status quo (Level 2) is the most likely outcome due to significant bureaucratic inertia and the short two-month timeframe. A change would require a major, unambiguous security event. However, the other forecasters provided convincing arguments to moderate my initial assessment. The most compelling new evidence, raised by Forecaster 2, is the March 2025 coastal security alert from the U.S. Embassy. The fact that this specific, recent warning did not result in a nationwide upgrade to Level 3 demonstrates that the threshold for such a change is very high. It shows the system can absorb and communicate new risks without resorting to a full level change. Furthermore, the arguments from both forecasters that the long-standing risks (e.g., Mozambique spillover) are already accounted for in the current Level 2 rating are sound. While the possibility of a major terrorist attack or a spike in violent crime targeting foreigners remains a non-trivial risk, the new evidence suggests the system is more resilient to it than I had initially weighted. My updated forecast of 15% better reflects this high bar for change, placing me between the other two forecasters and acknowledging that while an upgrade is unlikely, the security environment is volatile enough to make it a plausible scenario.",
