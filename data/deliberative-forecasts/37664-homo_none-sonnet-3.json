    "review": "All three forecasters converge on a low probability (8-18%) with similar reasoning: the 46-day window is extremely narrow, there are zero signals of an imminent release, and major AI model launches typically require advance preparation. Forecaster 2 makes a compelling point I underweighted: Claude 3 launched in March 2024, making it 14 months old, which is within typical cadence for major version updates. This temporal argument provides some justification for a higher probability than my initial 8%. However, I believe I raised a critical point the others didn't emphasize sufficiently: Anthropic's recent pattern of releasing Claude 3.5 variants (Sonnet and others) suggests they're in an incremental improvement phase using point releases rather than preparing a major version jump to Claude 4. This naming pattern is highly informative about their development strategy and argues against an imminent Claude 4 launch. Forecaster 3's emphasis on Anthropic's methodical, safety-focused approach also supports a lower probability. The consensus range of 8-18% appears reasonable, though I find the arguments for the lower end more compelling given the 3.5 variant pattern.",
    "rationale": "Upon reflection, I'm updating slightly upward from 8% to 10%. Forecaster 2's point about the 14-month gap from Claude 3 being within normal cadence has merit and I may have been marginally too conservative. However, I maintain that my observation about Claude 3.5 releases is crucial - these incremental updates strongly suggest Anthropic is not imminently jumping to Claude 4. The complete absence of any signals (announcements, leaks, beta programs, infrastructure changes, media coverage) with only 46 days remaining is extremely informative. Major flagship AI model releases simply don't materialize from nowhere in such short timeframes without leaving traces. While I acknowledge the small possibility of a surprise announcement or information we're not seeing, the combination of (1) the 3.5 naming pattern indicating incremental development, (2) zero public signals, (3) the extremely compressed timeline, and (4) Anthropic's historically methodical approach all point strongly toward No. My updated 10% reflects modest deference to the temporal cadence argument while maintaining confidence in my core reasoning.",
