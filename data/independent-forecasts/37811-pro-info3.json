  "information": "On April 4, 2025, a NOAA spokesperson stated that the agency's websites will remain online. Following an internal memo that had warned of potential data loss if sites went down, the spokesperson confirmed, 'There will be no interruption in service. All NOAA Research sites will remain online.' The statement specifically referred to websites connected to NOAA's Office of Oceanic and Atmospheric Research, which focus on climate change, extreme weather research, and drought monitoring.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Approximately 6 weeks.",
    "status_quo_outcome": "Yes. The website is currently online and the operating agency, NOAA, has publicly committed to keeping it online.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "A sudden, high-level political directive overrides NOAA's stated commitment and orders the site to be taken down. Alternatively, a critical and prolonged technical failure, such as a major server outage or cyberattack, takes the site offline and it cannot be restored by the resolution date.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "NOAA follows through on its public commitment, regular operations continue, and the website remains accessible and functional on July 1, 2025, encountering no major, unresolved technical outages.",
    "rationale": "My forecast is heavily weighted by the status quo and recent, highly credible evidence. The website, Climate.gov, is currently operational, and the default assumption for major government web infrastructure is continued operation. This baseline is strongly reinforced by the research provided: a NOAA spokesperson's official statement on April 4, 2025, explicitly confirming that 'All NOAA Research sites will remain online' and that there would be 'no interruption in service.' This statement directly addresses and mitigates the primary risk factor, which would be a deliberate, politically motivated takedown. Given the short time until resolution (around six weeks), there is very little time for a major policy or budgetary shift to be implemented that would result in the site's removal. My probability is not higher than 98% to account for low-probability but non-zero risks. These include an unexpected and severe technical failure (e.g., a major cyberattack, cascading hardware failure) or a sudden, sharp reversal in policy from a level of government above NOAA, which would be an extraordinary event on such a short timescale. My forecast is not lower because the official, public commitment from the relevant agency is the strongest possible evidence for continuity of service, leaving only low-probability 'black swan' events as paths to a 'No' outcome. I would lower my forecast upon news of a major cyberattack on U.S. government infrastructure or a credible report of a new directive to remove climate data. I would raise it if key officials, such as the Secretary of Commerce, publicly re-affirm the commitment.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill NOAA's Climate.gov still be online on July 1, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nNational Security Archive: [Disappearing Data: Trump Administration Removing Climate Information from Government Websites](https://nsarchive.gwu.edu/briefing-book/climate-change-transparency-project-foia/2025-02-06/disappearing-data-trump)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if Climate.gov is online according to [Is It Down Right Now?](https://www.isitdownrightnow.com/climate.gov.html) when accessed by Metaculus on or after July 1, 2025.\n\nAs of May 7, 2025, the resolution source returns the message, \"Climate.gov is UP and reachable by us.\"\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nOn April 4, 2025, a NOAA spokesperson stated that the agency's websites will remain online. Following an internal memo that had warned of potential data loss if sites went down, the spokesperson confirmed, 'There will be no interruption in service. All NOAA Research sites will remain online.' The statement specifically referred to websites connected to NOAA's Office of Oceanic and Atmospheric Research, which focus on climate change, extreme weather research, and drought monitoring.\n\nToday is 2025-05-21.\n\nBefore answering you think:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n(e) You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
