    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "About 3 weeks (≈21 days) until the June 17, 2025 primary; unofficial results likely the night of June 17-18.",
    "status_quo_outcome": "A competitive multi-candidate race with no clear prohibitive favorite; slightly more likely than not that someone other than Rouse wins.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "A Northern Virginia-based opponent consolidates endorsements and turnout in the vote-rich NOVA suburbs while Rouse underperforms in Hampton Roads and among statewide progressives; late polls/earned media break toward that opponent, producing a plurality loss for Rouse.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Rouse consolidates Hampton Roads and a large share of Black primary voters, adds labor and local-official support, and benefits from opposition vote-splitting in NOVA/Richmond; he wins a low-40s (or even high-30s) plurality in a crowded field.",
    "rationale": "Baseline: Virginia Democratic primaries for lieutenant governor are often multi-candidate plurality contests (e.g., 2017, 2021). In such fields, an individual candidate’s base-rate win probability approximates 1/N; with 3–4 serious contenders, that’s roughly 25–33%. Aaron Rouse is a credible, well-known state senator from Hampton Roads with the potential to raise money and assemble a geographically and demographically coherent coalition, which merits an upward adjustment from pure base rate. Countervailing factors include the outsized weight of Northern Virginia in Democratic primaries and the possibility of a well-known NOVA or Richmond-area opponent consolidating that vote. With three weeks to go, absent reliable public polling, I treat this as a competitive race in which Rouse is among the top contenders but not a prohibitive favorite. Status quo bias: If nothing significant changes, a fragmented field and NOVA turnout patterns slightly favor the field over any single candidate, keeping Rouse just below even odds. Why not higher: • Possible strong NOVA opponent, where most Democratic votes are. • Name ID statewide may lag a prior statewide nominee or long-time NOVA figure. • Plurality dynamics can cut against him if two candidates split Hampton Roads/Black vote. Why not lower: • Clear viability: regional base (Hampton Roads), potential to consolidate Black voters, strong campaign skills and fundraising potential make him more than a generic 1/N entry. • In multi-way races, a coherent regional/demographic base often suffices for a plurality. What would raise my forecast: • Credible, recent primary polling showing Rouse leading or clearly first-tier. • High-profile endorsements that signal coalition consolidation (e.g., major statewide figures, labor, key Hampton Roads blocs). • Opponents splitting NOVA/Richmond lanes or notable opponent withdrawals. • Strong late fundraising and favorable media narrative. What would lower my forecast: • Polling showing him trailing by mid-to-high single digits. • A unified NOVA-backed opponent with broad endorsements and cash lead. • Negative revelations or stumbles; weak early vote indicators from Hampton Roads. Research assistant summary: No additional information available, so this forecast leans on base rates, electoral geography, and generic candidate-quality adjustments. Note: If no Democratic primary occurs by June 30, 2025, the market would annul; that scenario currently appears very unlikely.",
