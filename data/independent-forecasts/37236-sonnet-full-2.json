  "information": "According to the US Census Bureau, the US trade deficit for goods reached a record $162 billion in March 2025, a 9.6% increase from February. This was driven by a surge in imports, which increased by $16.3 billion to $342.7 billion. This rise in imports was attributed to businesses stockpiling goods in anticipation of new tariffs. US exports of goods in March 2025 increased by $2.2 billion to $180.8 billion, a 1.2% increase from February and a 6.8% increase from March 2024.\n\nSweeping new tariffs were implemented by the US administration on April 2, 2025, which were followed by retaliatory measures from multiple countries. Subsequent shipping data showed that China-US bookings were down 45% year-over-year. Additionally, manufacturing PMI reports from the period indicated contracting activity in the sector.\n\nTotal US exports for February 2025 were reported at $278.5 billion. Historical data shows that between 79% and 93% of Aprils have seen a year-over-year gain in exports. The Atlanta Federal Reserve estimated that trade subtracted 3 percentage points from GDP in the first quarter of 2025.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "The Census Bureau typically releases the U.S. International Trade in Goods and Services report approximately 6 weeks after month-end. Since today is April 30, 2025, the April 2025 data should be released in early-to-mid June 2025, approximately 5-6 weeks from now.",
    "status_quo_outcome": "Historically, 79-93% of Aprils have shown year-over-year export gains. The immediate pre-tariff trend in March 2025 showed goods exports up 6.8% year-over-year. Without the tariff implementation, the status quo would strongly favor a Yes outcome.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "The sweeping tariffs implemented April 2, 2025, along with retaliatory measures from multiple trading partners, cause immediate and severe disruption to US export activity. The 45% decline in China-US shipping bookings reflects broader export collapse. Manufacturing PMI contraction leads to reduced production and exports. Services exports also decline due to reduced global economic activity. April 2025 total exports fall below $262.6 billion.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Despite tariff implementation on April 2nd, April exports remain above the April 2024 level due to: pre-tariff contracts and shipments already in transit during early April; services exports remaining resilient to goods tariffs; substitution effects where other countries increase purchases of US goods; and lag effects where the full impact of tariffs and retaliation doesn't materialize until May or later. Forward momentum from strong Q1 trends carries through.",
    "rationale": "This forecast faces a critical structural break on April 2, 2025, when sweeping tariffs were implemented. The key tension is between strong historical base rates (79-93% of Aprils show YoY gains) and recent positive trends (March goods exports up 6.8% YoY) versus severe trade disruption indicated by 45% decline in China-US bookings and retaliatory measures. The timing matters enormously - tariffs affected 28 of 30 days in April, not just a small portion. The $262.6 billion threshold compares to February 2025's $278.5 billion total exports. While goods exports showed strength in March (up 6.8% YoY), the tariff shock represents a major regime change. The 45% booking decline suggests rapid, severe impact on trade flows, though bookings may lag actual shipments. Services exports (a significant portion of total exports) may prove more resilient to goods tariffs, providing partial insulation. The forecast is not higher because the tariff implementation was immediate and broadly applied, with retaliatory responses compounding the effect. Manufacturing PMI contraction reinforces concern about production and export capacity. The forecast is not lower because: historical base rates are strong; there's uncertainty about timing of tariff impacts on actual April shipments; services may be resilient; and some April exports were likely contracted pre-tariff. I would revise upward if I saw data showing services exports remained strong, or if the booking decline proved less predictive of actual shipments. I would revise downward if I saw evidence that retaliatory tariffs were broader than initially understood or if services exports also collapsed.",
