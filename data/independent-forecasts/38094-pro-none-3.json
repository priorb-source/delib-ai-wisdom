    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Approximately one month (until July 1, 2025).",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No. Senator Fetterman will continue caucusing with the Democrats.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Despite media reports of friction and his independent policy stances, Senator Fetterman remains a member of the Senate Democratic caucus through the July 1, 2025 deadline, and does not resign or switch parties.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Driven by ideological disagreements, a desire for independence, or an unforeseen health issue, Senator Fetterman formally announces he is leaving the Democratic caucus to become an Independent, switches to the Republican party, or resigns from the Senate before July 1, 2025.",
    "rationale": "The forecast is anchored heavily in the status quo, as senators rarely switch caucuses or resign, especially on such a short timeline. The primary evidence supporting a 'No' outcome is Senator Fetterman's direct statement, as reported in May 2025, that he will not resign. Furthermore, the institutional and political incentives for him to remain in the Democratic caucus are substantial; these include committee assignments, party resources, and the political base that elected him in Pennsylvania. Leaving the caucus would alienate his voters and create significant uncertainty for his political future. The timeframe for this question is extremely short—just over one month. Such a significant political change would likely require a major precipitating event, for which there is currently no public evidence. The probability is not zero because Senator Fetterman has established a pattern of unpredictability and a willingness to publicly break with his party on significant issues, as highlighted in recent media reports. This ongoing friction, described as 'isolation' and 'anger,' creates a non-trivial, albeit small, chance of an impulsive decision to leave the caucus. His past health struggles also contribute a small amount of uncertainty that could lead to a sudden resignation. My forecast would increase with credible reports of a severe decline in his health or active consideration of a party switch. It would decrease if he made strong public statements affirming his commitment to the Democratic caucus.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill Senator John Fetterman cease caucusing with the Democrats before July 1, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\n[Fetterman says he won’t resign, gets support from McCormick as article blowback continues](https://www.pennlive.com/news/2025/05/fetterman-says-he-wont-resign-gets-support-from-mccormick-as-article-blowback-continues.html) | [An isolated, angry Fetterman is yet another challenge for Democrats](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2025/05/16/john-fetterman-senate-relationships/)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below.

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
