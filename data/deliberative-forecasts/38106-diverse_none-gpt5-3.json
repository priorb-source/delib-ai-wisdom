    "review": "Both forecasters emphasize the same core barriers I highlighted: extreme political/optical costs amid the Ukraine war, the lack of any public signaling or logistics, and the very short runway. Forecaster 2 adds the bipartisan condemnation point explicitly; Forecaster 3 stresses historical precedent (no Russia visit in Trump’s first term) and the planning timeline. None of this contradicts my prior view; it reinforces it. I don’t see new concrete evidence, but the convergence toward very low odds and the emphasis on the unusually high planning/security bar for a presidential visit to an adversary argue for a slight downward nudge.",
    "rationale": "With ~1 month left and zero credible indications, the base case remains No. A presidential trip to Russia—especially in wartime—would require extensive advance security/diplomatic prep and would incur massive political costs when neutral venues are available. Trump’s unpredictability and appetite for headline-grabbing moves keep a small tail, but even a breakthrough (ceasefire/prisoner exchange) would almost certainly be handled at a neutral site. Given peer convergence and the particularly tight planning window, I’m trimming my estimate slightly from 3% to 2%. I would move up only on credible reporting of an in-Russia meeting, observable logistical prep, or official statements of intent; I would move down on explicit denials, a scheduled neutral-site meeting with Putin, or a published June calendar leaving no gap.",
