    "review": "Both forecasters raise several compelling arguments that warrant updating my forecast downward. The most significant new information is that the deal was reportedly in 'final stages' with Q1 2025 expected finalization, yet we're now in May with no announcement. This missed timeline is a concrete negative signal I hadn't accounted for - it suggests either complications arose, the timeline was too optimistic, or the deal faces obstacles. Both forecasters also correctly emphasize status quo bias more strongly than I did - most questions resolve to No simply because the default state is 'nothing happens.' Their point about the Korea Herald quote noting relationships 'need more detailed road map' is important context suggesting frameworks aren't as concrete as I initially assessed. The observation that defense procurement typically takes 6-12+ months from advanced negotiations to announcement is also valuable baseline context. However, I think both forecasters may slightly underweight the significance of the November 2024 training - having Vietnamese troops actually train on the K9 system is a very concrete indicator that goes beyond exploratory talks. This type of hands-on training typically occurs when procurement is substantially likely. Additionally, while 2 months is tight, it's not unreasonably so for an announcement if negotiations are truly advanced. The specific deal parameters (20 units, $300M) still suggest substantive rather than purely speculative discussions.",
    "rationale": "I'm updating my forecast downward from 55% to 47% based on the Q1 2025 timeline miss and stronger emphasis on status quo bias, while maintaining modest optimism above the other forecasters' 40% due to the November 2024 training signal. The Q1 miss is genuinely concerning - it indicates the deal either hit complications or was never as close as reported. This pushes me toward skepticism. However, the November training remains a strong positive indicator that both forecasters may underweight. Training programs are expensive and time-consuming; they typically occur when procurement is substantially advanced, not merely possible. The combination of missed Q1 timeline (negative) and recent training completion (positive) creates a more mixed picture than either pure optimism or pessimism would suggest. With 2 months remaining, announcement is possible but increasingly unlikely with each passing week. The strategic alignment and specific deal parameters prevent me from going as low as 40%, but the timeline concerns prevent me from staying at 55%.",
