  "information": "In a January 2025 address to the diplomatic corps, President Alassane Ouattara stated he was in 'perfect health and ready to continue serving my country', but clarified that he had 'not yet made a decision' regarding a candidacy in the October 2025 presidential election. He noted that his party, the RHDP, has at least a dozen potential candidates. Previously, in 2020, Ouattara had announced his intention to step down but reversed this decision to run for a third term after the sudden death of his designated successor.\n\nPresident Ouattara's party, the RHDP, has referred to him as its 'natural candidate' and has been calling for him to run since 2024. In late December 2024, Minister of State Anne Désirée Ouloto announced Ouattara would be the candidate. Similarly, in early January 2025, Minister of Transport Amadou KONÉ stated that Ouattara 'will be the candidate of the RHDP in October 2025.' In late April 2025, a supporter group, the Jeunesse pour la Renaissance du Grand Nord (JRGN), held a press conference publicly calling on Ouattara to run.\n\nSeveral key opposition figures face eligibility challenges ahead of the 2025 election. In late April 2025, a court ruled that potential challenger Tidjane Thiam, leader of the PDCI party, was ineligible to run for president due to his French nationality. Former President Laurent Gbagbo was excluded from electoral lists in 2023 following a conviction for embezzlement. Another political figure, Guillaume Soro, remains in exile and is ineligible due to a 2021 conviction; in April 2025, a trial began for his former aide-de-camp for an alleged coup attempt against Ouattara.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "About 33 days (until 2025-06-01)",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No — Ouattara maintains ambiguity and does not personally declare before June 1, 2025",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "He continues to say he hasn’t decided, the RHDP defers a formal nominating congress or public endorsement acceptance to June or later, and no credible report quotes him explicitly declaring before June 1.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "The RHDP convenes a May congress or major rally where Ouattara personally accepts the nomination, or he gives a speech/interview explicitly stating he will run, promptly reported by credible outlets before June 1.",
    "rationale": "Signals are mixed. On one hand, Ouattara told diplomats in January 2025 he had not yet decided, consistent with his pattern of strategic ambiguity and the 2020 precedent of declaring relatively late (about 2–3 months before the vote). Early declaration risks mobilizing opposition and international criticism over a fourth term. If key rivals are being sidelined (e.g., late-April ruling against Tidjane Thiam, Laurent Gbagbo’s exclusion, Guillaume Soro’s ineligibility), Ouattara has less incentive to declare early; he can wait and preserve flexibility. On the other hand, his party (RHDP) figures have repeatedly said he will be the candidate (Dec 2024–Jan 2025), and pro-Ouattara groups are publicly calling on him to run, which slightly raises the chance of a May declaration if the party wants to formalize and lock in unity. Overall, the status quo favors delay past June 1, given past timing, incentives to manage optics, and the absence (so far) of a publicly known May nominating event. This keeps the probability below 50. It is not lower because elite signaling that he will run is strong, and a May party congress or set-piece address could happen on short notice. I would move higher if credible reports announce an RHDP nominating congress or a scheduled major address by Ouattara in May with indications of a declaration; I would move lower if Ouattara or RHDP formally indicates the nomination decision will come in June or later, or if he reiterates indecision in May without scheduling a party event.",
