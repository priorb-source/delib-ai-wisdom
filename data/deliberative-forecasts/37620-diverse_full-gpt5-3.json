    "review": "Both colleagues convincingly stress the high bar posed by the short timeline and the need for an official, public change in status for resolution. They also re-emphasize the pattern of prior step-down talk without action and the signaling from the May 7 Putin meeting. The point that health-driven resolution requires both an acute event and rapid official confirmation within ~3 weeks is a useful sharpening of the risk. I share their view that health risk is the main upside driver but that political inertia and wartime stability strongly favor continuity.",
    "rationale": "I’m lowering my estimate because I overweighted the immediacy implied by Kadyrov’s May 6 statement relative to the Kremlin’s demonstrated preference for timing and control. The lack of any concrete transition choreography after his May 7 meeting with Putin, plus his subsequent downplaying of resignation talk, points to low near-term hazard for a political handover. Health remains the primary tail risk, but given the multi-year pattern of serious-illness rumors without removal and the requirement for swift, official confirmation before June 1, the near-term probability is likely closer to the low-teens. I’m moving from 24% to 16%. I would move up on credible reports of hospitalization/incapacitation or clear administrative steps (e.g., decree drafts, successor surfacing, removal from official sites). I would move down on sustained, vigorous public appearances or explicit Kremlin affirmations that he remains in post for the foreseeable future.",
