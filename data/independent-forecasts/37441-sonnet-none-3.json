    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "The monitoring period begins in 6 days (May 12, 2025) and runs until July 1, 2025, giving approximately 50 days total for the condition to be met.",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No - the dollar remains above 0.80 EUR",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "The dollar stabilizes or strengthens from its current weak position due to factors such as: the Federal Reserve maintaining a hawkish stance on interest rates, US economic data showing resilience, tariff concerns de-escalating through negotiations, or European economic weakness undermining the euro. Central banks typically intervene before currencies reach extreme levels, and markets may have already priced in much of the tariff-related concerns.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "The dollar continues its sharp decline due to escalating trade war impacts, unexpected Fed rate cuts in response to economic slowdown, a major geopolitical or financial crisis that undermines dollar confidence, or compounding negative economic data. The tariff turmoil mentioned in the headline intensifies, causing significant capital outflows from dollar-denominated assets and a flight to euro assets.",
    "rationale": "The background article indicates the dollar has already hit a 3-year low against the euro amid tariff turmoil, suggesting significant weakness. However, reaching below 0.80 EUR per USD (equivalent to EUR/USD above 1.25) would represent an extremely weak dollar position. Historically, such levels have been rare - the euro reached similar strength in 2008. Without knowing the exact current rate, but assuming a 3-year low puts us somewhere around 0.87-0.92 EUR per USD based on historical ranges, we would need an additional 8-15% dollar decline in just 7 weeks. While currency crises can produce such moves, they remain unusual. The status quo bias suggests the dollar is more likely to stabilize than continue such a steep trajectory. Favorable factors for No: currency mean reversion, central bank interventions typically prevent extremes, 7 weeks is relatively short for such a large move. Favorable factors for Yes: mentioned tariff turmoil and existing downward momentum, potential for cascading effects if dollar weakness becomes self-reinforcing. I would revise upward if: new data showed we're already near 0.82-0.83 EUR, or if major new negative catalysts emerge. I would revise downward if: current rate is confirmed above 0.90 EUR, or if tariff tensions ease significantly.",
