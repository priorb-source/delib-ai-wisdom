    "review": "All three forecasters converge on a high probability (75-90%) with similar reasoning. Forecaster 2 makes an important point I understated: Zelenskyy attended not just the 2023 G7 but also the 2024 G7 in person - establishing a perfect 2/2 attendance record at G7 summits since the invasion. This strengthens the precedent considerably. Forecaster 2's 90% reflects strong confidence in this pattern continuing, tempered only by war-related risks. Forecaster 3's 75% gives more weight to the lack of confirmed attendance and the possibility of virtual participation as an alternative. A key consideration all of us share: we're early in June (June 3rd), and G7 summits typically occur mid-to-late month, so the absence of confirmation isn't necessarily alarming yet. Forecaster 3 correctly notes this timing nuance. However, I find Forecaster 2's emphasis on the limited window for disruptive events compelling - with only 2-3 weeks until the likely summit dates, major changes would need to happen soon. The 2/2 attendance record at recent G7s is stronger evidence than I initially weighted.",
    "rationale": "After reviewing both analyses, I'm updating slightly upward based on the reinforced precedent of 2/2 G7 attendance since 2022. The pattern is stronger than I initially credited. However, three factors prevent me from going as high as 90%: (1) we still lack confirmed attendance as of June 3rd, (2) the ongoing war creates irreducible uncertainty, and (3) virtual participation remains a viable fallback that Zelenskyy has used for less critical forums. The short timeframe argument is compelling - there's limited window for major disruptions, but also limited window for complex security/logistics arrangements if not already advanced. The diplomatic payoff of G7 attendance remains extremely high, and Canada's strong support for Ukraine makes this an especially favorable environment. My forecast moves from 80% to 85%, reflecting greater confidence in the established attendance pattern while maintaining appropriate uncertainty given the lack of confirmation and wartime volatility.",
