    "review": "Forecasters 2 and 3 raised critical information I lacked: UFC 316 is on June 7, 2025 at Prudential Center in Newark, NJ. This is a game-changer. Newark is approximately 30-40 minutes from Trump's Bedminster residence, making this an extraordinarily convenient event compared to other UFC venues. Both forecasters correctly emphasized this proximity factor, and Forecaster 3 provided valuable base-rate analysis suggesting Trump attends one-third to one-half of prime PPVs. Their identification of the O'Malley-Dvalishvili main event as marquee-level also strengthens the case for attendance. The 5-week gap since UFC 314 (not back-to-back events as I initially suggested) is reasonable spacing. However, I find their 55-57% forecasts slightly optimistic. While the convenience factor is substantial, presidential schedules remain highly constrained and unpredictable. We have no confirmation or credible hints about attendance plans, and even with strong personal ties to Dana White, Trump still misses most UFC events. The base rate they cite (33-50%) actually suggests non-attendance is still more common than attendance for any single event, even prime ones.",
    "rationale": "The Newark location fundamentally changes my analysis. I significantly underestimated the probability because I didn't factor in venue proximity to Trump's Bedminster residence. This convenience eliminates major logistical barriers that apply to distant venues. Combined with: (1) his demonstrated pattern of UFC attendance throughout his presidency, (2) strong Dana White relationship, (3) recent April 13 appearance showing continued engagement, (4) marquee main event, and (5) valuable New York media market exposure, the probability should be substantially higher than my initial 32%. However, I'm adjusting more conservatively than Forecasters 2 and 3 because: (1) presidential scheduling constraints remain significant even for convenient events, (2) June 7 is 5+ weeks away with unpredictable conflicts possible, (3) no confirmation or hints have emerged, (4) the base rate still suggests he misses most individual events, and (5) some advisors might counsel against frequent UFC appearances. The convenience factor warrants a major upward revision, but not quite to coin-flip territory given ongoing uncertainties.",
