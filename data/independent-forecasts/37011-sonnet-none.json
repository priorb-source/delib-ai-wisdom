    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Approximately 1-3 weeks. UK local elections typically occur in early May, so this election is likely scheduled for May 1 or May 8, 2025.",
    "status_quo_outcome": "Labour or Conservative party wins the most seats. Traditionally, Derbyshire County Council has been controlled by these established parties, with Labour winning control in the last 2021 election. The status quo strongly favors these major parties retaining dominance.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Traditional parties maintain their local stronghold. Labour and Conservatives compete for most seats based on their established local infrastructure, candidate recognition, and ground game. Reform UK may win a few seats but remains a minor presence. Voters prioritize local issues and known candidates over national political trends.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Reform UK experiences an unprecedented surge in Derbyshire, fielding strong candidates across most wards and capitalizing on widespread dissatisfaction with both major parties. National polling momentum translates unusually effectively to local level, and Reform UK's ground operation proves surprisingly effective. Both Conservative and Labour votes collapse simultaneously to Reform.",
    "rationale": "This forecast assigns very low probability to Reform UK winning the most seats for several structural reasons. First, local elections consistently favor established parties with local infrastructure, candidate recognition, and grassroots networks - advantages Reform UK lacks. Second, even when parties poll well nationally, translating this to local council victories is exceptionally difficult, especially for newer parties. Third, we're only weeks from the election with no indication Reform UK is competitive in Derbyshire specifically. Fourth, Reform UK has minimal local government representation nationwide, making a breakthrough of this magnitude unprecedented. The BBC article mentions an 'unusual' campaign but provides no evidence of Reform UK dominance. The status quo outcome (Labour/Conservative competition) deserves heavy weight given how slowly political landscapes change at the local level. For my forecast to increase significantly, I would need: polling showing Reform UK competitive in Derbyshire, evidence of strong candidate slates across all wards, indication of effective local campaign organization, or credible reporting of a major shift in local sentiment. For it to decrease further below 3%, I would need confirmation that Reform UK is essentially not competitive or fielding few candidates. Given complete uncertainty but strong structural disadvantages, I assign a 3% probability.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill Reform UK win the most seats in the 2025 Derbyshire County Council election?\n\nQuestion background:\nBBC: ['Unusual' election campaign under way in Derbyshire](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cg41lzylq64o)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if Reform UK controls the most seats following the [2025 Derbyshire County Council election](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2025_Derbyshire_County_Council_election)\n\n\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nNo additional information available.\n\nToday is 2025-04-21.\n\nBefore answering you think:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n(e) You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
