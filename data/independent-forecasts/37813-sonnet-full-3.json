  "information": "According to multiple news outlets, U.S. government bodies have documented 757 cases of Unidentified Aerial Phenomena (UAP) between May 2023 and June 2024. Of this total, 708 occurred in airspace, and only 49 cases had been officially closed as of early 2025. The Department of Defense's All-Domain Anomaly Resolution Office (AARO) is the primary body for receiving these reports. The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) also investigates UAP sightings, especially those confirmed by radar, and shares its findings with the Department of Defense.\n\nA specific incident in January 2023 involved a U.S. Air Force F-16 Viper fighter jet colliding with an unidentified object during a training mission over Arizona, causing damage to the aircraft's canopy. The object was described as an 'orange-white uncrewed aerial system' (UAS). This is one of numerous encounters reported by military pilots in the region, establishing Arizona as a hotspot for UAP sightings, particularly near military training areas and the border with Mexico. Former government intelligence officer Luis Elizondo confirmed that there has been significant reported activity in the area.\n\nSome U.S. officials speculate that a portion of the UAP sightings, especially in the Southwest, could be attributable to advanced drone technology used by drug cartels for espionage or smuggling. Ron Vitiello, an advisor to U.S. Customs and Border Protection, noted that the 'unlimited funding' of cartels could enable them to deploy technologies previously unseen in the drone sector. This theory has been presented as a potential explanation for some of the unidentified objects observed in restricted military airspace.",

    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Approximately 10 days until June 2025 begins, with the outcome definitively known by early July 2025 when NUFORC posts June 2025 reports.",
    "status_quo_outcome": "Yes - at least one cube-shaped UFO sighting is reported to NUFORC in June 2025",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "June 2025 sees numerous UFO reports submitted to NUFORC covering various shapes (lights, discs, triangles, spheres) but no witnesses report or describe cube-shaped objects during the month.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "At least one witness reports a cube-shaped UFO sighting from June 2025 to NUFORC, which processes and posts the report on their database by the time Metaculus checks on or after July 1, 2025.",
    "rationale": "The critical data point is that December 2024 had 6 cube-shaped sightings, explicitly noted as rare in NUFORC's history. This establishes that while uncommon, cube-shaped sightings do occur and are reported. The question only requires ONE cube-shaped sighting in June 2025, significantly lowering the bar compared to requiring multiple sightings. With NUFORC processing approximately 3,600 reports annually (roughly 300 per month based on 180,000 reports over 50 years), and December 2024 showing 6 cube sightings, this suggests perhaps 1-2% of reports involve cube shapes when they do occur. June typically sees increased outdoor activity in the Northern Hemisphere, potentially leading to more sightings overall. The research assistant's report indicates heightened UAP awareness and activity, particularly in the Southwest U.S., which could maintain or increase reporting rates. However, the 'rare' designation is crucial - not every month will have cube-shaped sightings, and December 2024 may represent an above-average month rather than the baseline. The status quo suggests some probability of cube sightings continuing, but the rarity factor prevents this from being a high-confidence prediction. My forecast is not higher because cube shapes are explicitly rare, and many months likely have zero such sightings. It's not lower because we have recent empirical evidence of cube sightings occurring, and we only need one instance. I would revise upward if data showed January-May 2025 also contained cube sightings, suggesting a sustained pattern. I would revise downward if evidence showed December 2024 was an isolated anomaly with surrounding months having zero cube-shaped reports.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill the National UFO Reporting Center report a sighting of a cube-shaped UFO in June 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nAccording to the [National UFO Reporting Center](https://nuforc.org/about-us/): \"The National UFO Reporting Center was founded in 1974 by noted UFO investigator Robert J. Gribble. The Center’s primary function over the past five decades has been to receive, record, and to the greatest degree possible, corroborate and document reports from individuals who have been witness to unusual, possibly UFO-related events. Throughout its history, the Center has processed over 180,000 reports, and has distributed its information to thousands of individuals.\"\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if The National UFO Reporting Center posts a report of a sighting of a UFO/UAP shaped like a cube in June 2025 at [this link](https://nuforc.org/ndx/?id=event) when accessed by Metaculus on or after July 1, 2025.\n\nFor example, although rare in the history of NUFORC, the month of December 2024 [had](https://nuforc.org/subndx/?id=e202412) six sightings with a cube shape.\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nAccording to multiple news outlets, U.S. government bodies have documented 757 cases of Unidentified Aerial Phenomena (UAP) between May 2023 and June 2024.

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
