  "information": "As of late April 2025, the African Continental Free Trade Area (AfCFTA) has achieved a 92% consensus on trade rules. Forty-nine of the 54 African countries have joined the agreement, with 23 having commenced implementation of the new trade rules. Supporting infrastructure includes the Pan-African Payment and Settlement System (PAPSS), which now connects over 20 central banks and 160 commercial banks, enabling easier payment for goods in local currencies. Additionally, Afreximbank is organizing specialized training programs to help African businesses understand the AfCFTA's commercial implications and regulatory landscape.",

    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "2 months",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Libya's rival governments remain locked in a political stalemate, prioritizing internal power struggles over foreign policy and long-term economic planning. The legislative process required for ratification is never initiated in the divided House of Representatives, and the July 1, 2025 deadline passes without action.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Seeking to bolster its international legitimacy and economic credentials, one of Libya's competing governments, likely the internationally-recognized GNU in Tripoli, fast-tracks the ratification process by decree. Despite internal disputes over the procedure, the instrument of ratification is successfully deposited with the African Union Commission before the deadline.",
    "rationale": "My forecast is based primarily on the persistent and deep-rooted political fragmentation in Libya, which represents a significant structural barrier to ratifying any major international treaty. The status quo is that Libya has not ratified the agreement, and with only two months remaining, this outcome is highly likely to persist. The country is split between rival administrations, the Government of National Unity (GNU) in Tripoli and the House of Representatives (HoR) in the east. Such a division makes the necessary legislative consensus and coordinated action for ratification extremely improbable. The focus of Libyan political actors remains on internal power consolidation, security, and the long-stalled electoral process, not on complex trade agreements. While the research assistant's report indicates strong continent-wide momentum for AfCFTA, with most nations already on board, this external pressure is unlikely to be sufficient to overcome Libya's internal paralysis in the short term. My forecast is not 0% because a surprise political maneuver by one faction seeking to score a diplomatic victory cannot be entirely dismissed. A powerful external actor could also pressure a faction into a swift ratification. The probability is not higher because the political deadlock is a well-established, multi-year reality, and the legislative process, even in a stable country, typically takes longer than two months. I would raise my probability upon seeing evidence of a formal bill being tabled in the HoR with cross-factional support. I would lower it if internal tensions escalate further.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill Libya ratify AfCFTA (the pan-African free trade agreement) before July 1, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nWikipedia: [African Continental Free Trade Area](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/African_Continental_Free_Trade_Area)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below.

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
