  "information": "According to multiple news reports from late May 2025, former Ivorian President Laurent Gbagbo is considered disqualified from the 2025 presidential election. This is due to a 2018 conviction for the looting of the Central Bank of West African States (BCEAO), which resulted in a 20-year prison sentence and the loss of his civic rights. Sources such as Le Point, tunisienumerique.com, and Abidjan.net state that he remains struck from the electoral list. His political party, the People's African Party-Côte d'Ivoire (PPA-CI), announced in late April 2025 that it would evaluate the situation in the first half of June 2025 and consider a 'new level in the fight' if his status on the electoral list does not change.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "32 days (resolves on July 1, 2025).",
    "status_quo_outcome": "Yes. Laurent Gbagbo is currently considered disqualified and has been removed from the electoral list.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "For a 'No' outcome, all five listed candidates must be eligible to run. This would require a significant change for Laurent Gbagbo, such as receiving a presidential pardon or amnesty from President Alassane Ouattara that restores his civic rights, or a successful court ruling overturning his ineligibility before the deadline.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "This scenario is already in effect. Laurent Gbagbo, due to a 2018 conviction, has been struck from the electoral list. As long as this legal status is confirmed by credible sources and is not reversed before July 1, 2025, the question will resolve as 'Yes'.",
    "rationale": "My forecast is based on the strong evidence that one of the named candidates, former President Laurent Gbagbo, is already legally ineligible to run. My research assistant's report, citing multiple news outlets from late May 2025, confirms that Gbagbo has been removed from the electoral list due to a 2018 conviction for which he was sentenced to 20 years and lost his civic rights. The resolution criteria for this question are met if a candidate 'has been removed from the electoral list or otherwise become legally ineligible'. This condition is already satisfied.\n\nThe status quo is therefore a 'Yes' outcome. The forecast is not 100% because there is a small, but non-zero, chance of a last-minute political development that could reverse this situation. President Ouattara could, for instance, grant Gbagbo a full amnesty to ease political tensions ahead of the election. However, given the deep political rivalry and the short timeframe of only one month, such a reversal is highly unlikely.\n\nThe probability is not lower because the legal and administrative basis for Gbagbo's disqualification is well-established and has been in place for years, and there is currently no indication of a serious process to overturn it. I would lower my probability if credible reports emerged of a pending presidential pardon or a high-stakes legal appeal with a significant chance of success. Conversely, an official statement from the Ivorian Electoral Commission (CEI) re-confirming Gbagbo's ineligibility would move my forecast closer to 100%.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill any of these candidates be disqualified from running in the 2025 Ivorian presidential election before July 1, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nBBC: [Main opposition leader removed from Ivory Coast electoral list](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c0l0j849143o)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if before July 1, 2025, according to [credible sources](https://www.metaculus.com/faq/#definitions) any of these candidates has been removed from the electoral list or otherwise become legally ineligible to run in the [2025 presidential election](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2025_Ivorian_presidential_election) of the Ivory Coast (Côte d'Ivoire) under the laws of the country: Gnangbo Kacou, Laurent Gbagbo, Pascal Affi N'Guessan, Jean-Louis Billon, or Simone Gbagbo.\n\n\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nAccording to multiple news reports from late May 2025, former Ivorian President Laurent Gbagbo is considered disqualified from the 2025 presidential election.

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
