    "review": "The other forecasters raised several important points I hadn't fully considered. Forecaster 2's observation about Uber's track record of regulatory resistance in smaller Caribbean islands provides useful base rate evidence that reinforces the difficulty of entry. Forecaster 3's point about Uber's demonstrated strategic focus on large markets (like Curitiba, Brazil) and technology ventures is valuable negative evidence. Most significantly, both Forecasters 2 and 3 highlighted the 'Uber Taxi' partnership model as a potential rapid-entry mechanism. This is a legitimate pathway I underweighted - it could theoretically allow Uber to enter by partnering with existing licensed drivers, positioning itself as a regulatory solution rather than a disruptor. This model has been used in other markets and could theoretically bypass some regulatory barriers. However, I'm not convinced this changes the fundamental calculus dramatically. Even an Uber Taxi partnership would require negotiations, government approval, and operational integration - all within 60 days, with zero public signals of such discussions occurring. The April 2025 warning about illegal taxis indicates the government is currently in enforcement mode, not negotiation mode. Forecaster 2's 7% forecast seems too optimistic about tourism demand driving a quick partnership, while Forecaster 3's 5% better balances the Uber Taxi possibility against the overwhelming barriers.",
    "rationale": "I'm updating my forecast upward from 3% to 5%. The Uber Taxi partnership model is a more plausible rapid-entry pathway than I initially weighted, and both peer forecasters correctly highlighted this. This model could theoretically allow Uber to work with existing licensed operators and frame itself as modernizing rather than disrupting the taxi market. However, this still requires negotiation, regulatory approval, and integration within just 60 days, with absolutely no public evidence of such discussions. The April 2025 government warning about illegal taxis signals active enforcement, not liberalization. The small market size (45,000 residents), existing local competition (GetMe Ride since 2019, Conch Cab just launched), and complete absence of launch signals from Uber all argue strongly against entry. While tourism demand is real, it's insufficient to overcome these barriers in such a short timeframe. My updated 5% forecast reflects slightly more weight on the partnership pathway while maintaining that a July 1 launch remains highly improbable.",
