    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "About 5 weeks. The question resolves on July 1, 2025.",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No. Databricks is currently a private company and has not announced an IPO. If nothing changes, it will not make the required announcement before the deadline.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Databricks leadership continues to see the public markets as volatile or unfavorable for a company of their valuation and profile. They opt to wait for a more stable macroeconomic environment and a stronger, more sustained tech IPO window, thus making no announcement before July 1, 2025.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "A favorable window in the public markets opens in late May or June 2025. Seeing strong performance from other recent tech IPOs and facing pressure from investors seeking liquidity, Databricks, having already done the preparatory work, decides to act quickly and files its S-1 or makes an official announcement to seize the opportunity.",
    "rationale": "My forecast is heavily weighted towards the 'No' outcome, primarily due to the extremely short timeframe. As of May 22, 2025, there are just over five weeks until the July 1 deadline. Announcing an IPO, even just by filing an S-1, is a monumental step that is typically preceded by months of public speculation and reporting, none of which is present according to the research provided. The status quo is that Databricks is a private company, and without a significant catalyst, this is unlikely to change in the next few weeks. The company's CEO, Ali Ghodsi, has a public history of being patient and waiting for the right market conditions, as evidenced by his 2023 comments about it being 'dumb to IPO' in a poor market. While market conditions may have improved since then, they are not in a full-blown bull market for tech IPOs that would necessitate such a rapid, un-telegraphed move. \n\nMy forecast is not lower than 10% because Databricks is widely considered 'IPO-ready' and has been for some time. It has the scale, revenue, and governance to go public whenever it chooses. A sudden, positive market shift could indeed trigger a fast decision, and much of the legal and financial groundwork for an S-1 may have already been laid confidentially. \n\nMy forecast is not higher because of the lack of signals. An imminent IPO announcement would likely be preceded by a hiring ramp-up in investor relations, a leak to a major financial news outlet, or other similar 'smoke'. The absence of this information, combined with the short timeline, makes a 'Yes' outcome a low-probability event. I would increase my probability in the event of credible reports from sources like Bloomberg or The Wall Street Journal about an imminent filing. Conversely, I would lower it if the CEO makes any public statements suggesting a continued 'wait and see' approach.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nBefore July 1, 2025, will Databricks announce that it is planning an IPO?\n\nQuestion background:\nTechCrunch: ['It's dumb to IPO this year': Databricks CEO explains why he's waiting to go public](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/dumb-ipo-databricks-ceo-explains-064957000.html)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question will resolve as **Yes** if Databricks, Inc., announces before July 1, 2025, that it is planning an initial public offering. In order to streamline the resolution of this question, there are two resolution sources for the IPO announcement: 1) Databricks filing an [SEC Form S-1](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/sec-form-s-1.asp) or 2) An announcement at the [news](https://www.databricks.com/blog) section of its website. If there is no such announcement before that date, this question resolves as **No**.\n\n\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nNo additional information available.\n\nToday is 2025-05-22.\n\nBefore answering you think:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n(e) You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
