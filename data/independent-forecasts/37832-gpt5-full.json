  "information": "In January 2025, Databricks completed a major funding round, raising over $15.25 billion. This included a $10 billion Series J equity financing round, which valued the company at $62 billion, and an additional $5.25 billion in debt financing provided by several major banks. New investors in the equity round included Meta as a strategic partner. The funding is intended to accelerate the development of new AI products, expand market reach, and finance acquisitions. A portion of the funds was also designated to offer liquidity to current and former employees.\n\nDatabricks has an upcoming Data + AI Summit scheduled for June 9-12, 2025. Keynote speakers announced for the event include the CEOs of JPMorgan Chase, Anthropic, and Microsoft. Previously, Databricks CEO Ali Ghodsi had described 2024 as a \"dumb\" year for IPOs and has made statements suggesting flexibility on the timing of a public offering, mentioning both 2025 and 2026 as possibilities. A January 2025 report noted that a public offering within a year \"wouldn't be a huge surprise.\"\n\nAs of late May 2025, there have been no public reports of Databricks selecting underwriters for an IPO or of the company making a confidential S-1 filing with the SEC. Market sentiment has been described as uncertain, with some IPO advisors noting that while planning is occurring, macroeconomic concerns might cause delays. Other major tech startups, such as Stripe, have also remained private despite IPO expectations. In contrast, companies like Klarna and eToro have reportedly filed confidential IPO paperwork.",

    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "About 39 days (until end of day June 30, 2025)",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Databricks continues operating privately through June, focusing on product launches at the June 9–12 Data + AI Summit and avoiding IPO-related communications due to quiet-period concerns. No public S-1 appears on EDGAR, and no announcement is posted on the Databricks news/blog page before July 1.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Databricks publicly files an S-1 in mid-to-late June (e.g., after its summit) and issues the standard press release/blog post noting a registration statement for a proposed IPO; or it posts a clear announcement on its news page that it plans to go public before July 1, 2025.",
    "rationale": "- What we know: In Jan 2025 Databricks raised a very large $10B Series J at a $62B valuation plus $5.25B in debt. The round included strategic participation (Meta) and provided employee liquidity. The company has a major conference June 9–12, 2025. The CEO previously called 2024 a “dumb” IPO year but left 2025/2026 open. As of late May 2025, there are no public reports of underwriter selection or a confidential S-1. Market conditions are mixed; some tech names have stayed private while a few have moved ahead via confidential filings.\n- Resolution specifics: This resolves Yes only if there is a publicly visible S-1 on the SEC site or an announcement on Databricks’ own news/blog page before July 1. A purely confidential filing would not satisfy the stated sources.\n- Base-rate and timing considerations: With ~5.5 weeks left, a high-profile company typically shows preparatory signals (bank mandates, audit and governance moves, media leaks) before a public S-1. The lack of such signals tilts toward No. Summer is also a slower IPO window; if they aim for a fall listing, a public S-1 in June is possible but not necessary if they remain confidential. Additionally, announcing IPO intent on the company blog without an S-1 is unusual and risks gun-jumping; most firms stick to a press release coincident with a public filing.\n- Liquidity and runway: The January equity and debt financing reduces urgency to go public imminently and provided employee liquidity, weakening the near-term need for an IPO announcement.\n- Countervailing factors (why not lower): The AI/infrastructure narrative is strong; peers like Snowflake provide a valuation benchmark; banks that provided debt could be natural underwriters; Databricks could be far along privately and decide to publicly file in late June to target a post-summer or early fall listing. Large companies can move quickly, and leaks are not guaranteed.\n- Status quo weighting: The most probable outcome, given no current public IPO process signals and the short window, is No. I assign extra weight to that inertia.\n- What would raise my probability: Credible reporting of underwriter selection; evidence of a confidential S-1; governance/audit shifts typical of pre-IPO readiness; IR build-out; or a strong, steady IPO tape in June that incentivizes a window capture. Any Databricks legal boilerplate around “quiet period” at or after the summit would also be a tell.\n- What would lower my probability: Deteriorating market conditions; explicit executive statements pushing any listing to 2026; additional private liquidity events; or organizational changes inconsistent with near-term listing.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nBefore July 1, 2025, will Databricks announce that it is planning an IPO?\n\nQuestion background:\nTechCrunch: ['It's dumb to IPO this year': Databricks CEO explains why he's waiting to go public](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/dumb-ipo-databricks-ceo-explains-064957000.html)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question will resolve as **Yes** if Databricks, Inc., announces before July 1, 2025, that it is planning an initial public offering. In order to streamline the resolution of this question, there are two resolution sources for the IPO announcement: 1) Databricks filing an [SEC Form S-1](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/sec-form-s-1.asp) or 2) An announcement at the [news](https://www.databricks.com/blog) section of its website. If there is no such announcement before that date, this question resolves as **No**.\n\n\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nIn January 2025, Databricks completed a major funding round, raising over $15.25 billion.

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
