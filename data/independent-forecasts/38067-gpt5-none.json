    "rationale": "Baseline and timing: The James Beard Restaurant & Chef Awards are announced in early June, so we’re within a week. My research assistant had no additional info, and I cannot verify the 2025 finalist slate here, so I lean on base rates and recent award dynamics.\nBase rates: Historically, men have won Outstanding Chef more often, but the past decade shows meaningful female representation among winners (e.g., Nancy Silverton 2014, Suzanne Goin 2016, Gabrielle Hamilton 2018, Ashley Christensen 2019, Mashama Bailey 2022). That’s roughly ~40–50% women in recent years, reflecting the Foundation’s reforms and a broader push for diversity since 2022.\nField composition: Recent finalist lists often include 2–3 women out of ~5 finalists. If that pattern holds, a neutral per-finalist probability would put the chance for a woman around 40–60%, before accounting for any perceived frontrunner effects. Without access to the actual 2025 finalists and pre-ceremony consensus, I can’t adjust for frontrunners.\nWhy not higher: Men still win slightly more often; if there are fewer women among the finalists (e.g., 1 of 5), the probability drops substantially. Also, Outstanding Chef often recognizes long-running impact and consistency, which may favor certain established male chefs in the pipeline.\nWhy not lower: Since the 2022 reforms, the Foundation has elevated a broader set of chefs, and multiple recent Outstanding Chef winners have been women. If 2–3 women are finalists—as has become common—then the chance is near-even.\nWhat would move me up: Confirmation that 3 (or more) of the finalists are women, or credible pre-award reporting that a woman is the clear frontrunner. I’d update to 55–70% in that case. What would move me down: If only one woman is a finalist, or trusted previews indicate a male frontrunner; I’d drop to 15–35% depending on consensus strength.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill a woman win the 2025 James Beard Award for Outstanding Chef?\n\nQuestion background:\n[Here Are the 2025 James Beard Awards Restaurant, Chef, and Media Award Finalists](https://www.eater.com/24398769/2025-james-beard-awards-restaurant-chef-finalists)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if a woman wins the 2025 James Beard Award for Outstanding Chef.\n\n\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nNo additional information available.\n\nToday is 2025-05-27.\n\nBefore answering you think:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n(e) You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
