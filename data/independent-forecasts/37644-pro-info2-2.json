  "information": "Anthropic has recently launched its Claude 3.7 Sonnet model and is reportedly developing new features, including a two-way voice assistant and enhanced memory functions for its AI. The company announced a five-year, $100 million partnership with Databricks to develop corporate AI agents. Concurrently, Anthropic is expanding its operations into the Asia-Pacific region, with plans to establish an office in Korea.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "About one and a half months, as the question deadline is July 1, 2025, and today is May 15, 2025.",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No. Anthropic will continue to operate as a well-funded private company without making any formal announcements about an IPO.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Anthropic's management and board decide that leveraging their existing substantial private funding from partners like Amazon and Google is sufficient for current operational and R&D needs. They prioritize product development and global expansion, viewing the regulatory scrutiny and short-term earnings pressure of a public listing as a distraction in the highly competitive AI landscape. The July 1, 2025 deadline passes without an S-1 filing or a news announcement from the company.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Driven by an urgent need for a massive capital infusion to secure next-generation computing resources or spurred by intense pressure from major investors seeking liquidity, Anthropic's leadership decides to fast-track an IPO. Having worked on the preparations secretly for months, they file an S-1 with the SEC or post an official announcement on their company news site before the deadline.",
    "rationale": "My forecast is based primarily on the extremely short timeframe of approximately six weeks until the resolution date. An initial public offering is a monumental and complex undertaking that typically involves months, if not years, of preparation, including engaging with investment banks, conducting extensive internal audits, and preparing detailed financial disclosures. The process is rarely kept entirely secret, and it is usually preceded by credible media leaks and reports, none of which are currently present for Anthropic.\n\nThe status quo is that Anthropic is a private company that has been highly successful at raising capital from private markets and strategic partners. The information from my research assistant—highlighting product launches, partnerships, and international expansion—paints a picture of a company executing a growth strategy funded by its existing war chest. There is no clear external or internal trigger suggesting an urgent need to pivot to public markets.\n\nMy probability is not lower than 3% because the AI industry is exceptionally volatile and capital-intensive. An unexpected strategic shift or a surprise announcement, while highly improbable, cannot be completely ruled out. The company could have been preparing for this in extreme secrecy.\n\nMy probability is not higher than 3% because the complete absence of any preparatory signals (like hiring bankers or credible rumors), combined with the very short deadline, makes an announcement extremely unlikely. The path of least resistance is for Anthropic to continue its current, well-funded private strategy.\n\nI would increase my forecast if credible reports emerged of Anthropic formally engaging with IPO advisors or investment banks. I would decrease my forecast further if Anthropic were to announce another major private funding round.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nBefore July 1, 2025, will Anthropic announce that it is planning an IPO?\n\nQuestion background:\nIn its most recent funding talks, Anthropic [floated](https://www.theinformation.com/articles/openai-rival-anthropic-has-floated-40-billion-valuation-in-early-talks-about-new-funding) a valuation of $40 billion. Although there has been speculation that the company could IPO, nothing concrete has been announced yet.\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question will resolve as **Yes** if Anthropic, Inc., announces before July 1, 2025, that it is planning an initial public offering. In order to streamline the resolution of this question, there are two resolution sources for the IPO announcement: 1) The company filing an [SEC Form S-1](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/sec-form-s-1.asp) or 2) An announcement at the [News](https://www.anthropic.com/news) section of its website. If there is no such announcement before that date, this question resolves as **No**.\n\n\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nAnthropic has recently launched its Claude 3.7 Sonnet model and is reportedly developing new features, including a two-way voice assistant and enhanced memory functions for its AI. The company announced a five-year, $100 million partnership with Databricks to develop corporate AI agents. Concurrently, Anthropic is expanding its operations into the Asia-Pacific region, with plans to establish an office in Korea.\n\nToday is 2025-05-15.\n\nBefore answering you think:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n(e) You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
