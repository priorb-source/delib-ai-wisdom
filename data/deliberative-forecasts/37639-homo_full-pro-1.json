    "review": "The other two forecasters provide analyses that are remarkably similar to my own, leading to a high degree of consensus. We all identify the same key variables: the extended Temporary Restraining Order (TRO) as the primary legal obstacle, the very short timeline until the July 1 deadline, the typical slowness of the U.S. judicial system, and the intense political will from the executive branch as the main driver for a 'Yes' outcome. No new evidence or lines of argument were raised that I had not previously considered. The only difference is Forecaster 2's slightly higher probability of 15% compared to my 10% and Forecaster 3's 10%. This appears to be a minor difference in the subjective weighting of political pressure versus judicial inertia, rather than a fundamental disagreement on the facts. Their analyses powerfully reinforce my initial conclusion that deportation before the deadline is a low-probability event.",
    "rationale": "After reviewing the other forecasts, I am maintaining my original assessment. The reasoning provided by my peers strongly aligns with and validates my initial analysis. The core of this forecast remains a race between the executive branch's desire for a swift deportation and the judicial branch's procedural slowness, which is currently embodied by a federal court's TRO. The judge's finding that Mahmoud Khalil's claims are 'plausible' establishes a significant legal hurdle that is highly unlikely to be cleared in the less than seven weeks remaining. For a 'Yes' outcome to occur, the federal court would need to quickly deny a preliminary injunction, the appellate court would have to immediately deny a stay, and ICE would have to execute the removal—a chain of events that is improbable, though not impossible, within the given timeframe. The consensus among the forecasters strengthens my confidence that the procedural barriers and the short timeline are the dominant factors. The 5% difference between my forecast and Forecaster 2's is not substantial enough to warrant a change, as it falls within a reasonable margin of uncertainty for this type of question. My 10% forecast continues to reflect an unlikely but possible outcome driven by extreme political pressure.",
