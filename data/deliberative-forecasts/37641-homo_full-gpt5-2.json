    "review": "Both forecasters’ reasoning closely matches mine. They add two useful nuances: (1) explicitly flagging that a venue switch away from NYSE would resolve this question as No, and (2) tightening the calendar mechanics—an S-1/A with a range by late May/early June is likely necessary to enable a late‑June listing, with minimal slack for additional SEC comments or volatility. I didn’t see any new hard facts; the media signals of a pause, lack of a range/roadshow, and the tight runway are all aligned with my priors. Their triggers for moving probabilities up or down mirror mine and reinforce the baseline that the default outcome is No absent near‑term activation.",
    "rationale": "Status quo remains: filed but not active, no price range or roadshow, and credible reports of a pause. With ~7 weeks left and a likely need for a 1–2 week roadshow plus SEC effectiveness, Circle would need to file a range in the next 1–2 weeks to hit a late‑June pricing and first trade before July 1. That’s feasible but leaves little buffer for market or regulatory hiccups. The added venue nuance (must be NYSE) slightly tilts risk downward versus a generic “public in 1H25” question. Offsetting that, Circle has a complete syndicate, a live S‑1, and could move quickly if conditions stabilize; crypto/Stablecoin sentiment is not outright negative. Net, I keep my estimate unchanged: odds of a rapid flip to active and a successful late‑June NYSE debut are meaningful but not the base case.",
