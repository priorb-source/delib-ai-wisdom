    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "UFC 316 is likely scheduled within the next 1-3 months from May 26, 2025, based on typical UFC event scheduling patterns. The exact date is not provided in the available information.",
    "status_quo_outcome": "The status quo is that the fight proceeds as rebooked at UFC 316 between Joe Pyfer and his opponent (likely Kelvin Gastelum based on the article), and the bout is completed with a definitive result.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Joe Pyfer does not fight at UFC 316 due to injury, weight miss, or another last-minute cancellation. Alternatively, Pyfer fights but loses via decision, knockout, or submission. Given this is already a rebooked fight after a Mexico cancellation, there's elevated risk of another disruption.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Joe Pyfer fights as scheduled at UFC 316 against his opponent (likely Kelvin Gastelum) and wins via decision, knockout, technical knockout, or submission. Pyfer is a rising middleweight prospect who could reasonably defeat a declining veteran like Gastelum.",
    "rationale": "This forecast requires estimating two independent probabilities: (1) whether the fight happens at all, and (2) whether Pyfer wins if it does happen. For fight completion: UFC fights have historical cancellation rates of 15-25%, but this is already a rebooked fight which introduces uncertainty. The fact it was cancelled once in Mexico suggests some instability, though the rebooking indicates commitment. I estimate ~75-80% probability the fight happens. For win probability: Without detailed current form data, but knowing Pyfer is mentioned as facing Kelvin Gastelum (a veteran who has been declining), I'd estimate Pyfer has approximately 55-65% chance of winning if the fight occurs. Gastelum's recent record shows vulnerabilities, while Pyfer represents younger, rising talent. Combined probability: 0.77 × 0.60 = ~46%. This forecast is not higher because: (1) significant cancellation risk exists, especially for an already-rebooked fight, (2) even skilled fighters lose roughly 40-50% of competitive matchups, (3) limited specific information about current conditions. It's not lower because: (1) the fight appears officially booked, (2) Pyfer appears to be favored if fighting a declining Gastelum, (3) UFC typically follows through with rebooked fights. I would update higher with: confirmation of fight date, positive news about both fighters' health, favorable betting odds for Pyfer. I would update lower with: injury reports, weight cut issues, news of another postponement, or information suggesting Pyfer is actually facing a tougher opponent.",
