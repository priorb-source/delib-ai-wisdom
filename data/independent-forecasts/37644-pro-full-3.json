  "information": "In March 2025, Anthropic raised approximately $3.5 billion in a funding round that valued the company at around $61.5 billion, up from $16 billion a year prior. Key investors in this and other recent rounds include Amazon (access to $8 billion), Google (over $3 billion invested), Lightspeed Venture Partners, Salesforce Ventures, and Fidelity Management & Research Co. Analysts have noted that the company's access to deep private funding from strategic partners lowers its immediate need for capital.\n\nAnthropic has recently launched its Claude 3.7 Sonnet model and is reportedly developing new features, including a two-way voice assistant and enhanced memory functions for its AI. The company announced a five-year, $100 million partnership with Databricks to develop corporate AI agents. Concurrently, Anthropic is expanding its operations into the Asia-Pacific region, with plans to establish an office in Korea.\n\nThe typical process for an initial public offering of this size involves preparatory steps that have not been publicly observed for Anthropic. There have been no reports or leaks to major financial news outlets like Reuters, the Wall Street Journal, or Bloomberg about the company hiring investment banks or filing a confidential S-1 form. Among U.S. venture-backed companies valued at over $10 billion (decacorns), the base rate for going public is approximately one to two companies per year.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Approximately 1.5 months, until the deadline of July 1, 2025.",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No. Anthropic will continue its operations as a heavily-capitalized private company and will not make a formal IPO announcement by the deadline.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Anthropic continues to leverage its substantial private funding from strategic partners like Amazon and Google. The company remains focused on research, product development, and its international expansion, seeing no immediate pressure or need to tap the public markets for capital. The July 1, 2025 deadline passes without an S-1 filing or an announcement on its official news page.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Driven by intense investor desire for liquidity and a belief that the current market window for AI stocks is too good to pass up, Anthropic's board makes a surprise decision to go public. Having worked confidentially with investment banks, the company either files an S-1 or posts a formal announcement of its IPO plans on its website before July 1, 2025.",
    "rationale": "My forecast is heavily weighted towards a 'No' outcome, primarily based on the status quo and the lack of preparatory evidence. Firstly, Anthropic has no apparent urgent need for capital, which is the primary driver for an IPO. The company has raised massive sums from private investors, including strategic partners like Amazon and Google who are likely more interested in long-term technology access than short-term liquidity. Secondly, an IPO for a company of Anthropic's scale ($61.5B valuation) is a complex, lengthy process. The research report notes an absence of public signals, such as leaks to major financial news outlets about hiring investment banks or filing a confidential S-1. With only about six weeks remaining until the deadline, it is highly improbable that these crucial steps could be initiated and an announcement made. The base rate for decacorns going public is also very low, reinforcing the idea that remaining private is the default path. My probability is not lower than 3% because the AI market is exceptionally volatile and fast-moving. A surprise announcement, driven by a sudden change in market conditions or competitive pressure, cannot be entirely ruled out. The resolution criteria only require an announcement, not the IPO itself, which lowers the bar for a 'Yes' outcome. My forecast is not higher because the evidence against an imminent IPO is substantial, including the recent large funding round, the lack of public filings or reports, and the short time frame. To increase my forecast, I would need to see credible reports from outlets like Bloomberg or Reuters of Anthropic hiring bankers for an IPO or confidentially filing its S-1. As time passes without such news, my confidence in a 'No' outcome will increase.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nBefore July 1, 2025, will Anthropic announce that it is planning an IPO?\n\nQuestion background:\nIn its most recent funding talks, Anthropic [floated](https://www.theinformation.com/articles/openai-rival-anthropic-has-floated-40-billion-valuation-in-early-talks-about-new-funding) a valuation of $40 billion. Although there has been speculation that the company could IPO, nothing concrete has been announced yet.\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question will resolve as **Yes** if Anthropic, Inc., announces before July 1, 2025, that it is planning an initial public offering. In order to streamline the resolution of this question, there are two resolution sources for the IPO announcement: 1) The company filing an [SEC Form S-1](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/sec-form-s-1.asp) or 2) An announcement at the [News](https://www.anthropic.com/news) section of its website. If there is no such announcement before that date, this question resolves as **No**.\n\n\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nIn March 2025, Anthropic raised approximately $3.5 billion in a funding round that valued the company at around $61.5 billion, up from $16 billion a year prior.

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
