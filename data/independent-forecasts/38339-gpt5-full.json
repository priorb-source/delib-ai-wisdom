  "information": "The 13-year gas transmission agreement between Bulgaria’s state-owned gas company Bulgargaz and Turkey’s BOTAŞ was signed in January 2023. The contract includes a 'take or pay' clause, obligating Bulgargaz to pay approximately $580,000 per day regardless of whether it uses the reserved capacity. Since July 2024, Bulgargaz has ceased payments, accumulating a debt reported to be around 4 billion leva (approximately €2 billion). Bulgarian officials have stated the company does not have the financial capacity to pay this debt, and Bulgargaz reportedly expects to incur a loss of 280 million leva in 2024.\n\nBulgarian Prime Minister Boyko Borissov has publicly stated to Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan that 'Bulgaria Needs Out of the Botas Gas Deal.' Former Bulgarian Deputy Energy Minister Zhecho Stankov stated that termination of the contract is blocked until the outstanding debt is fully settled. Despite the public statements, talks between the two countries as of May 2, 2025, focused on price and capacity renegotiation rather than outright cancellation. Turkey has publicly maintained a stance of viewing Bulgaria as a strategic partner and has opposed cancellation.\n\nIn early June 2025, Russian energy company Gazprom abandoned its plan to build a major gas distribution hub in Turkey. Reports cited insufficient pipeline capacity from Turkey to Greece and Bulgaria as a key reason for the project's lack of feasibility. Separately, Bulgaria has pursued other energy initiatives, signing gas exploration and drilling agreements with Shell and NewMed for blocks in the Black Sea. Bulgaria also has reserved 1 billion cubic meters of gas per year from the Alexandroupolis LNG terminal in Greece.",

    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "About 25 days (until 2025-07-01)",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No — the agreement is not cancelled; arrears, negotiations, and political pressure continue without an outright termination announcement.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Bulgaria and Turkey announce ongoing talks on price/capacity, possibly an interim arrangement, payment plan, or arbitration steps. Bulgargaz continues to delay payments, but neither side issues a formal termination notice. Political leaders keep criticizing the deal but stop short of cancelling it.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Either (a) Bulgaria/Bulgargaz unilaterally announces termination citing impossibility, public-interest grounds, or alleged illegality; or (b) BOTAŞ terminates for breach due to prolonged non-payment. Even if the other party disputes it, a public termination announcement before July 1, 2025 would resolve Yes.",
    "rationale": "- Timeframe is short. There are ~25 days left for a formal termination announcement.\n- Status quo favors persistence. Long-term energy contracts with take-or-pay clauses are rarely cancelled abruptly; they are typically renegotiated or litigated. Talks reportedly center on price and capacity revisions, not outright cancellation.\n- Contractual and financial constraints. The deal reportedly contains a take-or-pay obligation (~$580k/day). Bulgargaz halted payments since July 2024 and allegedly owes ~4 bn leva (~€2 bn). A former deputy energy minister said termination is blocked until arrears are settled, implying Bulgaria has weak leverage to cancel without first addressing debt, which the government says it cannot presently pay.\n- Incentives. Turkey benefits from keeping the contract alive to preserve claims on arrears and future payments; cancellation would risk weakening that leverage. Bulgaria signals it “needs out,” but the immediate costs (termination penalties, arbitration risk, supply security) make a pre–July 1 cancellation less likely than continued negotiation.\n- Recent context. Gazprom’s scrapped Turkish hub removes one strategic angle but doesn’t directly compel BOTAŞ to terminate. Bulgaria’s diversification (Alexandroupolis LNG, Black Sea exploration) helps medium-term leverage but is unlikely to catalyze a clean cancellation within weeks.\n- Why not higher? Because there is no public indication that either side is preparing a formal termination notice; both sides publicly stress partnership/renegotiation. Legal/financial barriers are significant and rapid resolution is improbable.\n- Why not lower? The arrears and Bulgargaz’s stressed finances create real tail risk. A political decision in Sofia to force the issue, or a BOTAŞ termination for non-payment, could still happen on short notice. Public rhetoric has escalated, so a tactical unilateral announcement to reset negotiations is not impossible.\n- What would move me up: credible reporting of cabinet approval to cancel; issuance/leak of a termination notice; Turkey/BOTAŞ announcing termination for breach; failure of talks plus explicit statements that cancellation is imminent; Bulgaria securing firm alternative supply cover enabling a hard break.\n- What would move me down: announcement of an interim addendum, standstill, payment schedule, or debt restructuring; EU/IMF or state support that keeps the contract in place; clear statements from both parties ruling out termination this month.",

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any).
