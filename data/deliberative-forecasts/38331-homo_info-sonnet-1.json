    "review": "Forecaster 3 raises a crucial methodological point that I underweighted: this is a conjunctive question requiring ALL seven countries to maintain blocks. While Forecaster 2 and I both emphasized the status quo and short timeframe (arriving at 92-93%), we didn't explicitly model the multiplicative risk. Forecaster 3's approach of estimating individual country probabilities and multiplying them is statistically sound. The key insight about Venezuela's 'historical variability' in enforcement is particularly important - if true, this creates more risk than I initially considered. However, I question whether complete independence is the right assumption, and I believe Forecaster 3 may be slightly too conservative on Russia (given ongoing Ukraine tensions) and Turkmenistan (extremely stable authoritarian regime). The conjunctive framework fundamentally changes the analysis from 'will the status quo hold?' to 'will the status quo hold in ALL seven cases simultaneously?' This distinction significantly lowers the appropriate probability.",
    "rationale": "After reviewing the other forecasts, I'm updating my analysis to better account for the conjunctive nature of this question. My initial 93% treated this too much as a single question about whether censorship regimes generally maintain stability over 26 days. The correct framework is: what's the probability that ALL seven countries individually maintain their blocks? Let me estimate individual probabilities: China (99.5% - rock-solid censorship apparatus), Iran (99% - deeply entrenched block since 2009), North Korea (99.5% - essentially no public internet access), Russia (98.5% - block tied to Ukraine conflict, highly unlikely to reverse), Turkmenistan (98.5% - stable authoritarian censorship), Myanmar (95% - military junta control but some political fluidity), Venezuela (91% - concerning note about 'historical variability' in enforcement, though still likely to maintain given Maduro's control and 26-day timeframe). Multiplying these yields approximately 83.5%. However, I'm adjusting slightly upward to 86% because: (1) the 26-day timeframe is exceptionally short for any policy reversal, (2) there are no current signals of policy changes in any of these countries, (3) there may be some positive correlation between these regimes' decisions (they're all authoritarian/semi-authoritarian with similar incentives), making the independence assumption slightly conservative. I'm not going lower because even Venezuela and Myanmar, the weakest links, would need to act within just 26 days with no advance signals.",
