    "review": "Forecaster 2 provides crucial new details I hadn't considered: the contract was signed only in January 2023 (making it quite new), has take-or-pay obligations of ~$580k/day, and most significantly, Bulgargaz ceased payments in July 2024 with arrears now reaching ~€2 billion. This paints a much more acute crisis than I initially understood - 11 months of complete non-payment on a 13-year contract is extraordinary. Forecaster 3 adds important context about Bulgaria's improved energy security position (LNG terminal access, Black Sea exploration) that strengthens their negotiating position and reduces dependence on the Turkish route. Both forecasters converge around 20-22%, slightly above my 18%. The key insight from Forecaster 2 that challenges my thinking is: if BOTAS hasn't terminated after 11 months of zero payments, this suggests either they prefer holding the contract for leverage or believe renegotiation is more profitable than termination. This reinforces inertia but also shows how broken the relationship is. Forecaster 3's point about diplomatic fallout risk is valid but perhaps overstated given the contract is already functionally dead.",
    "rationale": "Upon review, the new information about the severity of the financial crisis (€2b in arrears over 11 months of non-payment) does make cancellation more plausible than I initially estimated. This is not a minor commercial dispute - the contract is already fundamentally broken. Bulgaria's improved energy security position also removes one barrier to cancellation. However, the time constraint remains decisive: only 25 days until resolution, and there's no clear trigger event on the horizon. The fact that neither party has formally terminated despite 11 months of non-payment actually reinforces that both sides prefer the current standstill to formal rupture. BOTAS could have terminated for cause months ago but hasn't, suggesting they believe maintaining the contract (even with non-payment) serves their interests better than cancellation. The convergence of forecasts at 18-22% appears justified. I'm revising upward from 18% to 20% to account for the more severe crisis than I initially understood, while maintaining that the short timeline and entrenched inertia make cancellation unlikely in the next 25 days.",
