  "information": "U.S. President Donald Trump has postponed the implementation of a 50% tariff on goods from the European Union, moving the deadline from June 1 to July 9, 2025. The delay came after a request from European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen, who stated more time was needed for negotiations. U.S. officials have expressed frustration with the EU's cautious approach and lack of specific proposals in the trade talks. A key U.S. demand for a new trade agreement is a commitment from the EU to impose tariffs on Chinese industrial goods, which has not yet been agreed to.\n\nDomestically, U.S. tariff policy has drawn media commentary. The New York Post's editorial board warned of 'tariff burnout' among President Trump's supporters due to inconsistent implementation. The Wall Street Journal's editorial board has also criticized the tariffs, suggesting they would primarily benefit lobbyists and could be used by politicians to leverage campaign contributions. Internationally, Vietnam is reportedly fast-tracking a $1.5 billion Trump golf resort, a move linked to efforts to secure a new trade agreement with the U.S. and avoid potential tariffs as a 90-day pause on trade levies approaches its end.\n\nThe discussions around U.S. tariff policy have had observable economic effects. President Trump's announcement to delay the EU tariffs led to a positive shift in market sentiment and a surge in U.S. stock futures. In early April 2025, after the signing of an executive order for a 10% 'minimum benchmark tariff', there were reports of U.S. consumers stockpiling goods in anticipation of price increases. According to an estimate by the Tax Foundation, the proposed tariffs could cost U.S. households an additional $830 in 2025, reduce the nation's GDP by 0.4%, and result in the loss of 350,000 jobs.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "36 days remaining in the resolution window (May 27 - June 30, 2025)",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No - tariffs remain on both front pages throughout the period",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Tariffs continue to dominate front page coverage due to: the approaching July 9 EU tariff deadline (just after the window closes), ongoing trade negotiations with multiple countries, the ending of 90-day tariff pauses, continued economic impacts being reported, and Trump's active use of tariffs as a central policy tool. Both NYT and WSJ maintain coverage given the economic and political significance.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "A major non-tariff story (international crisis, domestic political scandal, natural disaster, or significant breakthrough in another area) dominates both newspapers' front pages on the same day. This could occur during a relative lull in tariff news, particularly in early-to-mid June after the June 1 EU deadline was postponed to July 9, creating a temporary gap where other stories take priority.",
    "rationale": "The core challenge is that BOTH papers must omit 'tariff/tariffs' on the SAME day. While the 35-day window provides multiple opportunities, several factors strongly favor continued coverage: (1) The EU tariff deadline of July 9 falls just after the resolution window, meaning June will see intensive coverage of those negotiations; (2) Multiple 90-day tariff pauses are ending soon, requiring policy decisions; (3) The research shows tariffs are having major economic impacts ($830/household, 350K jobs at risk) that warrant sustained coverage; (4) Trump remains actively engaged in tariff policy as a central tool; (5) Both NYT and WSJ prioritize economic/business news, making it unlikely both simultaneously deprioritize such a significant ongoing story.\n\nThe mention of 'tariff burnout' is noteworthy but likely reflects public sentiment more than editorial judgment to reduce coverage of consequential policy. The postponement of the June 1 EU deadline to July 9 might create a brief lull in early June, but negotiations will continue and likely generate front-page stories.\n\nFor the probability to be higher (20%+), I would need evidence of: significant de-escalation in trade tensions, Trump shifting focus away from tariffs, or multiple other dominant stories emerging. For it to be lower (5% or below), I would need confirmation that major tariff announcements are scheduled throughout June.\n\nGiven the sustained nature of this policy story, multiple upcoming deadlines, and the requirement for both papers to omit coverage simultaneously, I estimate a low but non-negligible probability around 12%.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill the word \"tariff\" disappear from the front pages of The New York Times and Wall Street Journal before July 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nWhether reading the newspaper or social media or watching the news, it is highly likely you are going to see something about tariffs - mainly due to US President Donald Trump's [renewed love](https://www.france24.com/en/live-news/20250401-tariff-man-trump-s-long-history-with-trade-wars) for this somewhat antiquated form of taxation.\r\n\r\nThe New York Times and the Wall Street Journal are two of the largest print newspapers in the US.
