    "review": "The other forecasters and I agree on the core evidence: strong media reporting, significant fundraising, staff expansion, and succession planning all point to an imminent announcement. Forecaster 2's 65% seems overly cautious, placing too much weight on weak negative signals like the lack of an exploratory committee filing, which is not a required precursor to a campaign launch. Forecaster 3's analysis at 77% was more compelling. I found two of their points particularly insightful. First, they noted the end-of-month fundraising deadline, which provides a strong strategic incentive for Stevens to announce *before* May 1 to capitalize on the launch buzz. This strengthens the case for 'Yes'. Second, they articulated concrete reasons for a short delay, such as venue scheduling or endorsement sequencing, which provides a plausible mechanism for a 'No' resolution even if Stevens fully intends to run.",
    "rationale": "My initial forecast of 90% was based on the overwhelming strength of the costly signals Stevens has already made (fundraising, staffing, planning for her House replacement), which indicate a firm decision to run. The deliberation has introduced two valuable, countervailing points, primarily from Forecaster 3. The strategic importance of announcing before the end-of-month fundraising deadline reinforces my belief that the campaign has a strong incentive to meet the timeline. However, the explicit mention of plausible logistical reasons for a short delay (e.g., a venue issue pushing an announcement from late April into the first days of May) is a risk I had not fully weighted. A delay of just a few days would flip the outcome of this question. This possibility of mundane friction causing the announcement to slip just past the deadline warrants a slight decrease in my confidence. I am therefore making a small downward adjustment to my forecast from 90% to 88%, acknowledging this newfound uncertainty while still reflecting the extremely high likelihood of a 'Yes' outcome based on the powerful positive evidence.",
