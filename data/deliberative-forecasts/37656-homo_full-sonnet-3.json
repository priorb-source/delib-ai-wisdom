    "review": "All three forecasts converge tightly in the 25-32% range, suggesting strong agreement on the key factors. The most compelling shared insight is that the 14-day delay between the executive order (May 2) and the current 'in progress' status (May 16) reveals the tracker maintainers' standards - if they considered an executive order alone sufficient for 'complete,' they likely would have updated by now. Forecaster 2 makes an excellent point about legal challenges typically requiring months or years to resolve, strengthening the case that resolution is unlikely within the 45-day window. Forecaster 3's emphasis on status quo bias and that funding continues to flow legally through 2027 reinforces why 'in progress' is the more probable outcome. All three correctly identify that we're essentially forecasting both the tracker maintainers' subjective criteria AND whether the political/legal situation will reach whatever threshold they require - a double uncertainty that keeps probabilities moderate.",
    "rationale": "Upon reflection, I should weight the 14-day delay more heavily than I initially did. This temporal evidence is our strongest signal about the maintainers' standards. If they were inclined to mark policy attempts as 'complete' regardless of implementation, they've had ample opportunity. The combination of: (1) no update despite 14 days passing, (2) legal challenges that typically take months/years, (3) Congressional appropriations already locked in through 2027, and (4) only 45 days remaining, all point toward 'in progress' remaining the status through July 1. However, I maintain meaningful probability (around 26%) for a 'complete' designation because executive orders can trigger quick policy changes in some cases, the maintainers could update their interpretation at any time, and we cannot be certain of their exact criteria. The narrow range across all forecasts (25-32%) suggests we've identified the key considerations. I'm updating slightly downward from 28% to 26% to give more weight to the informative 14-day delay and Forecaster 2's point about slow-moving legal processes.",
