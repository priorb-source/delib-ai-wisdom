    "review": "The other forecasters' analyses are well-reasoned and align closely with my own. All three of us correctly identified the critical resolution detail that suspension status doesn't affect the outcome - only whether the 31% rate is listed matters. Forecaster 2 raised an excellent point I should emphasize more: governments typically modify suspension status rather than underlying HTS entries during negotiation periods. This is a procedural insight that strengthens the YES case, as it suggests the administrative path of least resistance is to maintain the listing while adjusting suspension timing. Forecaster 3's observation about mid-negotiation policy changes potentially undermining negotiating position is also valuable - removing the tariff listing before negotiations conclude would essentially be a unilateral concession. However, I notice we're all clustering around 85-87%, which makes me question if we're sufficiently accounting for tail risks. The consensus could reflect groupthink, or it could reflect that we've correctly identified the strong status quo bias.",
    "rationale": "After reviewing the other analyses, I'm maintaining my forecast. The convergence around 85-87% appears justified rather than being groupthink because: (1) The status quo already satisfies the YES criteria - the 31% is currently listed in the HTS; (2) The suspension mechanism was specifically designed to preserve the listing during negotiations, not to facilitate early removal; (3) Only 38 days remain, which is a short window for formal HTS modifications that typically require administrative processes; (4) The procedural norm of modifying suspension status rather than underlying entries during negotiations strongly favors maintaining the current listing. The ~13-15% probability I'm assigning to NO reflects genuine but limited risks: unexpectedly rapid negotiations, political pressure for early reversal, or administrative decisions to preemptively modify the listing. These risks are real but constrained by timing, bureaucratic inertia, and strategic negotiation considerations. I'm not increasing my forecast to 90%+ because the Trump administration has demonstrated capacity for rapid policy shifts, and 38 days provides enough time for significant changes if political will exists. I'm not decreasing below 85% because the baseline scenario of no change is very strong.",
