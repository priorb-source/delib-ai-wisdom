    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "2 months. The question resolves on July 1, 2025.",
    "status_quo_outcome": "Yes. The political climate following the December 2024 martial law declaration is highly volatile. This makes continued large-scale protests, continuing the trend from early 2025, the most likely scenario.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "The political crisis de-escalates significantly before May 2025. The government and opposition reach a stable compromise, and protest movements are unable to mobilize more than 10,000 participants for any single event during the May-June period.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Sustained public anger over the martial law incident, or a new political trigger, leads to at least one mass demonstration organized by civic groups or labor unions in a major city, with attendance exceeding 10,000 people, which is then reported by the tracker.",
    "rationale": "My forecast is primarily based on the extraordinary political context provided: a martial law declaration in South Korea in December 2024, which reportedly led to a surge in anti-government protests. Such a severe challenge to democratic norms would almost certainly create a protracted period of political instability and public anger, making large-scale demonstrations highly likely to continue for many months.\n\nSouth Korea has a well-documented history of powerful, well-organized protest movements that can rapidly mobilize large crowds. The threshold of 10,000 participants is relatively modest for a national-level issue in a country with this civic tradition; major protests in Seoul frequently surpass this number. The provided information is the only basis for this forecast, as my research assistant reported no additional details.\n\nMy probability is not higher because the two-month window is relatively short. It is possible the peak of protest activity occurred earlier in the year and public fatigue could have set in. The specific May-June 2025 period could fall between major waves of mobilization.\n\nMy probability is not lower because the gravity of a martial law declaration is a powerful and enduring catalyst for protest. It is unlikely that such profound public anger would completely dissipate within five months. The status quo is one of heightened unrest, and absent evidence of a successful political resolution, further large protests are the default expectation. I would raise my forecast if there were specific reports of major rallies being planned for May or June. I would lower it upon news of a widely accepted political settlement.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill the Global Protest Tracker report any protests in South Korea with 10,000+ participants, before July 1, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nACLED December 2024: [South Korea: Anti-government protests surge following martial law declaration](https://acleddata.com/2025/01/15/asia-pacific-overview-january-2025/#keytrends6)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if the [Global Protest Tracker](https://carnegieendowment.org/features/global-protest-tracker?lang=en) reports a protest in South Korea with 10,000 or more participants with a start date after the launch of this question and before July 1, 2025.\n\n\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nNo additional information available.\n\nToday is 2025-05-01.\n\nBefore answering you think:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n(e) You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
