  "information": "The incumbent Senator, Pete Ricketts, is expected to seek re-election in 2026. Former President Donald Trump endorsed Ricketts for his reelection bid on April 11, 2025, calling Osborn a \"Radical Left Open Border Extremist\" while praising Ricketts. Ricketts is the seventh richest member of Congress and has a significant political and financial operation in Nebraska. Osborn runs as an independent but received support from the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee during his 2024 campaign.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Approximately 39 days until June 1, 2025",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No - Dan Osborn has not announced his candidacy",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Osborn's exploratory process takes longer than 5-6 weeks to conclude, he decides the race isn't winnable given Ricketts' resources and Trump's endorsement, or he chooses to wait until later in 2025 to make his announcement for strategic reasons closer to the 2026 election cycle",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Osborn's exploratory committee quickly concludes its assessment of viability, finds sufficient grassroots support and potential funding sources, and he announces his candidacy in May 2025 to gain early momentum and media attention before the summer",
    "rationale": "The key information is that as of April 3, 2025, Osborn was 'exploring' a midterm bid, meaning he's in an active decision-making phase but hasn't committed. We're now about 20 days into that exploration with 39 days remaining until the deadline. Typical exploratory phases can range from a few weeks to several months. Factors favoring announcement: (1) He's actively exploring, indicating serious interest, (2) 39 days provides sufficient time for decision-making, (3) Trump's April 11 endorsement of Ricketts clarifies the race dynamics, (4) Osborn showed viability in his 2024 campaign. Factors against announcement: (1) Status quo bias strongly favors no change - he hasn't announced yet, and most things that haven't happened tend not to happen, (2) It's extremely early for a November 2026 election (19 months out), so there's no urgency, (3) Exploratory phases often extend beyond 2 months, (4) Ricketts' significant wealth and political infrastructure may discourage entry, (5) He may decide to announce later or not run at all. The forecast would increase with reports of fundraising success, endorsements, or campaign infrastructure building. It would decrease with reports of difficulty raising money, lukewarm reception, or Osborn focusing on other activities. Given the strong status quo bias and the very early timing for a 2026 race, but balanced against active exploration and a reasonable timeframe, I estimate a moderate probability.",
