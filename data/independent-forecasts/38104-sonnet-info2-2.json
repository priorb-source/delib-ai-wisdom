  "information": "A multi-agency manhunt is underway, involving over 200 officers from local, state, and federal bodies, including the FBI, U.S. Marshals, and the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives (ATF). The reward for information leading to the capture of the two remaining fugitives has been increased to $50,000 per person, with funds contributed by Crimestoppers, the FBI, and the ATF. As of late May 2025, law enforcement had received nearly 700 tips from the public. In connection with the escape and subsequent aid to the fugitives, at least 14 accomplices have been arrested, including family members of one of the escapees.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "32 days (from May 30, 2025 to July 1, 2025)",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No - As of late May 2025, 2 of the 10 escapees remain at large. If nothing changes and these 2 fugitives are not captured or killed by July 1, the question resolves as No.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "At least one of the two remaining fugitives successfully evades the manhunt through July 1, 2025, either by hiding effectively, fleeing the region, or otherwise staying ahead of law enforcement despite the intensive search efforts.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Both remaining fugitives are captured or killed within the next 32 days. The massive law enforcement effort, substantial reward money, high volume of public tips, and disruption of their support network lead to successful apprehension of both individuals before the deadline.",
    "rationale": "The key evidence includes: (1) Strong progress already made - 8 of 10 escapees recaptured shows effective pursuit; (2) Substantial resources deployed - 200+ officers, FBI, U.S. Marshals, ATF involvement; (3) High financial incentive - $50,000 per fugitive; (4) Public engagement - nearly 700 tips received; (5) Support network disrupted - 14 accomplices arrested. However, important countervailing factors include: The remaining 2 have evaded capture for approximately 2 weeks already, suggesting they may be more resourceful or have better hiding arrangements than those already caught. Historical patterns show most jail escapees are captured quickly, but some can remain at large for extended periods. The 32-day window is meaningful but not extremely long. The status quo (2 at large) would result in No, but the significant law enforcement resources and momentum suggest better than even odds both will be caught. The last fugitives are often the hardest to apprehend - they may be the most careful or have the best support. My forecast is not higher (e.g., 80%+) because: 32 days is a relatively short window, these 2 have already proven elusive, and even with massive resources, some fugitives do evade capture for months. My forecast is not lower (e.g., 30-40%) because: the resources deployed are exceptional, the reward is substantial, 80% capture rate achieved already shows effective operations, and the support network is being systematically dismantled. I would update higher if: news reports additional captures of accomplices, credible sightings emerge, or one of the two is captured soon. I would update lower if: we reach mid-June with no progress, or evidence emerges they've left the region.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill all 10 inmates who escaped from jail in New Orleans on May 16, 2025 be recaptured before July 1, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\n[Manhunt continues Monday for 7 Orleans jail escapees as state launches investigation](https://www.fox8live.com/2025/05/19/manhunt-continues-monday-7-orleans-jail-escapees-state-launches-investigation/)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if before July 1, 2025, all 10 inmates who escaped from jail in the [2025 New Orleans jailbreak](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2025_New_Orleans_jailbreak) have been either recaptured or killed, according to [credible sources](https://www.metaculus.com/faq/#definitions). If any are still at large on July 1, 2025, then the question resolves as **No**.\n\n\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nA multi-agency manhunt is underway, involving over 200 officers from local, state, and federal bodies, including the FBI, U.S. Marshals, and the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives (ATF).

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
