    "review": "Both forecasters largely mirror my priors: small status-quo edge for Milei, slow MC movements, and meaningful tie-as-No risk. New emphasis I noted: the explicit comparison to AMLO’s sustained high approvals (supporting Sheinbaum’s stickiness) and the concrete risk factors for Milei (currency wobble/financial stress) versus short-term tailwinds (disinflation, possible legislative wins). Neither adds decisive new evidence beyond what I already weighted. The timing nuance (MC weekly cadence; check on/after June 28) and rounding/tie dynamics are aligned with my initial framing.",
    "rationale": "Given the current 1-point lead (61 vs. 60), short horizon (~6 weeks), and typical MC week-to-week changes of a few points at most, the baseline slightly favors Milei. However, the tie-as-No rule meaningfully compresses that edge, especially with rounding and normal sampling noise. Fundamentals look mixed-to-slightly-positive for Milei (ongoing disinflation and potential legislative progress) and stable-to-slightly-sticky for Sheinbaum around ~60%. The other forecasters’ arguments reinforce, rather than shift, this balance. Without fresh MC updates or clear macro/political shocks, I keep a modest Yes lean. I would update up if Milei’s lead widens to 2–3 points in MC or Argentina posts widely perceived wins; I would update down if the series shows parity/Sheinbaum ahead, or if Argentina experiences negative economic/political headlines. Net: no material change to my estimate.",
