  "information": "Alberta Premier Danielle Smith has stated that her government will permit a citizen-led referendum on independence in 2026 if a public petition gathers sufficient signatures. Smith has personally said she does not support separation but believes the decision should be made by Albertans. To facilitate this process, her government introduced Bill 54, which lowers the threshold for initiating a referendum from 20% to 10% of eligible voters (approximately 177,000 signatures) and extends the time for collection from 90 to 120 days. The government also formed a panel called 'Alberta Next' to explore the province's autonomy and future relationship with the federal government.\n\nThe process for triggering a referendum requires a successful citizen petition. The petition must gather at least 177,000 signatures, which then must be officially verified by Elections Alberta before the government can formally schedule a vote. As of early May 2025, a group named 'Project for Alberta Prosperity' announced its intention to organize a signature collection campaign. Its president claimed they had already exceeded the required signature threshold, while other unverified reports mentioned 80,000 signatures being collected in 36 hours. However, no petition had been formally submitted or certified by Elections Alberta.\n\nThe discussion around a potential referendum occurs amid heightened tensions between Alberta and the federal government over energy policies, the carbon tax, and fiscal distribution, particularly following the re-election of the federal Liberal party. The proposal has faced opposition from within Alberta. Leaders of the Sturgeon Lake and Mikisew Cree Nations have publicly opposed an independence referendum, stating their treaties were with the Crown, not the province. The official provincial opposition, the New Democratic Party of Alberta, has accused Premier Smith of promoting separatism.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Less than 2 months (deadline is July 1, 2025).",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No. The administrative process of collecting, submitting, and verifying petition signatures will not be completed in time for the government to make an announcement before the deadline.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "The 'Project for Alberta Prosperity' continues its signature collection campaign. While they may gather the required number of signatures, the formal submission to Elections Alberta and the subsequent verification process extends beyond the July 1, 2025 deadline. Consequently, the government does not receive a certified petition and does not anounce a referendum date.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "The pro-independence group submits a petition with a large surplus of signatures to Elections Alberta within the next week. Under significant political pressure and public attention, Elections Alberta completes an expedited verification process by mid-June. Premier Smith's government then moves swiftly to officially announce a referendum date right before the July 1, 2025 deadline.",
    "rationale": "My forecast is low primarily due to the extremely compressed timeline. As of May 7, 2025, less than two months remain before the deadline. The process required to trigger a referendum involves several time-consuming administrative steps that have not yet been completed. According to the research, a citizen-led petition must first be submitted to Elections Alberta, which must then verify a minimum of approximately 177,000 signatures. To date, no petition has been formally submitted.\n\nThe verification of signatures is a significant bureaucratic hurdle. It is highly improbable that Elections Alberta could receive, process, and certify a petition of this magnitude in the few weeks remaining before July 1. This administrative drag is the most significant barrier to a 'Yes' outcome.\n\nFurthermore, Premier Smith's position is nuanced; she supports the right for a citizen-led referendum but not separation itself. This suggests she lacks the political motivation to expend capital on rushing the process or pressuring an independent body like Elections Alberta to accelerate its work. The status quo, where the process unfolds at its natural pace, is the most likely path and that path extends beyond the question's deadline.\n\nMy forecast is not lower than 5% because the political environment is volatile, and the enabling legislation is already in place. The 'Project for Alberta Prosperity' claims significant momentum. If they were to submit a petition with a massive number of signatures immediately, it could create a black swan event, forcing an unexpectedly rapid response from all parties involved. \n\nMy forecast is not higher than 5% because the logistical and bureaucratic realities present a formidable obstacle that political will is unlikely to overcome in under eight weeks. For me to increase my forecast, I would need to see a petition formally submitted to Elections Alberta by mid-May, coupled with an official statement from Elections Alberta outlining an unprecedented, expedited verification timeline.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nBefore July 1, 2025, will the government of Alberta officially announce a date for an independence referendum?\n\nQuestion background:\nPolitico: [The quiet threat to Canadian unity isn’t Quebec — it’s Alberta](https://www.politico.com/news/2025/04/27/the-quiet-threat-to-canadian-unity-isnt-quebec-its-alberta-00311719)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if, before July 1, 2025, a referendum on the independence of Alberta from Canada is officially scheduled. If this does not occur before that date, this question resolves as **No**.\n\nFor purposes of this question, the referendum will be considered \"officially scheduled\" when it is announced by a person or entity with the authority to do so within Alberta. Please note that broader legality, such as within Canada, will be considered irrelevant for this question, so if the federal government declared the referendum illegal, the question would still resolve as Yes.\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nAlberta Premier Danielle Smith has stated that her government will permit a citizen-led referendum on independence in 2026 if a public petition gathers sufficient signatures.

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
