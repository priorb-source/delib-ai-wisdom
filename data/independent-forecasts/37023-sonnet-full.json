  "information": "The preliminary University of Michigan Consumer Sentiment Index for April 2025 was 50.8, the second-lowest level since records began in 1952. This represented the fourth consecutive monthly decline, a drop of 11% from the March 2025 reading of 57.0, and a cumulative decline of over 30% since December 2024. According to Surveys of Consumers Director Joanne Hsu, the decline was 'pervasive and unanimous across age, income, education, geographic region, and political affiliation.'\n\nMultiple reports highlighted significant macroeconomic concerns. Year-ahead inflation expectations rose to 6.7%, the highest level recorded since 1981, with consumers widely citing worries about tariffs. The share of consumers expecting unemployment to rise increased for the fifth consecutive month, reaching its highest point since 2009. Concurrently, the Conference Board’s Leading Economic Indicators registered four consecutive monthly drops. Policy uncertainty was also a factor, with ongoing tariff implementation, market volatility, and potential changes in Federal Reserve leadership.\n\nSpecific industries and markets have shown negative reactions to the economic climate. Moody's Ratings downgraded the retail industry's outlook to 'negative' due to 'bleak' prospects amid the ongoing trade war, predicting that tariffs will harm profitability and raise consumer prices. In response to tariffs, Volkswagen has implemented an 'import surcharge', and companies like Temu, Shein, and Hermès announced price increases. The financial markets have also been volatile, with the S&P 500 Index falling significantly after the tariff announcement. Separately, the U.S. beef industry has expressed concern that poor consumer sentiment could negatively impact demand.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Approximately 17-18 days. The preliminary University of Michigan Consumer Sentiment Index for May 2025 is typically released around the second Friday of May, which would be around May 9, 2025.",
    "status_quo_outcome": "NO - May 2025 sentiment will remain at or below 50.8. The status quo strongly favors continued depressed sentiment given the ongoing downward trend and deteriorating fundamentals.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Consumer sentiment remains at or below 50.8 as tariff concerns persist, inflation expectations stay elevated at 6.7%, unemployment fears continue rising, and economic uncertainty remains high. The downward momentum continues with no material improvement in consumer outlook, particularly if markets remain volatile and policy uncertainty persists regarding trade and Federal Reserve leadership.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Consumer sentiment rises above 50.8 if there's a positive shock such as tariff rollbacks or suspensions, a significant stock market recovery, moderation in inflation expectations, or clear policy resolution that reduces uncertainty. Sentiment could also bounce if the April reading represented an overshoot and consumers adjust their expectations upward in response to stabilizing conditions.",
    "rationale": "The evidence strongly favors a NO outcome. The April 2025 reading of 50.8 represents the second-lowest level on record since 1952, occurring after four consecutive monthly declines and a cumulative 30% drop since December 2024. Critically, the decline was 'pervasive and unanimous across age, income, education, geographic region, and political affiliation,' indicating no demographic segment showing resilience. The fundamentals are severely deteriorated: year-ahead inflation expectations at 6.7% (highest since 1981), unemployment concerns at their highest since 2009, and the Conference Board's Leading Economic Indicators showing four consecutive drops. The underlying causes—tariffs, market volatility, and policy uncertainty—remain unresolved and actively worsening, with retailers facing 'bleak' prospects and companies implementing price increases. Consumer sentiment typically exhibits strong momentum, and sharp declines rarely reverse immediately without clear positive catalysts. However, I'm not assigning an even lower probability because extreme sentiment levels can sometimes mean-revert, approximately 17 days remain before the survey period allowing time for positive developments, and sentiment can be more volatile than underlying fundamentals. A revision higher would require tariff rollbacks, significant market recovery, or major positive policy clarity. A revision lower would follow further tariff escalations, continued market declines, or additional negative economic data. Given the strong negative momentum, absence of clear positive catalysts, and typical persistence of consumer sentiment trends, the probability of May exceeding 50.8 is limited.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill the May 2025 University of Michigan Consumer Sentiment number be greater than it was for April 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nCNN: [US consumer sentiment plummets to second-lowest level on records going back to 1952](https://www.cnn.com/2025/04/11/economy/us-consumer-sentiment-april/index.html)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if the University of Michigan's reported Index of Consumer Sentiment, expected to be located [here](http://www.sca.isr.umich.edu/), is greater than 50.8 for May 2025. Less than or equal to that amount resolves the question as **No**.\n\nPreliminary results are sufficient to resolve the question. If there is any confusion about the number, Metaculus will resolve based on whatever number is posted at [this pdf](http://www.sca.isr.umich.edu/files/tbcics.pdf) that is labelled as May 2025, including preliminary. For example, on April 11, 2025 the number displayed was 50.8 for April 2025 (P).\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nThe preliminary University of Michigan Consumer Sentiment Index for April 2025 was 50.8, the second-lowest level since records began in 1952.

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
