    "review": "All three forecasters identified the same core tension: the historical base rate of presidential pardons (which are typically infrequent and clustered, favoring a 'No' outcome) versus Donald Trump's unique political style, his demonstrated willingness to use clemency, and the low threshold of the question (favoring a 'Yes' outcome). Forecaster 2's point about the first-term average of ~5 clemencies per month, while lumpy, was a useful piece of data I hadn't explicitly quantified; it suggests that a month with 3+ grants is not an extreme statistical outlier for a Trump presidency. Forecaster 3 provided a very well-structured analysis that mirrored my own but added a valuable point about the potential for Trump to use pardons to strategically create a news cycle, providing a non-holiday-related trigger for a June batch. Both sets of reasoning were highly convincing and highlighted factors that I had perhaps underweighted.",
    "rationale": "After reviewing the other forecasts, I am updating my probability from 35% to 40%. My initial forecast was heavily anchored on the historical pattern of presidents, including Trump in his first term, not prioritizing clemency early in a term and exhibiting a 'lumpy' pattern where most months have zero grants. While this remains a strong argument for 'No,' the other forecasters convinced me to give more weight to two countervailing points. First, as Forecaster 2 noted, Trump's first-term average was high enough that a single month with three or more grants is not a particularly rare event in the context of his presidency. Second, Forecaster 3's point about the strategic use of pardons to command a news cycle provides a plausible trigger for a June batch that is independent of traditional events like holidays. These factors, combined with the shared consensus that a second Trump term would be even less constrained by norms and that the threshold is very low, justify a modest increase. I remain below 50% because the 'no specific trigger' argument is still strong—without a known catalyst, inertia and the historical lumpiness of clemency actions still favor a 'No' outcome.",
