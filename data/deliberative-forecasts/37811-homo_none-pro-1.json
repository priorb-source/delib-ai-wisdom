    "review": "The other two forecasters provide analyses that are in strong alignment with my own, centering on the key factors of a short timeline, institutional inertia, and the status quo of the site being online. Their reasoning is highly convincing. Forecaster 2 adds a crucial piece of historical evidence I had not explicitly weighed: the Trump administration from 2017-2021 modified climate websites rather than taking them down entirely, creating a strong precedent for the most likely path of political interference. Forecaster 3 reinforces this by framing a complete takedown as a 'politically costly and highly visible act,' suggesting that less overt methods like altering content would be preferred. Both of these points strengthen the case for a 'Yes' resolution.",
    "rationale": "My initial forecast was 97%. Both other forecasters arrived at 95%. While their arguments—specifically the historical precedent of modification over removal and the political cost of a takedown—actually strengthen my conviction in a 'Yes' outcome, their consensus at a slightly lower probability gives me pause. It suggests I may be slightly underestimating the tail risk of a more aggressive and organized political directive than seen in the past. An administration in 2025, having learned from previous terms, might be more prepared to execute such a directive quickly, overcoming the bureaucratic inertia I am heavily relying on. My initial forecast of 97% implies only a ~1-in-33 chance of failure, while their 95% implies a 1-in-20 chance. Given the heightened political volatility, I believe it is prudent to slightly increase the probability assigned to this risk factor. Therefore, I am lowering my forecast by one percentage point to 96%, splitting the difference between my initial assessment and the group consensus. This adjustment reflects an increased, though still small, allowance for a rapid, politically motivated takedown.",
