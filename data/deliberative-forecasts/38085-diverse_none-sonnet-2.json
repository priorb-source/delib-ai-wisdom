    "review": "Forecaster 3 raises several compelling arguments I had not fully considered: (1) The population mathematics - 14 million represents approximately 60% of Florida's 23 million residents, which is actually a quite high threshold requiring widespread drought coverage. (2) Geographic concentration effects - South Florida's major metro areas (Miami-Dade, Broward, Palm Beach) contain 6+ million people, meaning localized improvements in these populous regions can substantially reduce the total count. (3) Historical patterns showing Florida spring droughts typically see material improvement by late June as the wet season establishes. (4) The US Drought Monitor's documented responsiveness to Florida's wet season improvements. These are substantive points that suggest I may have overweighted drought persistence relative to strong seasonal signals. Forecaster 2's analysis aligns closely with my original reasoning but doesn't introduce fundamentally new considerations. However, I also note that both other forecasters may be underweighting that we lack current data (as of May 29) on whether improvement has already begun, and the baseline measurement was exactly at the threshold. The actual time from April 28 to June 28 is two months, but from today (May 29) to resolution is only 30 days, creating genuine uncertainty about the current state.",
    "rationale": "After reviewing the arguments, I find Forecaster 3's seasonal and geographic analysis persuasive but believe they may be somewhat overconfident. The combination of (a) 14 million being a high population threshold requiring ~60% coverage, (b) Florida's populous coastal areas being able to quickly drop out of drought with wet season rainfall, and (c) historical patterns of June improvement, all argue for a lower probability than my initial 55%. However, several factors prevent me from going as low as 22%: The April 28 baseline showed not just widespread drought but extreme (D3) conditions in some areas, suggesting severity that may take longer to reverse. We have no information about current conditions as of late May - improvement may have already begun, or conditions may have persisted/worsened. The exact threshold positioning means status quo equals YES, providing a natural anchor. The 30-day forecast horizon from today introduces meaningful uncertainty. Balancing these considerations, I am updating my forecast downward to reflect the stronger seasonal signal and population geography arguments, while maintaining higher uncertainty than Forecaster 3 due to the lack of current data and the status quo anchor at exactly 14.0 million.",
