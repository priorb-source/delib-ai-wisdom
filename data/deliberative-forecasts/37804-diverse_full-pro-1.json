    "review": "The other two forecasts provided excellent, complementary perspectives that refined my view. Forecaster 2's analysis, focusing on institutional procedure, rightly emphasized that the public announcement of a formal review via a Task Force provides the CDC with a strong procedural justification for maintaining the status quo while that review is conducted. This is a standard bureaucratic response to political pressure. Conversely, Forecaster 3's analysis provided a crucial real-world counterpoint by citing the 2017 precedent of politically motivated, rapid changes to federal websites (e.g., climate information). This precedent makes the 'No' scenario—achieved by simply taking the page down—far more plausible than procedural norms alone would suggest. The core tension is between these two forces: the inertia of an announced process versus the potential for an immediate, top-down political directive.",
    "rationale": "After reviewing the other analyses, I am increasing my forecast. My initial 70% forecast attempted to balance institutional inertia against strong political will. The deliberation has clarified the specific mechanisms for both outcomes. I was particularly persuaded by the argument that the administration's own announcement of a formal Task Force review makes an immediate, arbitrary removal of the webpage less likely. Such an action would directly contradict the administration's stated commitment to a process, opening it to criticism of acting before its own review is complete. This procedural cover strengthens the case for the status quo surviving the next six weeks. However, Forecaster 3's point about historical precedent for such webpage removals is valid and powerful, confirming that this is a non-trivial risk, especially given the HHS Secretary's known convictions. Therefore, while I believe the probability of 'Yes' is higher than I initially estimated, Forecaster 2's 85% seems slightly too dismissive of this clear political risk. I am updating my forecast from 70% to 80%, giving more weight to the power of the announced process to defer immediate change, while still assigning a significant 20% probability to a politically expedient takedown of the recommendation.",
