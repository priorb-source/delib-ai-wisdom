    "review": "After reviewing the other forecasts, I find my position lies between the two. Forecaster 3 (80%) shares my core reasoning: recent, specific leaks about the 'Claude Neptune' model completing red-teaming are highly probative and should significantly outweigh historical cadence arguments in a fast-moving field. Their structured breakdown of risks—Naming, Rollout, and Slippage—is excellent and clarifies the key points of failure. Forecaster 2 (38%) provides a valuable counterpoint by emphasizing the historical pattern of lengthening release cycles (4 months -> 8 months). Extrapolating this pattern would indeed place a release later in 2025, providing a strong anchor for a lower probability. However, I believe this mathematical extrapolation is less predictive than the specific, recent evidence of a model nearing completion, especially given the intense competitive pressure in the AI industry. The most important point raised, which both other forecasters highlighted more strongly than I initially did, is the naming risk. The resolution criteria are explicit that the model must be named 'Claude 4'. Given competitors' recent moves (e.g., GPT-4o), the possibility of an intermediate naming convention like 'Claude 3.5' or 'Claude-Next' seems very plausible and is the single greatest point of uncertainty.",
    "rationale": "I am slightly decreasing my forecast from 75% to 70%. The core of my belief remains unchanged: the specific and recent reports about 'Claude Neptune' completing red-teaming with a target for a late May/early June release are the strongest piece of evidence and point towards a launch before the July 1 deadline. However, the deliberation has convinced me to place more weight on the uncertainty of the model's official name. Forecaster 3's clear articulation of the naming risk, combined with real-world examples of competitors using intermediate branding for major updates, suggests there is a non-trivial chance Anthropic will not use the 'Claude 4' moniker for this specific release. This single factor is an explicit path to a 'No' resolution, even if a powerful new model is released to the public on schedule. I am not decreasing my forecast further, as I side with Forecaster 3 in believing that the 14 months since Claude 3's release makes a successor model feel imminent, and Anthropic's history of no-waitlist public access makes the rollout criteria likely to be met if the model is released. The adjustment from 75% to 70% reflects a refined apportionment of risk, with a higher probability now assigned to the 'wrong name' failure mode.",
