    "review": "The other forecasters provided valuable new information and methodological approaches. Forecaster 2's base rate analysis is particularly strong - quantifying that only 2-4 of 25-35 Level 3 countries get upgraded annually yields a ~1-3% base rate for our 2-month window. This grounds the analysis in historical patterns. Forecaster 3 introduced critical new information: May 1st sanctions were just announced against Ethiopia. This is significant because it demonstrates escalating US concern and occurred just one day after the April 30 travel advisory review. Both forecasters correctly note that Level 4 upgrades require severe catalysts like coups, embassy evacuations, or major attacks - none of which are currently evident. However, I find Forecaster 3 may be slightly overweighting the sanctions announcement. While sanctions show policy concern, they serve different purposes than travel advisories. Sanctions are about diplomatic pressure and punishment; travel advisories are about citizen safety. These can be correlated but aren't necessarily so. The timing is notable: the April 30 review explicitly confirmed Ethiopia is NOT among Level 4 countries, then sanctions came May 1st. This could indicate either: (a) the situation warranting sanctions hasn't yet reached travel advisory threshold, or (b) these are separate diplomatic tracks. Forecaster 2's more conservative 6% appropriately weights base rates heavily, while Forecaster 3's 13% may be overreacting to very recent developments.",
    "rationale": "After reviewing both analyses, I'm making a modest upward adjustment from my initial 10% forecast. The May 1st sanctions announcement is genuinely new information that slightly increases the probability of a travel advisory upgrade, as it demonstrates the US government is taking stronger action on Ethiopia. However, several factors prevent me from moving significantly higher: (1) The base rate analysis from Forecaster 2 is compelling - historically only 1-3% chance in a 2-month window based on upgrade patterns; (2) The April 30 review happening just before sanctions suggests the State Department had already assessed the security situation and decided Level 3 was appropriate; (3) There are no reports of the specific catalysts that typically trigger Level 4 - no embassy threats, nationwide offensives, or incidents involving Americans; (4) The 60-day timeframe remains very short for such a dramatic policy shift; (5) Ethiopia's recent trajectory has been positive (downgraded from Level 4 in early 2023). The sanctions do warrant concern, but sanctions and travel advisories serve distinct purposes and don't always move in tandem. Regional instability (Sudan and South Sudan at Level 4) provides some context for risk, but Ethiopia has maintained Level 3 despite ongoing regional conflicts. My updated forecast of 11% acknowledges the sanctions as a meaningful but not transformative piece of information, staying closer to the base rate while recognizing Ethiopia-specific risk factors.",
