    "review": "Both forecasters converge at 90%, suggesting strong agreement. Their key points include: (1) Forecaster 2's reminder that Trump attended the 2018 G7 in Canada despite tensions, leaving early but still attending - this precedent strengthens the Yes case since even brief attendance satisfies our criteria; (2) Forecaster 3's explicit mention of Trump's age (79) as a health risk factor; (3) Forecaster 3's point about the possibility of summit postponement outside June, which I hadn't explicitly considered. Both emphasize the strength of official White House confirmation this close to the event. Their reasoning is generally sound, particularly the 2018 precedent showing that Trump attends even when relationships are strained. The convergence at 90% suggests I may have slightly overweighted the tail risks.",
    "rationale": "After reviewing the other forecasters' analyses, I'm updating slightly upward. The 2018 precedent is particularly compelling - it demonstrates that even amid diplomatic tensions with Canada, Trump still attended the G7 (though briefly). Since our resolution criteria only requires physical attendance at some point during the summit, not duration or full participation, this historical example strengthens the Yes case. The official White House confirmation combined with the very short time horizon (we're in early June now) makes cancellation increasingly unlikely. However, I'm not moving all the way to 90% because I still see meaningful tail risks: Trump's unpredictability, the 79-year-old age factor for sudden health issues, the specific June timing requirement (if postponed to July = No), and possibilities of acute crises demanding his presence domestically. The 3-point difference between my original 87% and their 90% represents a small but real disagreement about the magnitude of these tail risks. I'm splitting the difference at 89%, acknowledging their strong points while maintaining slightly more caution about unexpected developments.",
