    "review": "Both forecasters correctly emphasize the short time left, the absence of advance planning signals, and the high political/security costs of a Russia trip during the war. I find that core logic persuasive. Forecaster 2 introduces a potential pathway via June 2 Istanbul talks and notes the U.S. reportedly isn’t sending an official delegation; if accurate, that actually lowers the chance of a rapid breakthrough leading to a visit. Their 6% feels a bit high relative to their own caution. Forecaster 3 adds a claim that Trump recently used very negative rhetoric toward Putin and issued a two‑week ultimatum; if verified, that would further depress odds and narrow the already small window. Both rightly leave a small tail for an unconventional, last‑minute diplomatic gambit. Net, their points largely reinforce my low prior; the unverified new details don’t justify moving meaningfully off my initial estimate.",
    "rationale": "Time remaining is about one month, and there are no credible public indicators of an imminent June visit (no advance team reporting, no scheduling placeholders, no official leaks, no airspace/route chatter). Presidential travel of this sensitivity is rarely arranged in days; Russia would likely telegraph it, and the White House would face intense domestic and allied scrutiny. If Forecaster 3’s report of sharply negative Trump rhetoric toward Putin is accurate, that further reduces the plausibility of a near‑term visit absent a dramatic diplomatic breakthrough. A thin tail remains for an unconventional move tied to a breakthrough (e.g., ceasefire framework, major prisoner exchange, or a neutral‑site meeting rapidly shifting to Russia), but there is currently no evidence such a breakthrough is imminent. Given that, I’m holding my prior. I would update up on credible reports of a June visit, clear scheduling signals, or reliable leaks of high‑level preparations; I would update down on explicit denials or if early‑June diplomatic openings fail to materialize.",
