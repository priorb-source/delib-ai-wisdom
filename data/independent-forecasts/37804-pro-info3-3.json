  "information": "The U.S. Public Health Service and the CDC last changed the recommended fluoride level in 2015, when it was updated from a range of 0.7–1.2 mg/L to a single level of 0.7 mg/L. That revision process took four years, including public comment periods and interagency review. As of spring 2025, major professional organizations including the American Dental Association (ADA), the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP), and the Association of State and Territorial Dental Directors (ASTDD) have reiterated their support for the current 0.7 mg/L recommendation.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Approximately 6 weeks.",
    "status_quo_outcome": "Yes",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Under intense political pressure from HHS leadership, the CDC is directed to immediately take down the recommendation page pending the outcome of the new review, causing the question to resolve as No.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "The announced HHS review proceeds at a standard, deliberate pace for a major public health guideline. As of July 1, 2025, the review is still in its early stages and the CDC's official recommendation on its website remains 0.7 mg/L.",
    "rationale": "My forecast heavily favors the status quo due to the significant institutional inertia of federal health agencies like the CDC. The research report highlights that the last update to this recommendation in 2015 was the culmination of a four-year process. The period between today (May 20, 2025) and the resolution date (July 1, 2025) is extremely short, making it highly improbable that a thorough scientific review, public comment period, and final ruling could be completed in time to enact a change. Furthermore, the existing recommendation is supported by a strong consensus from major professional bodies like the ADA and AAP, which provides a significant buffer against rapid, politically-motivated changes. The announcement of an HHS review is the primary evidence for a potential change, but initiating a review is the first step in a very long process, not an indication of an imminent outcome. My probability is not higher than 95% to account for a small chance of an unexpected, rapid administrative action, such as an order to take the guidance page offline pending review, which would resolve the question as 'No'. My forecast is not lower because the procedural and scientific barriers to changing such a long-standing and widely-supported public health recommendation in under two months are immense. I would lower my forecast if there were an announcement of an expedited review or a leak of a draft recommendation with a lower concentration.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill the CDC still recommend 0.7 mg/L fluoride as the optimal level in community water supplies on July 1, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nNPR: [HHS will review guidance on the addition of fluoride to drinking water](https://www.npr.org/2025/04/10/g-s1-59452/hhs-rfk-fluoride-drinking-water-epa)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if the CDC's [Community Water Fluoridation Recommendations](https://www.cdc.gov/fluoridation/about/community-water-fluoridation-recommendations.html) recommends greater than or equal to 0.7 mg/L as the concentration that maximizes fluoride's oral health benefits while minimizing potential harms. If a lesser amount is recommended or if there is no longer any recommendation at all, then the question resolves as **No**.\n\nIf the page is pulled offline with no replacement, this question also resolves as **No**.\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nThe U.S. Public Health Service and the CDC last changed the recommended fluoride level in 2015, when it was updated from a range of 0.7–1.2 mg/L to a single level of 0.7 mg/L. That revision process took four years, including public comment periods and interagency review. As of spring 2025, major professional organizations including the American Dental Association (ADA), the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP), and the Association of State and Territorial Dental Directors (ASTDD) have reiterated their support for the current 0.7 mg/L recommendation.\n\nToday is 2025-05-20.\n\nBefore answering you think:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n(e) You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
