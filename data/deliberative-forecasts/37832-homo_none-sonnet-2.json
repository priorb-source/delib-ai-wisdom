    "review": "The other forecasters' analyses align closely with mine on the key factors: the 40-day window is extremely short, the CEO's explicit statement is strong evidence against an IPO announcement, and typical IPO processes require months of preparation. Both landed at exactly 8%, compared to my 10%. Their reasoning is sound and emphasizes some points I may have underweighted: (1) the extreme difficulty of companies reversing major strategic communications on such short timescales, and (2) the explicitness of the CEO's public stance. Forecaster 2's mention of 'tactical misdirection' is creative but speculative - I don't find this compelling enough to materially change probabilities. Forecaster 3's emphasis on how companies rarely reverse strategic guidance within weeks is well-taken. The consensus at 8% suggests my 10% may have been slightly too generous.",
    "rationale": "Upon reflection, I think the other forecasters correctly emphasize the difficulty of rapid strategic reversals more than I did in my initial analysis. When a CEO makes such an explicit public statement ('it's dumb to IPO this year'), reversing course within 40 days would be highly unusual and damage credibility unless driven by extraordinary circumstances - for which we have no evidence. The resolution criteria require either an S-1 filing or a website announcement, both formal actions representing significant strategic commitments, not just casual exploration. While my point about 'planning' being a lower bar than 'executing' an IPO still holds some weight, the other forecasters are right that even announcing plans shortly after such a public dismissal would be a notable reversal. The 8% probability better reflects: (1) the strong signal from CEO guidance, (2) the compressed timeframe making preparation unlikely unless already secretly underway, (3) the absence of any countervailing evidence, and (4) only minimal probability for surprise developments or information we lack. I'm updating down from 10% to 8% to align with the consensus and reflect the stronger emphasis on strategic reversal difficulty.",
