  "information": "According to multiple polls from early 2025, Reform UK's support has grown significantly. A YouGov poll in early February showed Reform UK taking the lead over Labour for the first time, with 25% of the vote compared to Labour's 24% and the Conservatives' 21%. It found that one in four Conservative voters from the July 2024 election would now vote for Reform. Later polls from late April by sources like YouGov and More in Common showed Reform UK and Labour tied at 25%, or Reform slightly ahead at 26%. Polling expert Sir John Curtice noted the unprecedented unpopularity of both Labour (24% average rating) and the Conservatives (22%), with Reform narrowly ahead at 25%. A poll by Find Out Now in late January also placed Reform UK in the lead with 26% of the vote, ahead of the Conservatives at 23% and Labour at 22%. By contrast, the Politico poll-of-polls, the resolution source for the question, was reported in one analysis as showing Reform UK at 14.1%, significantly behind Labour (33.7%) and the Conservatives (23.7%).\n\nOn May 1, 2025, local elections are scheduled to take place in England, representing the first major electoral test since the Labour party's landslide victory in the July 2024 general election. Voters will elect over 1,600 councillors and mayors across 23 local authorities. In conjunction with these elections, a UK parliamentary by-election is being held in Runcorn and Helsby. Opinion polls for the by-election in early April indicated a lead for Reform UK, with 28% support, putting them 6 points ahead of Labour (22%) and 8 points ahead of the Conservatives (20%). It was also reported that up to 60 council candidates had defected from the Conservative party to run for Reform UK in the May elections.\n\nRecent reports indicate a significant shift in the British political landscape. Patrick English, director of political analytics at YouGov, described the emergence of 'five party politics,' observing that both Labour and Conservative support levels are declining while support for Reform UK, the Liberal Democrats, and the Green Party is rising. A poll by More In Common found that 41% of voters lack faith in any of the main party leaders, and an Ipsos poll from March 2025 found that 36% of British adults were considering voting for Reform UK. Public sentiment is reportedly characterized by disillusionment with the traditional parties, with key voter issues including immigration, local infrastructure like potholes, and economic concerns. Polling data shows only 60% of those who voted for Labour in the July 2024 election would do so again.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "2 months. The resolution window is from May 1, 2025, to June 30, 2025.",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No. The most recent data from the resolution source, Politico's poll-of-polls, shows Reform UK at 14.1%, trailing Labour (33.7%) and the Conservatives (23.7%) by a significant margin. A gap of this magnitude is very unlikely to be closed and reversed to a 4-point lead within a two-month timeframe.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Reform UK's performance in the May 1st local elections is strong but not transformative enough to fundamentally alter the national polling landscape. Their support in polls continues to grow but plateaus in the low-to-mid 20s. The Politico poll-of-polls, being an aggregator that smooths out trends, reflects this gradual rise but does not show Reform UK overtaking both main parties, let alone establishing the required 4-point lead by the July 1 deadline.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Reform UK achieves a resounding, expectation-shattering victory in the May 1st local elections and the Runcorn and Helsby by-election. This creates a powerful media narrative of a political realignment, triggering a polling 'cascade'. A wave of disillusioned voters from both Labour and the Conservatives shifts allegiance, causing multiple subsequent polls throughout May and June to consistently place Reform in the lead by over 5 points. This sustained shift is significant enough to rapidly move the Politico poll-of-polls average, resulting in Reform achieving a lead of 4 points or more over the second-place party before July 1.",
    "rationale": "My forecast is based on the significant friction between Reform UK's clear momentum in individual polls and the strict, slow-moving nature of the resolution criteria. The primary argument against a 'Yes' outcome is the starting position. According to the Politico poll-of-polls, Reform UK is at 14.1%, nearly 20 points behind the leading Labour party. For this question to resolve Yes, Reform must not only close this gap but build a 4-point lead over the next-closest party, all within two months. Poll aggregators, by design, are lagging indicators that smooth out rapid fluctuations, making such a dramatic shift in a short period highly improbable. The status quo is a strong anchor here. However, the probability is not close to zero. The research shows a highly volatile political environment with unprecedented unpopularity for both major parties. Several individual polls already show Reform UK level with or ahead of Labour and the Conservatives. The May 1st local elections and by-election serve as a major potential catalyst that could accelerate this trend dramatically. A landslide victory for Reform today could create a bandwagon effect that forces the poll-of-polls aggregator to catch up quickly. My forecast is not higher because the 4-point lead requirement in a poll-of-polls is a very high bar to clear in just two months from a starting point so far behind. My forecast is not lower because the tangible momentum, voter disillusionment, and the immediate electoral test make a significant political upset a non-trivial possibility. I would increase my forecast if Reform UK significantly outperforms expectations in today's elections and subsequent polls show their lead widening across multiple pollsters. I would decrease it if their election performance is merely average and their polling numbers stagnate.",
