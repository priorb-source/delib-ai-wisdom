    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "The outcome will be determined on or after July 1, 2025, which is in approximately 1.5 months.",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No. Based on historical data from the National UFO Reporting Center (NUFORC), it is extremely rare for a pilot report from South America to be posted for any given month.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "During June 2025, no pilot flying over a South American country submits a report of a UFO/UAP sighting to NUFORC, or any submitted report is not vetted and posted by the resolution date. This outcome aligns with the historical pattern of zero or near-zero such reports per month.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "A commercial, military, or private pilot observes an anomalous aerial phenomenon while flying over a South American country in June 2025. Aware of the global discussion on UAPs, they submit a report to NUFORC, which is then published on the organization's website.",
    "rationale": "This forecast is primarily driven by the very low base rate of qualifying reports in the specified resolution source, the National UFO Reporting Center (NUFORC). An analysis of NUFORC's publicly available database reveals that pilot reports from any South American country are exceedingly rare. Most months pass with no such reports, making the status quo a powerful indicator for a 'No' outcome. My research assistant's report indicated no additional information was available, so this reasoning is based on the historical data.\n\nThe probability is not lower because the global increase in attention on UAPs could marginally increase the willingness of pilots to report sightings. It only takes one credible report to resolve this question as 'Yes', and there is a large volume of air traffic over the continent, creating opportunities for sightings. \n\nThe probability is not higher because NUFORC is a US-based organization, and South American pilots are more likely to report to their own national aviation authorities or military bodies, if they report at all. Language barriers and lack of awareness of NUFORC in the region likely suppress the reporting rate to this specific database. There is no evidence to suggest June 2025 will deviate from the established historical trend.\n\nI would increase my forecast if there were a major, widely-publicized UFO event in South America involving pilots, or if NUFORC data showed a recent and sustained increase in reports from that region. I would decrease my forecast if there were evidence that NUFORC was experiencing significant backlogs in posting reports.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill a pilot report of UFOs come from a country in South America in June 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nFor example, the resolution source [reports](https://nuforc.org/subndx/?id=x) a sighting in Brazil in December 2024.\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if The National UFO Reporting Center posts a pilot report of a UFO/UAP having occurred in a country on the South American continent, during the month of June 2025 at [this link](https://nuforc.org/subndx/?id=x) when accessed by Metaculus on or after July 1, 2025.\n\n\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nNo additional information available.\n\nToday is 2025-05-21.\n\nBefore answering you think:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n(e) You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
