    "review": "The other forecasters raise several critical points I underweighted. Forecaster 2's base rate argument is particularly important: with 50 states competing and only 8-12 pilot reports nationwide per month, the extreme small sample size creates high variance. Even if Florida is a top contender, the base probability for any single state leading in a given month is inherently low. Forecaster 2 also notes Arizona as a recent hotspot with 22 Air Force pilot reports over 8 months, which I hadn't considered as competition. Forecaster 3 correctly emphasizes the specificity gap - pilot reports are a distinct subset from general UFO reports, and Florida's strong performance in total sightings doesn't necessarily translate to dominance in pilot-specific sightings. Both forecasters highlight that we lack historical data on which states typically lead in pilot sightings month-by-month, which is a critical uncertainty I didn't fully weight. My initial forecast of 38% now appears too optimistic given these considerations.",
    "rationale": "After reviewing the other analyses, I'm revising my forecast downward significantly. The key insight is that monthly pilot sighting data is extremely sparse (8-12 reports nationwide), creating massive variance where any of several top-tier states could lead in a given month. While Florida is likely among the top 3-5 states for pilot reports based on its aviation activity and general UFO reporting history, this doesn't translate to a high probability of leading in any specific month. The base rate calculation suggests even a top-tier state might only lead 15-25% of months. Arizona's recent prominence as a pilot sighting hotspot (22 reports over 8 months per the research) is also concerning for Florida's chances. Without specific historical data showing Florida consistently leads in pilot sightings, I should be more conservative. My updated forecast of 25% reflects that Florida is a legitimate contender with above-average probability due to its substantial military and commercial aviation activity, but acknowledges the high uncertainty and competition from other aviation-heavy states.",
