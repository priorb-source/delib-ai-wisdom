    "review": "The other two forecasters provided crucial context that I had not sufficiently weighed. Specifically, their emphasis on Levar Stoney's structural advantages—a significant fundraising lead and broader establishment endorsements—is a compelling counterpoint to my more poll-centric initial analysis. I found Forecaster 3's argument particularly insightful: in a crowded, six-way primary, the plurality-wins rule structurally benefits the frontrunner, as the opposition vote tends to fragment. This is a dynamic I had underestimated. Both analyses correctly position Rouse as a viable contender but a clear underdog, a conclusion supported by their reasoning.",
    "rationale": "My initial forecast of 35% was based primarily on the March internal poll showing a 6-point gap and a massive 63% of undecided voters. I interpreted this as a highly fluid race where Rouse had a roughly 1-in-3 chance. After reviewing the other analyses, I believe I over-weighted the potential for volatility and under-weighted Stoney's structural advantages. The other forecasters correctly highlight that Stoney's lead in fundraising and establishment support makes him better positioned to consolidate support among those late-deciding voters. The structural dynamic of a six-candidate plurality election, which advantages the frontrunner, further strengthens the case for Stoney. While Rouse remains a strong candidate with a clear path to victory via his regional base and potential late momentum, his overall probability of winning is lower than I first estimated. Therefore, I am lowering my forecast by 5 percentage points to better reflect his position as a significant but secondary contender.",
