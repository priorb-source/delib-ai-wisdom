    "review": "Both forecasters make compelling arguments that have caused me to reconsider my initial forecast. They both emphasize California's significant baseline advantage (36,286 vs 8,623 total sightings), which suggests California likely receives more pilot reports on average. Forecaster 3 particularly highlights that with typical monthly counts of 0-2 reports per state (occasionally 3-4), the requirement for Florida to have MORE than all other states (not tied) creates a high bar. Both also correctly note that the March 2025 incident doesn't necessarily predict June patterns, which I may have overweighted. Their forecasts of 25-30% cluster lower than my 38%, suggesting I was too optimistic about Florida's chances. However, I don't think the probability should go quite as low as 25% given that: (1) Florida is definitively the #2 state historically, (2) high variance in small samples does create realistic upset opportunities, and (3) Florida has demonstrated recent activity. The key insight I'm incorporating is that California's volume advantage likely translates to a baseline edge in monthly pilot reports, not just overall sightings.",
    "rationale": "After reviewing the other forecasters' analyses, I'm updating my forecast downward but not as low as their estimates. The critical factors are: (1) California's substantial historical volume advantage suggests a baseline edge in pilot reports, (2) the requirement for Florida to strictly outpace all states (ties resolve No) is a high bar with small monthly sample sizes, and (3) while high variance creates opportunities for Florida to win individual months, California should win more often given its baseline advantage. The March 2025 incident provides some evidence of Florida activity but doesn't strongly predict June patterns. With typical monthly counts of 0-2 reports per major state and California having roughly 4x Florida's total volume historically, I estimate California wins approximately 40-45% of months, Florida wins 30-35%, and other states or ties account for the remainder. This suggests Florida's probability should be in the 30-35% range rather than my initial 38%.",
