    "review": "Both forecasters use the same decomposition I did: P(fight happens) × P(Pyfer wins | fight). New or emphasized points: (1) Forecaster 3 explicitly frames Gastelum’s near-year layoff since June 2024 as a slight negative for him; I implicitly had this but didn’t weight it. (2) Both set the fight-occurrence probability a bit higher (~92%) than my 90%, which seems reasonable this close to the event despite the earlier illness cancelation. Neither introduced market odds or stylistic nuances that would materially shift the matchup beyond what I already accounted for. I find their reasoning broadly sound; I’m not fully convinced by a 60% Pyfer line versus Gastelum, but I accept nudging occurrence up and giving a marginal bump to Pyfer’s win chance due to the layoff and size/power edge.",
    "rationale": "I keep the same structure but update slightly: - P(fight happens) ≈ 92% (most likely vs Gastelum; small chance of a replacement). - P(Pyfer wins | Gastelum) nudged from 57% to 58% to reflect modest ring-rust risk for Gastelum combined with Pyfer’s size/power and slight grappling edge; countered by Gastelum’s experience, durability, and potential cardio/pace advantage over three rounds. - P(Pyfer wins | replacement) ≈ 65% remains, as short-notice tends to favor the booked fighter. Putting it together (e.g., 87% Gastelum × 58% + 5% replacement × 65%): ~0.537 → 54%. This modestly increases my prior 52% while still reflecting a close matchup and residual cancellation/NC risk.",
