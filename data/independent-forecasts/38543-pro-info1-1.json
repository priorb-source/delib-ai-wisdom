  "information": "Following a phone call between the two leaders, Donald Trump stated that Xi Jinping had invited him to visit China, an invitation he accepted. Trump also extended a reciprocal invitation for Xi to visit the US. On June 11, 2025, Trump posted on social media that he and Xi had agreed to meet in person, with the date and location to be announced later. The official statement from the Chinese government mentioned that Trump was invited to visit China but did not mention Xi accepting an invitation to visit the US. In March 2025, Trump had announced that Xi would visit Washington in the 'not too distant future,' without specifying a date.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "15 days",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No. While an agreement to meet exists, planning and executing a presidential visit to China requires significantly more than two weeks. Without a specific date announced, the status quo is that no visit will occur within this timeframe.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Despite the agreement in principle, logistical arrangements and diplomatic negotiations on the summit's agenda extend beyond the deadline. The visit is subsequently scheduled for a date later in the summer or autumn of 2025.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Driven by an urgent geopolitical or economic crisis, both leaders override standard diplomatic protocols to arrange a hastily organized, short-notice summit in China before July 1, 2025.",
    "rationale": "My forecast is placed at a low 5%. The dominant factor is the extremely short timeframe; there are only about two weeks remaining until the July 1, 2025 deadline. Organizing a US presidential visit to China is a massive logistical and security undertaking that normally requires months, not days, of advance planning. The provided intelligence indicates that while there is a mutual agreement to meet, President Trump's own statement on June 11 specified the date was 'to be announced later,' which strongly suggests a visit is not imminent. The status quo for high-level diplomacy is methodical and slow, making a visit within two weeks a significant deviation from the norm. My forecast is not lower than 5% because the political will for a meeting clearly exists from both sides, and an unforeseen crisis or a desire for a dramatic diplomatic event could theoretically accelerate the timeline. President Trump's past unconventional approaches to diplomacy also add a small amount of uncertainty. My forecast is not higher because the practical barriers to executing a state visit on such short notice are immense. The single most important piece of evidence against a 'Yes' outcome is the lack of an officially announced date. I would need to see an official announcement in the next few days with a specific date before July 1 to significantly increase my probability.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill Donald Trump visit China before July 1, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nFox News: [Trump touts 'very positive' breakthrough with Xi after slamming China for trade violation](https://www.foxnews.com/politics/trump-touts-very-positive-breakthrough-xi-after-slamming-china-trade-violation) | Wikipedia: [List of international presidential trips made by Donald Trump](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_international_presidential_trips_made_by_Donald_Trump)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if, after this question opens and before July 1, 2025, President Donald Trump personally visits China.\n\n\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nFollowing a phone call between the two leaders, Donald Trump stated that Xi Jinping had invited him to visit China, an invitation he accepted.

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
