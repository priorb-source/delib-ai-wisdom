    "review": "All three forecasters correctly identified the central tension between powerful institutional inertia favoring the status quo and the unusual, destabilizing factors surrounding Senator Fetterman. We all agree the probability of a change is low but non-trivial. My initial forecast of 10% aligned with Forecaster 2, who focused on the political calculus and risk of an 'emotional decision' stemming from Fetterman's reported isolation. Forecaster 3, with a 4% forecast, made a compelling argument by more heavily weighting the extreme historical rarity of a senator leaving their caucus and the very short timeframe. I found this emphasis convincing. While I had considered these factors, Forecaster 3's lower probability forced me to critically re-evaluate whether a 1-in-10 chance of this high-inertia event happening in just one month was an overstatement. Forecaster 3 also introduced the specific detail of staff turnover due to policy disagreements, which adds a useful, concrete texture to the general reports of instability.",
    "rationale": "After reviewing my peers' analyses, I am revising my forecast downward from 10% to 7%. I maintain that the personal and health-related concerns described in the reporting are exceptionally serious and make this situation far more volatile than a typical case of political friction. These factors justify a probability significantly higher than baseline. However, I was persuaded by Forecaster 3's emphasis on the immense power of the status quo over such a short, one-month period. A senator resigning or switching parties is a monumental event that rarely happens, and it's even less likely to unfold so quickly without more immediate, escalating triggers. My initial 10% forecast may have over-weighted the severity of the reports relative to the short timeframe and powerful institutional inertia. I am not lowering my forecast to 4% because I believe the specific, credible 'warning signs' regarding Fetterman's health and erratic behavior, which go beyond policy disputes, create a uniquely high risk of an unpredictable outcome compared to other senators. A 7% forecast better reflects a balance between these acute, personal risk factors and the formidable barriers to change.",
