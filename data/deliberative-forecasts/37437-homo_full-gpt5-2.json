    "review": "Both forecasters largely mirror my take: the window is short, the bar for resolution is high (explicit U.S. accusation of PLA ground forces entering Taiwanese-controlled territory), and open-source indicators for imminent amphibious/airborne operations are absent. New/useful nuances they add: (1) seasonal/sea-state constraints heading into early typhoon season, which slightly compress amphibious windows; (2) language risk—Washington might calibrate phrasing, though a forcible landing would likely be called an invasion; (3) potential flashpoints around late May political dates and exclusion-zone patterns; and (4) clearer indicator sets (RO-RO requisitions, blood/logistics prepositioning, large exclusion zones, evacuation advisories). None of these meaningfully raise probability in the next ~8 weeks; if anything, the weather point marginally lowers it. Overall, I find their reasoning sound and consistent with mine, with no compelling argument to move materially off a very low base.",
    "rationale": "The necessary conditions—PLA ground troops landing on Taiwan-controlled territory plus a public U.S. accusation before July 1—remain unlikely in the short horizon. The 2027 readiness narrative, lack of visible mobilization, and substantial political/military costs to Beijing argue against near-term landing operations. Gray-zone pressure, encirclement drills, missile tests, or maritime seizures without ground landings would not resolve the question. A tail-risk remains for a limited fait accompli against an outlying island (e.g., Pratas/Dongsha, parts of Kinmen/Matsu); if it occurred, a U.S. “invasion” accusation is likely, satisfying resolution. The added considerations from peers (sea-state constraints, language calibration, indicator lists) slightly reinforce the low odds. Given the short time left and absence of triggers (massing amphibious assets, RO-RO mobilization, large exclusion zones, evacuations, PRC wartime legal steps), I keep my estimate unchanged.",
