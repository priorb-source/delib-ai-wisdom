  "information": "First-quarter earnings reports for the 'Magnificent Seven' showed varied performance. Meta's earnings per share beat analyst estimates, and Microsoft's revenue and profit exceeded expectations. In contrast, Amazon's cloud business showed decelerating growth, while Apple reported a 4.8% increase in earnings on 5.1% higher revenues. Both Amazon and Apple cited tariffs as a potential headwind. Around the same period, Warren Buffett announced his plan to retire as CEO at the end of 2025, with Greg Abel set to take over.

    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "About 8 days (the Q1 2025 13F is due by May 15, 2025, unless confidential treatment delays disclosure).",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Berkshire’s Q1 2025 13F shows only Apple and Amazon among the Magnificent 7, with no positions in Alphabet, Meta, Microsoft, Nvidia, or Tesla; or Berkshire obtained confidential treatment and any such stake is omitted from the filing.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "The Q1 2025 13F lists a new stake in at least one of Alphabet or Meta (most plausible), or less likely Nvidia; Microsoft and Tesla are unlikely due to longstanding considerations.",
    "rationale": "Base rate and stated preferences point to No. Over the past decade Berkshire has not reported positions in any Magnificent 7 name other than Apple (large) and Amazon (modest, initiated by a lieutenant). Buffett has historically avoided Microsoft to prevent any appearance-of-conflict given his relationship with Bill Gates, and he has been openly skeptical of owning Tesla. He has also signaled caution on the AI-driven rally, implying low odds for Nvidia at current valuations. Berkshire has often been extremely selective about new large-cap tech buys; exceptions (Amazon, Snowflake) came via Todd Combs/Ted Weschler and were relatively small versus Berkshire’s portfolio. While a lieutenant-initiated position in Alphabet or Meta is the most plausible pathway to Yes, the default behavior is to sit on record cash and concentrate in existing holdings (notably Apple), making a new M7 addition in Q1 2025 unlikely. Additionally, even if Berkshire initiated a position, there is a non-zero chance they seek confidential treatment, which would mean it does not appear in the Q1 13F and thus resolves No under this question’s rules. Research assistant highlights (strong Meta/Microsoft results; mixed Amazon/Apple; Buffett’s planned 2025 retirement; BRK.B at record highs) do not materially shift the base case—earnings beats alone rarely prompt Berkshire to add new megacap tech exposure, and leadership transition is already anticipated. Why not higher: valuations and Buffett’s stated reservations (MSFT conflict, Tesla skepticism, AI caution), plus the low historical base rate of initiating new M7 positions. Why not lower: Todd/Ted autonomy and precedent (Amazon, Snowflake) mean a small Alphabet or Meta position is plausible; these names have durable moats and massive buybacks that could appeal to Berkshire’s framework. What would move me up: credible reporting/leaks ahead of May 15 suggesting a new Alphabet/Meta/Nvidia position; explicit comments from Buffett/Combs/Weschler indicating an initiation; or the 13F filing itself showing such a stake. What would move me down: clear statements at the 2025 annual meeting that they own none of these names, or an early 13F filing without any new M7 holdings.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill Berkshire Hathaway reveal a purchase of any Magnificent 7 stock other than Amazon and Apple in its Q1 2025 13F filing?\n\nQuestion background:\nInvestopedia: [Berkshire Hathaway Doesn't Hold Nvidia Stock—Will Warren Buffett Come to Regret it?](https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/warren-buffetts-secret-portfolio-dumping-shares-3-supercharged-artificial-intelligence-ai)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if the 13F filing for Berkshire Hathaway, Inc., filed for the period ending 2025-03-31, reports the company holding shares of Alphabet, Meta Platforms, Microsoft, Nvidia, or Tesla.\n\n\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nFirst-quarter earnings reports for the 'Magnificent Seven' showed varied performance. Meta's earnings per share beat analyst estimates, and Microsoft's revenue and profit exceeded expectations. In contrast, Amazon's cloud business showed decelerating growth, while Apple reported a 4.8% increase in earnings on 5.1% higher revenues. Both Amazon and Apple cited tariffs as a potential headwind.

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
