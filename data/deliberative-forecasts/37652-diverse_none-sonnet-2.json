    "review": "Forecaster 2 appears to have fundamentally misinterpreted the question. They explicitly state they are forecasting 'based on the provided hypothetical premise that Mark Carney is the Canadian Prime Minister,' but this is not a hypothetical premise - it's the central uncertainty. Their 45% represents P(Carney approval > Trump approval | Carney is PM), which may be reasonable, but the actual question requires P(Carney becomes PM AND Carney approval > Trump). They've essentially skipped over the dominant constraint. Their conditional analysis of approval ratings is interesting - Trump likely in low-40s with sticky support, Carney potentially benefiting from a honeymoon period - but this only matters if the precondition is met. Forecaster 3's analysis closely mirrors mine, identifying that Carney must first become PM for Morning Consult to track his approval. Their 2% vs my 3% represents negligible disagreement, both reflecting that a complete leadership transition in 6.5 weeks would require an unprecedented sequence: Trudeau resignation, caucus/party selection of Carney (who isn't currently an MP), swearing in, and Morning Consult implementation. Their reasoning about why not higher (procedural constraints) and why not lower (small tail risk) aligns with mine. Neither forecaster presented new evidence suggesting an imminent transition is underway.",
    "rationale": "My original reasoning stands: the question hinges almost entirely on whether Mark Carney becomes Canadian Prime Minister by early July 2025, not on the comparative approval ratings themselves. With only 6.5 weeks remaining, the procedural path is extraordinarily compressed. Carney is not currently an MP, not Liberal Party leader, and there are no reported signals of imminent transition. While Forecaster 2's conditional analysis (if Carney were PM, he'd have perhaps 45% chance of beating Trump's approval) is plausible given honeymoon effects and Trump's polarized support, this conditional probability is irrelevant if the base event (Carney becoming PM) has <5% probability. Forecaster 3's reasoning reinforces my view. The tiny non-zero probability I assign reflects only tail risk: a sudden political crisis forcing Trudeau's immediate resignation with caucus acclamation of Carney through an expedited, unprecedented process. No evidence points to this scenario. The difference between 2% and 3% is negligible; I'll maintain 3% as it appropriately reflects 'extremely unlikely but not literally impossible.'",
