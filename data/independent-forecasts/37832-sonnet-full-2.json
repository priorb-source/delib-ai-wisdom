  "information": "In January 2025, Databricks completed a major funding round, raising over $15.25 billion. This included a $10 billion Series J equity financing round, which valued the company at $62 billion, and an additional $5.25 billion in debt financing provided by several major banks. New investors in the equity round included Meta as a strategic partner. The funding is intended to accelerate the development of new AI products, expand market reach, and finance acquisitions. A portion of the funds was also designated to offer liquidity to current and former employees.\n\nDatabricks has an upcoming Data + AI Summit scheduled for June 9-12, 2025. Keynote speakers announced for the event include the CEOs of JPMorgan Chase, Anthropic, and Microsoft. Previously, Databricks CEO Ali Ghodsi had described 2024 as a \"dumb\" year for IPOs and has made statements suggesting flexibility on the timing of a public offering, mentioning both 2025 and 2026 as possibilities. A January 2025 report noted that a public offering within a year \"wouldn't be a huge surprise.\"\n\nAs of late May 2025, there have been no public reports of Databricks selecting underwriters for an IPO or of the company making a confidential S-1 filing with the SEC. Market sentiment has been described as uncertain, with some IPO advisors noting that while planning is occurring, macroeconomic concerns might cause delays. Other major tech startups, such as Stripe, have also remained private despite IPO expectations. In contrast, companies like Klarna and eToro have reportedly filed confidential IPO paperwork.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Approximately 40 days remain until July 1, 2025. The resolution date is fixed and clear.",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No - Databricks has not announced IPO plans and the default outcome if nothing changes is that the question resolves as No.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Databricks continues its current trajectory as a well-funded private company, delaying any IPO announcement beyond July 1, 2025. The company leverages its recent $15.25 billion funding round to pursue growth initiatives without the immediate need for public markets. Management decides market conditions or internal readiness don't warrant an announcement in this narrow timeframe, consistent with the CEO's flexible timeline mentioning both 2025 and 2026 as possibilities.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Databricks announces IPO plans at or shortly after its Data + AI Summit (June 9-12, 2025), using the high-profile event with major CEOs as a platform to signal its readiness for public markets. Alternatively, the company files an SEC Form S-1 or makes a website announcement in mid-to-late June, capitalizing on improved market sentiment or competitive pressure from other tech IPOs. The $62 billion valuation and strong investor interest create favorable conditions for an announcement.",
    "rationale": "The status quo strongly favors No. Databricks completed a massive $15.25 billion funding round in January 2025, which significantly reduces immediate capital pressure and urgency to go public. This suggests the company has ample runway to operate and grow as a private entity.\n\nKey evidence against an announcement: (1) As of late May 2025, there are no reports of underwriters being selected or confidential S-1 filings - typical prerequisites for an IPO announcement that usually take months to prepare; (2) The CEO's previous characterization of 2024 as 'dumb' for IPOs indicates caution about market timing; (3) Market conditions remain uncertain according to IPO advisors; (4) Only 40 days remain, which is a very short window for a company showing no visible preparation; (5) The CEO mentioned both 2025 and 2026 as possibilities, indicating no firm commitment to 2025.\n\nFactors supporting a potential Yes: (1) The Data + AI Summit on June 9-12 with high-profile speakers (JPMorgan Chase, Anthropic, Microsoft CEOs) could theoretically serve as a backdrop for major announcements; (2) A January report suggested an IPO within a year 'wouldn't be a huge surprise'; (3) The $62 billion valuation represents a strong market position; (4) Some competitors like Klarna and eToro have filed IPO paperwork, suggesting selective windows of opportunity.\n\nHowever, companies rarely announce IPOs at user conferences - they typically file S-1 forms or make formal press releases/website announcements. The lack of any preparation signals (underwriters, confidential filings) as of late May makes an announcement in the next 40 days highly unlikely. IPO processes typically involve months of preparation that would be visible to market observers.\n\nMy forecast is not higher because: the recent mega-funding round eliminates urgency, there are zero visible preparation signals, the timeframe is extremely short, and the CEO has shown caution about timing. My forecast is not lower than 15% because: the June summit creates a specific catalyst window, the CEO did mention 2025 as possible, and unexpected announcements occasionally happen. To revise upward, I would need reports of underwriter selection, confidential filing rumors, or explicit statements from company leadership about near-term IPO plans. To revise downward, I would need the June summit to pass without announcement or statements ruling out 2025.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nBefore July 1, 2025, will Databricks announce that it is planning an IPO?\n\nQuestion background:\nTechCrunch: ['It's dumb to IPO this year': Databricks CEO explains why he's waiting to go public](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/dumb-ipo-databricks-ceo-explains-064957000.html)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question will resolve as **Yes** if Databricks, Inc., announces before July 1, 2025, that it is planning an initial public offering. In order to streamline the resolution of this question, there are two resolution sources for the IPO announcement: 1) Databricks filing an [SEC Form S-1](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/sec-form-s-1.asp) or 2) An announcement at the [news](https://www.databricks.com/blog) section of its website. If there is no such announcement before that date, this question resolves as **No**.\n\n\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nIn January 2025, Databricks completed a major funding round, raising over $15.25 billion.

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
