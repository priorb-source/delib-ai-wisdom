    "status_quo_outcome": "No. Berkshire Hathaway's reported holding of Amazon stock has been stable at 10,000,000 shares. If no action was taken, the holding will not be greater than 10,000,000 shares, resulting in a 'No' outcome.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Berkshire's investment managers, Todd Combs and Ted Weschler, see no compelling reason to alter their Amazon position. They either maintain the holding at 10,000,000 shares due to a belief it is fairly valued, or they trim the position, resulting in the Q1 2025 13F filing showing a holding that is not greater than 10,000,000 shares.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Driven by a specific catalyst in Q1 2025, such as a significant stock price decline or increased conviction in Amazon's long-term growth in AI and cloud computing, one of Berkshire's investment managers decides to deploy capital and increase the stake. The Q1 2025 13F filing subsequently reports a holding of more than 10,000,000 shares.",
    "rationale": "My forecast is anchored on the high degree of inertia within Berkshire Hathaway's portfolio. The status quo outcome is 'No,' as Berkshire has held exactly 10,000,000 shares of Amazon for a sustained period. Large portfolio adjustments are the exception, not the rule. The Amazon position is managed by Todd Combs or Ted Weschler, not Warren Buffett himself. While they have more flexibility, their actions have historically shown a pattern of holding this position steady. For the outcome to be 'Yes,' these managers would need a strong, specific reason to increase the stake during Q1 2025, such as a temporary, steep decline in Amazon's share price creating a clear value opportunity. Given Berkshire's recent trend of being a net seller of stocks and trimming other large technology positions like Apple, an aggressive new purchase in another tech giant seems less probable. The overall cautious stance of the firm reinforces the likelihood of inaction or trimming over a significant addition. I am setting the probability at 20% rather than lower because Combs and Weschler are active managers with a mandate to act on opportunities, and a purchase is a plausible, albeit unlikely, event within any given quarter. I would increase my forecast if there were reports of a significant market downturn focused on tech stocks during Q1 2025. Conversely, I would lower my forecast if information emerged suggesting Berkshire was liquidating positions to build its cash reserves due to a bearish macroeconomic outlook.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill Berkshire Hathaway reveal a purchase of more Amazon stock in its Q1 2025 13F filing?\n\nQuestion background:\nStockCircle: [Berkshire Hathaway's Amazon Stake](https://stockcircle.com/portfolio/warren-buffett/amzn/transactions)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if the 13F filing for Berkshire Hathaway, Inc., filed for the period ending 2025-03-31, reports the company holding greater than 10,000,000 shares of Amazon.com, Inc.\n\n\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nNo additional information available.\n\nToday is 2025-05-08.\n\nBefore answering you think:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n(e) You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
