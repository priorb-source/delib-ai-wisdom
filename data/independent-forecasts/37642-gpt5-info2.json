  "information": "Major financial institutions have recently pushed back their timelines for the first interest rate cut. Goldman Sachs adjusted its forecast to expect the first cut in December 2025, a delay from its previous July expectation, citing a stable US economy. Following a stronger-than-expected jobs report, Bank of America also shifted its rate cut expectation from June to July. Morgan Stanley economists now anticipate just one rate cut in 2025, projected for July. A Bloomberg survey of economists also reflects this shift, with the consensus projection for the first Fed rate cut moving from May to July.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "About 47 days (until July 1, 2025), with a key decision on June 11, 2025",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No cut announced before July 1, 2025 (Fed holds rates at the June meeting and no intermeeting action)",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Inflation remains sticky and the labor market resilient. The Fed signals ‘higher for longer,’ keeps the target range unchanged at the June 11 FOMC, and no shock prompts an intermeeting move. Outcome: No.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Either (a) the Fed announces a cut at the June 11 FOMC after clear disinflation and softer labor data restore confidence inflation is moving to 2%, or (b) a negative shock (credit/financial stress or a sharp employment slowdown) triggers an intermeeting cut before July 1. Outcome: Yes.",
    "rationale": "There is only one scheduled opportunity left before July 1: the June 10–11 FOMC meeting. Intermeeting cuts are rare absent acute stress. Recent bank and survey guidance has shifted later: per the research assistant, Goldman now sees the first cut in December 2025, BofA moved from June to July, Morgan Stanley sees one cut in July, and a Bloomberg economist survey shifted the modal first cut from May to July. That consensus implies a low probability of a June cut. Fed communications in 2024–25 have emphasized needing ‘greater confidence’ that inflation is moving sustainably to 2% before easing. A stronger-than-expected recent jobs report further reduces the near-term case to cut. Given the status quo usually persists and the Fed tends to telegraph policy shifts, the base case is no action in June. Why not higher: Inflation progress has been uneven, labor data resilient, and major forecasters now cluster at July or later; intermeeting cuts are historically very rare. Why not lower: There is still one full FOMC meeting before the deadline, and several key data points (April/May PCE, May payrolls, possibly May CPI near the meeting) could surprise dovish; a downside growth or financial-stability shock could also prompt an intermeeting move. What would move me up: Clear downside surprises across core inflation (notably core PCE), a materially weaker May payrolls/unemployment uptick, softening wages, and increasingly dovish Fed guidance hinting at June. Signs of financial stress would also raise odds. What would move me down: Continued firm inflation prints, solid labor data, and explicit Fed guidance pushing cuts to ‘later in 2025’ or ‘data dependent but not imminent.’",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill the Federal Reserve cut interest rates before July 1, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nJP Morgan: [Following the Fed’s decision to pause rate cuts, what could its next move be?](https://www.jpmorgan.com/insights/global-research/economy/fed-rate-cuts)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if, after the launch of this question and before July 1, 2025 the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) announces a reduction of any amount in the target federal funds rate range.\r\nThe primary resolution source is the FOMC's *target federal funds rate or range* webpage [here](https://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/openmarket.htm), the Federal Reserve's official minutes and statements [here](https://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/fomccalendars.htm), or other [credible sources](https://www.metaculus.com/help/faq/#definitions) in case the Federal Reserve's website is unavailable or not timely updated.\n\nThis question resolves based on the announcement. Therefore, the effective date of the rate cut does not need to be before the resolution date, as long as the announcement is made before then.\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nMajor financial institutions have recently pushed back their timelines for the first interest rate cut.

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
