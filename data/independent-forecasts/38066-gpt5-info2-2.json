  "information": "Sam Altman and Elon Musk co-founded OpenAI in 2015 as a non-profit foundation, with Musk providing significant initial funding. Musk left the organization in 2018 citing disagreements with Altman and the company's direction. After OpenAI was re-launched as a for-profit entity, Musk filed a lawsuit alleging a violation of the original non-profit principles. Their public rivalry has also included a hostile, unsolicited $97.4 billion takeover bid for OpenAI led by Musk, which Altman publicly dismissed, and reported competition for influence over U.S. government AI projects.",

    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "≈22 days until the resolution window closes (by 00:00 PDT, Jun 18, 2025)",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Both give separate keynotes/fireside chats with no overlap, no multi-speaker panel or group photo on stage, or one of them cancels/withdraws.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "YC schedules a joint fireside chat/debate, a multi-speaker panel, or a closing thank-you/group-on-stage moment where both are simultaneously on the platform.",
    "rationale": "Baseline event dynamics: At major conferences, headline speakers typically appear in solo keynotes or one-on-one fireside chats. Putting two high-profile, controversial figures together on stage is less common unless explicitly billed as a debate/panel. With no public agenda indicating a joint session yet, the status quo favors separate appearances. Relationship friction: The research assistant notes a long-running rift—Musk’s departure from OpenAI, public criticism, and litigation history—suggesting both parties may avoid a co-appearance that could become contentious or distract from a student-focused program. That lowers the prior. Execution risk: Musk, in particular, has a history of late changes to event participation; any cancellation instantly makes a joint appearance impossible. Reasons it could still happen: YC has history with both, and Altman interviewed Musk on stage in 2016; a reunion could be a headline-grabbing draw. YC could also stage a moderated panel or a brief group-on-stage photo/thank-you that satisfies the resolution criterion (any simultaneous on-stage presence counts). Those possibilities keep the probability meaningfully above zero. Why not higher: No public evidence (yet) of a planned joint session; the adversarial relationship and potential for drama make a co-appearance operationally and reputationally risky for YC. Why not lower: Both are confirmed headline speakers; YC has strong convening power; even a short overlap on stage (panel/photo) would resolve Yes. What would move me up: A published agenda or promotion showing a joint session, panel, or closing group stage moment; either party publicly hinting at a debate; confirmation of coordinated security/logistics. What would move me down: Final agenda with entirely separate slots and no panels; reports that one will appear virtually or cancel; renewed public conflict or legal friction between them; YC statements indicating strictly solo formats.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill Sam Altman and Elon Musk be on the stage together at YC AI Startup School?\n\nQuestion background:\nY Combinator is an American venture capital firm known for launching over 5,000 companies including Airbnb, Stripe, and Reddit. In 2025, Y Combinator announced AI Startup School, a conference in San Francisco held on June 16–17, aimed at 2,000 final-year students and recent graduates in computer science, artificial intelligence, and related fields.&#x20;\n\nY Combinator has announced that both Sam Altman and Elon Musk are among the headline speakers at the AI Startup School, but it is unknown whether they will appear on stage together at the same time.\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question will resolve as Yes if Sam Altman and Elon Musk share a stage together at YC AI Startup School after 7:59 AM, June 16, 2025, and before 00:00 AM, June 18, 2025. Otherwise, this question will resolve as No.\n\nSharing a stage is defined as both individuals being physically present on the same platform at the same time.&#x20;\n\nThis question will resolve according to a preponderance of evidence. If there is no clear evidence of this occurring before July 1, 2025, this question will resolve as No.\n\nAll times for this question are in Pacific Daylight Time (PDT).  &#x20;\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nSam Altman and Elon Musk co-founded OpenAI in 2015 as a non-profit foundation, with Musk providing significant initial funding. Musk left the organization in 2018 citing disagreements with Altman and the company's direction. After OpenAI was re-launched as a for-profit entity, Musk filed a lawsuit alleging a violation of the original non-profit principles. Their public rivalry has also included a hostile, unsolicited $97.4 billion takeover bid for OpenAI led by Musk, which Altman publicly dismissed, and reported competition for influence over U.S. government AI projects.\n\nToday is 2025-05-27.\n\nBefore answering you think:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n(e) You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
