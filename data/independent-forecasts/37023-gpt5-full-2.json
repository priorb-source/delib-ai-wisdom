  "information": "The preliminary University of Michigan Consumer Sentiment Index for April 2025 was 50.8, the second-lowest level since records began in 1952. This represented the fourth consecutive monthly decline, a drop of 11% from the March 2025 reading of 57.0, and a cumulative decline of over 30% since December 2024. According to Surveys of Consumers Director Joanne Hsu, the decline was 'pervasive and unanimous across age, income, education, geographic region, and political affiliation.'\n\nMultiple reports highlighted significant macroeconomic concerns. Year-ahead inflation expectations rose to 6.7%, the highest level recorded since 1981, with consumers widely citing worries about tariffs. The share of consumers expecting unemployment to rise increased for the fifth consecutive month, reaching its highest point since 2009. Concurrently, the Conference Board’s Leading Economic Indicators registered four consecutive monthly drops. Policy uncertainty was also a factor, with ongoing tariff implementation, market volatility, and potential changes in Federal Reserve leadership.\n\nSpecific industries and markets have shown negative reactions to the economic climate. Moody's Ratings downgraded the retail industry's outlook to 'negative' due to 'bleak' prospects amid the ongoing trade war, predicting that tariffs will harm profitability and raise consumer prices. In response to tariffs, Volkswagen has implemented an 'import surcharge', and companies like Temu, Shein, and Hermès announced price increases. The financial markets have also been volatile, with the S&P 500 Index falling significantly after the tariff announcement. Separately, the U.S. beef industry has expressed concern that poor consumer sentiment could negatively impact demand.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "About 3 weeks until the preliminary May 2025 reading (mid-May), with a possible final at month-end.",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No (May ≤ 50.8)",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Tariff and price-hike headlines persist, gas prices remain elevated, equities stay volatile, jobless claims edge up, and policy uncertainty remains high. Consumers continue to report worsening buying conditions and higher inflation expectations, nudging the index down into the high 40s/around 50.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Markets rebound and volatility eases, gas prices dip, tariff escalation pauses or is walked back, and/or a reassuring Fed communication reduces policy uncertainty. A modest mean-reversion bounce lifts sentiment to the low- to mid-50s (e.g., 51–54).",
    "rationale": "Status quo favors another very weak print. April’s preliminary 50.8 was the second-lowest on record, the fourth straight monthly decline, and followed an 11% drop from March and a ~30% slide since December. The Surveys of Consumers noted the decline was broad-based across demographics. Year-ahead inflation expectations spiked to 6.7% (highest since 1981), unemployment expectations rose for a fifth straight month to the highest since 2009, and the Conference Board LEI fell for four months. Policy and market uncertainty (tariffs, volatility, potential Fed leadership changes) and corporate price hikes (e.g., VW import surcharge; Temu, Shein, Hermès increases) all point to continued headwinds. These factors typically depress U-Mich sentiment, which is sensitive to price levels, job outlook, and market news. \n\nWhy not higher: Momentum is sharply negative, and new tariff-related price news likely persisted into late April/early May. At such low levels, equal-to-or-lower (≤50.8) remains the base case, especially given that ties (50.8) resolve No.\n\nWhy not lower: The index is near a historical floor, which raises the odds of a small bounce or noise-induced uptick. U-Mich prints are volatile month-to-month, and a modest rebound to just above 50.8 is plausible if markets steady or gas prices ease. Preliminary readings can move 1–3 points on sampling variance alone.\n\nUpdates that would lift my probability: Clear de-escalation on tariffs; visible declines in gas prices; a strong market rebound; reassuring Fed guidance; improving high-frequency labor data (claims stabilizing) and positive earnings/newsflow on jobs and wages.\n\nUpdates that would lower my probability: Further tariff escalation or pass-through price announcements; rising gas prices; continued equity selloff; deterioration in labor indicators; renewed policy turmoil.

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill the May 2025 University of Michigan Consumer Sentiment number be greater than it was for April 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nCNN: [US consumer sentiment plummets to second-lowest level on records going back to 1952](https://www.cnn.com/2025/04/11/economy/us-consumer-sentiment-april/index.html)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if the University of Michigan's reported Index of Consumer Sentiment, expected to be located [here](http://www.sca.isr.umich.edu/), is greater than 50.8 for May 2025. Less than or equal to that amount resolves the question as **No**.\n\nPreliminary results are sufficient to resolve the question. If there is any confusion about the number, Metaculus will resolve based on whatever number is posted at [this pdf](http://www.sca.isr.umich.edu/files/tbcics.pdf) that is labelled as May 2025, including preliminary. For example, on April 11, 2025 the number displayed was 50.8 for April 2025 (P).\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nThe preliminary University of Michigan Consumer Sentiment Index for April 2025 was 50.8, the second-lowest level since records began in 1952.

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
