  "information": "An executive order signed on March 7, 2025, aims to limit eligibility for the Public Service Loan Forgiveness (PSLF) program by altering the definition of 'public service'. The order directs the Department of Education and the Treasury Department to propose regulatory changes to make certain public-sector employees ineligible. Additionally, a provision within the House GOP's 2025 tax bill would grant the U.S. Treasury Secretary the authority to revoke the tax-exempt status of non-profits designated as 'terrorist supporting organizations,' which would disqualify their employees from the PSLF program.\n\nThe U.S. Department of Education is establishing a Negotiated Rulemaking Committee, named the Student Loans and Affordability Committee, tasked with developing proposed regulations for federal student aid programs. A key focus of this committee will be to refine the definition of qualifying employers for Public Service Loan Forgiveness eligibility. The deadline for nominations for negotiators was June 1, 2025, and the committee is scheduled to hold its first session from June 30 to July 2, 2025, with proposed and final rules anticipated for release later in 2025.\n\nThe Public Service Loan Forgiveness program is established by federal statute, specifically Section 455(m) of the Higher Education Act (codified at 20 U.S.C. §1087e(m)). Consequently, terminating the program is generally understood to require a new act of Congress. Unilateral executive action to end the program is considered to have uncertain legal standing and would require, at a minimum, a formal notice-of-proposed-rulemaking process, including a public comment period, before any changes could be finalized.",

    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Approximately 6.5 weeks until July 1, 2025",
    "status_quo_outcome": "The objective remains marked as 'in progress' on the spreadsheet",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "The rulemaking process continues but proposed regulations are not finalized by July 1. The PSLF program remains legally in effect under federal statute, with only preliminary steps taken toward limiting eligibility. The tracker maintainers do not consider these preliminary actions sufficient to mark the termination objective as complete.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "The Trump administration announces significant regulatory changes that they claim effectively end the PSLF program, and the Keep_Track community maintainers decide to mark the objective as complete based on these actions. Alternatively, Congress passes legislation terminating the program before July 1, though this is highly unlikely given the short timeframe.",
    "rationale": "The key constraint here is timing. The research shows that a Negotiated Rulemaking Committee is scheduled to hold its first session from June 30 to July 2, 2025 - essentially overlapping with the resolution date. Proposed and final rules are anticipated 'later in 2025,' which suggests they won't be finalized before July 1. Since the PSLF program is established by federal statute (20 U.S.C. §1087e(m)), true termination requires Congressional action, not just executive orders. While an executive order was signed on March 7 to limit eligibility, this doesn't constitute termination of the program. The timeline for the formal rulemaking process (notice-of-proposed-rulemaking, public comment period, final rule) extends well beyond July 1. The most likely outcome is that the program continues to legally exist with ongoing attempts to modify it, which the tracker maintainers would consider 'in progress' rather than 'complete.' For this to resolve Yes, either Congress would need to act (extremely unlikely in 6.5 weeks), or the tracker maintainers would need to interpret preliminary executive actions as sufficient to mark termination as complete (possible but unlikely given the program's continued legal existence). The base rate strongly favors status quo, as major policy changes typically move slower than this timeline allows. I would update higher if there were signs Congress planned to act quickly, or if the tracker maintainers had a history of marking objectives complete based on preliminary actions rather than actual completion. I would update lower if there were explicit statements from tracker maintainers about their standards for marking objectives complete.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill the Project 2025 Tracker spreadsheet have the objective of terminating the Public Service Loan Forgiveness program marked as complete before July 1, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nAt the time of this question, the objective was marked as \"in progress.\" The 2025 Tracker is a project of the Keep_Track subreddit and is explained [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/Keep_Track/comments/1ii7tbr/project_2025_tracker_is_now_live/).\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if the Project 2025 objective to \"terminate the Public Service Loan Forgiveness program\" is marked as complete according to [this spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1QGG6wNHna-1tt91yXNkOauAJJ7snobFjfEnmxlmzhl4/edit?gid=0#gid=0) before July 1, 2025.

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any).
