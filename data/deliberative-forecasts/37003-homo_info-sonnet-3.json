    "review": "Forecaster 3 raises a critical point I missed: the election timeline. They claim only 6 days remain until the election (placing it around April 27, 2025), whereas I assumed approximately 6 months. This dramatically changes the analysis. If Forecaster 3 is correct about both the timeline AND their cited polling data (SPÖ leading FPÖ by 16-19 points at 38-40% vs 21-24%), then 93% is well-justified - perhaps even conservative given that polling errors of such magnitude are rare, especially when combined with 80 years of SPÖ dominance.\n\nForecaster 2 provides valuable historical context (2020 results: SPÖ 41.6%, 46/100 seats) and correctly emphasizes base rate reasoning. Their 82% balances strong historical precedent against election uncertainty, though this might be too conservative if we're truly days away with a large polling lead.\n\nThe key question is the timeline. If we're 6 days out with consistent 16-19 point polling leads, my initial 72% significantly underestimated the probability. Late campaign movements that erase such leads are historically rare. However, I cannot independently verify Forecaster 3's specific polling numbers, which introduces some uncertainty.",
    "rationale": "Upon reflection, I believe I underestimated the probability due to timeline confusion. The question context (asking about a 2025 election when it's already April 2025, with March 2025 polling referenced) most logically suggests an imminent election, not one 6 months away. This aligns with Forecaster 3's analysis.\n\nKey factors supporting a higher forecast: (1) If the election is days away, time for dramatic shifts is minimal; (2) A 16-19 point lead (if accurate) would require unprecedented late movement to overcome; (3) 80 years of SPÖ victories represents extraordinary base rate strength; (4) Vienna's political culture and SPÖ infrastructure provide structural advantages.\n\nReasons for not going as high as 93%: (1) I cannot independently verify the specific polling numbers cited; (2) Seat allocation mechanics could theoretically produce surprises; (3) Maintaining epistemic humility about unforeseen late developments; (4) Small probability of polling systematic error.\n\nBalancing Forecaster 2's base-rate emphasis (82%) with Forecaster 3's data-driven confidence (93%), and accounting for information uncertainty, I'm updating significantly upward to 87%.",
