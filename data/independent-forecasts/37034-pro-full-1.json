  "information": "According to Baker Hughes data from mid-April 2025, the total number of active drilling rigs in the U.S. rose by 2 to 585. This followed a 7-rig dip in the prior week. The count of oil rigs rose by 1 to 481, and gas rigs also increased by 1 to 98. The total rig count is down by 34 compared to the same period in the previous year. Drilling activity in the Permian basin was steady at 289 rigs, which is 29 fewer than the previous year. The Frac Spread Count, which estimates the number of crews completing wells, fell by 10 to 195.\n\nAs of late April 2025, West Texas Intermediate (WTI) oil prices were around $64-$65 per barrel, after the American Petroleum Institute reported a decrease of 4.565 million barrels in U.S. crude oil inventories for the week ending April 18. This price is near the breakeven point for many drilling operations, which is estimated to be around $65 per barrel. A Dallas Fed survey of 130 energy firms in Texas, New Mexico, and Louisiana indicated that firms are dealing with increased costs, reduced rig counts, and layoffs. The survey's company outlook index decreased by 12 points, while the outlook uncertainty index increased by 21 points, with executives citing tariffs on steel (25%) as increasing costs for casing and tubing.\n\nSeveral major energy and service companies reported on their performance in Q1 2025. Halliburton reported declining profits in North America due to decreased drilling activity. Baker Hughes' oilfield services division saw a 10% sequential drop in revenue. In contrast, Occidental Petroleum announced a capital expenditures plan of $7 billion to $7.2 billion for 2025, with $3.7 billion allocated to the Permian Basin. The company plans to operate 24 gross drilling rigs and bring 500 to 550 new wells online in the Permian during the year.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Approximately five weeks, as the question resolves based on the report for the week ending May 30, 2025.",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No. The most recently reported rig count is 585, which is not less than 583.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "A modest increase in oil prices or stabilization of drilling costs encourages operators to maintain or add rigs. Capital spending from larger companies provides a floor for drilling activity, preventing the net rig count from falling by the 3 rigs needed to dip below the 583 threshold.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "The recent downward trend in drilling activity continues, driven by stagnant WTI oil prices around the breakeven point, persistent high operating costs, and negative industry sentiment. A net decrease of at least 3 rigs occurs over the next five weeks, bringing the total count below 583.",
    "rationale": "My forecast is based on an analysis of current market conditions, recent trends, and forward-looking industry indicators. The current rig count is 585, only slightly above the resolution threshold of 583. While this makes the status quo outcome 'No,' the prevailing evidence suggests a decline is more likely than not.\n\nSeveral key factors support a 'Yes' outcome. First, there is a clear year-over-year downward trend, with the rig count down by 34. Second, recent sentiment indicators are bearish; a Dallas Fed survey highlighted increased costs, a deteriorating outlook, and rising uncertainty among energy firms. Third, major oilfield service companies like Halliburton and Baker Hughes have reported declining revenues in North America, directly reflecting lower activity levels. Finally, West Texas Intermediate (WTI) oil prices are hovering near the estimated breakeven point of ~$65/barrel, providing little incentive for new drilling.\n\nMy probability is not higher because the margin is extremely thin. A net decrease of only 3 rigs is required to flip the outcome to 'Yes'. Weekly rig count data is volatile, and a small, short-term increase could easily keep the count at 583 or above. Additionally, announced capital expenditure plans from some large producers like Occidental could partially offset declines from smaller operators.\n\nMy probability is not lower because the weight of the macro and industry-specific evidence points strongly towards continued contraction or stagnation in drilling activity. The combination of the long-term trend, negative executive sentiment, and weak pricing environment makes a further decline more probable than an increase or stabilization over the next month.\n\nI would update my forecast towards 'Yes' if WTI prices were to drop below $60 or if the next weekly report showed a significant decrease. Conversely, I would update towards 'No' if oil prices were to rise decisively above $70 or if the next two weekly reports showed rig count additions.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill the number of active US drilling rigs be less than 583 for the week ending May 30, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nSeekingAlpha: [U.S. rig count falls for third straight week, Baker Hughes says](https://seekingalpha.com/news/4430543-u-s-rig-count-falls-for-third-straight-week-baker-hughes-says)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if the last count of active US drilling rigs for the week ending May 30, 2025, according to the [Baker Hughes North America Rig Count](https://rigcount.bakerhughes.com/na-rig-count), is less than 583. Specifically, it will resolve based on the number listed as the United States Total for the most recent week in the May 30, 2025 North America Rig Count Report. This is the number of active drilling rigs and includes the total of those classified as gas, oil and miscellaneous, in every US location including inland waters, land and offshore.\n\nIf no report dated May 30, 2025, is released before June 1, 2025, Eastern Time, Metaculus may resolve this question using the most recent report available dated between May 23, 2025, and June 1, 2025, inclusive.

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
