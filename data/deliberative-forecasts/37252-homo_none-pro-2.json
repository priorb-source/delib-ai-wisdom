    "review": "The other two forecasters and I are in strong agreement, with forecasts in a narrow 75-80% range. We all identify the hypothetical December 2024 martial law declaration as the primary driver, creating a high-tension political environment conducive to large protests. Forecaster 3's reasoning closely mirrored my own, including the final probability, and helpfully articulated the main downside risk as 'public fatigue' setting in after several months. Forecaster 2's analysis was particularly persuasive in raising a point I had not explicitly considered: an 'impeachment process' as the specific, ongoing mechanism fueling public grievance. This provides a more concrete and durable catalyst for protests than the general 'political inertia' I had initially focused on.",
    "rationale": "My initial forecast of 75% was based on the severe political instability expected to follow a martial law declaration in a democracy like South Korea. After reviewing my peers' analyses, I am slightly increasing my forecast. The core reasoning remains the same, but Forecaster 2's specific identification of an ongoing 'impeachment process' provides a crucial, concrete focal point for continued public mobilization. An impeachment process is not a single event but a prolonged period of political conflict with numerous potential flashpoints (hearings, votes, rulings) that can easily trigger protests exceeding the 10,000-person threshold. This specific mechanism makes a quiet two-month period less likely and serves as a powerful counterargument to the risk of 'public fatigue' mentioned by Forecaster 3. The addition of this specific driver strengthens the case for a 'Yes' outcome. Therefore, I am making a small upward adjustment to my forecast to reflect an increased confidence that at least one large protest will occur and be recorded before the deadline.",
