  "information": "The Bangladeshi interim government has publicly stated that securing Sheikh Hasina's extradition from India is a 'top priority.' A formal request for her extradition, along with supporting documents, was submitted to India in December 2024. As of February 2025, India had not officially responded to the request. A spokesperson for Bangladesh's foreign ministry indicated that a formal reminder would be sent to India regarding the extradition at an 'appropriate time' to be determined by the country's political leadership.",

    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "About 54 days (until July 1, 2025)",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No — she remains outside Bangladesh through June 30, 2025.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "India does not act on Bangladesh’s extradition request in the next several weeks, and Hasina does not voluntarily travel to Bangladesh due to legal and security risks. She stays in India or relocates to a third country.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "A politically driven, expedited extradition or deportation from India occurs, or Hasina voluntarily flies/lands in Bangladesh under an arrangement (e.g., assurances or a legal deal), with credible media confirming her entry before July 1.",
    "rationale": "Window is short and the status quo favors non-return. According to the assistant’s report: (1) Bangladesh submitted a formal extradition request to India in Dec 2024; (2) as of Feb 2025 India had not officially responded; (3) Bangladesh plans to send a reminder at an “appropriate time.” This implies no clear momentum or timetable. Extraditions of high-profile political figures typically take months unless there is a top-level political decision. There is no public indication from New Delhi of imminent action, and Dhaka’s own signaling sounds procedural rather than urgent. Voluntary return also looks unlikely in the near term: Hasina faces legal jeopardy and security risks, while political conditions in Bangladesh remain unsettled. While Hasina has vowed to return (per Firstpost), such statements do not establish a near-term schedule and can be aimed at maintaining political support. Upside risk exists: the interim government prioritizes extradition, and India could decide to facilitate a transfer quickly for strategic reasons, or Hasina could stage a surprise return. But absent fresh, credible signals (e.g., India agreeing to extradite, detention pending removal, travel notifications, or a publicized return plan), the base case is continued exile for the next 7 weeks. Not higher because: no formal Indian assent, known bureaucratic/political delays, and safety/legal deterrents for voluntary return. Not lower because: stated extradition priority, the possibility of a political decision overriding normal timelines, and Hasina’s expressed intent to return. I would move higher on: official Indian approval or concrete steps toward transfer, credible reports of Hasina’s imminent travel to Bangladesh, or a political deal guaranteeing her entry. I would move lower on: India’s explicit refusal, credible reports she relocates to a third country, or clear Bangladeshi de-prioritization of the case.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill Sheikh Hasina return to Bangladesh before July 1, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nFirstpost: [Bangladesh has turned into a ‘terrorist country’: Sheikh Hasina targets Yunus, vows to return](https://www.firstpost.com/world/bangladesh-has-turned-into-a-terrorist-country-sheikh-hasina-targets-yunus-vows-to-return-13878191.html)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if Sheikh Hasina after May 12, 2025 and before July 1, 2025 enters territory of Bangladesh according to [credible sources](https://www.metaculus.com/help/faq/#definitions).\n\nThe circumstances of her entering Bangladeshi territory, whether voluntarily or due to her extradition from India, will not affect resolution.\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nThe Bangladeshi interim government has publicly stated that securing Sheikh Hasina's extradition from India is a 'top priority.'

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
