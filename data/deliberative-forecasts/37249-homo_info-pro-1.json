    "review": "The other forecasters provide two compelling and somewhat opposing perspectives that add nuance to my initial analysis. Forecaster 2 makes a very strong case for the plausibility of a rapid shift by identifying the imminent May 1st local elections as a specific catalyst that could create a 'bandwagon effect' for Reform. This mechanism for acceleration is a concrete factor I had not fully weighed. Conversely, Forecaster 3 introduces an excellent structural argument against the 'Yes' outcome: the fragmentation of the vote in a 'five party politics' environment. This makes achieving a dominant 4-point lead significantly harder than simply becoming the most popular party, a crucial distinction. Forecaster 3's data point on the softness of Labour's support (60% loyalty) also provides a strong counter to the idea of an unbreakable 'honeymoon period'. Both analyses were highly convincing and highlighted factors I had previously understated.",
    "rationale": "After reviewing my peers' analyses, I am making a small downward adjustment to my forecast. My initial 15% was based on the tension between Reform's powerful momentum in individual polls and the significant inertia of the Politico poll-of-polls aggregator. Forecaster 2's argument about the local elections as a catalyst convinced me that a rapid convergence is more plausible than I initially thought, which would argue for increasing my forecast. However, I found Forecaster 3's point about vote fragmentation to be a more powerful structural barrier. Even if Reform surges, as seems likely, in a system with 4-5 viable parties, achieving a consistent 4-point lead over the second-place party is an extremely high bar. The surge could simply result in a tighter bunching of the top three parties rather than a clear lead for Reform. The combination of a lagging aggregator (my initial point) and the structural difficulty of getting a 4-point lead in a fragmented field (Forecaster 3's point) now outweighs the potential for a catalysing event (Forecaster 2's point). Therefore, I am reducing my forecast slightly from 15% to 12%, to better reflect this very specific and difficult resolution criterion.",
