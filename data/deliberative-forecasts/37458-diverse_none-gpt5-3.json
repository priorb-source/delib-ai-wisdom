    "review": "Forecaster 2 adds a key constraint I underweighted: if Trump is not the sitting U.S. president, Beijing has strong protocol and political reasons to avoid (and certainly not publicly acknowledge) a leader-level call. Given the both-sides-acknowledgment requirement, that makes a Yes outcome very hard in that scenario. Their 5% feels plausible for the private-citizen case, though I think it’s slightly conservative given the possibility of an acute crisis. Forecaster 3’s 40% seems high. They overstate the base rate for a narrow 33-day window and don’t grapple with the possibility that Trump is not in office; they also slightly misstate the eligible days. They do, however, correctly emphasize the friction added by the mutual-acknowledgment requirement and the need for preparatory signals.",
    "rationale": "I’m updating downward by explicitly scenario-weighting Trump’s status, which I left implicit before. If Trump is President, a leader call within May 13–June 14 is conceivable but still not a base-case in such a short window without a clear catalyst; I’d put that around 20–30% given normal readout practices would satisfy the acknowledgment constraint. If Trump is not President, the probability of a mutually acknowledged call is very low (roughly 3–7%) due to protocol and Beijing’s incentives, reinforced by past denials highlighted in the background. Without current information to resolve which scenario we’re in, I blend these: assuming roughly even-to-moderate odds he is President, the combined probability lands in the mid-to-high teens. I’m therefore lowering from 24% to 17%. I would move up if there are credible reports of a planned leader call, coordinated press guidance, or a clear catalytic event (e.g., major tariff action) with signals of leader-level engagement. I would move down if Beijing explicitly rules out leader-level contact with non-office-holders, or if there are repeated public denials after U.S. claims of contact.",
