    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Exactly 2 months, from May 1, 2025 to July 1, 2025",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No - North Korea does not test a nuclear weapon. This is the status quo since North Korea has not conducted a nuclear test since September 2017, approximately 8 years ago.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "North Korea continues its current trajectory of refraining from nuclear tests. While they may continue conventional military exercises and ballistic missile tests, they choose not to cross the nuclear threshold due to international pressure, sanctions concerns, ongoing diplomatic considerations with regional powers, or internal strategic calculations about the optimal timing for such a provocative action.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "North Korea conducts its seventh nuclear test in response to escalating geopolitical tensions, domestic political considerations, or as a strategic signal to the international community. This could occur with little warning, as North Korea has historically conducted tests with limited advance notice, leveraging them for maximum political impact during moments of their choosing.",
    "rationale": "The most important factor is the strong status quo: North Korea has not tested a nuclear weapon in approximately 8 years (since September 2017). This represents their longest gap between tests since beginning their nuclear program, suggesting a stable equilibrium where they are not actively testing. Looking at historical patterns: tests occurred in 2006, 2009 (3-year gap), 2013 (4-year gap), 2016 twice, and 2017 (close together). The clustering in 2016-2017 was followed by the longest dormant period yet. \n\nThe timeframe is critical - only 2 months remain until the resolution date. Nuclear tests require preparation, including potential tunnel work at test sites, which intelligence agencies typically detect. There are no reported indicators of imminent testing activity according to the research assistant's report. \n\nWhy not lower (below 5%): North Korea has demonstrated both the capability and willingness to conduct nuclear tests across multiple administrations. They have a history of unpredictable provocations and could use a test as diplomatic leverage or as a show of force. Two months provides enough time for a test if the decision were made. Geopolitical situations can change rapidly. \n\nWhy not higher (above 10%): The 8-year gap is historically significant and suggests sustainable deterrence from sanctions and international pressure. No specific intelligence or warnings have been mentioned. The short 2-month window limits opportunities. North Korea would face severe diplomatic and economic consequences. Most forecasting literature emphasizes that status quo outcomes are more likely than changes, especially over short timeframes. \n\nTo update higher, I would need: credible intelligence reports of test site preparation, significant escalation in regional tensions, explicit threats from North Korean leadership about imminent testing, or precedents of tests occurring with similar warning timelines. To update lower: explicit diplomatic commitments from North Korea, verified dismantling of test sites, or credible reporting that leadership has decided against near-term testing.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill North Korea test a nuclear weapon before July 1, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nAccording to Wikipedia, \"North Korea has conducted six nuclear tests, in 2006, 2009, 2013, twice in 2016, and in 2017.\"\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if before July 1, 2025, North Korea tests a nuclear weapon, according to [credible source](https://www.metaculus.com/help/faq/#definitions) reporting such as the [International Monitoring System’s ](https://www.ctbto.org/our-work/detecting-nuclear-tests) and the sources cited at Wikipedia's [List of nuclear weapons tests of North Korea](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_nuclear_weapons_tests_of_North_Korea).\n\n\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nNo additional information available.\n\nToday is 2025-05-01.\n\nBefore answering you think:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n(e) You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
