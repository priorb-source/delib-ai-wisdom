    "review": "Forecaster 2 provides excellent quantitative grounding with the year-over-year trend calculation (34k increase from Feb 2024 to Feb 2025, projecting to only ~509k by May). Their insight about builder responsiveness to inventory is crucial - homebuilders don't passively watch inventory pile up; they adjust construction and offer incentives. Forecaster 3 makes the strongest empirical argument: this series changes slowly (typically low single-digit thousands monthly), and requiring ~17k/month increases would be ~6x the recent trend rate. Their emphasis on status quo bias and typical series behavior is methodologically sound. Both forecasters identified similar mechanisms (demand shock, sales freeze) needed for YES, reinforcing these are tail scenarios rather than base cases.",
    "rationale": "Upon review, I was too high at 30%. The trend extrapolation is damning: at the Feb 2024-2025 pace (~2.8k/month), we'd reach only ~508k by May. To hit 550k requires approximately 16.7k/month growth - about 6 times faster than the recent trend. This acceleration seems unlikely absent a serious demand shock. However, I won't go as low as 12% because: (1) we're already at 18-year highs showing real momentum, (2) if mortgage rates remain elevated while completions continue, inventory could accumulate faster than the linear trend suggests, and (3) the background emphasizes we're in unprecedented territory. Forecaster 2's 35% seems too optimistic given the math, but their identified mechanisms (demand freeze, elevated supply) are real risks. I'm settling between them, closer to Forecaster 3's conservative view but acknowledging meaningful tail risk.",
