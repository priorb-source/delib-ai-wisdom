    "review": "All three analyses converge on 30-35%, which increases my confidence in this range. Forecaster 2 makes a compelling point I underweighted: the Kremlin has now stated *twice* in five weeks (April 4 and May 5) that no calls are planned, suggesting a consistent diplomatic posture rather than one-off messaging. This repetition is a stronger signal than I initially credited. Forecaster 3 raises an important technical point about the acknowledgment requirement—both sides must confirm the call occurred. While Trump-Putin calls are too high-profile to likely go unacknowledged, political optics could theoretically prevent acknowledgment, adding a small additional hurdle beyond just 'did they speak.' Both forecasters appropriately emphasized that the status quo is 'no planned call' with explicit Kremlin statements to that effect, which should be weighted more heavily than I did initially.",
    "rationale": "Reviewing the evidence with all analyses in mind: The Kremlin's repeated messaging (April 4 and May 5) about no near-term calls and the need for 'adequate preparation' is stronger counter-evidence than I initially assessed. Making such statements twice in five weeks suggests a deliberate diplomatic posture, not casual dismissal. However, the precedent of two calls in early 2025 (establishing a roughly 5-6 week cadence), the volatile Ukraine situation, Trump's informal diplomatic style, and his mid-May Gulf trip remain legitimate upside factors. The 34-day window provides sufficient time for circumstances to change, but we're now one week away from the window opening with zero indication of planning. The acknowledgment requirement adds a minor additional hurdle. Balancing these factors, I'm adjusting slightly downward to align with the consensus range, specifically matching Forecaster 3's comprehensive analysis at 32%.",
