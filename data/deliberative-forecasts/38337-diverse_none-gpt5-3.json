    "review": "Forecaster 2’s argument that the short-horizon baseline is a 215–235k range with a slight central tendency above 220k aligns with my prior view and is consistent with a gradually cooling labor market under restrictive policy. The emphasis on near-term persistence and revision risk is persuasive for a modestly >50% call. Forecaster 3 appropriately highlights high week-to-week volatility, the small but real effect of the strict “>220k” threshold, and limited seasonal distortions in June. However, their 42% seems low relative to the evidence of mild softening and the recent central tendency that appears closer to the low-220s than to 210–215. The “exceed vs. meet” point is technically true but likely has only a marginal effect given the 1–5k typical noise and revisions. Net, F2 nudges me slightly higher; F3’s caution tempers confidence but doesn’t outweigh the mild upward tilt.",
    "rationale": "Baseline conditions still point to initial claims hovering around the low- to mid-220s, with continuing claims elevated versus a year ago and hiring momentum slower, all consistent with a mildly cooling labor market. Over a three-week horizon, absent a shock, the distribution around 220k looks symmetric-to-slightly-right, making “>220k” a bit more likely than not. I also account for small revisions that could flip a near-threshold print. Forecaster 2’s framing of the current range and drivers adds weight to the slight-Yes tilt; Forecaster 3’s emphasis on volatility argues against a strong view but doesn’t push me below 50%. Accordingly, I’m making a small upward adjustment from 56% to 58% to reflect that the central tendency appears a touch above 220k while recognizing near-term noise could easily produce a sub-220k print.",
