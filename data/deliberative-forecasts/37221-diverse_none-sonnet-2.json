    "review": "Forecaster 3 raises a critical argument I completely overlooked: the Easter timing effect. Easter 2025 falls in April (versus March 2024), which historically elevates April services prices for travel and hospitality in year-over-year comparisons. This is a concrete, mechanistic factor specific to April 2025. Additionally, Forecaster 3 correctly reframes the question: if the status quo is 'mid-2s' (suggesting 2.3-2.5%), then being ABOVE 2.2% may actually be the base case, and falling below would require a downside surprise. This is the opposite of how I initially framed it. Forecaster 2's analysis (40%) aligns closely with my original view, emphasizing the disinflationary trend but acknowledging sticky services inflation. However, neither of us considered the Easter calendar effect. The gap between Forecaster 2/me (38-40%) and Forecaster 3 (80%) is substantial. While I find the Easter argument compelling and the reframing of 'mid-2s as status quo' persuasive, 80% seems too high given the documented downward revisions in February and ongoing ECB policy pressure. The Easter effect is one factor, not determinative.",
    "rationale": "Upon reflection, I underweighted the importance of where inflation actually stands versus the 2.2% threshold. If recent readings are genuinely in the 'mid-2s' range (2.3-2.5%), then 2.2% is closer to the lower end of recent performance, not the upper end. The Easter calendar effect in April 2025—which I completely missed—adds upward pressure on services inflation compared to April 2024. This combination suggests being above 2.2% is more likely than my initial 38% implied. However, I maintain some caution: the March news specifically mentioned 'downward revisions' to February, the ECB's restrictive policy continues to work, and persistent disinflationary forces remain in goods and food. The question asks for ABOVE 2.2%, not at or around it, so there's still meaningful probability of landing at exactly 2.2% or slightly below. I'm updating significantly upward to reflect the Easter effect and better baseline positioning, but stopping short of Forecaster 3's 80% to preserve probability weight on the documented downward momentum.",
