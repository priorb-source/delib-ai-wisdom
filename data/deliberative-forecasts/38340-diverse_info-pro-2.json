    "review": "All three forecasters, including myself, agree that the probability of Sudan ratifying the AfCFTA before July 1, 2025, is very low. The ongoing civil war, lack of a functioning legislature, and the extremely short timeframe are the dominant factors for all of us. However, the other two forecasters introduced a key argument that I had not sufficiently weighed: the possibility of ratification via executive decree without a legislature. Forecaster 2 was particularly persuasive in framing this as a potential 'low-cost legitimacy signal' for the internationally recognized government to curry favor with regional bodies. My initial analysis was too heavily anchored on the standard legislative process and only considered a 'black swan' peace deal as a path to 'Yes.' Their argument for a non-standard, politically motivated executive action is a more plausible, though still highly unlikely, scenario.",
    "rationale": "I am updating my forecast upward from 1% to 4%. My initial assessment remains largely intact: the civil war and institutional collapse in Sudan make ratification within the next 25 days extraordinarily unlikely. However, the other forecasters convinced me that I was under-weighting a specific, plausible pathway to a 'Yes' outcome. My initial 1% forecast was based almost entirely on the remote chance of a sudden peace accord. The other forecasters correctly identified the possibility that Sudan's recognized executive body could ratify the treaty by decree as a political and diplomatic maneuver. This does not require a functioning legislature or an end to the war; it only requires the political will of the Sovereign Council and the administrative ability to deposit the instrument of ratification with the AU. While I still believe this is a very low-probability event, as the government's focus is almost certainly on the war itself, it is a more concrete and likely scenario than my initial 'black swan' theory. This warrants a modest increase to my forecast to account for this non-standard, but possible, pathway to ratification.",
