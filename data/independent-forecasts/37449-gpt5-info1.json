  "information": "In April 2025, China conducted the \"Strait Thunder-2025A\" military exercises, which involved dozens of aircraft and warships. According to a spokesperson for the Chinese Eastern Theater Command, the operation aimed to test China's capabilities in \"controlling zones\" and \"blockading\" Taiwan, and included simulations of \"strikes on key ports and energy infrastructure.\" Following these and other drills, US military officials, including US Pacific Army Commander Ronald P. Clark and US Indo-Pacific Command Commander Admiral Samuel Paparo, stated that China's exercises simulating a blockade of Taiwan have become a \"regular occurrence\" and that Beijing is rehearsing the \"full spectrum of military operations.\"",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "About 56 days (until July 1, 2025)",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No — the U.S. does not publicly accuse China of blockading any Taiwanese seaport.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "China continues large-scale drills, air and naval incursions, and gray-zone pressure (including around Kinmen/Matsu) without physically preventing merchant traffic to major Taiwanese ports. The U.S. condemns “coercive” and “destabilizing” actions and “simulated blockade” drills but avoids the explicit term “blockade.”",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Around/after Taiwan’s May 20 inauguration, China imposes exclusion/inspection zones that close approaches to a major port (e.g., Kaohsiung, Keelung, Taichung), with PLAN/CCG turning away or delaying commercial ships. Taipei protests publicly. The U.S. State Department, White House, Defense Department, or Congress explicitly accuses China of “blockading” at least one Taiwanese seaport.",
    "rationale": "- Status quo and incentives: An actual blockade of a Taiwanese seaport would be a major escalation with high economic and military risk for Beijing and could trigger strong international responses. Historically, Beijing has preferred coercive drills and grey-zone tactics rather than crossing the blockade threshold. The U.S. typically avoids using the legally and politically charged term “blockade” unless the facts are unmistakable, to limit escalation. With less than two months left, the base case is no accusation.\n- Recent pattern: Per the research assistant, April 2025’s “Strait Thunder-2025A” and other exercises simulated port strikes and blockade operations. U.S. commanders have described these as rehearsals that are now regular. This reinforces that China is preparing and signaling capability but has not yet executed an actual blockade.\n- Near-term risk factors: Taiwan’s May 20 inauguration raises the probability of a sharp demonstration. Beijing could announce “maritime traffic control,” “quarantine,” or “inspection” regimes near port approaches. If these materially impede access to a specific port, U.S. officials might adopt “blockade” language—especially if commercial AIS shows diversions/loitering and Taipei labels it a blockade. Congress is also more willing than the Executive to use the term, which marginally raises odds.\n- Why not higher: No precedent of the U.S. accusing a PRC blockade of Taiwan’s ports; Beijing has so far stayed below that threshold. The U.S. has strong incentives to avoid the blockade label absent clear, sustained interference at a port.\n- Why not lower: The inauguration window and China’s increasingly assertive CCG/PLAN posture create tail risk of an exclusion/inspection regime that effectively closes a port’s approaches, forcing U.S. rhetoric to sharpen.\n- What would move me up: PRC maritime safety announcements closing approach channels to a named Taiwanese port; repeated PLAN/CCG hailing/boarding/turn-backs of merchant vessels bound for that port; visible shipping disruptions (AIS-based diversions) and Taipei publicly alleging a blockade, followed by sharper U.S. language.\n- What would move me down: Inauguration passes with only routine drills; no closures near port approaches; continued U.S. avoidance of “blockade” terminology; signs of de-escalation in maritime notices.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill the United States accuse the People's Republic of China of blockading Taiwan before July 1, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nWSJ via MSN: [China Is Ready to Blockade Taiwan.

These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if, before July 1, 2025, the US government publicly accuses the People's Republic of China of blockading at least one of Taiwan's seaports without consent from the Taiwanese government in Taipei.\n\n\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nIn April 2025, China conducted the \"Strait Thunder-2025A\" military exercises, which involved dozens of aircraft and warships.

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any).

Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
