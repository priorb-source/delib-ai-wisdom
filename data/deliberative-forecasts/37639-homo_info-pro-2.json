    "review": "My initial forecast of 5% was in strong agreement with Forecaster 2, as we both focused on the very short timeframe and the high procedural barrier created by an active federal court case and a temporary restraining order (TRO). Forecaster 3 provided a compelling counter-perspective, arguing that intense and specific political will from the executive branch (65% forecast) could overcome this institutional friction. Forecaster 3's argument about high-level political pressure is a crucial variable I had not fully weighted. Forecaster 2 also added the useful detail that there is a parallel BIA appeal, which adds another layer of procedural delay, strengthening the case for a 'No' resolution.",
    "rationale": "I am updating my forecast slightly upward in response to the deliberation. My initial analysis was correct that the primary obstacle to a 'Yes' outcome is the federal judiciary. A judge has already extended a TRO, finding Khalil's claims 'plausible,' which is a strong indicator that the court will not be rushed into a decision. The timeline of under seven weeks is extremely short for resolving such a matter against the petitioner's will. However, Forecaster 3's point about extraordinary political pressure from the Trump administration is valid and increases the probability that the government will use every possible lever to expedite the case. While I believe it is very unlikely this pressure will be sufficient to force a final judicial resolution and subsequent deportation before July 1, the possibility is greater than in a standard case. Therefore, I am raising my probability to account for this increased, albeit still small, chance of an unusually rapid, politically-motivated outcome. I am not moving higher because the power of a federal judge's TRO is a formidable and direct obstacle that political will cannot simply bypass; it must be overcome through a legal process that takes time. My confidence in a 'No' outcome remains high, but I acknowledge the tail risk of an expedited process is larger than I first estimated.",
