    "review": "Forecaster 2’s emphasis on the three-month delay since Lula’s invitation is a strong and underweighted negative signal in my initial take. Major-leader participation at summits is typically locked in weeks in advance and often telegraphed; continued ambiguity into early June increases the likelihood Uruguay opts for a lower-level delegation. I find this persuasive and it pulls me down. \n\nForecaster 3 introduces a claimed scheduling conflict (Seville Jun 30–Jul 3). If accurate, it explains the hesitation, but with BRICS reportedly set for July 6–7 and this question resolving by July 1 (announcement only), the travel overlap isn’t decisive. A president could announce in late June and still attend after Seville, so I don’t find this argument as weighty for this question. I would want a source; absent that, I treat it as a modest negative (planning complexity) rather than a near-blocker.\n\nNet: Forecaster 2’s “silence as signal” point is convincing and warrants a material downward adjustment; Forecaster 3’s conflict, even if true, does not by itself justify a 10% probability for an announcement by July 1.",
    "rationale": "Key considerations:\n- Timing and protocol: As of early June, there is no official confirmation. For head-of-state participation, many governments announce travel 1–3 weeks in advance. The lack of movement by now is a genuine negative signal that Uruguay may either keep options open until very late or choose to send the foreign minister instead (which would resolve No).\n- Incentives to say Yes: Low travel cost (Rio), Lula’s personal invite, ideological proximity to Brazil’s government, and Uruguay’s interest in diversifying ties (e.g., prior openness to China) all support a potential acceptance. As a guest, the political cost is manageable.\n- Reasons for No (or delay): Balancing Western ties, not wanting to signal alignment with BRICS geopolitically; a new administration’s domestic agenda; and standard caution—Uruguay often opts for pragmatism and may prefer representation below presidential level. The absence of any credible leak or provisional attendee listing is notable.\n- Scheduling: A late-June Seville trip (if correct) complicates but does not preclude attendance or an announcement by July 1; it slightly lowers the likelihood of a timely decision being communicated but isn’t determinative.\n\nUpdate: I’m lowering my probability substantially from 56% to reflect the accumulated negative from prolonged silence and the plausible preference to send a lower-level delegate. I remain above 30% due to the clear diplomatic upside, proximity, and low cost of a late confirmation.\n\nWhat would move me up: a Presidency/MRREE hint of Orsi’s Brazil travel, Brazilian hosts listing Orsi among confirmed guests, or Uruguayan media citing imminent confirmation. Down: any indication that the foreign minister will represent Uruguay, or continued silence into the last 10 days of June.",
