  "information": "In the 2019 and 2021 Canadian federal elections, the Bloc Québécois won 32 seats in Quebec, while the Conservative Party of Canada won 10 seats in each of those elections. Historically, the Bloc has won more seats in Quebec than the Conservatives in the last five to seven elections.\n\nRecent polling data shows a shift in voter support in Quebec. Bloc Québécois support has declined from 37% to a range of 23-27%. Conservative support has remained stable at approximately 23%. The Liberal Party has seen its support surge to between 40-42%. Aggregated polls from sources like Nanos, CROP, Abacus Data, and Ipsos show the Bloc leading the Conservatives by 5 to 17 percentage points province-wide.\n\nSeat projection models, including Canada388 and The Writ, estimate the Bloc Québécois will win between 19 and 25 seats. Projections for the Conservative Party place their seat count between 10 and 12. The increase in Liberal support is reported to primarily affect the Bloc's vote share rather than the Conservatives'. The Conservative party's support is most concentrated in the Quebec City region and its south shore.",

    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Approximately 6 months until the Canadian federal election scheduled for October 20, 2025",
    "status_quo_outcome": "The Bloc Québécois wins more seats in Quebec than the Conservative Party, as it has consistently done in recent elections and as current projections suggest",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "The Conservative Party experiences a significant surge in Quebec support over the next 6 months, potentially capitalizing on dissatisfaction with the Liberal government while the Bloc's support continues to erode. The Liberals' gains disproportionately hurt the Bloc while Conservative support grows beyond their Quebec City base, allowing them to win 13+ seats compared to the Bloc's declining total",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "The current polling and seat projection trends hold relatively steady through October. Despite the Liberal surge reducing Bloc support, the Bloc maintains its 5-17 point lead over Conservatives province-wide, translating to approximately 19-25 seats compared to the Conservatives' 10-12 seats. The Conservatives remain concentrated in the Quebec City region with limited province-wide appeal",
    "rationale": "Multiple factors strongly favor the Bloc maintaining their seat advantage over the Conservatives in Quebec. Historically, the Bloc won 32 seats to the Conservatives' 10 in both 2019 and 2021, establishing a clear baseline. Current seat projection models from Canada388 and The Writ estimate the Bloc will win 19-25 seats compared to 10-12 for the Conservatives. Even at the Bloc's lower bound and Conservatives' upper bound, the Bloc would still lead 19-12. Province-wide polling shows the Bloc leading Conservatives by 5-17 percentage points (23-27% vs 23%), despite the Bloc's decline from 37% support. The research indicates the Liberal surge to 40-42% is primarily eating into Bloc support rather than Conservative support, yet the Bloc maintains its lead. Conservative support remains concentrated in the Quebec City region, limiting their ability to win seats across the broader province. The Bloc's focus exclusively on Quebec interests provides structural advantages the Conservatives lack. I'm not forecasting higher (e.g., 90%+) because six months remains before the election, allowing time for significant shifts. Campaign dynamics, unexpected events, or continued Bloc erosion could narrow the gap. The Conservative Party could potentially mobilize new support or the Liberal surge could disproportionately damage the Bloc. I'm not forecasting lower (e.g., 50-60%) because the current gap is substantial across multiple indicators, the historical pattern is clear, there's no evidence of Conservative momentum in Quebec, and the structural factors favor the Bloc. For me to revise upward, I'd need to see the Bloc stabilize or rebound in polling, or seat projections widen the gap further. For me to revise downward, I'd need evidence of Conservative surge in Quebec polling beyond their traditional base, or projections showing the Conservatives approaching 15+ seats while the Bloc falls below 15",
