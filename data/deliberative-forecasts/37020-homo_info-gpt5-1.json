    "review": "Both forecasters sharpened two key points: (1) category correlation risk is real—if voters cool on “I Had Some Help,” Malone can miss across Single/Song/Music Event/Video; (2) ACMs often reward major commercial impact, which favors this track. Forecaster 2 added the Grammys 0–18 stat; I don’t find that especially probative for ACM behavior given different electorates and genre identity—ACMs have recently embraced high-profile crossovers (e.g., Luke Combs’ Fast Car). Both rightly emphasize that four nominations materially raise the at-least-one-win base rate. Net, I find their correlation emphasis a useful tempering factor and their commercial-impact argument reinforcing; overall, their reasoning nudges me slightly down from my initial estimate rather than up.",
    "rationale": "Clarifying the setup: Malone appears to have four ACM nominations, all tied to “I Had Some Help” and adjacent categories (Single, Song, Music Event, Video/Visual), not Album of the Year—so the paths to a win are concentrated but still multiple. The single was arguably the cycle’s dominant commercial moment, and ACM voters have a history of rewarding radio and marquee collaborations, giving Malone strong chances in Single or Music Event in particular. Offsetting that, outcomes across these categories are correlated: if voters favor a core-country alternative (Lainey Wilson, Chris Stapleton, Luke Combs, Zach Bryan) or hesitate on a pop-to-country crossover, Malone could plausibly be shut out across all four. The Grammys shutout is weak evidence for ACM behavior. Balancing multiple bites at the apple and commercial strength against correlated risk and tough fields, I trim slightly from my prior while staying clearly above 50%.",
