  "information": "According to multiple South Korean industry and government sources from January 2025, South Korea and Vietnam were in the final stages of negotiating a deal for South Korea to export K9 self-propelled howitzers. The proposed agreement was reported to involve the sale of approximately 20 K9 units for a value of around $300 million. The deal was expected to be finalized in the first quarter of 2025 and would mark South Korea's first arms export to Vietnam. If completed, Vietnam would become the 10th foreign country to acquire the K9 system.\n\nActions preceding the final negotiations included a visit by Vietnamese Defense Minister Gen. Phan Van Giang to South Korea in February 2023. During his visit, he inspected a South Korean army unit operating the K9 and received a briefing from the manufacturer, Hanwha Aerospace. In November 2024, Vietnamese troops also participated in a training program in South Korea for using the K9 howitzer. The two nations had elevated their relationship to a 'comprehensive strategic partnership' in 2022, and South Korea has previously provided military aid to Vietnam, including two decommissioned corvettes.\n\nThe potential purchase is part of Vietnam's broader effort to diversify its arms suppliers, moving away from its traditional reliance on Russian equipment. The deal is situated within a complex regional security environment, particularly Vietnam's ongoing territorial disputes with China in the South China Sea. Hanwha Aerospace, the manufacturer of the K9, has been actively securing defense contracts globally, with significant sales to Poland, Australia, and Egypt. The company reported a substantial increase in its first-quarter 2025 sales, driven by exports of the K9, and noted expectations for more orders in the second half of the year.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Exactly 2 months remain until July 1, 2025, the resolution date for this question.",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No - currently no agreement has been publicly announced, so if nothing changes, the question resolves as No.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "The negotiations encounter unexpected obstacles such as budgetary constraints in Vietnam, political pressure from China, technical disagreements, or simply take longer than anticipated. The deal might still eventually happen but the announcement comes after July 1, 2025, missing the resolution deadline.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "The negotiations that were reportedly in 'final stages' in January 2025 successfully conclude within the next two months. Either Vietnam or South Korea's government makes an official announcement of an agreement to export K9 self-propelled howitzers before July 1, 2025.",
    "rationale": "Several factors support a Yes outcome: As of January 2025, multiple sources indicated negotiations were in 'final stages' for approximately 20 K9 units worth $300 million, with expectations for Q1 2025 finalization. The groundwork is strong - Vietnamese Defense Minister visited in February 2023 to inspect the K9 system, Vietnamese troops trained on the system in November 2024, and the countries elevated their relationship to 'comprehensive strategic partnership' in 2022. Vietnam has strategic motivation to diversify from Russian equipment amid South China Sea tensions, and Hanwha Aerospace has a proven track record of international K9 sales.\n\nHowever, concerning factors temper this optimism: We are now in May 2025, meaning the Q1 2025 timeline has passed without a reported announcement. This missed deadline suggests either delays or complications have emerged. Defense deals of this magnitude ($300 million) frequently experience delays due to complex negotiations, political sensitivities, or budgetary issues. China may apply diplomatic pressure on Vietnam given regional tensions. Only 2 months remain until the resolution deadline, and the status quo is No.\n\nThe fact that the Q1 target was missed is the most significant negative signal. This could indicate minor administrative delays or more fundamental obstacles. For me to update higher, I would need evidence that an announcement is imminent or that high-level diplomatic activity suggests finalization is near. For me to update lower, I would need reports of stalled negotiations, Vietnamese budgetary problems, or explicit statements pushing the timeline beyond July 2025.\n\nGiven the advanced negotiation stage but missed initial timeline with limited time remaining, I assess this as roughly a coin flip with a slight bias toward No due to status quo considerations.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill Vietnam and South Korea announce an agreement for South Korea to export self-propelled howitzers to Vietnam?\n\nQuestion background:\nThe Korea Herald: [South Korea-Vietnam ties enter new strategic terrain, but need more detailed road map: Seoul envoy](https://www.koreaherald.com/article/10464718) \"Vietnam is reportedly in negotiations to import 20 units of K9 self-propelled howitzers from Korea in a deal valued at $300 million. If finalized, it would mark Korea’s first defense arms sale to the country.\"\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if, before July 1, 2025, the governments of Vietnam and/or South Korea announce an agreement for South Korea to export 2 or more self-propelled howitzers to Vietnam. If no such agreement is announced after the launch of this question and before July 1, 2025, this question resolves as **No**.\n\n\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nAccording to multiple South Korean industry and government sources from January 2025, South Korea and Vietnam were in the final stages of negotiating a deal for South Korea to export K9 self-propelled howitzers.

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
