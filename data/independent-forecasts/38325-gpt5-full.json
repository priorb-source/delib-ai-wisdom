  "information": "The advance estimate for Q1 2025 annualized real GDP growth was -0.3%. The second estimate, released on May 29, 2025, was an upward revision to -0.2%. Key factors driving the contraction in the first quarter included a significant increase in imports, which subtracted 4.90 percentage points from GDP, and a reduction in government spending, which subtracted 0.12 percentage points. These negative factors were partially offset by positive contributions from investment (+3.98 percentage points) and consumer spending (+0.80 percentage points).\n\nHistorical analyses of BEA data by the St. Louis Fed show that revisions which change the sign of GDP growth from negative to positive are uncommon, happening in less than 20% of such cases. Another analysis covering the period from 1996 to 2024 indicates that when an advance estimate is between -0.5% and 0%, the third estimate turns positive in roughly 35-40% of instances. The typical absolute revision from the second to the third estimate is about 0.1 to 0.2 percentage points, while the absolute average revision from the advance to the third estimate is larger, at approximately 0.5 percentage points.\n\nThe third estimate for Q1 2025 GDP incorporates more comprehensive source data than was available for previous estimates. This includes complete data for March on international trade in goods and services, construction spending, and manufacturers' and trade inventories. The third estimate will also incorporate updated data on federal and state government spending, as well as the results of annual benchmark revisions to trade and services data which can affect the final figures.",

    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "About 3 weeks (BEA’s Q1 2025 Third Estimate is likely released in the last week of June, around June 27, 2025).",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No — the second estimate is -0.2%, and the typical second-to-third revision is small, leaving GDP growth still negative.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Routine, modest revisions to trade, inventories, and construction/spending data leave Q1 growth at roughly -0.3% to -0.1%, so the third estimate remains below zero.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Larger-than-usual upward revisions to net exports (e.g., smaller measured imports after annual ITA updates and March trade revisions) and/or inventories and construction spending collectively add at least +0.3 pp to growth, pushing the third estimate above 0.0%.",
    "rationale": "- Where things stand: Advance estimate was -0.3%; second estimate was revised up to -0.2%. To resolve Yes, the third estimate must be >0.0%, which implies at least a +0.3 pp revision from the second estimate.\n- Historical revision patterns: The research assistant notes that sign changes from negative to positive are uncommon (<20% overall), and when the advance is between -0.5% and 0.0%, the third estimate turns positive roughly 35–40% of the time. However, those figures reflect advance-to-third dynamics. From the second to the third estimate, typical absolute revisions are only about 0.1–0.2 pp. A +0.3 pp revision is larger than usual, so odds should be lower than the 35–40% figure tied to the advance estimate.\n- Composition clues: Q1’s headline weakness was driven by a very large import subtraction (about -4.9 pp), with smaller drags from government spending (-0.12 pp), partly offset by strong investment (+3.98 pp) and consumer spending (+0.80 pp). Net trade and inventories are traditionally the most revision-prone components. The third estimate will incorporate more complete March data (trade in goods and services, construction, inventories) and BEA’s annual updates to international trade in services (ITA), which could adjust net exports. Given the unusually large import drag, this is the most plausible channel for a sizeable upward revision.\n- Base-rate weighting (status quo): Most second-to-third revisions aren’t big enough to flip the sign, and -0.2% to >0.0% requires a relatively large move. Even with the potential from ITA annual updates and March revisions, a +0.3 pp swing is not the norm.\n- Why not higher? Because the required revision from the second estimate is larger than typical, and sign flips between the second and third estimates are historically uncommon.\n- Why not lower? The massive import subtraction offers an avenue for outsized upward revision if revised lower, and strong domestic demand (investment and consumption) means the underlying economy wasn’t weak; that increases the tail risk of a larger upward revision.\n- What would move my forecast up: Evidence from BEA/Census revisions indicating notably smaller Q1 imports or higher inventories/construction in March; advance notice from BEA’s ITA annual update indicating stronger services net exports for Q1; credible private nowcasts suggesting a third-estimate revision of +0.3 pp or more.\n- What would move my forecast down: Indications that trade/services annual updates are small, or that inventories/construction revisions for March are neutral/negative; any pre-release technical notes hinting at minimal second-to-third changes.",
