  "information": "The advance estimate for Q1 2025 annualized real GDP growth was -0.3%. The second estimate, released on May 29, 2025, was an upward revision to -0.2%. Key factors driving the contraction in the first quarter included a significant increase in imports, which subtracted 4.90 percentage points from GDP, and a reduction in government spending, which subtracted 0.12 percentage points. These negative factors were partially offset by positive contributions from investment (+3.98 percentage points) and consumer spending (+0.80 percentage points).\n\nHistorical analyses of BEA data by the St. Louis Fed show that revisions which change the sign of GDP growth from negative to positive are uncommon, happening in less than 20% of such cases. Another analysis covering the period from 1996 to 2024 indicates that when an advance estimate is between -0.5% and 0%, the third estimate turns positive in roughly 35-40% of instances. The typical absolute revision from the second to the third estimate is about 0.1 to 0.2 percentage points, while the absolute average revision from the advance to the third estimate is larger, at approximately 0.5 percentage points.\n\nThe third estimate for Q1 2025 GDP incorporates more comprehensive source data than was available for previous estimates. This includes complete data for March on international trade in goods and services, construction spending, and manufacturers' and trade inventories. The third estimate will also incorporate updated data on federal and state government spending, as well as the results of annual benchmark revisions to trade and services data which can affect the final figures.",

    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Approximately 3 weeks. The BEA typically releases the third estimate about 90 days after quarter end. Since Q1 2025 ended March 31, and the second estimate was released May 29, the third estimate should be released around June 26-27, 2025.",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No. The second estimate showed -0.2% annualized real GDP growth, which is not greater than 0.0%, so if this number remains unchanged the question resolves as No.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "The third estimate confirms or slightly worsens the contraction shown in the second estimate. The additional comprehensive data on trade, inventories, and government spending either validates the -0.2% figure or shows further weakness. The third estimate remains at or below 0.0%, resolving the question as No.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "The third estimate incorporates more comprehensive data that reveals positive revisions to key components. Perhaps March trade data shows better exports than preliminary estimates, or construction spending and inventories were stronger than initially reported. The cumulative revisions push GDP growth from -0.2% to positive territory (>0.0%), resolving as Yes.",
    "rationale": "The current second estimate stands at -0.2%, requiring an upward revision of at least 0.3 percentage points to reach positive territory. Historical data provides mixed signals: while revisions that flip GDP from negative to positive are uncommon (under 20% of cases), the specific situation where advance estimates fall between -0.5% and 0% (as our -0.3% advance estimate did) sees positive third estimates 35-40% of the time. The typical absolute revision from second to third estimate is 0.1-0.2 percentage points, meaning we're at the upper bound of what's typically needed. Importantly, we've already seen one upward revision (+0.1 pp from advance to second), and we're now very close to the zero threshold. The third estimate incorporates more complete data on international trade, construction, inventories, and government spending, plus annual benchmark revisions. This additional data could plausibly push the estimate positive, but consecutive large upward revisions are relatively rare. I'm not forecasting higher because sign changes remain uncommon and we've already had one upward revision, suggesting the most obvious positive adjustments may have been captured. I'm not forecasting lower because we're extremely close to the threshold (-0.2%) and the historical precedent for this range suggests meaningful probability of turning positive. A forecast update would require information about the underlying March economic data (trade balances, inventory levels, construction activity) or preliminary signals from the BEA about the magnitude of expected revisions.",
