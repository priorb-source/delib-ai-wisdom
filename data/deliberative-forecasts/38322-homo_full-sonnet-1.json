    "review": "The other forecasters raise several compelling arguments that warrant consideration. Most importantly, they emphasize the **time constraint** - with only 23 days until the final report and the survey period likely beginning around mid-June, there's limited time for sentiment reversal. This is a stronger argument than I initially weighted. They also correctly emphasize that the structural nature of the decline (tariffs cited by 75% of consumers, persistently elevated inflation expectations) makes rapid reversal less likely than if this were merely cyclical volatility. Both forecasters arrive at similar conclusions (72% and 75%), suggesting reasonable consensus. However, I note they may be underweighting the significance of the Conference Board's sharp improvement (85.7 to 98) and the fact that only 1.8 points separates the current reading from the threshold. Monthly volatility in consumer sentiment can easily produce swings of this magnitude, and we haven't yet seen any June data - preliminary or otherwise. The May preliminary-to-final revision of 1.4 points demonstrates that meaningful intra-month adjustments occur, though it still left the final reading below threshold. Their analysis is generally sound, but I'm cautious about assigning too high a probability when we're this close to the threshold and this early in the measurement period.",
    "rationale": "Upon reflection, I should update my forecast modestly upward. The time constraint argument is particularly persuasive - with approximately 23 days until resolution and the survey period starting mid-June, there's genuinely limited time for major sentiment shifts. The other forecasters correctly emphasize this is a structural decline driven by persistent headwinds (tariff uncertainty, elevated inflation expectations of 7.3% one-year and 4.6% long-term, weak economic indicators) rather than temporary noise. The May 2025 final reading of 52.2 already satisfies the Yes condition, and no clear near-term catalysts for a 1.8+ point improvement are evident. However, I'm maintaining some caution against going higher than ~73% because: (1) the 1.8-point gap is genuinely small in the context of normal monthly volatility, (2) the Conference Board's improvement from 85.7 to 98 suggests some positive momentum exists in consumer attitudes, (3) unexpected policy developments regarding trade or Fed actions could shift sentiment quickly, and (4) we're still early enough in June that we lack any preliminary data. My updated forecast of 73% reflects greater weight on the time constraint and structural factors while preserving meaningful probability for the inherent uncertainty around a relatively close threshold.",
