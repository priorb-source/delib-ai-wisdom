    "review": "Forecaster 2 provides critical new evidence I lacked: an official NOAA spokesperson statement from April 4, 2025, explicitly confirming 'All NOAA Research sites will remain online' with 'no interruption in service.' This is the strongest possible evidence - a direct, public commitment from the relevant agency addressing exactly this question. This dramatically strengthens the case for a Yes outcome.\n\nForecaster 3 raises important technical considerations I underweighted: the resolution depends on a single point-in-time check by IsItDownRightNow. Even highly reliable sites can experience brief outages, TLS certificate issues, or CDN problems. This tail risk is real and argues against extreme confidence levels. Their historical analysis (2017-2020 changes were content-focused, not domain takedowns) and mention of the Billion-Dollar database decommissioning provides valuable context - showing the administration is willing to curtail climate information but typically through content changes rather than complete shutdowns.\n\nBoth forecasters are more bullish than my original 87%, and I find their reasoning compelling. The official NOAA commitment is much stronger evidence than the general status quo arguments I relied on.",
    "rationale": "I'm updating significantly upward from 87% to 94% based on the official NOAA spokesperson commitment that I previously lacked. This explicit statement from April 4, 2025 - just six weeks before resolution - directly addresses continuity of NOAA research sites and provides strong institutional evidence for a Yes outcome.\n\nHowever, I'm not going as high as Forecaster 2's 98% because I weight the technical tail risks more heavily. The resolution mechanism (single check by IsItDownRightNow on July 1) means even a brief transient outage, monitor blocking, or technical misconfiguration could trigger a No. Government sites do experience occasional outages, and 6 weeks provides some opportunity for technical issues.\n\nAdditionally, while the official commitment is strong, the research showing NOAA database decommissioning and aggressive climate data changes indicates the administration's willingness to make rapid, significant policy shifts. A sudden directive to consolidate or redirect Climate.gov remains a low but non-zero probability.\n\nMy 94% forecast accounts for: (1) strong official commitment and status quo, (2) short timeframe limiting major changes, (3) technical tail risks of 3-4%, and (4) small residual political risk of rapid policy reversal despite the official statement.",
