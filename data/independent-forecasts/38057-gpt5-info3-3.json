  "information": "Sean O'Malley is the former bantamweight champion. This fight will be his first since undergoing hip surgery in October 2024 following his loss to Dvalishvili. In preparation for the rematch, O'Malley has been sparring with former UFC middleweight champion Israel Adesanya. O'Malley has stated he is confident in his skills and expects to be significantly better than he was in the first fight post-surgery.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "About 1–2 months (UFC 316 is likely in late June or July 2025)",
    "status_quo_outcome": "Dvalishvili and O’Malley fight at UFC 316 and Dvalishvili wins again, most likely by decision via pressure wrestling and cardio.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "The bout is canceled or changed (injury/withdrawal/weight-cut issue), or O’Malley keeps it standing and wins via clean striking and damage over five rounds (or scores an early knockout).",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "The fight goes ahead as scheduled, and Dvalishvili reproduces his wrestling-heavy game plan, piling up control time and volume to win a decision (or a late stoppage).",
    "rationale": "Baseline considerations: Merab Dvalishvili already beat Sean O’Malley in their first meeting, and his style—relentless chain wrestling, top pressure, and elite cardio over five rounds—matches up well against O’Malley’s striking-centric approach. Rematches where the first fight showcased a clear stylistic edge often favor the original winner unless the loser lands a decisive early counter or makes major defensive improvements.\n\nKey inputs from the research assistant: O’Malley is the former bantamweight champion coming off hip surgery (Oct 2024) after losing to Dvalishvili, and this would be his first fight since. He has reportedly been sparring with Israel Adesanya and expects to be much improved post-surgery. That suggests potential striking refinement and possibly better movement; however, the main tactical hurdle versus Dvalishvili is takedown defense, scrambling, and wall-walking, not elite kickboxing per se. First-fight-back uncertainty and ring rust also introduce risk for O’Malley.\n\nQuantitatively, I’d make Dvalishvili a modest favorite if the fight happens (roughly 60–62%) due to the proven stylistic path and five-round cardio edge. However, this question resolves No if the fight doesn’t occur at UFC 316. Late-notice withdrawals for UFC main events are not uncommon; I’d assign roughly a 10–15% chance the bout changes or falls through. Combining these gives a mid-50s overall Yes probability.\n\nWhy not higher: O’Malley’s knockout threat and surgical striking, the possibility his hip is now fully healthy and improves his lateral movement/sprawl, and general rematch volatility. Why not lower: Merab’s demonstrated success in the first fight, a rinse-and-repeat game plan that historically scores well with judges, and his durability/cardio.\n\nWhat would move me up: Confirmed clean bills of health and weigh-ins for both, strong reports or footage showing O’Malley still struggling to get up from layered rides, or any indication of a smaller cage/high altitude that further favors wrestling cardio. What would move me down: Reports of Dvalishvili injuries or compromised camp, credible evidence O’Malley’s wrestling defense and get-ups have markedly improved, or market/analytic consensus swinging toward O’Malley after open workouts or insider gym intel.",
