  "information": "On May 5, 2025, Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov stated that a meeting between Putin and Trump is 'certainly necessary' and 'on everyone's lips.' However, Peskov emphasized that any such meeting requires 'adequate preparation' at 'various expert levels' and that, as of that date, there were no specific details or a set date.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "40 days",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Despite public statements of intent from the Kremlin, the diplomatic and logistical preparations required for a phone call prove too complex to complete within the short timeframe. Scheduling conflicts, disagreements on the agenda, or domestic political considerations on either side prevent the call from being finalized and officially acknowledged before June 15, 2025.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Following the Kremlin's public statement, a specific geopolitical event or a mutual desire to de-escalate tensions accelerates diplomatic preparations. Both sides quickly agree on an agenda, and a phone call is scheduled and takes place within the specified window, with both the Kremlin and Trump's team issuing statements confirming the conversation occurred.",
    "rationale": "My forecast is based on balancing the stated intent from the Russian side against the significant logistical and political hurdles of arranging such a high-level call on a short timeline. The status quo is that no call is scheduled, making 'No' the default outcome. The statement from Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov on May 5, 2025, calling a meeting 'certainly necessary', is a very strong positive indicator that significantly increases the probability of a call. This indicates a high-level political will from at least one side. However, Peskov's own caveat that such an event requires 'adequate preparation' at 'various expert levels' and that there were 'no specific details or a set date' as of May 5 is a major counterpoint. Organizing a formal, agenda-driven phone call between these two leaders, which would then be publicly acknowledged by both sides as per the resolution criteria, typically takes weeks of back-channel negotiations. The window between May 12 and June 15 is tight. Furthermore, we have no public signal from Donald Trump's side confirming a mutual, immediate interest. My probability is not higher because the logistical hurdles and the short timeframe are substantial, and the high bar for resolution requires official acknowledgment from both parties, which is not guaranteed even if a call occurs. My probability is not lower because the Kremlin's statement is an unusually direct and forceful signal of intent, and Donald Trump has a documented history of engaging in direct, leader-to-leader diplomacy, potentially bypassing traditional preparatory timelines. I would increase my forecast if Trump's team releases a corroborating statement of intent. I would decrease it if two or three weeks pass without any further public developments on the matter.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill Donald Trump and Vladimir Putin speak on the phone with each other before June 15, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nWikipedia: [February 2025 Putin–Trump call](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/February_2025_Putin%E2%80%93Trump_call)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if, after May 12, 2025 and before June 15, 2025, Donald Trump and Vladimir Putin speak on the phone with each other, according to [credible sources](https://www.metaculus.com/faq/#definitions).\n\nBoth sides must acknowledge the phone call took place for it to count. \"Speak on the phone with each other\" is defined as both Trump and Putin, from different physical spaces, orally uttering words intended for the other individual into a telephone or equivalent device, those words being converted into electrical or digital signals in real time, and then transferred to the other individual via telecommunications links, where they are reconverted into sound waves at the other individual's listening device.\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nOn May 5, 2025, Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov stated that a meeting between Putin and Trump is 'certainly necessary' and 'on everyone's lips.' However, Peskov emphasized that any such meeting requires 'adequate preparation' at 'various expert levels' and that, as of that date, there were no specific details or a set date.\n\nToday is 2025-05-06.\n\nBefore answering you think:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n(e) You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
