    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "About 60 days (until July 1, 2025)",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No — the U.S. State Department keeps Mozambique at its current overall level (likely Level 2 or Level 3) with specific northern areas designated higher risk, but not a nationwide Level 4.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Security incidents remain largely confined to northern provinces (e.g., Cabo Delgado) with periodic, localized violence; protests in major cities stay sporadic and manageable; the U.S. issues security alerts and retains area-specific restrictions without upgrading the nationwide level.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "A rapid and visible deterioration such as widespread violent unrest in Maputo and other major cities, a major terrorist attack targeting foreigners or critical infrastructure, a significant expansion of insurgent activity beyond the north, a severe cyclone/flooding crisis that prompts ordered embassy departures, or credible intelligence of imminent, widespread kidnapping/terror threats leading State to raise the national level to 4.",
    "rationale": "- Baseline and status quo: Mozambique is not currently at Level 4 nationwide, and the State Department rarely assigns Level 4 to an entire country absent sustained, widespread conflict, government collapse, or severe, nationwide threats to U.S. citizens. Historically, Mozambique has had elevated risk in specific northern provinces due to the Cabo Delgado insurgency, with the rest of the country typically at a lower level (Level 2–3). Given only ~60 days left, the base-rate probability of a nationwide Level 4 shift is low. I place extra weight on this status quo, as the State Department’s countrywide level tends to be sticky absent major triggers.\n- Recent signals: The prompt references ATTA warning amid protests, which suggests some near-term unrest. However, such sector advisories often lead to U.S. Embassy security alerts or localized restrictions rather than an immediate nationwide Level 4. Unless protests become widespread and violent with significant casualties or target foreigners, a Level 4 is unlikely.\n- Triggers for an upgrade: The fastest route to Level 4 would be major escalation beyond the north (e.g., high-profile attacks in Maputo/Beira/Nampula), ordered departure of embassy staff, or a large-scale crisis (severe cyclone/flooding) that seriously degrades security and consular capacity. While possible, these are relatively low-probability within the next two months.\n- Why not higher: Level 4 is uncommon and typically reserved for countries with active nationwide conflict or exceptionally high and pervasive risk (e.g., Yemen, Sudan, Syria). Mozambique’s risks are significant but geographically concentrated; time window is short; and there’s no known imminent trigger.\n- Why not lower: The presence of an active insurgency in the north, a history of episodic resurges, and fresh protest activity raise tail risks. A single major event in the south or against foreigners could prompt a sharp reassessment.\n- What would move me up: Credible reports of ordered/authorized departure of U.S. government personnel, a large terrorist attack in Maputo or multiple cities, rapid spread of violence to southern/central regions, or severe disaster impacts limiting embassy/consular operations.\n- What would move me down: Several calm weeks with protests dissipating, successful security operations in Cabo Delgado, and State/Embassy messaging limited to routine updates without heightened alerts.\n- Research assistant summary: No additional information provided; thus, I rely on base rates, known risk patterns, and typical State Department behavior.\n",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill Mozambique receive a \"Level 4 – Do Not Travel\" travel advisory from the US State Department before July 1, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nMSN: [ATTA issues travel advisory for Mozambique amid protests](https://www.msn.com/en-za/travel/travel-preparation/atta-issues-travel-advisory-for-mozambique-amid-protests/ar-AA1wHavB?ocid=BingNewsVerp)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if the country of Mozambique has received a Level 4 [travel advisory](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/International-Travel-Country-Information-Pages/Mozambique.html) from the US Department of State before July 1, 2025.\n\n\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nNo additional information available.\n\nToday is 2025-05-02.\n\nBefore answering you think:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n(e) You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
