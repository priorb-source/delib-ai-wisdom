    "review": "Both forecasters emphasize the same key drivers I used: strong precedent against acting presidents running (Hwang 2017), legal/normative constraints to resign to run, and the lack of visible pre-signals with ~13 days left. They add a bit more texture on registration/nomination timelines and the need for rapid party convergence, which reinforces rather than alters my view. No new concrete evidence (e.g., verified deadlines, endorsements, or reporting of exploratory moves) was introduced that would materially change the balance. I find their reasoning sound and broadly aligned with mine; it supports staying in a low-but-nontrivial band.",
    "rationale": "With roughly two weeks remaining to May 5, a viable Han candidacy would almost certainly require immediate, observable steps: openness signals, formation of a camp, legal consultations and likely resignation timing, and overt PPP elite coordination. The historical norm for acting presidents to avoid running, Han’s technocratic profile and age, and the availability of other PPP figures all bias toward no announcement. The cited draft chatter keeps a path open—especially if a June snap election compresses timelines and party elites move to a caretaker-unity option—but the absence of corroborating movement to date weighs more heavily. Given the deliberation inputs reinforce these constraints without adding fresh indications of momentum, I maintain a modest probability rather than adjust materially.",
