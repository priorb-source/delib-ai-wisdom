    "review": "The other forecasters raise several important points that warrant careful consideration. Most significantly, Forecaster 3's explicit compound probability framing is crucial - requiring BOTH fugitives to be captured means we must consider their individual capture probabilities and multiply them. If Massey has 65-70% individual capture probability and Groves 70-75%, the strict mathematical product would be 45.5-52.5%. However, the probabilities aren't fully independent: capturing one could yield intelligence on the other, and manhunt resources can be concentrated. Forecaster 3's learning effect point - that remaining fugitives learn from others' mistakes - is also well-taken and reinforces the selection effect I noted. Forecaster 2's emphasis on the status quo baseline (two at large) as weighing against Yes resolution is a valid base rate consideration. All forecasters converge on 60-65%, suggesting this is the reasonable range given the evidence.",
    "rationale": "Upon reflection, my initial 65% forecast may have been slightly optimistic given the compound probability requirement. The need for BOTH fugitives to be captured within 32 days is mathematically more challenging than I initially weighted. While I acknowledged the selection effect and Massey's escape history, I didn't fully incorporate the multiplicative nature of the probability. However, I don't believe a dramatic downward revision is warranted because: (1) the probabilities have positive correlation - catching one provides intelligence and allows resource concentration on the other; (2) the 80% recapture rate within two weeks demonstrates genuine operational effectiveness; (3) the massive resource deployment ($100K rewards, 200+ officers, multiple federal agencies) and strong public engagement (700 tips) remain compelling; (4) 32 days is a meaningful timeframe; and (5) the systematic dismantling of their support network (14 accomplices arrested) continues to constrain their options. The compound probability argument is strongest when events are independent, but here there's meaningful correlation. I'm updating down to 62% to better account for the mathematical requirement of capturing both individuals while maintaining that the operational momentum and resources justify odds meaningfully above 50%.",
