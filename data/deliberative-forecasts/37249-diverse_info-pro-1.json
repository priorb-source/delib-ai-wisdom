    "review": "I find the other forecasters' analyses very helpful in calibrating my own. Forecaster 2 provides a compelling, data-driven argument for a low probability (10%), emphasizing the structural barriers: the inertia of the Politico poll-of-polls, the high bar of a 4-point lead, and the historical rarity of such rapid third-party surges. This reasoning is very strong and provides a robust anchor against over-interpreting recent momentum. Forecaster 3 (30%) offers a valuable counterpoint by highlighting the current evidence of Reform's momentum (councillor defections, by-election polling) and, crucially, identifying the imminent local elections as a major potential catalyst for a rapid realignment. While I believe their forecast is too high—placing too much faith in a potential catalyst overcoming the significant structural hurdles—their identification of this specific, near-term event is a key consideration I had not weighted as heavily.",
    "rationale": "After reviewing my peers' analyses, I am adjusting my forecast slightly downward from 15% to 12%. My initial reasoning focused on the tension between the high structural barriers and the volatile political environment. Forecaster 2's analysis persuades me that I was slightly underweighting the structural difficulty, particularly the known lag in the specific resolution source (Politico's average) and the historical base rates for third-party performance. These factors make a 'Yes' outcome exceptionally difficult in just two months. However, I am not moving down to 10% because Forecaster 3 makes an excellent point about the local elections on May 1st being a potential political shock with unpredictable consequences. This event introduces significant near-term variance. Therefore, my updated 12% forecast reflects a stronger belief in the structural impediments to a 'Yes' outcome, while still acknowledging that the current political instability and the potential for a catalyst event create a non-trivial, albeit small, possibility of a rapid polling shift sufficient to meet the resolution criteria.",
