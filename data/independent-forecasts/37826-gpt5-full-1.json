  "information": "Following a terrorist attack in Pahalgam, Jammu and Kashmir on April 22, 2025, which killed 26 tourists, the Indian government took several actions against Pakistan. These included suspending the Indus Water Treaty, closing the Attari-Wagah border, and banning the SAARC visa scheme for Pakistan. The Indian military launched 'Operation Sindoor' (also referred to as 'Operation Sundar'), a series of targeted strikes against what were described as terrorist camps in Pakistan-occupied Kashmir and Pakistan proper. Indian sources reported that over 100 terrorists were killed in these operations, including high-value targets. The operation targeted infrastructure linked to groups like Lashkar-e-Taiba and Jaish-e-Mohammed.\n\nAfter India's initial strikes, a period of military escalation occurred. The Indian Army reported that on the night of May 8-9, 2025, Pakistan launched multiple attacks using drones and missiles targeting military stations at Jammu, Pathankot, and Udhampur, and committed numerous ceasefire violations along the Line of Control. India stated that these threats were neutralized using kinetic and non-kinetic means with no casualties or material losses reported on the Indian side. India conducted retaliatory strikes, with reports claiming the destruction of a Pakistani post, a terrorist launch pad, and 11 Pakistani airbases. After several days of tension, a ceasefire was agreed upon on May 10, 2025, following direct talks between the two countries' Directors-General of Military Operations (DGMOs). Subsequently, Pakistani intelligence sources reported an agreement for both sides to withdraw troops to their pre-conflict positions by the end of May.\n\nIn the aftermath of the military engagements, India initiated a diplomatic offensive. The government dispatched seven all-party delegations to 32 countries for a diplomatic push scheduled between May 21 and June 5. These delegations were provided with 'talking points' and a 150-page dossier detailing India's position on cross-border terrorism. Politically, the Indian Prime Minister announced a new doctrine of 'no tolerance for terror that hides under nuclear blackmail'. In parallel, the Indian Army Chief, General Upendra Dwivedi, granted 'full authority' to the Western Commanders to retaliate with kinetic actions in response to any future violations of the ceasefire agreement by Pakistan.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "About 40 days (until July 1, 2025)",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "The May 10 ceasefire holds. Both sides complete pullbacks by end-May and keep incidents confined to the Line of Control or Pakistan-administered Kashmir. Diplomatic outreach through early June lowers temperatures, and no large provocation occurs that would justify an Indian strike into Pakistan’s Sindh, Balochistan, Punjab, or Khyber Pakhtunkhwa.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "A major June provocation occurs—e.g., a mass-casualty terror attack in India attributed to Pakistan-based groups or a significant Pakistani strike on Indian territory—triggering an Indian kinetic response into Pakistan proper (e.g., an air or missile strike on a LeT/JeM facility in KP or Punjab, or artillery/drone strikes across the international border hitting targets in Pakistani Punjab).",
    "rationale": "Baseline: After intense April–May hostilities, India and Pakistan agreed to a ceasefire on May 10, with reported withdrawals to pre-conflict positions by end-May. India launched ‘Operation Sindoor’ with strikes including in Pakistan-administered areas and reportedly in Pakistan proper, followed by Pakistani drone/missile activity May 8–9 and Indian retaliatory actions; then de-escalation. India has since opened a diplomatic campaign (May 21–June 5) and signaled a hard line on terrorism. The Army Chief granted commanders authority to retaliate to ceasefire violations.\nWhy No is more likely: The status quo after a ceasefire typically favors restraint, especially given the risks of broader escalation and international pressure. Historically, Indian strikes into Pakistan proper (e.g., Balakot 2019) are rare and tied to immediate provocations. With troop pullbacks and ongoing diplomacy, a June strike into Pakistan’s provinces would likely require a fresh, significant trigger. Routine ceasefire violations generally elicit responses along the LoC or in Pakistan-administered Kashmir rather than Pakistan proper, which this market explicitly requires.\nWhy not lower: Tensions remain elevated. India’s new doctrine and delegated authority raise the chance of a prompt punitive action if Pakistan conducts a severe violation or if there is a high-profile terror attack with clear Pakistan-based links. There is precedent for limited strikes into Pakistan proper under such conditions.\nKey updates that would raise my probability: Credible reports of a mass-casualty attack in India tied to Pakistan-based groups; significant Pakistani kinetic action on Indian territory; public Indian preparations (NOTAMs, forward deployment of strike assets), emergency CCS meetings, or strong signaling of impending action; failure of withdrawals or collapse of the ceasefire. Key updates that would lower it: Verified completion of withdrawals; sustained quiet along the LoC/IB through mid-June; de-escalatory statements by both sides; active third-party mediation and confidence-building steps; focus shifting to non-kinetic tools.\nSummary of assistant’s inputs affecting this forecast: The April 22 attack and subsequent Indian operations increased short-term risk, but the May 10 ceasefire, planned withdrawals, and diplomatic push suggest a de-escalatory trajectory. Delegated authority to retaliate keeps some tail risk alive if there is a June provocation.\nOverall, absent a new trigger, the most likely outcome is no Indian kinetic strike in Pakistan proper during June 2025. My probability reflects a modest but real tail risk driven by potential provocations and India’s stated willingness to respond.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill the Indian Armed Forces execute a kinetic attack in Pakistan proper in June 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nWikipedia: [2025 India–Pakistan conflict](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2025_India%E2%80%93Pakistan_conflict)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if after May 31, 2025 and before July 1, 2025 the Indian Armed Forces execute a kinetic attack on targets in one of the following provinces of Pakistan: Sindh, Baluchistan, Punjab, or Khyber Pakhtunkhwa.\n\nTo count, an attack must be [kinetic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kinetic_military_action), using explosive weaponry or physical violence.
