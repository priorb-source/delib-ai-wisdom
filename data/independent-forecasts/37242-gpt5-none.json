    "status_quo_outcome": "No (arrivals continue their recent year-over-year growth)",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "April 2025 arrivals exceed or match April 2024 due to: Easter/holy week falling in April 2025 (vs March 2024) boosting traffic; ongoing capacity growth from key European source markets (UK, Germany, mainland Spain); and minimal impact from US policy shifts given the very small US share of Canary Islands air arrivals.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "April 2025 arrivals fall below April 2024 because of a significant disruption or demand shock: major airline/ATC strikes affecting Spain or key feeder markets during April; weather events (e.g., calima) causing widespread cancellations; notable capacity cuts by large carriers; or an unexpectedly weak domestic/inter-island segment that outweighs the Easter timing boost.",
    "rationale": "Evidence and base rates point to growth rather than a decline. The February 2025 AENA report shows Feb 2025 arrivals above Feb 2024 (2,248,198 vs 2,199,255), consistent with the broader post-pandemic upward trend in Canary Islands traffic. The most important calendar effect is Easter: in 2024, Easter fell on March 31 (pulling holiday travel into March), while in 2025 it falls on April 20, likely shifting substantial leisure travel into April 2025. That alone makes a year-over-year April increase more likely. Furthermore, the Canary Islands’ inbound traffic is dominated by European markets (UK, Germany, Spain). Even if new US policies marginally reduce US-origin demand, the US share of arrivals is very small, so the effect on total arrivals should be negligible for this metric. Status quo dynamics—steady capacity and demand—therefore favor a No outcome (no decline). Why not a lower probability of a decline? Tail risks remain: April could have seen operational disruptions (strikes, weather) or unexpected capacity reductions sufficient to offset the Easter boost. Also, the metric is all passenger arrivals (including domestic and inter-island), so weakness in those segments could drag totals. Why not higher? While momentum and the Easter shift are strong positives, I reserve some probability for unforeseen disruptions or a high April 2024 base in certain segments that could make surpassing it harder than expected. What would move me up (toward a lower chance of decline): seat-capacity data or early press pointing to record Easter travel to the Canaries; AENA indicators showing strong March–April throughput at Canary airports; reports from major carriers (Ryanair, Jet2, easyJet, TUI) of capacity growth and high load factors to the Canaries in April. What would move me down (toward a higher chance of decline): credible reports of significant April flight cancellations/strikes affecting Spain or key source markets, notable weather-related airport closures, or confirmed capacity cuts on Canary routes during April. Research assistant input: none beyond the prompt; no additional information supplied.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill inbound airline passenger arrivals to the Canary Islands fall in April 2025 compared with April 2024?\n\nQuestion background:\n[Canarias braces for the consequences of Trump's policies on tourism, potentially leading to a decline in tourist arrivals from the US](https://diariodeavisos.elespanol.com/2025/04/turismo-aranceles/)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if the total number of passenger arrivals to the Canary Islands for the month of April 2025, as presented at the [Canary Islands Tourism Research site](https://investigacion.turismodeislascanarias.com/en/inbound-tourism-arrival-passengers/monthly-data), is lower than the total number for April 2024. If the number for April 2025 is greater than or equal to the number for April 2024, the question resolves as **No**.\n\nSpecifically, Metaculus will access \"Passenger arrivals (AENA). April 2025,\" which is expected to be posted in the beginning of June 2025. The numbers considered will be the monthly totals under Canary Islands. For example, in the [February 2025 report](https://investigacion.turismodeislascanarias.com/sites/default/files/2025-03/Promotur_AENA_febrero%202025_EN.pdf), the number shown for February 2025 is 2,248,198 and the number shown for February 2024 is 2,199,255. Thus, if the question had been comparing February 2025 with February 2024, it would have resolved as No, because the number went up.\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nNo additional information available.\n\nToday is 2025-04-30.\n\nBefore answering you think:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n(e) You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
