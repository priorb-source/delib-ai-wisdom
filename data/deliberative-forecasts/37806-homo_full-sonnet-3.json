    "review": "The other forecasters make compelling arguments that have caused me to reconsider my position. All three of us converge on the key dynamics: Trump's clear opposition to the program, the strong 4+ month pattern of not mentioning it despite 62+ immigration-focused executive orders, the statutory limitations on executive action, and the legislative path via the SAFE Act.\n\nForecaster 3's point about recent catalytic events (May 3 lottery results) initially seemed compelling, but upon reflection, the fact that we're now 17 days past that event WITHOUT any presidential action mentioning 'Diversity Visa' is actually evidence against it happening, not for it. If the lottery results were going to be a trigger, we would likely have seen action by now.\n\nForecaster 2's emphasis on the 4+ month pattern being 'highly informative' resonates strongly. This isn't just a few weeks of inaction - it's a sustained pattern across Trump's entire term so far, during a period of hyperactive immigration policy-making. The administration has had countless opportunities to mention the Diversity Visa program and has chosen not to, even while addressing related immigration topics.\n\nBoth forecasters also make the excellent point about terminology - Trump may prefer 'visa lottery' which wouldn't satisfy the resolution criteria. This creates an additional hurdle beyond just whether he takes action on the program conceptually.",
    "rationale": "I'm updating my forecast downward based on three key considerations:\n\n1. **The strengthening status quo**: We're not just 4 months into the administration anymore - we're 4.5 months in, and specifically 17 days past the May 3 lottery results release. If that event was going to catalyze a presidential action, we would have seen it. Each passing day strengthens the evidence that this isn't a priority for presidential action.\n\n2. **The legislative preference signal**: The fact that the SAFE Act is the vehicle being pushed, with Trump's apparent support, strongly suggests the administration recognizes that meaningful changes require Congressional action. This is a considered strategic choice, not just a timing issue.\n\n3. **Terminology specificity**: The resolution criteria requiring the exact phrase 'Diversity Visa' creates an additional hurdle. Even if Trump wanted to address the program, he might naturally use other terminology like 'visa lottery program' that wouldn't count.\n\nThe factors keeping me from going lower: 42 days remains, Trump has shown willingness to test executive authority limits (birthright citizenship), and there's some small chance of an unexpected security event or coordination with the SAFE Act creating a moment for action.\n\nMy updated forecast of 16% represents a meaningful 4-point decrease from my original 20%, acknowledging the strength of the status quo evidence while maintaining some probability for the remaining time window and Trump's unpredictability.",
