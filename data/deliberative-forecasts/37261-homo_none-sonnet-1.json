    "review": "All three forecasters converged remarkably well on similar reasoning and forecasts (35%, 35%, 40%), which validates the core analytical framework. Forecaster 2 raises an excellent point I hadn't explicitly considered: the Global Protest Tracker's coverage methodology and potential reporting delays add uncertainty beyond whether a protest occurs - it must also be documented by this specific tracker. This is a meaningful consideration that could lower the probability slightly. Forecaster 3 mentions Trump's second term as context, which is relevant for understanding the current political environment's contentious nature. Both forecasters note the favorable May-June timing for protests (weather, academic year ending), which I had considered but they emphasized more. Forecaster 3's point about Pride events is interesting but unlikely to be relevant as these are typically celebratory rather than meeting the protest criteria. The convergence around 35-40% suggests we're all identifying similar base rates and weighting factors comparably. The key tension is between: (1) demonstrated US capacity for large protests and contentious political climate versus (2) episodic nature of such events, short timeframe, and tracker coverage uncertainty.",
    "rationale": "My original analysis remains sound. The deliberation reinforced several key points: large US protests require triggering events, the 2-month window is short but not trivial, and the US has demonstrated mobilization capacity. The Global Protest Tracker coverage uncertainty is valid but likely minimal given Carnegie Endowment's reputation - major 10,000+ person protests would likely be documented. The Trump administration context adds some political tension, but I had already factored in a contentious environment. The academic year timing is mildly favorable but not decisive. My 35% forecast appropriately balances: (1) historical base rates suggesting several large protests annually in the US, making 2 months = ~1/6 year reasonable for some positive probability, (2) the episodic nature requiring specific triggers we currently don't see, and (3) the 10,000+ threshold being substantial. No new information warrants a material change. The convergence around 35-40% across all forecasters suggests this range appropriately captures the uncertainty.",
