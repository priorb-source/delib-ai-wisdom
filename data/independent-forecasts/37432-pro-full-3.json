  "information": "In Ohio, Republican lawmakers introduced Senate Bill 153 (SB 153), which would create new requirements for citizen-led ballot initiatives. The bill would compel paid signature gatherers to wear visible badges, list employers on petitions, and maintain detailed records. The bill's definition of 'paid' circulators is considered broad, and it requires petition signers to be registered voters on the exact day they sign. As of early May 2025, this bill had not completed the legislative process. In February 2025, a provision requiring Ohioans to prove citizenship to register to vote at the Bureau of Motor Vehicles was removed from the state's transportation budget by Republicans. Instead, BMV employees will be prohibited from offering registration forms to individuals identified as non-citizens. This change was prompted by a report from Secretary of State Frank LaRose indicating that non-citizens were accidentally registering to vote, partly due to language barriers.\n\nThe Ohio legislature has Republican supermajorities in both the Senate (26-7) and the House (67-32). Senators Theresa Gavarone and Andrew Brenner are key sponsors pushing for stricter election laws. In early 2023, Governor Mike DeWine signed HB 458, a voter ID law. However, Governor DeWine has also expressed some hesitation regarding the current proof-of-citizenship proposals. Organizations such as the ACLU are actively opposing the new legislation. The Ohio General Assembly has session days scheduled through late June 2025, ahead of the July 1, 2025 resolution deadline.\n\nThere is a national trend of Republican-led efforts to enact proof-of-citizenship voting requirements. At the federal level, the U.S. House of Representatives passed the Safeguard American Voter Eligibility (SAVE) Act, which would require proof of citizenship for voter registration. Several states have pursued similar legislation. Wyoming passed a law requiring proof of citizenship to vote, which will take effect on July 1, 2025. In Iowa, a state audit found 277 noncitizens were registered to vote or had voted in the 2024 election. In Tennessee, a bill to create a portal for election workers to verify voter citizenship has advanced in the state House. In Michigan, a proposed constitutional amendment that would have required proof of citizenship for voter registration failed to pass.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Less than two months, as the question resolves on July 1, 2025.",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No new legislation expanding voter citizenship verification requirements is enacted by the deadline.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "The legislative session ends or the July 1, 2025, deadline passes without both chambers agreeing on an identical bill. This could happen if legislative leaders prioritize other issues, if Governor DeWine's reluctance to support such measures dissuades the caucus, or if internal disagreement among Republicans prevents a bill from advancing.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "In response to national trends or a specific local event, the Republican supermajority coalesces around a proof-of-citizenship bill. They use their legislative power to fast-track the bill or attach it to other priority legislation, passing it through both the House and Senate before the July 1 deadline.",
    "rationale": "My forecast is primarily driven by recent legislative behavior and the very tight timeline. The most significant piece of evidence is that in February 2025, Ohio Republicans actively removed a provision requiring proof of citizenship for voter registration at the BMV from the state's transportation budget. This indicates a lack of sufficient consensus or political will within the majority party to pass this specific type of legislation, even when presented with a convenient legislative vehicle. Secondly, with less than two months until the deadline, the legislative calendar is short for introducing, debating, and passing a potentially controversial bill through both chambers. While the Republican supermajorities in the House and Senate theoretically make passage easy, the noted hesitation from Governor Mike DeWine presents a real obstacle, potentially requiring a veto-proof majority and a willingness to engage in an intra-party fight. The status quo, in which no new law is passed, is the most likely outcome given these demonstrated headwinds.\n\nMy probability is not lower than 15% because the political motivation for such a law clearly exists within the Ohio GOP, evidenced by sponsors like Senators Gavarone and Brenner and the broader national Republican focus on 'election integrity.' The supermajority has the raw power to move legislation quickly if leadership decides to make it a priority. A sudden, highly-publicized incident of non-citizen voting could rapidly change the political calculus and create the urgency needed for passage.\n\nMy probability is not higher because the recent, concrete action of removing the BMV provision is a much stronger signal of the legislature's current intent than the general political desire for such a law. For my forecast to increase, I would need to see a specific bill pass in at least one chamber or a public statement of support from Governor DeWine.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nBefore July 1, 2025, will Ohio enact legislation expanding its verification requirements of a voter's citizenship?\n\nQuestion background:\nThe Ohio Senate: [Gavarone, Brenner Introduce Bill to Require Proof of Citizenship to Vote](https://ohiosenate.gov/members/theresa-gavarone/news/gavarone-brenner-introduce-bill-to-require-proof-of-citizenship-to-vote)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if, before July 1, 2025, the state of Ohio enacts legislation requiring voters to provide proof of US citizenship beyond the requirements at the time of this question, according to [credible sources](https://www.metaculus.com/faq/#definitions).\n\nAny subset of voters being required to provide such proof would count (for example if it only applied to first-time voter registrants or creating a new requirement for mail-in voters). An example of a bill that would count is [Senate Bill 153](https://www.legislature.ohio.gov/legislation/136/sb153). This question resolves upon enactment; therefore other questions such as when the legislation takes effect or whether it survives court challenges and is implemented is immaterial to this question's resolution. Please note that under Ohio law, a bill is considered enacted \"after both houses have passed and agreed on identical bills.\" ([Source](https://www.lsc.ohio.gov/assets/organizations/legislative-service-commission/files/chapter-5-enacting-legislation-10021971.pdf))\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nIn Ohio, Republican lawmakers introduced Senate Bill 153 (SB 153), which would create new requirements for citizen-led ballot initiatives.
