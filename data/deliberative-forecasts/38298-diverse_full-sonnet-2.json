    "review": "Both forecasters make compelling arguments that strengthen the case for a record May 2025. Forecaster 3's emphasis on ocean dominance is particularly important - the global Land+Ocean average weights SSTs heavily, and these remain extraordinarily elevated even in ENSO neutral conditions. This partially mitigates my concern about India's cooling, which represents a relatively small land area. Forecaster 2 correctly notes the powerful momentum signal from 2025's start, though both acknowledge that April being 2nd (not 1st) suggests the El Niño boost has indeed faded. All three of us cluster in the 58-62% range, which validates that this probability band appropriately balances the evidence. The key insight I underweighted was the persistence of elevated SSTs as the primary driver, independent of ENSO phase. However, I also note that none of us have access to preliminary May 2025 data, and the requirement for explicit 1st place (not tied) remains a meaningful constraint.",
    "rationale": "After reviewing the other forecasters' analyses, I'm updating my assessment modestly upward. The most persuasive new consideration is the ocean dominance argument: global SST anomalies remain at record or near-record levels even in ENSO neutral, and oceans comprise the majority of Earth's surface in the NOAA Land+Ocean metric. This means regional land anomalies like India's coolness have limited impact on the global result. The 2025 momentum remains extraordinary (3 of 4 months in top 2), and anthropogenic warming continues to raise the baseline. However, I maintain significant uncertainty because: (1) April's 2nd place ranking suggests the automatic record-breaking has stopped as El Niño effects fully dissipate; (2) May 2020's +0.95°C anomaly is a genuinely high bar; (3) the question requires 1st place specifically, not tied for 1st; (4) we lack preliminary May 2025 data to confirm the trend continuation. The convergence of all three forecasts in the 58-62% range suggests this represents appropriate confidence - more likely than not, but far from certain. I'm adjusting from 58% to 60% to reflect the stronger case for ocean-driven warmth persistence.",
