    "review": "Both forecasters largely mirror my view: the deal is filed but inactive, with no range/roadshow and media signaling a pause. They emphasize the tight calendar and that one more week of inaction materially harms the odds. They also outline clear update triggers (S-1/A with range, roadshow launch) and credible downside triggers (explicit postponement, continued silence into early June). I find this reasoning persuasive and consistent with standard IPO timing mechanics. My only minor pushback is on Forecaster 3’s suggestion that a mid-June launch could still comfortably make June 30; that feels optimistic unless they run an unusually compressed roadshow and have the SEC already essentially cleared. I would instead require a price range by late May or very early June for a pre-July 1 listing to be realistic.",
    "rationale": "Nothing in the peer analyses adds new factual information; they reinforce the same constraints and catalysts I noted. The base case remains that Circle has not activated the deal, and credible reports suggest a pause. With ~6–7 weeks left, they would need to file an S-1/A with a range imminently and launch a roadshow within roughly 1–2 weeks to hit a late-June trade. That is feasible but leaves little margin for market or regulatory noise. Given the current signals and tight timeline, I maintain that the status quo outcome is No, with a meaningful but sub-50% chance they seize a brief window. I would materially raise the probability if we see an S-1/A with a price range by late May and roadshow chatter shortly thereafter; conversely, if there’s no range on file by the first week of June, I’d quickly cut to low teens or single digits.",
