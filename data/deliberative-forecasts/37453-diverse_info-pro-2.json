    "review": "The other forecasters provided two crucial pieces of context that my initial analysis lacked. First, they detailed the formal citizen petition process, including signature thresholds and verification timelines by Elections Alberta. This procedural information, as Forecaster 2 correctly argues, establishes a significant bureaucratic hurdle that makes a petition-driven announcement before the July 1 deadline virtually impossible. This strengthens the case for 'No' via that specific path. Second, and more importantly, Forecaster 3 astutely highlighted a nuance in the resolution criteria that I had overlooked: the question resolves 'Yes' if a date is merely *announced*, even if that date is far in the future (e.g., 2026). This introduces a new, more plausible scenario for a 'Yes' outcome. While I find their reasoning for why the probability is greater than zero to be convincing, their final forecasts of 6% and 10% still feel slightly high. They seem to underweight the immense political and economic risks the Alberta government would assume by making such a destabilizing announcement, even for a future date, without a much more severe and immediate political crisis.",
    "rationale": "I am increasing my forecast from 2% to 5%. My initial analysis focused on the high improbability of the government calling and scheduling an *imminent* referendum within the short timeframe. The other forecasters' analyses convinced me to reconsider the scope of possible 'Yes' outcomes. The key driver of my update is the realization that an announcement before July 1, 2025, for a referendum to be held in the more distant future (e.g., 2026) would satisfy the question's criteria. This type of strategic announcement is more plausible than scheduling an immediate vote. It fits Premier Smith's pattern of escalatory brinkmanship with Ottawa—using the threat of separation as leverage—without committing to the immediate political upheaval of a referendum campaign. While the formal citizen petition process is a non-starter given the timeline, this alternative path of a unilateral government announcement of a future date constitutes a real, albeit small, possibility not fully captured by my initial 2%. I am not updating higher because such an announcement remains a high-risk political gamble with significant potential for economic blowback. The dominant political incentives for the Premier still favor using sovereigntist rhetoric and legislation as leverage, rather than taking the momentous and likely irreversible step of setting a date for an independence vote.",
