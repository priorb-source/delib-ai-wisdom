    "no_outcome_scenario": "Both appear at the event but in separate solo sessions with no joint panel, or one of them cancels/doesn’t show during June 16–17.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "YC schedules a joint fireside chat/panel or brings both on stage together for an opening/closing segment or Q&A during June 16–17, and both attend.",
    "rationale": "- Baseline/status quo: When multiple headline speakers are booked for a conference without an explicit joint-session announcement, the default is separate keynotes/fireside chats. That alone leans to No.\n- Relationship dynamics: Sam Altman and Elon Musk have a well-known, tense relationship around OpenAI/xAI. That makes a deliberate joint stage less likely unless all parties desire a high‑profile debate and are comfortable with the optics and ground rules. This pushes the probability down versus a neutral pair of headliners.\n- Organizer incentives: YC could engineer a buzzy joint conversation, but it also risks overshadowing the rest of the program and introduces security/logistical complexity. Absent clear marketing of a joint appearance, the safer, common choice is separate slots.\n- Scheduling/cancellation risk: Musk, in particular, has a history of last‑minute scheduling volatility. A joint appearance requires both to be on time and aligned; this fragility reduces odds versus independent sessions.\n- Countervailing factors (why not lower): Both are confirmed headliners at the same two‑day event in SF, reducing travel friction and creating an opportunity. Musk often embraces spectacle; YC may decide a marquee joint session or brief stage moment (e.g., closing remarks) is worth it. Even a short overlap on stage would resolve Yes.\n- Research assistant: No additional information available, so no program details to shift the prior.\n- What would move me up: Public agenda or YC promo explicitly listing a joint session; credible reports that both agreed to a debate/panel; social posts hinting they’ll appear together; confirmation of an all‑speakers on‑stage segment.\n- What would move me down: Published agenda showing clearly separate, non‑overlapping sessions with no joint elements; reports of either canceling; renewed public friction making a joint appearance implausible.\nOverall, base rates for headliners sharing a stage without prior announcement are modest, and the interpersonal and logistical factors further dampen the likelihood, but the event setup preserves a real tail for a joint moment.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill Sam Altman and Elon Musk be on the stage together at YC AI Startup School?\n\nQuestion background:\nY Combinator is an American venture capital firm known for launching over 5,000 companies including Airbnb, Stripe, and Reddit. In 2025, Y Combinator announced AI Startup School, a conference in San Francisco held on June 16–17, aimed at 2,000 final-year students and recent graduates in computer science, artificial intelligence, and related fields.&#x20;\n\nY Combinator has announced that both Sam Altman and Elon Musk are among the headline speakers at the AI Startup School, but it is unknown whether they will appear on stage together at the same time.\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question will resolve as Yes if Sam Altman and Elon Musk share a stage together at YC AI Startup School after 7:59 AM, June 16, 2025, and before 00:00 AM, June 18, 2025. Otherwise, this question will resolve as No.\n\nSharing a stage is defined as both individuals being physically present on the same platform at the same time.&#x20;\n\nThis question will resolve according to a preponderance of evidence. If there is no clear evidence of this occurring before July 1, 2025, this question will resolve as No.\n\nAll times for this question are in Pacific Daylight Time (PDT).  &#x20;\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nNo additional information available.\n\nToday is 2025-05-27.\n\nBefore answering you think:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n(e) You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
