  "information": "Executives from major publishers, including The New York Times and News Corp, stated confidence in their businesses' ability to grow despite economic uncertainties from tariffs. In Q1 2025, The New York Times reported a 12% growth in digital advertising revenue, while most other publishers saw flat revenue. New York Times executives described the impact of tariffs as 'immaterial.' This contrasts with a survey indicating 54% of marketers plan to reduce their 2025 budgets due to tariff concerns. Following a Federal Reserve statement that it would wait for the full impact of tariffs before making decisions, communications-services stocks declined, though The New York Times and Walt Disney posted positive results.\n\nThe Wall Street Journal's editorial board described a trade deal with the United Kingdom as a step towards unwinding the trade war, writing that the economic damage from tariffs was proving politically risky. The board also has stated that the tariff policy has shaken global confidence in U.S. reliability and called it a 'true gift' to Chinese President Xi Jinping. In April 2025, President Trump suggested tariffs could replace income taxes, a claim that a Wall Street Journal reporter noted reasons to be skeptical of. Following the implementation of tariffs, the Treasury Department raised its borrowing projection for the April-June 2025 quarter to an estimated net marketable borrowing of $514 billion.\n\nAn executive order signed on April 2, 2025, imposes a 10% 'minimum benchmark tariff' on all trade partners, with higher tariffs on certain partners. Reports since the order indicate a 'precautionary consumption' trend in the US, with consumers stockpiling goods. The arrival of container ships from China, which supplies 77% of toys sold in the US, has reportedly fallen by 50%. In March 2025, the Cortland Standard, a 147-year-old newspaper in New York, ceased publication, citing rising costs, including a 25% tariff on newsprint from Canada, as a contributing factor.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "23 days (from May 9, 2025 to May 31, 2025)",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No. Tariffs are a major, ongoing news story due to recent presidential actions, making it highly likely the word 'tariff(s)' will appear on the front page of at least one of the two newspapers every day.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "The economic and political consequences of the administration's new universal tariff policy continue to be a top national story, ensuring the word 'tariff(s)' appears daily on the front page of either The New York Times, The Wall Street Journal, or both, for the remainder of May 2025.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "On at least one day before June 1, 2025, likely a weekend, a separate major, breaking news event (such as a significant geopolitical development or a large natural disaster) dominates the news cycle, pushing any mention of tariffs off the front pages of both newspapers simultaneously.",
    "rationale": "My forecast is that there is a low probability of the word 'tariff(s)' disappearing from the front pages of both the NYT and WSJ by June 1, 2025. The primary driver for this forecast is the extremely high news salience of the tariff issue at this specific time. According to the provided background, a sweeping executive order imposing a 'minimum benchmark tariff' on all trade partners was signed on April 2, 2025. This is a recent, major policy development with significant ongoing economic and political ramifications, such as consumer stockpiling and increased Treasury borrowing, which are classic front-page stories. The President's own suggestion that tariffs could replace income taxes further guarantees the topic's prominence in public discourse. The Wall Street Journal, being a premier business newspaper, is almost certain to cover this story on its front page daily. For a 'Yes' outcome, both it and The New York Times would need to omit the word on the same day. Given the story's magnitude, this is unlikely to happen. The status quo strongly suggests the topic will remain a front-page fixture.\n\nMy forecast is not lower (e.g. 5%) because the 23-day period provides several opportunities for a different, major story to dominate the news cycle. News is inherently volatile, and an external event could plausibly displace tariff coverage in both papers for a single day, especially over a weekend when news coverage can be different. \n\nMy forecast is not higher (e.g. 40%) because the tariff story is not a background issue; it is the central, active economic policy being debated and reported on. The provided information indicates the story is at its peak, not fading. Therefore, the probability of it disappearing from both front pages, even for one day, remains low.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill the word \"tariff(s)\" disappear from the front print pages of The New York Times and Wall Street Journal by June 1, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nWhether reading the newspaper or social media or watching the news, it is highly likely you are going to see something about tariffs - mainly due to US President Donald Trump's renewed love for this somewhat antiquated form of taxation.\n\nThe New York Times and the Wall Street Journal are two of the largest print newspapers in the US. When, if ever, will we seen tariffs wiped from the front pages of both papers?\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below.

Format is: yyyy-mm-dd.</sup>\n\nGrammar is not relevant (e.g. \"TARIFF\" will suffice to prevent a \"No\" resolution).\n\n\"Tariff(s)\" must be omitted from both papers' front pages on the same day.\n\n\"Tariff(s)\" can appear anywhere on the page, it does not have to be in a title.\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nExecutives from major publishers, including The New York Times and News Corp, stated confidence in their businesses' ability to grow despite economic uncertainties from tariffs.

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
