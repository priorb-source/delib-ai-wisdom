  "information": "Prominent attorney John Morgan has announced plans to launch a new political party aimed at centrist voters, expressing dissatisfaction with the current two-party system. Multiple news outlets reported in February and May 2025 that Morgan has been working on this initiative for months, with lawyers preparing party-formation paperwork for what has been referred to as the 'Capitalist Party' or '#ForThePeople'.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Approximately 24 days remain until July 1, 2025",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No - John Morgan has not yet formally announced his candidacy",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Morgan continues exploring a potential gubernatorial run and working on party formation but does not make a formal candidacy announcement before July 1, either because the party registration paperwork is not finalized, he decides to announce at a later strategic date, or he ultimately decides against running in this cycle.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Morgan capitalizes on the recent media momentum from his May 15 Politico interview and his new political party efforts to formally announce his candidacy for Florida governor within the next 24 days, potentially timing it with the completion of his 'Capitalist Party' or '#ForThePeople' party formation.",
    "rationale": "The research assistant indicates Morgan has been actively preparing for a potential run, with lawyers working on party-formation paperwork and multiple news outlets covering his plans since February and May 2025. The May 15 Politico article specifically describes him laying out a 'campaign blueprint,' suggesting serious consideration. However, several factors support a conservative forecast: (1) As of June 6, no formal announcement has been made despite months of preparation; (2) Only 24 days remain until the July 1 deadline; (3) The Politico headline describes it as a 'possible' run, not a confirmed one; (4) Forming a new political party is complex and the paperwork is still being prepared, which might delay any announcement. Good forecasters favor status quo outcomes since change happens slowly - the current status quo is 'no formal announcement.' The probability is not higher because there's been no concrete evidence of an imminent announcement (no scheduled press conference, no campaign staff hires reported, no explicit commitment). The probability is not lower because Morgan has clearly invested significant time and resources into this possibility, and 24 days is sufficient time to make an announcement if the decision is made. For me to update higher, I would need to see: scheduled announcement events, campaign staff hires, fundraising activities, or more definitive statements about running. For me to update lower, I would need: explicit statements about reconsidering, extended delays in party formation, or reports that he needs more time beyond July 1.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill John Morgan announce his candidacy for Florida governor before July 1, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nPolitico: [John Morgan lays out campaign blueprint for possible Florida governor run](https://www.politico.com/news/2025/05/15/john-morgan-florida-governor-run-00351005)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if John Morgan announces his candidacy for governor of Florida before July 1, 2025. If no such announcement has been made before that date, the question resolves as **No**.\n\n\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nProminent attorney John Morgan has announced plans to launch a new political party aimed at centrist voters, expressing dissatisfaction with the current two-party system.

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any).
