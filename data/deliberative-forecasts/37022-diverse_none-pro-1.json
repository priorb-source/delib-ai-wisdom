    "review": "I have reviewed the analyses from the other two forecasters. Forecaster 3's reasoning aligns very closely with my own, correctly identifying that baseline debt levels are far above the 1.90 trillion UAH threshold, making a 'Yes' outcome highly probable. They accurately pinpoint the only plausible, albeit remote, risks as definitional issues or data errors from the source. Forecaster 2's analysis arrives at a broadly correct conclusion but assigns far too much uncertainty, with a forecast of 78%. Their reasoning seems to overlook the most crucial piece of evidence: the latest available data from the resolution source (Trading Economics) already shows the debt level at over 6 trillion UAH for February 2025. This makes the question less about forecasting a trend and more about confirming an already-established fact, barring an extraordinary data revision. The 22% uncertainty implied by their forecast is not justified by the fiscal realities or the available data.",
    "rationale": "My original forecast of 99% remains unchanged. The deliberation process has reinforced my initial assessment. The core of my argument is simple and dispositive: the resolution source, Trading Economics, reports Ukraine's government debt for February 2025—the month immediately preceding the resolution month—as 6.01 trillion UAH. This figure is more than triple the 1.90 trillion UAH threshold. For the question to resolve as 'No', the debt would have had to decrease by over 4.1 trillion UAH (a drop of nearly 70%) in a single month. There is no plausible economic or political scenario, including debt restructuring or accounting changes, that could produce such a monumental drop without being a major, widely reported international event. None has occurred. Forecaster 3's analysis validates this view. Forecaster 2's lower probability does not present any specific evidence that could account for such a decrease, relying instead on general uncertainty that is inconsistent with the sheer scale of the mismatch between the current data and the resolution threshold. My 99% forecast accounts for the small tail risk of a gross data error or a sudden definitional change by the source, which I continue to assess as extremely unlikely.",
