    "review": "Forecaster 2 adds two useful points I hadn’t fully weighted: (1) Osborn’s stated “decide by early summer” timeline, which plausibly points to June/July rather than before June 1, and (2) his 2024 cycle pattern (announced July 2023), consistent with a later 2025 announcement. The 3–6 month exploratory norm also supports a post–June 1 decision; their 28% is coherent with these signals.\n\nForecaster 3 introduces Trump’s April 11 endorsement of Ricketts. That’s new and relevant, but I see the effect on timing as ambiguous: it raises the hurdle (arguing for more deliberation) but could also spur a faster announcement to frame the race. Given no public signs of an imminent rollout, I agree more with the “status quo” tilt. Their 40% feels high relative to their own cautionary arguments.\n\nNet: F2’s timeline/semantics and exploratory-duration points move me modestly downward; F3’s endorsement point doesn’t raise the pre–June 1 likelihood in the absence of concrete launch signals.",
    "rationale": "Time remaining is ~39 days. We have: an exploratory committee formed in early April; public guidance of a decision by “early summer”; no visible pre-announcement markers (senior staff hires, event holds, FEC conversion, media advisories); and no ballot-access or calendar pressure forcing a May 2025 launch for a 2026 independent. Osborn’s prior pattern (July 2023 announcement for his 2024 run) and the common 3–6 month exploratory window both point to June/July or later. Trump’s endorsement of Ricketts likely increases the difficulty of the race but doesn’t create urgency to announce before June 1. Conversely, arguments for a May announcement (capitalize on Q2 fundraising, leverage name ID) are plausible but currently unsupported by tangible signals.\n\nGiven this, I’m lowering my estimate from 35% to 30%, reflecting a modestly stronger tilt toward a continued exploratory phase past June 1 absent new evidence of an imminent rollout.",
