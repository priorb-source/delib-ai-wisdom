    "review": "The other forecasters and I are in strong agreement that a 'No' outcome is overwhelmingly likely, with all forecasts at 6% or lower. The core reasoning is identical: the ongoing civil war has crippled Sudan's state capacity, and the less-than-one-month timeline is wholly insufficient for ratification. I found the other analysts' contributions valuable for adding specific details to the very low-probability 'Yes' scenarios. Forecaster 2 rightly pointed to the possibility of 'expedited executive action,' and Forecaster 3 provided an even more detailed mechanism ('ratification by decree' by the Sovereign Council) and a compelling motive ('diplomatic signaling' to project legitimacy). These arguments articulate a more plausible pathway to 'Yes' than the generic 'black swan' event I had initially considered.",
    "rationale": "My initial forecast of 1% was based on the near-total paralysis of the Sudanese state due to the civil war. The arguments from the other forecasters have convinced me to slightly increase this probability. While the primary drivers of my forecast—the intense conflict, the shattered administrative capacity, and the extremely short deadline—remain firmly in place and point strongly to a 'No' outcome, I underestimated a specific, plausible, albeit highly improbable, pathway to 'Yes'. The combination of a potential legal mechanism (an executive decree) and a strategic motive (using ratification for diplomatic signaling to appear as a functioning, legitimate government on the international stage) makes a surprise ratification a non-zero possibility worth more than a 1% probability. However, the practical obstacles are immense. The government's focus is on military survival, not on long-term trade policy. Therefore, while I am updating my forecast upward to account for this newly considered scenario, the change is small. I am moving from 1% to 3%, aligning with Forecaster 2. This reflects that while a 'Yes' is more conceivable than I first thought, it remains an extreme long shot.",
