  "information": "The 'Magnificent Seven' stocks led a market rebound starting April 8, 2025, but their performance in the first four months of 2025 was negative. The group's value stumbled due to investor concerns over the economic impact of President Donald Trump's tariffs, announced on April 2, which caused a combined loss of $2.27 trillion in market value before recovering by May 2. Specific stocks were affected differently; year-to-date, Tesla's stock had declined 31% and Amazon's 15%. Around May 5, 2025, the US stock market saw the end of a 9-day winning streak.",

    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "About 8 days (13F due by May 15, 2025)",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Berkshire’s Q1 2025 13F lists Apple (and possibly Amazon) but shows no positions in Alphabet, Meta Platforms, Microsoft, Nvidia, or Tesla; or any such positions remain under confidential treatment and thus are not disclosed in the filing.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "The Q1 2025 13F shows Berkshire holding any of Alphabet (GOOGL/GOOG), Meta (META), Microsoft (MSFT), Nvidia (NVDA), or Tesla (TSLA) as of March 31, 2025, regardless of size.",
    "rationale": "- Base rate/status quo: Berkshire has consistently avoided adding new Magnificent 7 exposures beyond Apple (core) and a modest Amazon stake. Buffett has long articulated reasons for not owning Microsoft (appearance issues given his friendship with Gates), has expressed discomfort with high-flying AI names (e.g., sold TSMC on geopolitical risk), and has shown little interest in Tesla or Nvidia at current valuations. Historically, new large-cap tech positions from Berkshire are rare and telegraphed; Apple was an exception years ago. \n- Recent posture: Berkshire has been a net seller and has allowed cash to build to record levels, signaling caution rather than expansion into pricey megacaps. The 2025 annual meeting commentary (widely reported) emphasized valuation discipline and a likely shrinking equity portfolio, which makes a fresh Mag 7 purchase less likely. \n- Confidential treatment: Berkshire has used confidential treatment (e.g., Chubb) when building positions. If they were accumulating any Mag 7, they could keep it hidden; in that case, the Q1 2025 13F would still not reveal it, resolving No. For mega-cap, hyper-liquid names, the need to hide is arguably lower, but the mechanism still tilts the near-term disclosure probability down. \n- Countervailing factors (why not lower): Weschler/Combs have autonomy and could initiate a small position in Alphabet or Meta on valuation/moat grounds. Early-2025 weakness in Mag 7 (per research assistant: the group was down in the first four months) could tempt a small, opportunistic entry. Gates’ formal ties to Microsoft have waned, marginally reducing optics concerns (though Buffett has still cited them historically). \n- Research assistant summary impact: The Mag 7 drawdown in early 2025 increases the theoretical attractiveness slightly, but the timing (some weakness occurred in April, after Q1-end) and Berkshire’s overall risk-off stance temper that effect. \n- Why not higher: Track record, Buffett’s public skepticism of AI-driven valuations, recent net selling and cash build, and the availability of confidential treatment (which would still produce a No) all argue for a low probability of a visible new Mag 7 stake in this 13F. \n- What would move me up: Credible reporting (WSJ/Bloomberg) hinting Berkshire or its lieutenants bought Alphabet/Meta/Microsoft/Nvidia/Tesla; meeting/transcript remarks signaling new comfort with a specific name; an absence of a confidential treatment request combined with hints of tech interest. \n- What would move me down: Clear statements from Buffett that they hold none of these; evidence of continued broad selling; a new confidential treatment request suggesting any new stake will remain hidden this quarter.",

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
