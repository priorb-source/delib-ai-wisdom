    "review": "All three of us converge on the fundamental assessment: legal reentry within 2 months is nearly impossible, and no evidence suggests imminent return. Forecaster 2 provides important additional detail about 'prior criminal convictions' requiring waivers of inadmissibility, which substantially compounds the legal barriers beyond standard deportation bars. This is a crucial point I had not explicitly considered. Forecaster 2's very conservative 2% reflects appropriate skepticism about even irregular pathways succeeding and being documented within such a short window. Forecaster 3 and I both landed at 8%, emphasizing that while unlikely, the Wikipedia page existence suggests enough notability that advocacy-driven outcomes or irregular entry with subsequent reporting remain possible, if improbable. The key debate is whether the additional criminal conviction barrier and absence of any positive signals warrants moving from 8% toward 2%, or whether maintaining some probability mass for unexpected developments (political intervention, successful irregular entry, emergency parole) justifies staying closer to 8%. The 'no additional information' from the research assistant is indeed telling - in high-profile cases where return is imminent, there are usually signals (legal filings, advocacy campaigns, media reports). The absence suggests no active pathway is underway.",
    "rationale": "After reviewing both analyses, I find Forecaster 2's emphasis on the criminal conviction barrier particularly compelling and a factor I had insufficiently weighted. The combination of deportation plus criminal inadmissibility creates a double barrier that makes legal reentry within 2 months virtually impossible absent extraordinary circumstances. However, I disagree with dropping all the way to 2% because: (1) the existence of a Wikipedia article does indicate sufficient notability that advocacy efforts or political intervention, while rare, are within the realm of historical precedent for similar cases; (2) irregular reentry followed by arrest and credible media reporting, while unlikely, occurs often enough that over a 2-month period it warrants more than negligible probability; and (3) emergency humanitarian parole or court-ordered returns, though rare and typically slow, occasionally happen faster than expected in politically salient cases. The forecast question requires only entry and credible reporting, not sustained lawful presence. I'm updating downward from my initial 8% to 5% to appropriately weight the criminal conviction barrier and the genuine severity of the 2-month constraint, while maintaining that black swan events and irregular entry scenarios justify keeping probability above the 2% floor.",
