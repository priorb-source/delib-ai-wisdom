    "review": "Both forecasters align with my assessment: White House confirmation, inclusion on official participant lists, active Canadian security posture, and normal ministerial/preparatory activity strongly point to attendance. They add two useful nuances I hadn’t explicitly noted: (1) Kananaskis’s suitability as a secure venue lowers operational risk, and (2) a small tail risk from potential wildfire/airspace or severe weather disruptions in the Canadian Rockies. They also reiterate that lack of a joint communique would not materially affect attendance. I find their reasoning convincing and consistent with the high historical base rate of U.S. presidential G7 attendance and current signals.",
    "rationale": "Key signals remain robust: WH confirmation, official listings as of June 3, Canadian controlled access and airspace restrictions (June 10–18), and standard choreography (finance track in Banff; a June 5 Scholz meeting at the White House). With less than two weeks to go, the status quo clearly favors attendance. Tail risks persist but are small: acute health issues, sudden domestic/foreign crises, specific security threats, mechanical/weather/wildfire-related aviation issues, or an idiosyncratic last-minute change. The additional wildfire/airspace consideration slightly reinforces the tail-risk bucket rather than reducing it. No new contrary evidence emerged to move the probability meaningfully. Given converging confirmations and preparations, I maintain my estimate.",
