    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Approximately 1.5 months (47 days). The resolution deadline is July 1, 2025, and today is May 14, 2025.",
    "status_quo_outcome": "Mahmoud Khalil remains in the United States, likely in detention, as his legal challenge to his detention and potential deportation continues to move through the U.S. legal system.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Mr. Khalil's legal proceedings, including potential appeals, are not fully concluded by the deadline. The U.S. legal and immigration systems often move slowly, and his case follows this typical timeline. A court might grant a stay of removal or schedule hearings for a date after July 1, 2025, leaving him in the U.S. as the deadline passes.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "The court system moves with unusual speed to deny Mr. Khalil's legal challenge. All avenues for appeal are quickly exhausted or denied, resulting in a final, executable order of removal. U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) then prioritizes his case, rapidly securing any necessary travel documents and arranging his physical removal from the United States before the July 1, 2025 deadline.",
    "rationale": "My forecast is heavily influenced by the typically slow pace of the U.S. legal and immigration systems. The status quo, as indicated by the question's background, is an ongoing legal challenge. Such challenges, which can involve multiple layers of hearings and appeals, rarely conclude and result in physical deportation within a very short timeframe of approximately six weeks. The research assistant's report provided no additional information, so I must rely on this general principle, which serves as a strong prior. The world, and especially its bureaucracies, usually changes slowly. Therefore, the most probable outcome is that the legal process will not be finalized by the deadline.\n\nThe probability is not lower than 5% because unforeseen events could expedite the process. For example, his legal challenge could be dismissed on a technicality, or the case could be a high government priority, leading to an accelerated timeline that is not publicly known. A 5% chance accounts for these less likely, but still possible, rapid resolutions.\n\nThe probability is not higher because there is no positive evidence to suggest this case will deviate from the standard, protracted timeline. To increase my forecast, I would need information confirming that Mr. Khalil has exhausted all his legal appeals and a final, non-appealable deportation order is already in place. Conversely, my forecast would decrease if new information showed that a court had agreed to hear a new appeal or scheduled a hearing for after the July 1, 2025 deadline.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill Mahmoud Khalil be deported before July 1, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\n[Mahmoud Khalil's challenge to his detention moves forward]()\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if the United States deports Mahmoud Khalil before July 1, 2025. For purposes of this question, \"deported\" means Khalil being transported out of the territory of the United States against his will.\n\n\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nNo additional information available.\n\nToday is 2025-05-14.\n\nBefore answering you think:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n(e) You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
