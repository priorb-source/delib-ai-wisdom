  "information": "According to reports, Berkshire Hathaway was a net seller of stocks for nine to ten consecutive quarters through Q4 2024, with cash reserves reaching between $334 billion and $347.7 billion by the end of that year. The company's portfolio turnover rate is 0.97%. Warren Buffett recently stated that the 'Magnificent Seven' companies require more capital to operate today than they did a few years ago, reiterating that Berkshire Hathaway's investment philosophy is to seek companies with high returns and low capital needs.\n\nThe 'Magnificent Seven' stocks led a market rebound starting April 8, 2025, but their performance in the first four months of 2025 was negative. The group's value stumbled due to investor concerns over the economic impact of President Donald Trump's tariffs, announced on April 2, which caused a combined loss of $2.27 trillion in market value before recovering by May 2. Specific stocks were affected differently; year-to-date, Tesla's stock had declined 31% and Amazon's 15%. Around May 5, 2025, the US stock market saw the end of a 9-day winning streak.\n\nFirst-quarter earnings reports for the 'Magnificent Seven' showed varied performance. Meta's earnings per share beat analyst estimates, and Microsoft's revenue and profit exceeded expectations. In contrast, Amazon's cloud business showed decelerating growth, while Apple reported a 4.8% increase in earnings on 5.1% higher revenues. Both Amazon and Apple cited tariffs as a potential headwind. Around the same period, Warren Buffett announced his plan to retire as CEO at the end of 2025, with Greg Abel set to take over. On March 17, 2025, Berkshire Hathaway Class B shares reached a record high of $523.01.",

    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "~8 days (13F due by May 15, 2025)",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Berkshire’s Q1 2025 13F shows no new positions in Alphabet, Meta, Microsoft, Nvidia, or Tesla—continuing its multi‑quarter pattern of net selling and conservatism, possibly trimming Apple and/or other holdings but not initiating new Mag7 names.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Todd Combs or Ted Weschler initiates and discloses (i.e., not kept confidential) a new position in Alphabet, Meta, Microsoft, Nvidia, or Tesla during Q1 2025—likely a modest starter stake in Alphabet, Meta, or Microsoft rather than Nvidia or Tesla—and it appears on the Q1 13F.",
    "rationale": "- Base rate/status quo: Berkshire rarely opens new mega‑cap tech positions; aside from Apple (2016) and a small Amazon position (2019), new FAAMG/Mag7 buys are unusual. Berkshire has been a net seller for many quarters and is sitting on record cash, signaling reluctance to add equity risk. This pushes toward No as the default.\n- Recent posture: Per the assistant’s report, Berkshire was a net seller for 9–10 straight quarters through Q4 2024 and emphasized seeking high returns on low capital. Buffett has suggested many Mag7 firms are more capital intensive now, which is a philosophical headwind to initiating new stakes—particularly in Nvidia and Tesla. This supports a lower likelihood of a new Mag7 buy being revealed in Q1 13F.\n- Timing/valuation: Q1 ended Mar 31, before the April tariff shock and early‑April tech selloff. That reduces the chance Berkshire opportunistically bought on weakness during Q1. \n- Process/opacity: If Berkshire were accumulating a sizable new Mag7 position, it might request confidential treatment from the SEC, meaning the Q1 13F would not reveal it—still resolving this question as No even if buying occurred. This further lowers the Yes probability.\n- Countervailing factors (why not lower): Todd Combs and Ted Weschler have discretion and have bought large‑cap tech before (Amazon, TSMC briefly). Among the five eligible names, Alphabet/Meta/Microsoft are plausible for a small, disclosed starter stake given durable moats and AI positioning. Even a modest buy would trigger a Yes. Also, performance dispersion within Mag7 and evolving AI economics could make one of these names attractive to Todd/Ted.\n- Net assessment: The combination of Berkshire’s seller stance, Buffett’s comments, the Q1 timing, and the possibility of confidential treatment outweigh the chance of a disclosed starter stake. Still, the non‑zero probability that Todd/Ted initiated and disclosed a small position keeps the forecast above very low levels.\n- What would raise the probability: Evidence from Berkshire’s Q1 results/meeting that they were net equity buyers; hints that Todd/Ted initiated a tech position; market chatter or filings (13G/13D) tied to Berkshire; signs Berkshire did not request confidentiality. \n- What would lower the probability: Confirmation they were sizeable net sellers in Q1, further public statements dismissing Mag7 valuations/capital intensity, or indications of continued use of confidentiality around any new large positions.",

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
