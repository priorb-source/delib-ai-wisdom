  "information": "A specific incident in January 2023 involved a U.S. Air Force F-16 Viper fighter jet colliding with an unidentified object during a training mission over Arizona, causing damage to the aircraft's canopy. The object was described as an 'orange-white uncrewed aerial system' (UAS). This is one of numerous encounters reported by military pilots in the region, establishing Arizona as a hotspot for UAP sightings, particularly near military training areas and the border with Mexico. Former government intelligence officer Luis Elizondo confirmed that there has been significant reported activity in the area.",

    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Approximately 41 days - June 2025 begins in 10 days, and the outcome will be determined on or after July 1, 2025, once the full month of June has elapsed.",
    "status_quo_outcome": "Yes - Based on recent historical patterns, it appears likely that at least one cube-shaped UFO will be reported to NUFORC in June 2025.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "During June 2025, people either report no UFO sightings to NUFORC that are cube-shaped, or all reported sightings are of other shapes (spheres, triangles, discs, cylinders, etc.). This could occur if the December 2024 spike was an anomaly, or if June historically has fewer sightings than winter months.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "At least one observer reports seeing a cube-shaped UFO/UAP to NUFORC during June 2025, and NUFORC posts this report on their website. Given that December 2024 saw 6 such reports, even a fraction of that activity would satisfy the resolution criteria. Summer months may see increased outdoor activity and visibility, potentially leading to more sightings.",
    "rationale": "The key data point is that December 2024 had 6 cube-shaped UFO sightings reported to NUFORC, which the question describes as 'rare' in NUFORC's history. This provides crucial base rate information: while cube-shaped sightings are uncommon, they do occur with some regularity. The question only requires ONE cube-shaped sighting to resolve Yes, which is a low bar compared to December's 6. NUFORC processes approximately 3,600 reports annually (300 per month on average based on 180,000 reports over 50 years). If December's 6 cube-shaped sightings represent a relatively high month for this shape category, we might expect most months to have 0-3 such sightings. However, the probability of having at least one in any given month appears substantial. June being a summer month could work in favor of a Yes outcome due to increased outdoor activity, better weather, and longer daylight hours leading to more sky observation time. The research assistant's information about military encounters, while interesting for context, doesn't directly address cube-shaped sightings specifically. Why not higher (above 75%): The term 'rare' is emphasized, suggesting cube-shaped sightings are genuinely uncommon. December 2024 might have been an outlier month. There's insufficient data about typical monthly variation in cube-shaped reports. Why not lower (below 55%): December 2024's 6 reports demonstrate that cube-shaped UFOs are actively being reported to NUFORC. We only need ONE report, not multiple. The base rate evidence suggests better than coin-flip odds. To update higher: Evidence that cube-shaped sightings are trending upward, or that June historically sees more UFO reports. To update lower: Data showing December 2024 was a major statistical outlier, or that most recent months have had zero cube-shaped reports.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill the National UFO Reporting Center report a sighting of a cube-shaped UFO in June 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nAccording to the [National UFO Reporting Center](https://nuforc.org/about-us/): \"The National UFO Reporting Center was founded in 1974 by noted UFO investigator Robert J. Gribble. The Center’s primary function over the past five decades has been to receive, record, and to the greatest degree possible, corroborate and document reports from individuals who have been witness to unusual, possibly UFO-related events. Throughout its history, the Center has processed over 180,000 reports, and has distributed its information to thousands of individuals.\"\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if The National UFO Reporting Center posts a report of a sighting of a UFO/UAP shaped like a cube in June 2025 at [this link](https://nuforc.org/ndx/?id=event) when accessed by Metaculus on or after July 1, 2025.\n\nFor example, although rare in the history of NUFORC, the month of December 2024 [had](https://nuforc.org/subndx/?id=e202412) six sightings with a cube shape.\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nA specific incident in January 2023 involved a U.S. Air Force F-16 Viper fighter jet colliding with an unidentified object during a training mission over Arizona, causing damage to the aircraft's canopy. The object was described as an 'orange-white uncrewed aerial system' (UAS). This is one of numerous encounters reported by military pilots in the region, establishing Arizona as a hotspot for UAP sightings, particularly near military training areas and the border with Mexico. Former government intelligence officer Luis Elizondo confirmed that there has been significant reported activity in the area.\n\nToday is 2025-05-21.\n\nBefore answering you think:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n(e) You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
