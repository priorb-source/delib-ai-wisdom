  "information": "The most recent post on Virgin Galactic's News page was dated January 30, 2025. The post before that was from December 12, 2024. Over the 10 complete months leading up to May 2025, five months contained at least one post. There was a four-month gap in posts from August to October 2024, and a three-month gap from February to April 2025.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Approximately one month. The outcome will be determined after May 31, 2025.",
    "status_quo_outcome": "Yes. The current status is a three-month period with no new posts on the News page. A continuation of this trend through May would result in a 'Yes' outcome.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Virgin Galactic makes at least one post on its News page in May 2025. This is most likely triggered by the release of its Q1 2025 financial results, which typically occurs in May, or an announcement regarding its next spaceflight mission.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "The current pause in communications continues through May. This could occur if there are no flights, financial reports, or other significant announcements scheduled for the month, or if the company decides to push its Q1 earnings announcement into June.",
    "rationale": "My forecast is primarily based on the high likelihood of a scheduled corporate event forcing a news post. The research assistant's data indicates a 50% base rate of posting per month over the last 10 months (five of ten months had posts). However, the most recent data shows a three-month gap, and a previous four-month gap demonstrates that such pauses are not unprecedented. This recent trend, representing the status quo, would strongly suggest a 'Yes' outcome if viewed in isolation. However, this is counteracted by a highly predictable event: quarterly earnings reports. As a publicly traded company, Virgin Galactic must release quarterly financial results. Historically, their Q1 results are released in early-to-mid-May. Such an event is almost always accompanied by a press release posted to the company's own news hub. The probability of a Q1 earnings report occurring in May and being posted on their News page is very high, making a 'No' outcome the more likely scenario. My forecast is not lower (i.e., a higher probability of a post) because the recent three-month silence is a significant deviation from their earlier cadence and suggests a lower general level of news-worthy activity. There's a small chance they might delay the earnings release until June or change their communication policy. My forecast is not higher because the predictable nature of a quarterly earnings report is a very strong driver for a news post that outweighs the current 'no news' trend. I would raise my probability of 'Yes' if a Q1 earnings date is announced for June or later, and lower it if a May date is confirmed.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill Virgin Galactic fail to make any new posts on its News page in May 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nAs of April 19, 2025, Virgin Galactic's most recent post was timestamped January 30, 2025. The most recent one before then was December 12, 2024.\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if no new posts appear at Virgin Galactic's News page, which can be accessed at [this address](https://www.virgingalactic.com/news), timestamped after April 30, 2025 and before June 1, 2025. If there is a new post, then this question resolves as **No**.\n\n\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nThe most recent post on Virgin Galactic's News page was dated January 30, 2025. The post before that was from December 12, 2024. Over the 10 complete months leading up to May 2025, five months contained at least one post. There was a four-month gap in posts from August to October 2024, and a three-month gap from February to April 2025.\n\nToday is 2025-04-29.\n\nBefore answering you think:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n(e) You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
