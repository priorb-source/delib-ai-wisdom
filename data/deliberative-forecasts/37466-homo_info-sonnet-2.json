    "review": "Forecaster 3 raised a critical point I completely missed: WorldAtlas.com is a Canadian company, not US-based. This substantially changes the analysis. A Canadian educational geography website would have far less incentive to adopt what is essentially a unilateral US government naming decision that lacks international recognition and is opposed by Mexico. This dramatically reduces the likelihood of adoption. Forecaster 2's point about 3.5 months having elapsed without change to the North America page (despite acknowledging the name in the article title) is also significant - it suggests editorial reluctance rather than just slow updating. Forecaster 3's distinction between parenthetical acknowledgment in an article versus changing primary cartographic representations is well-taken. However, Forecaster 3 may be slightly too pessimistic given that WorldAtlas has shown some willingness to acknowledge the alternative name, and 54 days does provide technical opportunity for change.",
    "rationale": "My initial forecast of 25% significantly overweighted the possibility of change and underweighted several key factors. The most critical oversight was not identifying WorldAtlas as a Canadian company, which fundamentally changes the pressure dynamics. Canadian educational geography sites would prioritize international naming standards over US government decisions, especially controversial ones lacking IHO recognition. The fact that 3.5 months have passed since the Executive Order without the North America page changing - despite WorldAtlas acknowledging the name parenthetically in their Gulf article - strongly suggests editorial policy to maintain internationally recognized nomenclature on their primary maps. The split among major entities (Google changed for US users, but National Geographic and Apple have not) further indicates this is not becoming a consensus position even within the US. While 54 days is technically sufficient time for a website update, there's no catalyst, no evidence of policy shift, and the status quo heavily favors maintaining 'Gulf of Mexico' on authoritative reference maps. I'm updating substantially downward to reflect these considerations, particularly the Canadian ownership factor.",
