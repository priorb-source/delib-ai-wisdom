    "review": "Forecaster 2 and 3 largely reinforce the status-quo case. New/useful points I hadn’t explicitly weighed: (1) the 120-day petition window (Forecaster 3) that pushes any citizen-initiated path well beyond July 1; (2) the political salience of First Nations opposition and treaty considerations (Forecaster 2), which, while not dispositive for resolution, raise the cost of an early announcement; (3) the framing that the government has signaled 2026 as the envisioned timeline, with the Premier personally opposed to outright separation (Forecaster 3). I already considered that an announcement of a future date would count, but Forecaster 3’s emphasis on that mechanic is a good reminder of the tail risk. Overall, their arguments strengthen the No case; none materially increase the odds beyond my baseline.",
    "rationale": "Time remaining is very short (~55 days). The petition route almost certainly cannot complete by July 1 given a 120-day collection period plus verification, and the research assistant indicates no submission or certification to date. While the government could theoretically announce a date without a certified petition, the political incentives cut strongly against it: Premier Smith has consistently favored leverage over secession, polling for independence is not strong, First Nations opposition is salient, and an announcement would invite significant economic and legal turbulence. Tail risks remain (a galvanizing federal move or a strategic pivot to announce a 2026 date), but I view these as low-probability within the window. I’m nudging my forecast slightly down to reflect the added process/timeline friction and political costs highlighted by the other forecasters, while preserving a small chance for an announcement-only maneuver.",
