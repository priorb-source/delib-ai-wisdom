    "review": "The most critical revelation is the stark disagreement on current market caps. Forecaster 3 provides specific data showing Tesla at $1.078T vs Walmart at $768.81B—a $309B (40%) gap favoring Tesla. Forecaster 2 claims Walmart is 'slightly ahead.' These cannot both be true. Forecaster 3's precise figures and the fact that Tesla, despite recent declines, historically maintains a premium valuation due to growth/tech narrative, make their data more credible. This fundamentally changes the question: the status quo is Tesla substantially ahead, not Walmart slightly ahead or neck-and-neck as I implicitly assumed. For a Yes outcome, we need a ~29% relative swing in 45 days. While Tesla faces serious headwinds (Strong Sell, margin compression, historic decline warning), and the Robotaxi launch adds volatility, closing a 40% gap in 1.5 months is a much higher bar than I initially considered. Forecaster 2's volatility analysis (Tesla 10-20% monthly swings vs Walmart 3-8%) is valuable but insufficient to justify nearly even odds when starting from a 40% deficit. Forecaster 3's anchor effect argument is compelling—large market cap differences tend to persist over short horizons absent extreme catalysts.",
    "rationale": "I significantly underweighted the starting position in my initial forecast. If Tesla currently leads by $309B (40%), my 65% probability for Walmart finishing higher was far too aggressive. I incorrectly assumed from the article framing that the companies were closer in valuation or that Walmart might already be ahead. The math is stark: Tesla would need to fall ~29% relative to Walmart in just 45 days. While Tesla's fundamentals are weak and volatility is high, this magnitude of relative movement requires either a major Tesla-specific catastrophe (Robotaxi failure, regulatory action, demand collapse) or an extreme sector rotation away from tech. The Robotaxi launch in June is a wild card that could go either way, but product launches typically don't erase 40% valuation gaps instantly. My original reasoning about Tesla's problems remains valid, but I failed to properly weight the strong inertia of a substantial market cap lead over such a short timeframe. I'm updating significantly downward toward Forecaster 3's assessment, though slightly higher given Tesla's documented fundamental deterioration.",
