    "review": "Both forecasters provide valuable points. Forecaster 3's analysis is particularly strong, establishing a realistic baseline of 2-4 routes and correctly identifying that achieving 'greater than 5' requires multiple, independent, and unlikely events to occur within a very short timeframe. Their reasoning on route launch lead times and weak market demand aligns with my own. Forecaster 2 provides a critical piece of information I had missed: the new United Airlines service from Narita is scheduled to begin in October 2025, well after the resolution date. This removes a primary candidate for a new route and significantly strengthens the case for a 'No' outcome. However, I find Forecaster 2's probability of 45% to be inconsistent with their own reasoning and based on a likely incorrect baseline assumption that a Seoul route is currently active, which contradicts the background information.",
    "rationale": "After reviewing my peers' analyses, I am maintaining my initial forecast. The core of the problem remains unchanged: starting from a verified baseline of four scheduled direct destinations (Guam, Manila, Taipei, Brisbane), the question requires at least two new routes to be announced and operational by July 1, 2025—a period of just over five weeks. The new information provided by Forecaster 2—that United Airlines' planned Narita service will not start until October 2025—is a significant piece of evidence that reinforces my low probability. It eliminates one of the most plausible potential additions. While Forecaster 3's point about potential summer seasonal resumptions (e.g., from Hong Kong or Seoul) is valid, the complete lack of any announcements or ticket sales with the peak season already imminent makes this highly improbable. Airlines require significant lead time to market and sell new or returning international services. The combination of the extremely short timeframe, the explicitly noted weak tourism recovery, and the confirmation that a key potential route is not starting in time makes the prospect of two new routes materializing negligible. My 5% forecast reflects this confluence of negative factors, while still admitting a very small chance of a surprise, short-notice resumption of a prior route.",
