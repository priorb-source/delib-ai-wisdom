    "review": "Both forecasters make broadly similar points to mine. Forecaster 2 leans more on the strategic push from China/Russia and the existence of a partner-to-member pipeline, arguing for a higher base rate (40%). Forecaster 3 emphasizes the recency of the 2024 partner framework, the rapid growth to 10 members, and the unanimity hurdle to justify a lower base rate (30%). Neither offered concrete new signals (leaks, official statements) that would justify a large shift, but they did sharpen two considerations: (1) the partner framework reduces transaction costs for an incremental invite; (2) Brazil could, in principle, use its host role to advance a regionally convenient pick (e.g., Bolivia), even while generally cautious. I find Forecaster 3’s weighting closer to my prior, while Forecaster 2’s 40% feels high absent credible reporting of consensus forming around a specific candidate.",
    "rationale": "Time to event: ~5 weeks. Status quo: no invite. Key constraints remain: rapid expansion since 2023 (now ~10 members), a consolidation impulse after the 2024 creation of the partner track, unanimity, and Brazil’s likely preference to avoid divisive moves as host. The main upside case is a single, consensus, low-friction upgrade from the 2024 partner pool that satisfies different members’ priorities and can be framed as incremental rather than a new wave. Candidates like Bolivia (regional logic for Brazil) or Kazakhstan/Thailand/Malaysia (balanced, economically relevant, and less contentious than Turkey/Cuba/Belarus) fit that mold—but each still faces potential objections (e.g., optics, balance across regions, timing so soon after Indonesia’s accession, unsettled Saudi track). With no credible leaks or public preparatory signaling yet, the prior remains that Rio will emphasize consolidation and partner-framework deepening over new full invites. However, Forecaster 2/3’s emphasis on the pipeline and potential for a small, consensus invite nudges me slightly higher. I’m moving from 28% to 30%, reflecting a modest acknowledgement of an incremental, last-minute deal path, but keeping ‘No invite’ as the clear base case.",
