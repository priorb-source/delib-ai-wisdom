    "review": "Both forecasters emphasize the same structural constraints I used: entrenched CPC lead, FPTP seat conversion, Bloc/NDP ceilings, and the scale of swing required. They add helpful specificity on update triggers (e.g., Ontario >45% Liberal, Quebec mid‑30s with Bloc slumping, 338Canada median ≥160) and on using seat-model upper bounds to gauge tail probability. No new empirical evidence was introduced, but their calibration and thresholds are sound and reinforce a very low probability. Their convergence at 2% suggests my 3% may be a touch high absent fresh data indicating a reversal.",
    "rationale": "Time to election is roughly six months. To reach 172 in a 343-seat House, the Liberals likely need high-30s to ~40% national vote and very efficient gains in Ontario, Atlantic, and a meaningful Quebec rebound—all inconsistent with the prevailing multi‑year polling baseline and seat model tendencies. Structural constraints (Bloc in Quebec, NDP competition in urban cores, CPC gains/suburban realignment, incumbency fatigue) remain binding. Campaign volatility and tail events (leadership change with broad appeal, major CPC stumble) keep the probability above zero, as 2015 showed campaigns can move markets; however, starting from a weaker baseline than 2015 and needing a larger, multi‑region swing makes the tail thinner. The other forecasters’ reasoning aligns with mine and offers sensible thresholds for upward revision. In the absence of new signals (sustained Liberal national lead, Ontario/Quebec surges, 338Canada pushing Liberal median into the 150–160+ range), I modestly shade my estimate down to align with consensus low single digits. I would move up if: multiple independent polls for several weeks show a Liberal national lead with Ontario +5–10, Quebec mid‑30s vs Bloc, and 338Canada assigning a material (>10%) majority probability. I would move down toward ~1% if the CPC lead remains >10 points into late summer and seat model upper bounds still leave Liberals well short of 172.",
