    "review": "Forecaster 2 adds a crucial piece of evidence I hadn’t incorporated: that NUFORC shows cube-tagged reports in every month from Jan–Apr 2025, following six in Dec 2024. If accurate, that’s a strong recent base rate for a monthly “success.” Forecaster 3 reinforces the low bar (only one June report needed) and seasonality, but doesn’t add much beyond the December data point. I find F2’s argument compelling because it directly addresses the most relevant statistic—monthly frequency of the exact shape label in the primary source. I still discount slightly for possible taxonomy inconsistencies (e.g., “box,” “square,” or “unknown” instead of “cube”) and because I can’t independently verify the Jan–Apr claim here, but it materially lifts the probability.",
    "rationale": "My prior 45% leaned on historical rarity and uncertainty about the current base rate. The reported streak of monthly cube entries from Dec 2024 through Apr 2025 implies a much higher contemporary probability that any given month has at least one cube-tagged sighting. Using a simple monthly Bernoulli framing with a weak prior, five consecutive “success” months would put the posterior mean near the 80–85% range. I temper that for (a) potential misclassification/labeling variance (near-miss labels wouldn’t count), (b) possibility that the recent streak is partly a transient cluster, and (c) residual uncertainty about verification of the Jan–Apr data. Seasonality (June tends to have more reports) nudges upward. Net effect: I update substantially upward from 45% to 72%.",
