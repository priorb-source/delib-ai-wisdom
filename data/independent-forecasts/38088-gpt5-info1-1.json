  "information": "As of April 30, 2025, the 250th-ranked person on the Bloomberg Billionaires Index was Giancarlo Devasini of Italy. As of May 29, 2025, the position was occupied by Vladimir Potanin of Russia.",

    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "About 33 days (until July 1, 2025)",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No — the current #250 (as of May 29, 2025) is Vladimir Potanin of Russia, not the United States",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "By July 1, the 250th spot is held by a non-U.S. billionaire (e.g., from Europe, China, India, or Russia). Mid-list ranks tend to be internationally diverse, and normal market/currency moves keep a non-U.S. name at #250 on the day admins check.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "A U.S. billionaire hovering around ranks ~245–255 drifts into #250 due to typical daily market and FX moves or list updates, making the #250 entry show United States on July 1 when admins access the page.",
    "rationale": "- Evidence/status quo: The research assistant notes #250 was Giancarlo Devasini (Italy) on April 30 and Vladimir Potanin (Russia) on May 29. So the most recent observed occupant is non-U.S., and the last two snapshots were also non-U.S. That nudges the forecast toward No.\n- Baseline composition: The U.S. is the largest single-country share of the Bloomberg Billionaires Index, but it is well below 50% of the list. Around the median (rank ~250), the field is internationally mixed. A reasonable baseline probability that a random mid-rank is U.S. is roughly in the 30–40% range.\n- Volatility at rank ~250: Day-to-day moves in equities and FX frequently shuffle positions by a few ranks. That means there is meaningful churn in who sits at #250 on any given day, keeping a nontrivial chance that it could be U.S. on July 1 despite today’s non-U.S. status. However, because the U.S. share is probably <50% and the latest observed holder is non-U.S., the probability remains below even odds.\nWhy not higher: The U.S. almost certainly constitutes <50% of the top 500, and two recent data points at #250 were non-U.S., suggesting the immediate neighborhood isn’t U.S.-dominated.\nWhy not lower: The U.S. is still the single most represented nationality on the list, and rank ~250 is volatile; a U.S. billionaire near that rank could easily land exactly at #250 on July 1.\nWhat would move me up: Seeing, in mid-to-late June, that several U.S. billionaires are clustered around ranks 247–253, or that #250 is frequently U.S. across multiple recent days; strong relative gains in U.S. equities vs. ex-U.S. peers; FX moves favoring USD vs. currencies tied to nearby-ranked non-U.S. billionaires.\nWhat would move me down: Persistent non-U.S. occupancy of #250 across late June checks; evidence that the 245–255 band is dominated by non-U.S. names; relative underperformance of U.S. markets vs. markets tied to nearby non-U.S. billionaires.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill the median person on Bloomberg's Billionaires Index be from the United States on July 1, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nOn April 30, 2025, the 250th-ranked name on the list was Giancarlo Devasini of Italy\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if the person ranked 250th on the Bloomberg Billionaires Index (available at [this link](https://www.bloomberg.com/billionaires/)) is listed as being from the United States, when accessed by Metaculus Admins on or after July 1, 2025. It resolves as **No** if the 250th-ranked person is from any other country.\n\nFor purposes of this question, the \"median\" from the question's title is defined as the 250th ranked person on the Bloomberg Billionaires Index, no matter how many are on the list.\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nAs of April 30, 2025, the 250th-ranked person on the Bloomberg Billionaires Index was Giancarlo Devasini of Italy. As of May 29, 2025, the position was occupied by Vladimir Potanin of Russia.\n\nToday is 2025-05-29.\n\nBefore answering you think:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n(e) You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
