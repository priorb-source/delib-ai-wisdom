  "information": "As of early May 2025, campaign finance reports indicated that Jay Jones held a significant fundraising advantage. He had raised approximately $1.8 million, with $1.4 million in cash on hand. In contrast, reports for Shannon Taylor showed she had raised over $1 million. Earlier reports from the first quarter of the year indicated Jones had a roughly 2-to-1 fundraising lead over Taylor, having raised approximately $900,000 to her $525,000.",

    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "14 days until the Democratic primary scheduled for June 17, 2025",
    "status_quo_outcome": "Jay Jones wins the primary based on his significant fundraising advantage and frontrunner status",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Shannon Taylor overcomes the fundraising deficit through superior grassroots organization, stronger name recognition in key Democratic strongholds, critical endorsements from party leaders or unions, or a late-breaking issue that shifts voter sentiment away from Jones in the final two weeks",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Jay Jones converts his 2-to-1 fundraising advantage into effective advertising and voter outreach in the final two weeks, maintaining his frontrunner status and winning the primary through superior resources and campaign organization",
    "rationale": "With only 14 days until the primary, the race dynamics are largely set. Jones holds a commanding fundraising advantage with $1.8 million raised and $1.4 million cash on hand versus Taylor's $1 million total raised. This roughly 2-to-1 advantage in a two-person primary is substantial and typically correlates with organizational strength, name recognition building, and voter contact operations. At this late stage, Jones likely has already deployed much of his resource advantage into advertising and ground game operations. However, several factors prevent a higher forecast: (1) absence of polling data means I cannot confirm Jones's lead with voters despite his financial advantage; (2) Taylor has still raised over $1 million, indicating she's a credible candidate with meaningful support; (3) in Democratic primaries, factors beyond fundraising matter significantly, including endorsements, ideological positioning, and geographic base; (4) turnout in primaries can be unpredictable and driven by factors not captured in fundraising totals. The forecast is not lower because we're only two weeks out (limiting time for dramatic shifts), the fundraising gap is large, and money typically matters more in down-ballot races where voter information is limited. I would update higher with polling showing Jones with a double-digit lead or major endorsements. I would update lower with polling showing a tight race or evidence of superior Taylor ground game organization.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill Jerrauld \"Jay\" Jones win the Democratic primary for attorney general of Virginia in the 2025 election?\n\nQuestion background:\nWashington Post: [Former Del.

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
