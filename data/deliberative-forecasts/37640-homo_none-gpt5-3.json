    "review": "Both forecasters largely align with my initial reasoning: short horizon, federal inertia, archiving/redirect norms, and that any reachable response (including a redirect or sunset page) should register as “up.” New/useful nuances: (1) Metaculus can check any time on or after July 1, which lowers transient-outage risk; (2) 2017 EPA content precedent suggests months-long transitions rather than abrupt takedowns; (3) explicit acknowledgment that reliance on a single third‑party monitor adds a small measurement risk, but is manageable. I find their arguments convincing and directionally supportive of a slightly higher probability than mine due to the reduced measurement/timing risk.",
    "rationale": "Core view unchanged: even with elimination plans, the domain is likely to remain reachable (possibly as a notice/redirect/archived site) through July 1 given records, stakeholder needs, and typical federal decommission timelines. The main downside risks are a deliberate symbolic takedown timed before July 1 or an unfortunate false negative/outage at the moment Metaculus checks. The “on or after July 1” clause slightly reduces the outage/measurement risk versus my initial assessment. Accordingly, I nudge my forecast up modestly while keeping it below the most optimistic take to reflect the (still small) chance of a fast, politically driven takedown.",
