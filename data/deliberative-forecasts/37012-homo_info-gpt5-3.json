    "review": "New, useful specifics from Forecaster 2: seats reduce from 93 to 76 (39 for a majority), current composition (C 50, Lab 16, Reform 4, Green 3, Ind 3), and the Tory leader not re‑standing. Those details sharpen the baseline and increase uncertainty from boundary-induced reweighting toward Northampton. The explicit Reform presence (4 councillors) is a meaningful right‑split risk I hadn’t fully priced. Forecaster 3’s qualitative points on geography and multi‑member wards are sound, but their cited national polling (Reform > Labour) looks inaccurate; nonetheless, the core argument—Reform underperforms headline VI and often has patchy slates—still holds. The two differ on Lib Dem strength: F2 sees weak LD footprint; F3 posits LD targeting. In absence of concrete ward-level intel, I treat LD impact as moderate but not dominant.\n\nOverall, both reinforce that Conservatives remain slight favorites to be largest due to rural structure and opposition fragmentation, but boundary changes, a visible Reform presence, and leadership churn increase the chance Labour becomes largest via a Northampton sweep plus some fringe/rural losses for Conservatives.",
    "rationale": "Status quo still favors Conservatives as largest given rural South Northants/Daventry dynamics and multi-member wards, even amid sizeable losses. However, I’m nudging down from my prior because: (1) seat reduction and new boundaries plausibly increase Northampton’s relative weight; (2) evidence of an existing Reform foothold (4 councillors) heightens right‑split risks in rural/market-town wards; (3) loss of the Conservative leader’s incumbency marginally weakens their slate. Countervailing factors—likely patchy Reform slates and limited Labour reach in rural areas—keep Conservatives narrowly ahead for plurality rather than majority.\n\nNet: I still expect Conservatives to finish with the most seats, but trim the edge slightly given the added risks highlighted by the others.",
