    "review": "Both forecasters’ arguments largely align with my prior view. New and useful: Forecaster 3’s back‑of‑the‑envelope quantification of the outage (344/6,000 cancellations ≈ 5.7% for one day, translating to roughly ~0.2% of monthly traffic if proportionate) tightens the case that the April 28 shock is too small to flip the month negative. Both also appropriately downweight US‑specific demand risks given the Canaries’ European‑dominated mix. I don’t see overlooked upside risks to a ‘Yes’ outcome beyond the possibility of multi‑day spillovers from the outage or unexpectedly weak load factors despite capacity increases.",
    "rationale": "Baseline drivers (Easter entirely in April 2025, explicit capacity additions from key carriers, and Q1 growth of +3.6% with Feb/Mar +2.2% YoY) make it hard for April 2025 arrivals to underperform April 2024. The late‑month Iberian grid outage is a real negative shock, but likely limited in magnitude relative to the monthly total, and concentrated near month‑end. Even if Canary routes were hit somewhat more than proportionally and some disruptions bled into Apr 29–30, the plausible passenger loss (order of several thousand to perhaps low tens of thousands) is unlikely to offset the Easter timing tailwind and added capacity. US tourism downside from tariff headlines is marginal for this market and period. Given the additional quantification shared by the other forecasters, I trim my already low probability slightly. If evidence emerged of multi‑day, large‑scale Canary‑specific cancellations or unusually poor April load factors, I would revisit upward; absent that, the ‘decline’ scenario remains a tail.",
