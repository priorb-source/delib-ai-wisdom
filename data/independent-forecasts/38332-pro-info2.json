  "information": "President Yamandú Orsi is confirmed to travel to Seville, Spain, to attend the Fourth International Conference on Sustainable Development Financing. This United Nations conference is scheduled to run from June 30 to July 3, 2025. President Orsi has reaffirmed Uruguay's commitment to multilateralism, stating that his government will be in Seville to 'strengthen and commit' to the UN's objectives.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Less than one month, as the question resolves on July 1, 2025.",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No. As of today, the government of Uruguay has not announced that President Orsi will attend the BRICS summit.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "The July 1, 2025 deadline passes without an announcement. This is most likely because President Orsi's confirmed attendance at a UN conference in Spain from June 30 to July 3, 2025 creates a logistical conflict, leading Uruguay to decline the invitation at the presidential level or send a different representative.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Despite the scheduling conflict, the Uruguayan government prioritizes the BRICS invitation and makes an announcement before July 1. This could happen if the BRICS summit is scheduled for later in July, allowing President Orsi to travel from Spain to Brazil, or if his plans for the Spain conference change.",
    "rationale": "My forecast is primarily based on the strong evidence of a scheduling conflict provided by the research assistant. President Orsi is confirmed to be attending a conference in Seville, Spain from June 30 to July 3, 2025. This makes his personal attendance at a summit in Brazil in early July logistically infeasible. International travel for a head of state is planned well in advance, so this existing commitment is a significant barrier. The status quo is 'No,' and this new information provides a compelling reason for why an announcement has not been made and is unlikely to be made before the deadline. \n\nMy forecast is not lower than 10% because some uncertainty remains. The exact dates of the BRICS summit in July are not specified; if it is scheduled for mid-to-late July, attendance could still be possible. Plans, though unlikely, can also change due to political pressures or opportunities. \n\nMy forecast is not higher because the confirmed scheduling conflict is a concrete, high-confidence piece of evidence weighing heavily against a 'Yes' outcome. I would raise my probability if we learned that the Spain conference was canceled or that the BRICS summit was officially scheduled for late July. I would lower my probability if Uruguay announced a lower-level delegate would attend BRICS, or if the summit was confirmed for the first week of July.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill the government of Uruguay announce that its president, Yamandú Orsi, will attend the BRICS summit in July 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\n[Lula invites Mexico, Colombia, and Uruguay to BRICS Summit](https://en.mercopress.com/2025/03/04/lula-invites-mexico-colombia-and-uruguay-to-brics-summit#google_vignette) | [Uruguay’s participation at the BRICS summit still up in the air](https://www.plenglish.com/news/2025/03/02/uruguays-participation-at-the-brics-summit-still-up-in-the-air/)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if before July 1, 2025 the government of Uruguay, or anyone speaking on its behalf, issues any sort of public communication (written or oral) confirming its acceptance of the invitation for President Yamandú Orsi to attend in person the BRICS Summit scheduled to take place in Rio de Janeiro in July 2025.\n\nSince the summit will be held after this question resolves, actual attendance is not required, merely the announcement of plans to attend.\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nPresident Yamandú Orsi is confirmed to travel to Seville, Spain, to attend the Fourth International Conference on Sustainable Development Financing. This United Nations conference is scheduled to run from June 30 to July 3, 2025. President Orsi has reaffirmed Uruguay's commitment to multilateralism, stating that his government will be in Seville to 'strengthen and commit' to the UN's objectives.\n\nToday is 2025-06-05.\n\nBefore answering you think:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n(e) You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
