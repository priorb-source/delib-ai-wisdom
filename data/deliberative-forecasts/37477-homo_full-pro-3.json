    "review": "The other forecasters provided valuable perspectives that challenged my initial assessment. Forecaster 2's primary contribution was emphasizing the resolution criteria: a 'Yes' outcome requires only a single day where both papers omit the word 'tariff(s)' over the 23-day period. This reframes the problem from 'will this story remain important?' to 'what is the cumulative probability of at least one quiet day occurring?' Their 75% forecast seems overly optimistic about the chances of this happening, underestimating the sheer dominance of the tariff story as described in the background. Forecaster 3's analysis was more aligned with my own qualitative assessment of the story's high salience but resulted in a higher probability of 20%. Their reasoning—that the story is at its peak but that a 23-day window offers opportunities for other news to dominate—is very convincing. Their forecast prompted me to quantify my own assumptions.",
    "rationale": "My initial forecast of 11% was based on the story's immense and ongoing importance, but I now believe I failed to properly weigh the cumulative probability over the 23-day window. Forecaster 2's focus on the 'one success is all it takes' structure was a crucial insight. While I find their 75% probability far too high, their logic prompted me to re-evaluate. I performed a brief quantitative analysis, estimating the probability of 'tariff(s)' being absent from both front pages on any given day. Assuming a low daily probability of success—say, 1%—the cumulative probability of this happening at least once in 23 days is approximately 21% (1 - (0.99^23)). This figure aligns almost perfectly with Forecaster 3's 20% forecast. A 1% daily chance feels like a reasonable assessment; it reflects the story's dominance (meaning on 99% of days, at least one paper will mention it) while still accounting for the volatility of the news cycle, the possibility of major superseding events, and the potential for lighter news days on weekends. Therefore, I am increasing my forecast significantly, from 11% to 22%, to better reflect the mathematical reality of the resolution criteria over the given timeframe.",
