  "information": "As of March 12, 2025, BC Hydro officially excluded Tesla products, including electric vehicle chargers, energy storage batteries, and inverters, from its CleanBC and BC Hydro rebate programs. The stated reason for the policy change is to preference Canadian goods and exclude U.S.-produced goods where practicable, as part of a broader trade dispute. The EV charger rebate for single-family homes covers up to 50% of the cost, to a maximum of $350. The policy was publicly defended by B.C. Premier David Eby and Energy Minister Adrian Dix. Products purchased or pre-approved before March 12, 2025, remain eligible for the rebate.\n\nIn the Canadian market, Tesla has experienced a significant downturn in early 2025. New vehicle registrations in Québec dropped by 85-90% in the first quarter of the year. Concurrently, a J.D. Power survey indicated a shift in Canadian consumer preference, with Tesla falling from second to eighth place among most-considered EV brands. Other manufacturers, such as General Motors, surpassed Tesla as the top seller of EVs in Canada during this period. Public sentiment has also been a factor, with protests occurring at a B.C. Tesla dealership on March 23, 2025, where participants called for a boycott of the company.\n\nThe exclusion of Tesla from B.C.'s rebate program occurred within a broader context of shifting trade policies and incentives. Canada's federal iZEV rebate program, which offered up to $5,000 for EV purchases, ended on March 31, 2025. A 25% tariff on U.S.-made electric vehicles is also in effect. The B.C. government's action to preference domestic goods extends beyond the EV sector; for instance, the province has also removed U.S. liquor products from the shelves of government-run liquor stores as part of the ongoing trade friction with the United States.",

    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "About 1 month (until Metaculus checks on/after 2025-07-01)",
    "status_quo_outcome": "Yes — the BC Hydro page continues to state Tesla products are not eligible for the single-family home EV charger rebate.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Either (a) BC Hydro revises the page to remove the explicit mention of Tesla being ineligible (even if the underlying exclusion remains), or (b) the province/BC Hydro reverses the exclusion and restores eligibility for Tesla chargers before July 2025.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "The March 12, 2025 policy remains in place and the BC Hydro rebate page still explicitly states that Tesla products are not eligible.",
    "rationale": "- Recency and political backing: The exclusion was announced March 12, 2025 and publicly defended by Premier David Eby and Energy Minister Adrian Dix. New, politically messaged policies typically persist for months, not weeks. With only ~1 month to go, the base rate strongly favors the status quo. \n- Policy context: The move was framed as preferring Canadian goods and excluding U.S.-produced goods where practicable, amid broader trade frictions. The RA notes aligned actions (e.g., stance on U.S. products) and broader shifts (federal iZEV ending; tariffs on U.S.-made EVs). That context supports continuity rather than a quick reversal.\n- Program communications practice: After a notable change, agencies commonly keep explicit brand mentions on public-facing pages for clarity for at least a full program cycle. Removing the explicit “Tesla not eligible” language by early July is possible but less likely so soon after the March announcement.\n- Why not higher: The resolution hinges on explicit mention on the specific web page. Even if Tesla remains excluded, BC Hydro could revise copy to brand-neutral wording (e.g., “certain U.S.-made products are ineligible”) or move details to a linked PDF, causing the page itself not to mention Tesla and thus resolving No. There’s also a small chance of partial policy softening or legal/compliance review leading to a wording change.\n- Why not lower: A full policy reversal in a month would be unusually fast given the political signaling and the broader trade narrative. No strong signals of retreat have emerged since March.\n- What would move me up: Continued public reiterations by BC officials naming Tesla specifically; site updates that keep or amplify the explicit Tesla exclusion; signs of escalating trade measures reinforcing the stance.\n- What would move me down: BC Hydro quietly reformatting the page to remove brand-specific language; legal or trade advisories urging non-discriminatory wording; any announcement of policy moderation or carve-outs restoring eligibility or avoiding brand callouts.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill BC Hydro still exclude Tesla from its EV charger rebate program for single-family homes in July 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nAccording to the resolution source, \"The Government of B.C. and BC Hydro are taking action to preference Canadian goods in our rebate programs going forward and to exclude, where practicable, U.S. produced goods. As of March 12, 2025, Tesla products (electric vehicle chargers, energy storage batteries and inverters) are not eligible for CleanBC and BC Hydro rebates. If you purchased or have received pre-approval for your Tesla product before March 12, 2025, it can still qualify for rebates and will be processed as normal.\"\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if BC Hydro at [this page](https://www.bchydro.com/powersmart/electric-vehicles/rebates-incentives/rebates-home-chargers.html) when checked by Metaculus on or after July 1, 2025, says that Tesla products are not eligible for the EV charger at home program. If it does not mention Tesla being ineligible, then this question resolves as **No**.\n\n\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nAs of March 12, 2025, BC Hydro officially excluded Tesla products, including electric vehicle chargers, energy storage batteries, and inverters, from its CleanBC and BC Hydro rebate programs.

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
