    "no_outcome_scenario": "NYT covers the Chinese consumption trend or other relevant topics but uses alternative phrasing (e.g., “reverse consumption,” “buying at home instead of abroad”) or avoids the exact quoted strings. No finance or accounting piece happens to use the uncommon exact phrase “reverse purchase.”",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "NYT runs a piece that directly quotes Chinese state media or a translation using the exact term “reverse purchasing,” or an article uses “reverse purchase” in a technical finance/accounting context and the exact quoted string appears in the text during June 10–30, 2025.",
    "rationale": "- The exact-phrase requirement (“reverse purchasing” or “reverse purchase”) within a narrow 21-day window makes this unlikely. NYT typically uses established English terms: for Chinese consumption trends they may write “reverse consumption” or describe the phenomenon without that exact phrase; for finance they say “reverse repurchase (repo)” or “buybacks,” not “reverse purchase.”\n- Base-rate intuition: NYT site historically has few or zero hits for these exact quoted strings; such uncommon phrasing appearing in a short, specific window is low probability.\n- The People’s Daily article provides a potential hook, but translation choices vary, and NYT often avoids direct calques from Chinese state-media jargon. The window begins more than a month after that article, further lowering odds.\n- Research assistant: no additional information available, so no event-driven catalyst identified.\n- Why not higher: rarity of the exact strings, NYT style conventions, and the tight timing window all push the probability down.\n- Why not lower: NYT could quote or paraphrase Chinese coverage using the term in quotation marks, or a niche finance/accounting piece might include “reverse purchase.” Even small chances across several articles in the window justify a non-zero tail.\n- What would move me up: evidence that NYT or major Western outlets are adopting “reverse purchasing” as a translation for the current Chinese trend; a preview or newsletter hint; or a finance/accounting story draft/coverage note using “reverse purchase.”\n- What would move me down: an NYT style or explainer piece that standardizes on a different term (e.g., “reverse consumption”) or the absence of any China-consumption feature planning in that window.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill the New York Times mention \"reverse purchasing\" before July 1, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nPeople's Daily: [“Reverse purchasing” reflects the vitality of the Chinese market](http://finance.people.com.cn/n1/2025/0430/c1004-40471159.html)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if the NY Times mentions \"reverse purchasing\" in any of its content items as found through [this search](https://www.nytimes.com/search?dropmab=false&lang=en&query=%22reverse%20purchasing%22&sort=best), dated after June 9, 2025 and before July 1, 2025. This question will also count \"reverse purchase,\" which can be found through [this link](https://www.nytimes.com/search?dropmab=false&lang=en&query=%22reverse%20purchase%22&sort=best).\n\n\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nNo additional information available.\n\nToday is 2025-06-05.\n\nBefore answering you think:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n(e) You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
