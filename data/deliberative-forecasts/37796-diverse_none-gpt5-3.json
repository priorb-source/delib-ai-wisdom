    "review": "- New arguments: Forecaster 2 quantified recent base rates (6 of last 7 plenaries changed the grey list) and highlighted that June 2024 reportedly had no changes, illustrating a non-zero “no-change” precedent. Forecaster 3 emphasized the short interval since February 2025 and the implementation/on-site visit timing friction, and noted some higher-capacity jurisdictions as plausible exit candidates.\n- Convincingness: The quantified base rate from Forecaster 2 (if accurate) is helpful and broadly aligns with my prior reasoning. The June 2024 no-change point is a useful cautionary data point. Forecaster 3’s timing caution is valid, but the large pipeline and the fact that removals depend on pre-planned on-sites still leave a high probability that at least one jurisdiction moves. Neither introduced specific intel on imminent removals/additions that would materially shift the odds.\n- Net effect: Their inputs reinforce a high base rate and a non-trivial chance of no change. This aligns with my prior view; I don’t see sufficient new evidence to justify a large adjustment.",
    "rationale": "My core view remains: historical base rates favor at least one change per plenary, especially with a large pool (≈25) under monitoring and ongoing mutual evaluations creating both removal and addition pathways. The February 2025 activity confirms the process is active. The main counterweight is that June 2024 reportedly saw no changes and the February-to-June window can be tight if on-site visits or final legislative steps slip. Balancing these, the probability of at least one change remains high but not near-certain.\n\nGiven Forecaster 2’s quantified base rate (~86% if 6/7 recent plenaries had changes) and Forecaster 3’s timing caveat, I hold close to my original estimate, which already reflected these dynamics. I do not see compelling new evidence to move materially higher (e.g., credible reports of successful on-sites) or lower (e.g., official indications of deferral to October).",
