    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Approximately 6-7 weeks until July 1, 2025",
    "status_quo_outcome": "Without current approval rating data, the status quo is highly uncertain. However, historically, Donald Trump's approval ratings have consistently ranged in the low-to-mid 40s during his presidencies, which tends to be lower than most world leaders.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Trump maintains or improves his approval rating to match or exceed Carney's. This could occur if Trump experiences popular policy wins, positive economic news, or if Carney faces early challenges as PM such as unpopular policy decisions, economic difficulties, or internal party conflicts that erode his approval rating.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Carney maintains a higher approval rating than Trump. As a potentially new Prime Minister, Carney could benefit from a honeymoon period with approval ratings in the 50-60% range while Trump's ratings remain in his typical 40-45% range. This becomes more likely if Carney successfully navigates early governance challenges while Trump faces controversies or policy setbacks.",
    "rationale": "This forecast faces significant uncertainty due to lack of current approval rating data. The research assistant provided no additional information about current ratings or even confirmation that Mark Carney is currently serving as PM. Key considerations: (1) Trump's approval ratings have historically been stable but low compared to most world leaders, typically 40-45%. (2) If Carney is indeed PM, the timing and circumstances of his ascension matter greatly - a recent transition might provide a honeymoon boost, while a longer tenure under difficult circumstances could depress ratings. (3) Six weeks provides limited time for dramatic shifts in approval ratings, which tend to be relatively stable short-term. (4) Base rates suggest most world leaders, especially newly installed ones, tend to have higher approval than Trump. I'm not going higher because: the fundamental uncertainty about current conditions, lack of data about Carney's actual status and current ratings, and possibility of unforeseen events. I'm not going lower because: Trump's historical pattern of below-average approval ratings compared to other leaders provides a weak prior favoring Carney. To update higher, I'd need: confirmation Carney is PM with current approval ratings showing a comfortable lead over Trump. To update lower, I'd need: data showing Carney's approval is currently below or near Trump's, or confirmation Carney is not actually PM.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney have a higher approval rating than US President Donald Trump on July 1, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nResolution source updates monthly. According to Morning Consult for January 2025: \"The latest approval ratings are based on data collected from Jan. 21-27, 2025. Ratings reflect a trailing seven-day simple moving average of views among adults in each country surveyed.\"\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if Mark Carney has a higher approval rating than US President Donald Trump according to [Morning Consult](https://pro.morningconsult.com/trackers/global-leader-approval) when checked by Metaculus on or after July 1, 2025. If this not the case (including due to a tie), this resolves as **No**.\n\n\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nNo additional information available.\n\nToday is 2025-05-15.\n\nBefore answering you think:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n(e) You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
