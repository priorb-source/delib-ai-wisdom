    "review": "The other forecasters provided excellent points that refined my initial analysis. Forecaster 2's primary argument, emphasizing the proximity to the summit date (June 2025) and the absence of any contrary signals, is the most powerful reason to increase my forecast. The logistical and diplomatic momentum at this late stage makes non-attendance much less likely than it would have been several months ago. Forecaster 3 provided excellent nuance, reminding me of Trump's history of skipping other multilateral summits (e.g., ASEAN), which is a key piece of evidence that his attendance is not guaranteed. However, Forecaster 3 also noted that increased defense spending by allies gives Trump a potential 'victory' to claim, making attendance at this specific summit more appealing to him. I find both analyses convincing, with Forecaster 2's point about timing being the most decisive factor for an update, and Forecaster 3's points helping to correctly calibrate the magnitude of that update.",
    "rationale": "After reviewing the other analyses, I am increasing my forecast from 75% to 85%. The primary driver for this 10-point increase is the argument made by Forecaster 2 regarding the timeline. As it is now June 4, 2025, we are very close to the event. The planning for a US President's attendance at a major international summit is extensive. The absence of any official announcements, credible leaks, or public rumblings about non-attendance at this stage is very strong evidence that the visit is proceeding as planned. My initial forecast did not sufficiently weigh this 'no news is good news' factor so close to the event date. \n\nHowever, I am not increasing my forecast to 90% because Forecaster 3's points serve as an important check on overconfidence. The reminder that Trump has a history of skipping other major summits, like ASEAN, confirms that non-attendance to make a political statement is a tool he is willing to use. This tempers the 'status quo' argument. This downside risk is somewhat counterbalanced by their other point: with more allies meeting the 2% defense spending target, Trump has a compelling reason to attend, declare victory, and use the platform to make new demands. \n\nUltimately, the very high probability suggested by the late date is moderated by Trump's demonstrated unpredictability. An 85% forecast reflects a high likelihood of attendance due to presidential norms and the advanced state of planning, while still reserving a significant 15% probability for a last-minute cancellation due to a manufactured diplomatic dispute, a domestic crisis, or a simple strategic snub.",
