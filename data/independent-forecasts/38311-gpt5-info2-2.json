  "information": "The 51st G7 Summit is scheduled to take place in Kananaskis, Alberta. Security measures are being implemented, including a controlled access zone around summit venues from June 10-18 and temporary airspace restrictions. In advance of the leaders' summit, U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent and Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell attended preparatory G7 meetings in Banff. Historically, sitting U.S. presidents have attended every in-person G7/G8 summit since its inception in 1975.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "About 1–2 weeks (leaders’ summit expected mid-June 2025)",
    "status_quo_outcome": "Yes — he attends in person",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Last-minute cancellation due to a domestic or international crisis, an acute health issue, security threat, severe disruption (e.g., major wildfire/smoke event) that postpones the summit, or a decision to participate only virtually.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "The summit proceeds in Kananaskis as planned and Trump arrives via Air Force One, participates in leaders’ sessions, and is photographed with other heads of state.",
    "rationale": "- Baseline: The White House has publicly confirmed President Trump will visit Canada for the G7 leaders’ summit (per CTV). That is a strong signal of intent and typically precedes final logistical execution.\n- Historical base rate: Sitting U.S. presidents have attended every in-person G7/G8 since inception, barring years when the summit was not held in person. This favors attendance absent an extraordinary shock.\n- Preparations: Canadian authorities have implemented a controlled access zone (June 10–18) and airspace restrictions; U.S. principals (Treasury Secretary, Fed Chair) have already participated in G7 preparatory meetings nearby. These concrete logistical signals indicate the event is on track and that the U.S. delegation is engaged.\n- Why not higher: Small but real tail risks remain—unexpected health issues, domestic or international crises requiring the president’s presence elsewhere, last-minute security concerns, aviation/weather disruptions, or a late diplomatic rift leading to a boycott. While rare, such disruptions occasionally alter presidential travel.\n- Why not lower: There is affirmative White House confirmation, strong precedent, and extensive security/logistics already in place. Canada-U.S. relations and the G7’s prominence make deliberate nonattendance unlikely.\n- What would move the forecast up: Publication of the official daily schedule with departure times, sighting of Air Force One departing for Alberta, pool reports en route, or confirmation of arrival at Calgary/nearby airfield.\n- What would move it down: Reports of a developing crisis requiring stateside management, credible health concerns, credible security threats near the venue, or Canadian/host announcements of postponement or format change (e.g., shifting to virtual).",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill Donald Trump attend the G7 Summit in June 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nCTV: [Donald Trump will visit Canada for G7, White House confirms](https://www.ctvnews.ca/politics/article/white-house-confirms-trump-will-visit-canada-for-g7-leaders-summit/)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if US President Donald J. Trump attends in person a G7 summit held in June 2025.\n\n\"In person\" is defined as occupying the same physical space closely enough at the G7 Summit that he can see and hear other heads of state through direct un-intermediated exchange of photons and sound waves.\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nThe 51st G7 Summit is scheduled to take place in Kananaskis, Alberta. Security measures are being implemented, including a controlled access zone around summit venues from June 10-18 and temporary airspace restrictions.

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
