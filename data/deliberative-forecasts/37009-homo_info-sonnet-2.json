    "review": "Forecasters 2 and 3 present dramatically different pictures with contradictory information. Forecaster 2 cites recent reports from April 19 (just 2 days ago) from multiple credible outlets stating Stevens is 'widely expected to declare as early as next week,' which would be THIS week - well before May 1. This is highly specific, recent reporting that I didn't have access to. However, Forecaster 3 claims Stevens has filed no FEC paperwork for an exploratory committee as of late April, which is typically a prerequisite for candidacy announcements. These cannot both be fully accurate. The critical question is which information is more reliable. Forecaster 3's claim that Stevens 'is not preparing to run' directly contradicts my research assistant's concrete evidence of $1.2M raised in Q1, $1.6M on hand, expanded staff, and contacting potential House seat replacements. This makes me skeptical of Forecaster 3's analysis. Meanwhile, Forecaster 2's media reports align better with the preparation signals I identified. However, I note that we are already IN the timeframe those April 19 reports mentioned ('as early as next week' from April 19 would be this week), yet no announcement has materialized. This is a negative signal suggesting those reports may have been speculative or the timeline has slipped.",
    "rationale": "The most important new information is Forecaster 2's citation of multiple April 19 reports predicting announcement 'as early as next week.' This is more specific and recent than my original information. However, we're now in that predicted window without an announcement, which tempers optimism. The FEC filing concern raised by Forecaster 3 is valid - candidates typically file such paperwork before announcing - but I'm skeptical of their broader claim that Stevens isn't preparing given the concrete fundraising and staffing evidence. The truth likely lies between these extremes: Stevens is clearly preparing for a Senate run (per fundraising/staffing data), media reports suggest imminent announcement, but the lack of FEC filing and absence of announcement despite being in the predicted window suggests possible delays. With 10 days remaining, there's still adequate time, and the strength of preparation signals remains compelling. I'm updating slightly upward from 72% because of the more specific recent reporting from multiple outlets, but remaining cautious because we're already in the predicted announcement window without results and the FEC filing concern is legitimate.",
