  "information": "Circle's main business is issuing the USDC stablecoin, which has a market capitalization of approximately $60 billion. The company's revenue is primarily generated from managing the reserve assets backing USDC, which produced $1.7 billion in income in 2024, accounting for 99.1% of total revenue. The company's financial performance has varied, reporting a net loss of $768.8 million in 2022 followed by a net income of $267.6 million in 2023. For 2024, Circle's revenue was $1.68 billion, while net income declined 42% to $155.7 million and adjusted EBITDA fell 29% to $285 million. A major expense in 2024 was $907.9 million paid to partner Coinbase for USDC distribution. The company's liquidity was $1.05 billion at the end of 2024.",

    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "~47 days (until July 1, 2025)",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "SEC review and sign-off takes longer than expected or triggers additional comment rounds, pushing effectiveness past late June; Circle postpones due to market volatility or valuation concerns; or Circle opts to list on Nasdaq instead of NYSE, which would resolve this question as No even if the IPO occurs by July 1.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Circle’s S-1 is declared effective in late May or early June; the roadshow proceeds smoothly; the deal is priced and shares begin trading on the NYSE in mid-to-late June.",
    "rationale": "- Timing: With ~6.5 weeks left, an IPO is still feasible if Circle’s registration is near the end of SEC review. A typical cadence is: SEC comments and amendments, 1–2 week roadshow, then pricing and listing. If public filing occurred around early April (as implied by the Forbes piece), a late-June listing is operationally plausible.\n- Signals: The cited Forbes article (April 4, 2025) frames a Circle IPO as a near-term 2025 event, suggesting concrete steps toward listing. Circle’s scale (USDC ~$60B) and brand, plus a crypto-friendly market backdrop, are supportive.\n- Fundamentals: Per the research assistant, 2024 revenue was $1.68B with net income of $155.7M (down y/y) and strong liquidity ($1.05B). Revenue is largely interest on reserves; while earnings volatility and heavy Coinbase distribution costs may weigh on valuation, they don’t preclude listing. Investors may still accept these tradeoffs given USDC growth and rate environment.\n- Exchange specificity risk: The resolution requires NYSE specifically. If Circle’s S-1 indicates an intended NYSE listing (as is often specified), that reduces exchange risk materially. If not, there is real risk they choose Nasdaq, which would yield a No here even if the IPO prices.\n- Status quo weight: As of May 14 there is no completed listing, and the window is narrow. Regulatory and market hiccups often delay high-profile IPOs. This inertia caps the probability below a strong conviction.\n- Why not higher: Remaining SEC review uncertainty; compressed timeline; potential market volatility; and the exchange-specific condition.\n- Why not lower: Public signaling of intent in April; favorable crypto market sentiment; operationally sufficient time to execute a June listing; Circle’s scale and readiness.\n- Updates that would increase probability: SEC declares the S-1 effective; reports of roadshow launch and order book strength; NYSE listing approval and confirmed ticker; stable-to-strong market conditions into late June.\n- Updates that would decrease probability: News of postponement; additional SEC comment cycles; selection of Nasdaq rather than NYSE; risk-off market turn or adverse regulatory developments affecting stablecoins.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill Circle be publicly-traded before July 1, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nForbes: [The Circle IPO Solidifies 2025 As The Year Of Stablecoins](https://www.forbes.com/sites/digital-assets/2025/04/04/the-circle-ipo-solidifies-2025-as-the-year-of-stablecoin/)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if shares of Circle Internet Group, Inc. are publicly traded on New York Stock Exchange (the \"NYSE\") before July 1, 2025.\n\n\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nCircle's main business is issuing the USDC stablecoin, which has a market capitalization of approximately $60 billion.

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
