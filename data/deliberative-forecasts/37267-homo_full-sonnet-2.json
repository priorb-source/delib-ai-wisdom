    "review": "All three forecasters independently arrived at 10% with remarkably similar reasoning, which increases my confidence in this estimate. The key convergence points are: (1) base rate of 1-2.5% over 2 months from historical upgrade patterns, (2) elevation above base rate justified by May 1 sanctions and multiple active conflict zones, but (3) significant constraints preventing higher estimates including the April 30 review maintaining Level 3, absence of clear catalysts, and localized rather than nationwide nature of conflicts. Forecaster 3 made an excellent point that 'upgrades are not evenly distributed—they follow specific catalysts,' which reinforces that we shouldn't mechanically apply base rates but should look for triggering events. Forecaster 2's emphasis that the violence is 'not threatening the capital or major tourist/business areas' is important geographic context. The most compelling shared argument is that the State Department just reviewed Ethiopia 2 days ago and explicitly maintained Level 3 status despite knowing about the regional conflicts—this is strong revealed preference evidence against imminent upgrade. The convergence at 10% suggests we're appropriately balancing the low base rate (~1-2%) with elevated risk factors, arriving at roughly 4-5x the base rate, which seems reasonable given the specific circumstances without overstating the likelihood absent clear catalysts.",
    "rationale": "After reviewing the other forecasters' analyses, I find no compelling reason to update my forecast. The remarkable convergence at 10% with nearly identical reasoning validates the analytical approach. The key insight all three of us share is that while base rates suggest only 1-2.5% probability over 2 months, the specific context—renewed violence prompting May 1 sanctions, multiple regions already at Level 4, and regional instability—justifies elevating to 10%. However, critical factors prevent going higher: the State Department conducted a review just 48 hours ago (April 30) and explicitly kept Ethiopia at Level 3, demonstrating that current decision-makers do not view the situation as warranting Level 4; no clear catalysts exist (embassy evacuations, attacks on foreigners, coups, airport closures); and the conflicts remain geographically contained to areas already carrying Level 4 regional warnings. The 10% estimate represents approximately 4-5x the base rate, which appropriately accounts for elevated risks while respecting the strong evidence against imminent upgrade. I would only update higher if new catalysts emerged in the coming weeks—violence spreading to Addis Ababa, incidents involving US citizens, or embassy staff departures. The convergence among three independent analyses strengthens rather than weakens my confidence in 10%.",
