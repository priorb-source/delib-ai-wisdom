    "review": "Forecaster 3 raises the most compelling argument that I initially underweighted: if the BBC article indicates a 'main opposition leader' has already been removed from the electoral list, there's a substantial probability it refers to one of our five candidates. Laurent Gbagbo and Pascal Affi N'Guessan particularly fit this description as former president and opposition leader respectively. This reframes the question - it's not just about whether someone WILL BE disqualified in the next 32 days, but whether someone HAS ALREADY BEEN disqualified. However, Forecaster 2 makes an important counterpoint about status quo bias and lack of specific evidence. The critical factor that gives me pause is that my research assistant found 'no additional information available.' If one of these specific five prominent candidates had been disqualified, this should be discoverable information. This suggests either: (1) the BBC article refers to a different opposition leader not on our list, or (2) the information is so recent it hasn't been fully reported yet. Ivory Coast has multiple opposition figures, so 'main opposition leader' could refer to someone else. The lack of confirming details is significant evidence against resolution as Yes.",
    "rationale": "I'm updating my forecast upward from 45% to 52%, but not as high as Forecaster 3's 65%. Forecaster 3's core insight is correct - the BBC article's timing and language suggest a disqualification may have already occurred involving a main opposition figure, and several of our candidates fit that profile. However, the complete absence of additional confirming information from my research assistant is a strong counterweight. If Laurent Gbagbo or Pascal Affi N'Guessan had been disqualified, this would be major international news that should be readily discoverable. The most likely scenario is that the BBC article refers to a different opposition figure, but there remains meaningful uncertainty. The short 32-day timeframe means new disqualifications are less likely unless proceedings are already underway. My updated probability reflects genuine uncertainty between two competing interpretations of limited evidence.",
