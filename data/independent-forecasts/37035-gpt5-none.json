    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Substantial deterioration: widespread or urban yellow fever transmission affecting major travel hubs, rapidly rising cases/deaths, vaccine shortages or access constraints, and PAHO/WHO elevate response; CDC issues a Level 3 Warning (“Avoid Nonessential Travel”) for Colombia prior to June 1.",
    "rationale": "I interpret resolution per the criteria: this resolves Yes if the CDC’s Travel Health Notice level for Colombia is greater than 2 (i.e., Level 3 or higher) when checked on/after June 1, 2025. Today Colombia is Level 2.\n\nBase rates and CDC practice: CDC uses Level 3 sparingly, typically for very high-risk, hard-to-mitigate situations (e.g., Ebola, large Marburg outbreaks). For vaccine-preventable, vector-borne diseases like yellow fever, CDC historically favors Level 2 plus strong vaccination guidance rather than advising against nonessential travel—even during sizable outbreaks (e.g., Brazil 2017–2018 remained Level 2). Moving an entire country to Level 3 would likely require clear, widespread traveler risk that cannot be reasonably mitigated by vaccination and standard precautions.\n\nTiming: There are only ~5–6 weeks until resolution. Rapid escalation to a CDC Level 3 nationwide warning in that interval would require a marked, widely reported surge (e.g., sustained urban transmission, large clusters in major cities, severe strain on healthcare, vaccine unavailability). While possible, that’s not the modal outcome.\n\nStatus quo weight: The current Level 2, combined with CDC’s conservative use of Level 3 for yellow fever, makes “no change” the default. Thus, No is the status-quo outcome.\n\nWhy not higher: To justify a higher probability, I’d need strong evidence of uncontrolled urban spread in Colombia’s main travel corridors, international agency escalation (PAHO/WHO emergency grading), clear vaccine shortages, or CDC interim alerts signaling consideration of a Level 3. None of that is currently in hand.\n\nWhy not lower: Media reports mention an outbreak and economic concern; outbreaks can evolve quickly. If surveillance reveals rapid expansion or vaccine shortages, CDC could act quickly. This tail risk keeps the probability above near-zero.\n\nUpdate triggers:\n- Upward: Verified reports of sustained urban transmission in major cities, steep week-over-week case growth, PAHO/WHO declaring higher-grade emergency response, widespread vaccine shortages/contraindications for travelers, or CDC issuing urgent updates hinting at travel avoidance.\n- Downward: PAHO/WHO/Colombia MOH reports showing containment or decline, successful vaccination campaigns and good supply, CDC updates reaffirming Level 2 without escalation.\n\nThe research assistant provided no additional specific data, so the forecast relies on CDC historical behavior, disease characteristics, and the short timeline.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill the CDC raise the Travel Health Notice status of Colombia to above level 3 before June 1, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\n[Colombia’s Economic Emergency As Yellow Fever Outbreak Threatens Tourism And Agricultural Exports](https://www.travelandtourworld.com/news/article/colombias-economic-emergency-as-yellow-fever-outbreak-threatens-tourism-and-agricultural-exports/) | CDC: [Travel Health Notices](https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/travel/notices)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if the [Travel Health Notice status of Colombia](https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/travel/destinations/traveler/none/colombia), which is \"Level 2 Practice Enhanced Precautions\" at the time of this question, is a level of greater than 2 when checked by Metaculus on or after June 1, 2025.\n\n\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nNo additional information available.\n\nToday is 2025-04-23.\n\nBefore answering you think:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n(e) You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
