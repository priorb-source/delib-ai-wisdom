  "information": "Following a terrorist attack in Pahalgam, Jammu and Kashmir on April 22, 2025, which killed 26 tourists, the Indian government took several actions against Pakistan. These included suspending the Indus Water Treaty, closing the Attari-Wagah border, and banning the SAARC visa scheme for Pakistan. The Indian military launched 'Operation Sindoor' (also referred to as 'Operation Sundar'), a series of targeted strikes against what were described as terrorist camps in Pakistan-occupied Kashmir and Pakistan proper. Indian sources reported that over 100 terrorists were killed in these operations, including high-value targets. The operation targeted infrastructure linked to groups like Lashkar-e-Taiba and Jaish-e-Mohammed.\n\nAfter India's initial strikes, a period of military escalation occurred. The Indian Army reported that on the night of May 8-9, 2025, Pakistan launched multiple attacks using drones and missiles targeting military stations at Jammu, Pathankot, and Udhampur, and committed numerous ceasefire violations along the Line of Control. India stated that these threats were neutralized using kinetic and non-kinetic means with no casualties or material losses reported on the Indian side. India conducted retaliatory strikes, with reports claiming the destruction of a Pakistani post, a terrorist launch pad, and 11 Pakistani airbases. After several days of tension, a ceasefire was agreed upon on May 10, 2025, following direct talks between the two countries' Directors-General of Military Operations (DGMOs). Subsequently, Pakistani intelligence sources reported an agreement for both sides to withdraw troops to their pre-conflict positions by the end of May.\n\nIn the aftermath of the military engagements, India initiated a diplomatic offensive. The government dispatched seven all-party delegations to 32 countries for a diplomatic push scheduled between May 21 and June 5. These delegations were provided with 'talking points' and a 150-page dossier detailing India's position on cross-border terrorism. Politically, the Indian Prime Minister announced a new doctrine of 'no tolerance for terror that hides under nuclear blackmail'. In parallel, the Indian Army Chief, General Upendra Dwivedi, granted 'full authority' to the Western Commanders to retaliate with kinetic actions in response to any future violations of the ceasefire agreement by Pakistan.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "The question resolves at the end of June 2025, which is approximately 5 weeks from today (May 22, 2025).",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No. The ceasefire agreed upon on May 10, 2025, holds. Both nations continue the process of de-escalation, including the reported troop withdrawal, and focus on diplomatic, rather than military, actions for the remainder of the period.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "The ceasefire largely holds throughout June. Pakistan, having sustained significant damage and facing international pressure, refrains from launching or sponsoring any major attacks that would cross India's red lines. India prioritizes its diplomatic offensive, using the credibility gained from 'Operation Sindoor' to isolate Pakistan internationally. Without a major new provocation, India has no incentive to launch another attack and undermine its own diplomatic efforts.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "A high-casualty terrorist attack occurs in India, and intelligence quickly links it to a group operating from one of the specified Pakistani provinces. Alternatively, the Pakistani military commits a flagrant and deadly ceasefire violation. Citing its new doctrine of 'no tolerance for terror' and the authority granted to commanders, the Indian Armed Forces launch retaliatory kinetic strikes against training camps or military infrastructure inside Pakistan proper to demonstrate resolve and deter future attacks.",
    "rationale": "My forecast of a low probability for a 'Yes' outcome is primarily based on the current de-escalation trend and India's ongoing diplomatic offensive. Following the intense military exchanges in April and early May, both sides agreed to a ceasefire and troop withdrawal on May 10. This indicates a mutual desire to step back from the brink of a wider conflict. Critically, India has launched a major diplomatic push from May 21 to June 5, sending delegations to 32 countries. It is highly improbable that India would intentionally sabotage its own high-profile diplomatic efforts by launching a new, unprovoked attack during or immediately after this period. The status quo is one of tense de-escalation, which favors a 'No' outcome.\n\nHowever, the probability is not close to zero. The core driver for a 'Yes' outcome would be a significant provocation from Pakistan. The Indian Prime Minister's new, more aggressive doctrine and the explicit authority granted to Western Commanders for kinetic retaliation have lowered the threshold for an Indian response. The situation remains volatile, and a major terrorist attack or a severe ceasefire violation could force India's hand, making a retaliatory strike politically necessary to uphold the new doctrine. The precedent has already been set with 'Operation Sindoor', which included strikes in Pakistan proper, making a repeat action plausible under the right circumstances.\n\nMy forecast is not lower than 20% because the risk of a triggering event from non-state actors or hardliners within the Pakistani establishment remains significant. The underlying tensions have not been resolved. \n\nMy forecast is not higher because the incentives for de-escalation are currently very strong for both governments. India is focused on capitalizing on its recent military actions diplomatically, and Pakistan has an incentive to avoid further damaging strikes. \n\nI would increase my probability forecast if we see a major terrorist attack in India linked to Pakistan or a collapse of the ceasefire agreement. I would decrease my forecast if the troop withdrawal is publicly confirmed as complete and high-level diplomatic channels between the two countries are re-established.",
