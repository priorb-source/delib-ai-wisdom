    "review": "Both forecasters raised important points I hadn't adequately considered. Forecaster 2's claim that Ballerini has a 'long history of nominations without a win' at ACM Awards is crucial base rate information that significantly weakens the case for a win. Forecaster 3's observation about correlation across categories is mathematically sound - if she's not a top favorite in one category, she's likely not a top favorite in the others either, meaning my independence assumption (1-0.8^3 = 48.8%) likely overstated her chances. Both forecasters also provided valuable context about the current competitive landscape (Lainey Wilson, Chris Stapleton dominating), which I lacked. Their converged range of 35-40% appears more defensible than my initial 50%.",
    "rationale": "I'm updating my forecast downward from 50% to 40% for several reasons: (1) If Ballerini has a history of ACM nominations without wins, that establishes a strong negative base rate that I should have weighted more heavily. Being repeatedly nominated but not winning suggests she's consistently competitive but not quite at the top tier. (2) The correlation argument is valid - outcomes across her three categories are not independent events. If industry voters favor other artists, that preference likely applies across multiple categories. (3) The competitive landscape with dominant recent winners makes individual category wins harder. However, I'm not going lower than 40% because three nominations still provide meaningful probability mass, and she remains an established, respected artist capable of winning. The 40% forecast accounts for the realistic chance that she wins at least one category while acknowledging the historical and competitive headwinds.",
