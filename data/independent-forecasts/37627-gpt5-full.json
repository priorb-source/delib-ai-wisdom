  "information": "Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy and Donald Trump have had several communications in 2025. On February 12, they spoke for about an hour about peace efforts and cooperation. On March 19, they spoke again, with Zelenskyy expecting to be briefed on Trump's prior conversation with Vladimir Putin. On May 10, following a meeting with European leaders in Kyiv, Zelenskyy spoke with Trump, stating that Ukraine was ready for direct peace talks if a 30-day ceasefire was agreed upon. On the same day, European leaders also held a joint call with Trump from Kyiv.\n\nA proposal was made for direct Russia-Ukraine talks to be held in Istanbul on May 15, 2025. Volodymyr Zelenskyy agreed to attend and invited Donald Trump to be present at the meeting. Trump expressed optimism about the talks and stated he was considering attending, but noted his schedule was busy. His schedule included a trip to Saudi Arabia, Qatar, and the UAE from May 12, concluding on May 15, the same day as the proposed meeting.\n\nEuropean powers have demanded a 30-day ceasefire from Russia, starting May 12, warning of new sanctions if the demand was ignored. Donald Trump advised Volodymyr Zelenskyy to accept talks with Vladimir Putin without the precondition of a ceasefire. Conversely, Zelenskyy stated that Ukraine's readiness for talks was contingent on Russia agreeing to a 30-day ceasefire and providing for its effective monitoring.",

    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "About 33 days (through June 14, 2025, inclusive)",
    "status_quo_outcome": "Yes",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Talks in Istanbul fizzle and both camps shift to using envoys; any interactions are limited to group calls without either side explicitly acknowledging a direct phone call, or they meet in person instead. A public rift over the ceasefire precondition leads Zelenskyy to avoid direct, publicized calls with Trump, or Trump chooses to communicate via intermediaries only.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Trump cannot align schedules to attend Istanbul on May 15 and instead phones Zelenskyy to coordinate; or, amid the EU-backed 30‑day ceasefire push, they hold at least one check‑in call to discuss talks, monitoring, or sanctions. Each side issues a readout or public comment acknowledging the call.",
    "rationale": "- What we know (from the assistant’s report): Trump and Zelenskyy already spoke multiple times in 2025 (Feb 12, Mar 19, May 10), and both sides acknowledged these calls. On May 10, there was also a joint call with European leaders. A proposal emerged for Russia–Ukraine talks in Istanbul on May 15. Zelenskyy agreed to attend and invited Trump; Trump was non‑committal due to a May 12–15 Gulf trip. Europe demanded a 30‑day ceasefire from May 12; Trump urged talks without that precondition, while Zelenskyy tied talks to the ceasefire and its monitoring.\n- Base rates/pattern: Their call cadence has been roughly monthly, and the issue salience is rising. The next ~33 days include the proposed Istanbul meeting and the early days of the EU-demanded ceasefire window—periods that typically require leader‑level coordination. Historically, both sides have publicized their calls, satisfying the dual‑acknowledgment criterion.\n- Why not higher than this: Several failure modes exist: (1) communications routed through envoys; (2) a public spat over preconditions that makes either side avoid public acknowledgment; (3) reliance on in‑person meetings or multi‑party calls that aren’t framed as a direct Trump–Zelenskyy call; (4) a call happens but only one side releases a readout.\n- Why not lower than this: The stakes are high and time‑sensitive; even if Trump skips Istanbul, a coordinating call is natural. The recent frequency of acknowledged calls suggests at least one more within a month is more likely than not.\n- What would move me up: Clear reporting that Trump won’t attend Istanbul but will engage Zelenskyy by phone; confirmation of ongoing ceasefire monitoring or sanctions coordination necessitating leader‑level calls; any readout signaling imminent direct contact. What would move me down: Reports of a diplomatic rift or a decision to channel all communications through intermediaries; a surprise in‑person meeting that reduces the need for calls; patterns of group calls without explicit bilateral acknowledgment.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill Donald Trump and Volodymyr Zelenskyy speak on the phone with each other before June 15, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nSky News: [Key moments that have shaped Trump and Zelenskyy's relationship](https://news.sky.com/story/trump-and-zelenskyys-relationship-from-perfect-phone-call-to-oval-office-clash-13331892)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below.

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
