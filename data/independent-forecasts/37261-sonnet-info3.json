  "information": "Data from the Crowd Counting Consortium from early 2025 showed a notable trend in protest activity. The consortium recorded 2,085 protests nationwide in February 2025, more than double the 937 recorded in February 2017. However, the data also indicated that the average size of these events had decreased to an estimated 60-88 participants per protest. In separate protest movements, over 300 actions were reported on university campuses related to the conflict in Israel.",

    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Approximately 2 months, from May 2, 2025 to July 1, 2025",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No - The Global Protest Tracker will not report any US protests with 10,000+ participants before July 1, 2025",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "The current trend of numerous small protests continues through June 2025. Despite ongoing political tensions and issues like the Israel-Gaza conflict, protests remain localized and fragmented across hundreds of smaller actions. No single catalytic event emerges powerful enough to mobilize 10,000+ people in one location, or such an event occurs too late in June for adequate organization. The average protest size remains in the 60-88 participant range.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "A major catalytic event occurs in May or early June 2025 - such as a controversial Supreme Court decision, a high-profile incident of police violence, a dramatic escalation in international conflict, or a polarizing executive action. This triggers rapid grassroots organization, particularly in a major city like Washington DC, New York, or Los Angeles, resulting in at least one demonstration that draws 10,000+ participants and gets reported by the Global Protest Tracker.",
    "rationale": "The research assistant's data reveals a critical trend: while protest frequency has more than doubled (2,085 in Feb 2025 vs 937 in Feb 2017), the average protest size has dramatically decreased to just 60-88 participants. This suggests a shift toward many small, dispersed actions rather than large concentrated demonstrations. To meet the threshold, we'd need a protest over 100 times the current average size. With only 2 months remaining, several things must align: (1) a significant catalytic event must occur, (2) organizers must mobilize quickly, (3) at least 10,000 people must participate in a single event, and (4) the Global Protest Tracker must report it. While the US has demonstrated capacity for large protests historically (Women's March, George Floyd protests), these typically require both a powerful trigger and adequate organization time. The campus protests mentioned involve 300+ actions but appear fragmented rather than concentrated. For my forecast to be higher, I'd need evidence of: planned major demonstrations, a recent major catalytic event, or historical data showing 10,000+ protests occur more frequently than I estimate. For it to be lower, I'd need evidence that the Global Protest Tracker has reporting gaps or that current political sentiment makes large mobilizations unlikely. The status quo (no large protest) deserves substantial weight given the short timeframe and current trend data, but I cannot rule out the possibility of a surprise catalytic event in the volatile US political environment.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill the Global Protest Tracker report any protests in the United States with 10,000+ participants, before July 1, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nBrookings Institution: [The power of protest in the US](https://www.brookings.edu/articles/the-power-of-protest-in-the-us/)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if the [Global Protest Tracker](https://carnegieendowment.org/features/global-protest-tracker?lang=en) reports a protest in the United States with 10,000 or more participants with a start date after the launch of this question and before July 1, 2025.\n\n\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nData from the Crowd Counting Consortium from early 2025 showed a notable trend in protest activity.

However, the data also indicated that the average size of these events had decreased to an estimated 60-88 participants per protest.

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
