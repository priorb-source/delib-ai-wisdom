    "review": "Both forecasters emphasize short-horizon inertia, the State Department’s use of localized Level 3s (e.g., Mtwara) instead of nationwide upgrades, and the lack of a recent trigger inside Tanzania—points aligned with my prior view. They also lean on recent regional upgrades (Uganda, Burundi) and the March 2025 embassy alert plus Mozambique border insurgency as reasons for a non-trivial tail. The “regional precedent” argument is directionally helpful but not decisive since State assesses countries individually; still, it marginally increases hazard. I’m less persuaded by the claim that tourism importance creates institutional inertia—State typically prioritizes risk over economics. Net, they add no new hard evidence or clear catalyst I hadn’t considered; their probabilities (15–20%) feel slightly high for a two-month window without a triggering event.",
    "rationale": "Baseline: Tanzania is Level 2 as of May 2, 2025, with localized Level 3 (Mtwara) and a March coastal alert. A nationwide upgrade to Level 3 within ~60 days usually requires a major attack, a surge of incidents targeting foreigners, or pronounced unrest/security force actions—none currently evident inside Tanzania. Spillover risk from Mozambique’s insurgency and active monitoring (embassy alert) keep a meaningful tail, but State often manages such risks with targeted regional cautions rather than a national jump. Recent regional upgrades show willingness to move when justified but do not, by themselves, imply an imminent change for Tanzania. Given the short timeframe and absence of a clear trigger, I maintain a low, non-zero probability. I would move up quickly on: a significant terrorist attack in Tanzania proper (especially coastal/Zanzibar), multiple severe incidents affecting foreigners, or new embassy movement restrictions for staff. I would move down as time passes without incidents or if State reissues a Level 2 update reaffirming the status quo. No change to my forecast.",
