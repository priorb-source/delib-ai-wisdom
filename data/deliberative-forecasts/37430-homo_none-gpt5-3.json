    "review": "Both forecasters largely align with my priors: short runway, need for explicit prioritization, and the risk that an omnibus tax bill slows things down. New/useful nuances they added: (1) the risk that even a late‑June passage slips on presidential assent beyond July 1 (F3), and (2) an upside scenario where the exemption is carved into a smaller, fast‑track finance/VAT amendment (F2). They also emphasize risks of the clause being stripped during harmonization and note alignment with the Fiscal Policy and Tax Reforms Committee recommendations. These are credible and consistent with Nigerian legislative practice. On balance, the assent‑timing risk is a slight negative relative to my prior, while the carve‑out pathway is a slight positive; they offset each other. I don’t see decisive new evidence to move the forecast materially.",
    "rationale": "Less than two months remain for a full bicameral process plus assent. Executive alignment and active signaling increase feasibility, but Nigeria’s pattern is to pass tax packages later in the year, and revenue concerns could motivate watering down or deferral. A carve‑out VAT amendment could move quickly if leadership prioritizes it in May, but I have not seen concrete signs (e.g., completed second readings, committee reports scheduled) that such fast‑tracking is underway. The added consideration that late‑June passage could still miss a July 1 assent deadline slightly lowers odds, counterbalanced by the credible possibility of a narrow fast‑track bill. Net: maintain prior. I would move up on evidence of committee reports filed this month, third reading in either chamber by late May, or credible reports of imminent transmission to the President. I would move down if the measure is bundled into a broader Finance Bill targeting Q4, committee timelines slip, or reporting indicates the exemption clause is being dropped to preserve revenue.",
