    "review": "Forecaster 2 usefully stresses retaliation risk from a sweeping tariff regime and argues it could overpower nominal price growth. That’s a valuable downside scenario I underweighted. However, their case leans heavily on assumptions of immediate, broad, and severe retaliation across major partners without timing detail; historically, policy lags and partial exemptions can dilute near-term impact, and services/long-term contracts cushion exports. A 30% seems too low given nominal tailwinds and lags.\n\nForecaster 3 appropriately highlights timing uncertainty and the potential lag between tariff announcements and realized export impacts. Their framework—balancing inflation/services support versus policy headwinds—is close to my own, and the triggers they cite (Q1 export trend, retaliation evidence, dollar path) are the right ones. I agree with their caution versus my initial take, but I still think their 42% is a bit conservative given services momentum and energy prices likely providing a nominal cushion.\n\nNet: Their arguments nudge me modestly downward due to plausible near-term policy drag and Boeing/strong-dollar risks, but not enough to flip the base case.",
    "rationale": "Status quo baseline: April 2024 exports were ~$262.6B. With typical nominal drift (services recovery, potentially firm energy values), a small YoY increase is plausible. Key opposing forces now emphasized in deliberation are (1) tariff/retaliation risk and uncertainty spillovers that could suppress goods volumes, and (2) a strong dollar and possible weak aircraft deliveries. Supportive forces remain (1) resilient services exports—especially travel and other business services—which tend to be less immediately hit by tariffs, (2) energy-related export values if prices stay firm, and (3) near-term lags in policy transmission and contract stickiness.\n\nI downgrade slightly from 58% to 55% to reflect added weight on retaliation/tariff uncertainty and goods-specific headwinds (notably potential Boeing softness). I do not move further because: (a) immediate, sweeping retaliation broad enough to drive a nominal YoY decline by April is uncertain; (b) services strength likely provides a buffer; and (c) the threshold is modest—only needing a small nominal gain to clear.\n\nUpside risks: solid April travel receipts, firm petroleum exports, benign retaliation timing. Downside risks: earlier-than-assumed and broad retaliation, stronger dollar into April, and weak aircraft/industrial shipments. On balance, a narrow ‘Yes’ remains slightly more likely, but with high uncertainty.",
