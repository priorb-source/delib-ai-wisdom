    "review": "The other forecasters and I are in strong agreement on the fundamental drivers of this question. We all identify the extremely short timeline (less than two months), the Alberta government's current strategy of seeking sovereignty 'within' Canada, and the complete lack of any political or administrative groundwork as overwhelming evidence for a 'No' outcome. Their arguments were not new, but they reinforced my own analysis. The primary difference between our forecasts of 1%, 2%, and 3% is a minor disagreement on the weight to assign to the tail risk of a 'black swan' event—a sudden crisis with Ottawa sparking a reactive, unpredictable announcement from the Premier. Their slightly higher probabilities serve as a useful check on my own forecast, suggesting I might be slightly under-weighting this idiosyncratic political risk.",
    "rationale": "My initial analysis concluded that the probability was extremely low, around 1%, due to the immense structural barriers and the short timeline. After reviewing the other forecasts, I am updating my probability slightly upwards. While my core reasoning remains unchanged, the consensus of the other forecasters at 2% and 3% suggests that my initial 1% may have been too dismissive of the 'unpredictability factor' of the current Premier and the volatile nature of federal-provincial relations. They correctly point out the Premier's track record for bold maneuvers. An unforeseen, acute crisis could theoretically provoke a populist, reactive call for a referendum, however strategically unsound. I am therefore adjusting my forecast from 1% to 2% to better incorporate this small but non-zero tail risk, bringing my forecast closer to the group's consensus without altering my fundamental belief that a 'Yes' resolution is extraordinarily unlikely.",
